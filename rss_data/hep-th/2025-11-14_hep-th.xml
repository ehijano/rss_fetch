      <title>Bounds on Discrete Gauge Symmetries in Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We place bounds on the order of enhanced discrete gauge symmetries that act on massless fields and thus arise at subloci of the moduli space in supergravity theories. We focus on supersymmetric theories with 8 or more supercharges which in some cases lead to sharp upper bounds realized by specific string constructions.</description>

      <title>All-order generalized Green-Schwarz transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compatibility with T-duality severely constrains higher-derivative corrections to the low-energy supergravity limits of string theory. For example, it suggests that Lorentz transformations for heterotic strings are modified in precisely the way required for the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism. A systematic procedure to construct the resulting generalized Green-Schwarz transformations is the generalized Bergshoeff-de Roo identification (gBdRi). Although it in principle allows computing $\alpha'$-corrections to higher and higher orders, technically it becomes unfeasible beyond $\alpha'^2$. We revisit this problem with an alternative approach to the gBdRi, which we have recently developed. It gives rise to a very simple all-order transformation law whose closure we verify by explicitly computing the resulting gauge algebra.</description>

      <title>Bouncing off a stringy singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sharp signature of the black hole singularity in holography is a divergence in the boundary thermal two-point function at a specific point in the complex time plane. This divergence arises from a null geodesic that bounces off the black hole singularity. At finite 't Hooft coupling, stringy corrections to the bulk dynamics cannot be neglected, and the fate of the bouncing geodesic is an open question. We propose a simple scenario in which the singularity in the two-point function is shifted slightly into the complex plane, thereby smoothing it out into a finite-size bump. We demonstrate this smoothing explicitly in a microscopic example, namely the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at infinite temperature, where the correlator is under analytic control. Our result suggests a bulk description of planar theories at finite coupling as stringy black holes.</description>

      <title>Microstate counting from defects in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the microscopic origin of de Sitter entropy using a Lorentzian path-integral approach. We construct a Hilbert space whose states are associated with configurations of thin shells or end-of-the-world branes, with state overlaps defined by the gravitational path integral. By considering states which are indistinguishable to an observer, we find that the variance of microstate overlaps is dominated by Lorentzian wormhole topologies with conical singularities. Evaluating these overlaps, we recover the expected area law for the entropy, relating the dimension of the de Sitter Hilbert space to the area of the cosmological horizon. Extending this analysis to Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, we show that both the cosmological and black hole horizons contribute to the total entropy. Along the way, we present an explicit construction of the shell and brane configurations and examine their compatibility with relevant consistency conditions, including the null energy condition.</description>

      <title>Mutual information as a measure of renormalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renormalization is an essential technique in field-theoretic descriptions of natural phenomena, where the absence of a UV-complete description yields an abundance of divergent quantities. While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincar\'{e} patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum Spectral Curve for $\text{AdS}_3\times \text{S}^3\times \text{S}^3\times \text{S}^1$ strings and the $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\alpha)$ Q-system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we put forward and discuss a proposal for a Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) describing the planar spectrum of the holographic CFT dual to strings on AdS$_3\times$ S$^3\times$ S$^3\times$ S$^1$, a theory with global symmetry $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\alpha)^{\oplus 2}$. We focus mainly on the case when the radii of the two spheres are the same, i.e. $\alpha = 1/2$, where the symmetry reduces to $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)^{\oplus 2}$. In this case, our proposal is based on two copies of an $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)$ Q-system, glued through the branch cuts of the Q-functions in a minimal way. We study in detail the ensuing analytic properties of the Q-functions in this proposal.
  Focusing on purely massive excitations, we consider the large worldsheet limit in which the QSC leads to a set of Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz (ABA) equations, yielding strong constraints on the (so-far unfixed) dressing factors of the worldsheet S-matrix.
  In a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric sector, our proposal is consistent with all previous results on the worldsheet S-matrix. However, in the non-symmetric case, we found a subtle incompatibility between the analytic constraints arising from the proposed QSC, the crossing equations present in the literature, and braiding unitarity.
  We discuss possible explanations for this mismatch: either our minimal QSC proposal does not hold beyond the symmetric sector, or the crossing unitarity equations receive a nontrivial correction that needs to be understood.
  Finally, we also propose a generalisation of the Q-system for the case of $\alpha\neq 1/2$, corresponding to the superalgebra $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\alpha)$. This novel algebraic structure represents a significant step towards understanding the Quantum Spectral Curve of the entire theory.</description>

      <title>Fooling the Censor: Going beyond inner horizons with the OPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytic structure of holographic correlation functions at finite temperature contains information about curvature singularities of black holes in AdS. We compute the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients of the holographic two-point function of scalar operators at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. We show that the stress-tensor and current (T+J) sector of the OPE contains a singularity in the complex time plane at a location that can be identified with the time-shift of a bouncing geodesic in the charged black hole geometry: The geodesic starts at a boundary of a charged black hole in AdS, bounces off the timelike singularity, before returning to a different asymptotic boundary on the same side of the Penrose diagram. We show that the singularity in the T+J sector is smooth across the point where black hole becomes extremal, indicating that the analytic properties of holographic correlators could potentially probe naked singularities.</description>

      <title>Full spectrum of Love numbers of Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in D-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the full spectrum of tidal Love numbers for Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes in general spacetime dimensions. By perturbing the Einstein-Maxwell theory around the $D$-dimensional RN background, we derive an effective two dimensional quadratic action encompassing tensor, vector, and scalar-type perturbation sectors. Through diagonalization, we obtain master equations governing each sector and extract the corresponding Love numbers from the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. Our results confirm that all Love numbers vanish for four-dimensional RN black holes. In higher dimensions, the tensor and vector Love numbers reproduce previously known results. For the previously unknown scalar-type Love numbers, we show also they vanish for integer valued effective multipolar indices and display logarithmic running behavior when the corresponding indices are half integers.</description>

      <title>The Wilson Spool in Flat Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a definition of what has previously been coined a Wilson Spool in the case of three-dimensional gravity with vanishing cosmological constant. The definition builds upon a construction of the one-loop partition function of a massive, spinning field from a fixed background holonomy. While the background is taken to be a flat-space cosmology, the definition of the Wilson spool is expected to hold independently of the underlying geometry. Some comments are given towards possible connections to its two-dimensional incarnations at non-vanishing cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Gluing Quantum Spectral Curves: A Two-Copy osp(4|2) Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Quantum Spectral Curve for planar string theory on AdS3*S3*S3*S1 supported by pure Ramond-Ramond flux. Our proposal is built on symmetry considerations and integrability-based functional relations. To test our construction, we consider the large volume limit and successfully reproduce the cross- ing equations and the correct structure of the Bethe equations found in the literature. In a symmetric subsector, we find agreement with previously known results and furthermore extend the Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz to include massless modes. Beyond this sector, we identify an interesting puzzle regarding the compatibility of crossing equations with braiding unitarity for individual dressing phases, which warrants further investigation and may require additional physical insights or novel structures not previously encountered in related systems. As we expect the QSC to be exact in the planar limit, our proposal may open the way for non-perturbative analysis of this holographic system.</description>

      <title>Heptagon Symbols at Five Loops and All-Loop Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the symbol bootstrap program for the seven-particle MHV and NMHV amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) based on the alphabet associated with the $E_6$ cluster algebra. After imposing integrability, cluster adjacency (or extended Steinmann), first- and last-entry conditions, the solution space is already highly restrictive: e.g. for MHV case there are exactly $1,1,2,3,4$ parity-invariant solutions for $L=1,2,\cdots, 5$, which automatically satisfy dihedral symmetry. Remarkably, after further requiring a well-defined collinear limit, we find a unique solution for both MHV and NMHV sectors where all coefficients (e.g. more than $3.1\times 10^{10}$ for MHV at $L=5$) turn out to be integers. Furthermore, we observe recurrent patterns for coefficients of special words in $E_6$ symbols mirroring those found for the $C_2$ symbol of three-point form factors, which lead to numerous predictions in the form of all-loop sequences. As an initial application, we show that these sequences uniquely fix the MHV symbol through five loops without input from collinear limits. Given the simplicity and surprisingly strong constraining power of both physical constraints and the newly observed sequences, we conjecture that there is a unique symbol satisfying these constraints at any loop order.</description>

      <title>Geometry Induced Chiral Transport and Entanglement in $AdS_2$ Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</description>

      <title>On BRST-Related Symmetries in the FLPR Model with Gribov Ambiguities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a recent revival, novel features of the FLPR model have been reported in the literature. A connection between those features to QCD involving the Gribov problem is explored. We investigate the FLPR model in a recently proposed framework of BRST-related symmetries and perform its full functional quantization as a gauge invariant system taking into account the Gribov ambiguities. We obtain a family of BRST-related transformations generated by the discrete group of symmetries of the action. We show that gauges possessing Gribov ambiguities lead to a violation of the initial discrete group of symmetries of the gauge-fixed action. The obtained results shed light into similar issues in QCD by the corresponding association of variables and fields between the two systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide some additional comments on the long-lived discussions surrounding an effective action and potential plagued by a number of ambiguities. We reinforce the importance of an extra condition on the gauge-fixing function, namely the vanishing of its vacuum expectation value in the absence of external sources, when concluding gauge-independence of the effective action and potential at an extremum. We advocate for the alternative construction of the effective action and potential based on the Vilkovisky-DeWitt approach, and demonstrate its independence from the gauge-fixing parameter. We also exhibit a high-temperature generalisation of this alternative construction in the specific case of the Abelian-Higgs model.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormhole with double trace deformations via gravitational shear and sound channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how non-local gravitational couplings from double-trace deformation between two asymptotic boundaries of an AdS$_5$ black brane can lead to the violation of the Averaged Null Energy Condition (ANEC). The first-order gravitational perturbations backreact with the background metric at second-order, creating a wormhole opening. The wormhole becomes traversable in both the gravitational shear and sound channels within the hydrodynamic approximation. This shows that dynamical metric perturbations can facilitate information transfer in a purely gravitational setting, with the emergence of $G_N$ indicating the gravitational origin. For the shear channel, we consider three different coupling configurations, whereas for the sound channel, we vary both the speed of sound and the attenuation constant, as these parameters control the wormhole traversability. Furthermore, we obtain late-time power-law behavior in the ANEC using fitting function and present a generalization that applies to both shear and sound channels. Due to its propagating nature, the sound channel exhibits late-time power-law remnants at low sound speed similar to the vector diffusive probes, but it prefers an exponential decay at higher sound speed similar to the scalar non-diffusive probes, as the power-law exponent weakened with increasing sound speed. For superluminal sound channels, the wormhole opens for an extremely brief duration at late insertion times, rendering it non-traversable.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a conceptual parallel between the black hole information problem and Zeno's paradox, highlighting the role of limiting procedures that turn formally infinite constructions into finite physical observables. Building on the replica--wormhole paradigm, we move beyond unitarity restoration to formulate a quantitative notion of irreversibility in Hawking radiation. Our main result is a modular thermodynamic framework for black-hole evaporation, in which modular entropy, entanglement capacity, and relative entropy assume thermodynamic roles. The monotonicity of relative entropy furnishes a generalized second law that determines the arrow of evolution in replica space. We further resolve the apparent tension between the replica method and the quantum no-cloning theorem by interpreting replicas as ensemble representations rather than physical copies of an unknown state, thereby clarifying the operational meaning of gravitational path integrals. A key message of this work is that non-additivity in Tsallis statistics provides an information-theoretic analogue of the correlations induced by replica wormholes.</description>

      <title>Lectures on Carrollian Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrollian Holography aims to provide a holographic description of quantum gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, in terms of a novel kind of `carrollian' conformal field theory defined on the spacetime null conformal boundary $\mathscr{I}$.
  The goal of these lectures is to offer a self-contained, pedagogical introduction to this active field of research. The main focus is given to the correspondence between massless scattering amplitudes, including gravitational amplitudes, and correlators in carrollian conformal field theory. Strong emphasis is put on the development of carrollian conformal field theory as an intrinsic, independent, and non-perturbative framework in which to formulate gravitational scattering theory.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of gauged tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that all physically relevant states of gauge theories lie in the sectors of the Hilbert space which satisfy the Gauss law. On the lattice, the manifeslty gauge invariant subspace is known to be exactly spanned by gauged tensor networks. In this work, we demonstrate that the continuum limit of certain types of gauged tensor networks is well defined and leads to a new class of states that may be helpful for the non-perturbative study of gauge theories directly in the continuum.</description>

      <title>Boundary Conditions and Dirac Fields on AdS$_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Dirac fields on AdS$_n$ in both global and Poincar\'e charts and, for each mass window, we classify the boundary conditions at conformal infinity that ensure the existence of advanced and retarded propagators. We distinguish the well-known MIT--bag class from a generalized family, thereby extending to arbitrary dimensions the procedure initiated by Blanco. As in the scalar case, we show that suitable generalized boundary data can support bound states. In four dimensions we work out two explicit examples: (i) the MIT case, for which we construct the advanced/retarded propagators and the two-point function of the associated ground state and (ii) a representative generalized boundary condition, for which we construct the propagators and exhibit a normalizable bound state.</description>

      <title>Scattering Gravitons off General Spinning Compact Objects to $\mathcal{O}(G^2 S^4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the classical one-loop gravitational Compton amplitude describing the scattering of a graviton off a massive spinning compact object at the second post-Minkowskian order, including terms through the quartic order in spin. Our analysis includes spin-induced finite-size effects up to the hexadecapolar order, and extends recent results obtained for minimal couplings at the quadratic order in spin. From the amplitude, we determine the scattering phase in momentum space, applicable in both the eikonal and wave regimes. In the eikonal limit, we then isolate the spin-independent contribution of the graviton field, explicitly linking it to the dynamics of a massless scalar probe in a Kerr background. This constitutes the first complete description of classical one-loop Compton scattering for generic spinning compact objects at the second post-Minkowskian and hexadecapolar orders.</description>

Abstract: From the AdS/CFT dictionary, we derive a bulk dual of the work distribution defined by the two-point measurement on the boundary, yielding a bulk formulation of the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem. We argue that this not only provides a holographic prescription of the work distribution, but is also expected to capture some "mesoscopic" aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic supercriticality and complex phase diagram for charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lee-Yang zero theory plays a crucial role in phase transition theory and is widely employed in the critical behavior of statistical thermodynamics. The supercritical regime of black hole thermodynamics remains a relatively unexplored area, and recent applications of this theory to charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes have initiated probes into this regime, revealing a simple structure partitioned by a single Widom line. In this paper, we apply Lee-Yang theory to charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes, which feature complex phase diagrams (e.g., triple points), to determine how such structures are reflected in the supercritical regime. Notably, we observe a key dimensional difference in that the five-dimensional (5d) system, which lacks a triple point, confirms the known single Widom line structure, while the six-dimensional (6d) system, which admits a triple point, generates two distinct Widom lines. These lines partition the supercritical domain into three sectors (small-, intermediate-, and large- black hole-like phases), corresponding to the three phases coexisting at the triple point. Our results reveal a direct correspondence between the number of coexisting phases at a triple point and the number of distinct supercritical sectors separated by Widom lines.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Black Holes from Mass Generation in Matrix Compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism for generating mass terms in the IKKT and BFSS matrix theories through compactification on a torus and the derivation of a zero-mode effective theory, emphasising the crucial role of fermionic boundary conditions. Extending a recent proposal developed for the IKKT model to the BFSS framework, we explore a broader class of mixed fermionic boundary conditions in both theories. This choice leads to a distinct effective theory with intermediate features, where a mass term is generated together with fermionic zero modes. In the BFSS case, this setup further allows for the construction of black hole solutions. The resulting geometry takes the form of a fuzzy sphere, with quantum excitations in the fermionic sector accounting for the corresponding black hole entropy.</description>

      <title>Symmetries, operators and correlators in $J\bar{T}$ deformed CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct symmetry generators and operators for $J\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories by generalizing the framework established for $T\bar{T}$ deformations. Working in the Hamiltonian formalism on the plane, we derive the symmetry algebra of the deformed theory, which consists of a local Virasoro-Kac-Moody algebra in the left-moving sector and a non-local counterpart in the right-moving sector. This algebraic structure guides the definition of two operator classes: dressed operators, which transform as primaries under the deformed symmetries, and local physical operators. While dressed operators are local only in the left null direction, physical operators maintain locality in both directions and are constructed from dressed operators and currents. This formulation allows the powerful constraints of conformal symmetry to be leveraged for computing physical observables. Consequently, we employ conformal perturbation theory to compute the two-point and $N$-point functions of physical operators. In momentum space, we sum the most UV-sensitive contributions to all orders; the results show precise agreement with string theory predictions. Furthermore, a non-perturbative analysis of the position-space correlator reveals an instanton contribution, providing a complete characterization of the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Crossing Symmetry and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between crossing symmetry and entanglement in $2 \to 2$ scattering within local quantum field theories that possess an $SU(N)$ global symmetry. In particular, we recast scattering amplitudes of fixed helicity as quantum operations on the Hilbert space of internal quantum numbers, where the external states play the role of qudits. The entire space of $SU(N)$-invariant scattering operators between qudits is spanned by a minimal set of three quantum gates. Recoupling relations among quantum gates are shown to follow directly from the crossing properties of the underlying amplitudes and reveal that entanglement generated from separable states in one channel is necessarily intertwined with another. Consequently, we argue any interacting quantum field theory that realizes an $SU(N)$ global symmetry must generate entanglement in at least one scattering channel.</description>

      <title>Classifying Fibers and Bases in Toric Hypersurface Calabi-Yau Threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a complete analysis of the toric elliptic and genus-one fibrations of all 474 million reflexive polytopes in the Kreuzer-Skarke database. Earlier work with Huang showed that all but 29,223 of these polytopes have such a fibration. We identify 2,264,992,252 distinct fibrations, and determine the fiber and base structure in each case; after accounting for automorphisms of the ambient polytope, these fibrations furnish 2,250,744,657 equivalence classes. We summarize generic features and identify exotic special cases among these fibrations. These fibrations illustrate many features that have been explored in the context of 6D F-theory, including gauge groups hosted on non-toric divisors, automatic enhancement of gauge groups, and implicit non-toric bases and high-rank 6D SCFTs associated with nonflat fibers, as well as novel geometric features such as singular bases for genus-one fibrations with multisections. This analysis illustrates the power of elliptic and genus-one fibrations, and the geometro-physical language of F-theory as a tool for understanding the structure of Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <title>The Unitary Architecture of Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set up a bootstrap problem for renormalization. Working in the massless four-dimensional O$(N)$ model and the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, we prove that unitarity leads to all-loop recursion relations between coefficients of scattering amplitudes with different multiplicities. These turn out to be equivalent to the identities imposed by renormalization of the coupling and the wavefunction through subleading logarithmic order, except with different initial conditions. Matching the initial conditions thus fixes the beta function and wavefunction anomalous dimension to these orders. We explain how to connect this new on-shell renormalization picture with the standard renormalized perturbation theory, highlighting a rich interplay between finiteness, dimensional regularization, and unitarity cuts.</description>

      <title>Eigenfunctions of deformed Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral problems associated with the finite-difference operators $H_N = 2 \cosh(p) + V_N(x)$, where $V_N(x)$ is an arbitrary polynomial potential of degree $N$. These systems can be regarded as a solvable deformation of the standard Schr\"odinger operators $p^2 + V_N(x)$, and they arise naturally from the quantization of the Seiberg-Witten curve of four-dimensional, $\mathcal{N} = 2$, SU($N$) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Using the open topological string/spectral theory correspondence, we construct exact, analytic eigenfunctions of $H_N$, valid for arbitrary polynomial potentials and describing both bound and resonant states. Our solutions are entire in $x$ for generic values of the energy, and become $L^2$-normalizable only at a discrete set of energies. An interesting feature of these Hamiltonians is the existence of special loci in the parameter space of the potential, the so-called Toda points. The eigenfunctions exhibit enhanced decay at these points, leading to spectral degeneracies for confining potentials and to a real energy spectrum for unbounded ones. Our results provide a rare example of a quantum-mechanical spectral problem that is exactly solvable, admitting explicit, analytic eigenfunctions for both bound and resonant states.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Simplicity and Scattering in General Relativity from Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fate of asymptotic simplicity in physically relevant settings of compact-object scattering. Using the stress tensor of a two-body system as a source, we compute the spacetime metric in General Relativity at finite observer distance in an asymptotic expansion. To do so, we relate the metric to the final-state graviton one-point function in momentum space, which is computed using perturbative QFT techniques. Both the simple pole and the infrared-related logarithmic branch cut in the virtuality of the external graviton contribute nontrivially. We focus on determining the fall-off behavior of the Newman-Penrose scalars, confirming previous predictions that Sachs's peeling property is violated at leading order in the post-Minkowski expansion. Our analysis at higher orders in the post-Minkowskian expansion reveals a significantly stronger breakdown of the peeling property than previously recognized, which is the result of nonlinear, long-range interactions between localized sources and the surrounding gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Evading the BBN bound with a soft stiff period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation is the leading theory to explain early Universe history and structure formation. Non-oscillatory inflation is a class of models which can naturally introduce a post-inflationary stiff period of the Universe's evolution which boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs), making it possible to observe them in forthcoming GW experiments. However, this pushes the GW energy density high enough to destabilise the process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This problem can be overcome by "softening" the stiff period, so that the field is gradually tending towards freefall from a frozen start. Here, we consider a modified hybrid inflation model where the stiff period is driven by the waterfall field, allowing the barotropic parameter of the Universe to vary, so that it does not violate the BBN constraint but produces a characteristic gravitational wave spectrum soon to be observable.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit black hole perturbations through Heun differential equations, focusing on Frobenius power-series solutions near regular singularities and their connection formulas. Central to our approach is the notion of a cline in the complex plane, which organizes singular points of the differential equations and remain invariant under M\"obius transformations. Building on the cline structure we identified in black hole horizons, we carry out a systematic reduction and relocation of poles in the differential equation to obtain explicit representations of the solutions. We illustrate our approach by extracting the scalar perturbation solutions for the 7-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole and deriving the static scalar tidal Love numbers. These results suggest that clines expose a M\"obius-invariant order within black hole perturbations, rendering black hole perturbation problems remarkably tractable.</description>

      <title>Extreme Sensitivity of Standard Model Vacuum Stability to Enhanced Scalar Couplings: Implications from Renormalization Group Equations and Radiatively Broken Electroweak Symmetry Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Standard Model vacuum stability exhibits extreme sensitivity to the Higgs quartic coupling: a mere 3\% enhancement represents the critical threshold separating metastability from absolute stability with UV Landau poles. Using three-loop renormalization group equations, we systematically investigate enhancement factors $k = \lambda_{\rm enhanced}/\lambda_{\rm SM}$ ranging from $k=1.0$ (Standard Model) to $k=7.2$ (radiative electroweak symmetry breaking prediction). We identify $k_{\rm crit} = 1.03$ as the marginal case where the coupling transitions from negative to positive evolution at high energies. For $k &gt; 1.03$, the theory exhibits absolute vacuum stability and develops UV poles at $\Lambda_{\rm UV} \sim 10^{16}$--$10^{18}$ GeV, signaling effective field theory breakdown and the onset of strong dynamics. The radiative symmetry breaking scenario with $k \approx 7.2$ falls deep in this regime, naturally connecting the electroweak scale to compositeness or other strong-coupling physics near the GUT scale. Our results reveal that the 125 GeV Higgs mass, lying near the metastability boundary, makes the scalar sector an exceptionally sensitive probe of beyond-Standard-Model physics.</description>

      <title>Cooling the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using thermofield double states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a simple and efficient experimental protocol to cool the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to low temperatures. The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly.</description>

      <title>A new regularization scheme for the wave function of the Universe in the Lorentzian path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorentzian path integral for the wave function of the Universe is only conditionally convergent and thus requires a well-defined prescription. The Picard-Lefschetz approach ensures convergence through contour deformation, but it has been argued that this leads to unsuppressed perturbations due to relevant saddle points residing in the region ${\rm Im}N&gt;0$. As an alternative, we propose a simple regulator for the lapse integral in minisuperspace. Specifically, we impose the vanishing initial size of the Universe via a delta function, represented as a narrow Gaussian of width $\sigma$, and take the limit $\sigma \to 0$ only after performing the functional integrations. This regulator has a clear physical interpretation: it corresponds to a vanishingly small quantum uncertainty in the initial size of the Universe. For any fixed $\sigma &gt; 0$, the lapse integral is absolutely convergent along (or slightly below) the real axis, and no excursion into the region ${\rm Im}N&gt;0$ is required. We further argue that the initial wave function for scalar and tensor perturbations should be incorporated in the Lorentzian path integral formalism, and we show that these perturbations are then appropriately suppressed. A purely Lorentzian path integral thus yields the tunneling wave function with suppressed perturbations. We also demonstrate that the Hartle-Hawking wave function can be reproduced by choosing a contour for the lapse integral extending from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ that passes below the singularity near the origin.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Yang-Mills, and the Scattering Matrix as an SU(N)-equivariant Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-body scattering as an SU(N)-equivariant map acting on tensor-product representation spaces and analyze the entanglement generated by the $S$-matrix. This representation-theoretic perspective separates group structure from dynamics: the decomposition of $R\!\otimes\!R'$ fixes the invariant operator algebra and therefore the qualitative entangling power of the process. For particles in the fundamental representation, $\mathrm{End}_{\mathrm{SU}(N)}(N\!\otimes\!N)=\mathrm{Span}\{\mathbb{I},\mathbb{S}\}$, so only the identity and swap directions preserve separability, whereas generic combinations generate entanglement. Adjoint-adjoint scattering involves a larger invariant algebra involving $d$-tensors and is intrinsically entangling. In Yang-Mills theory one can use color-kinematics duality to show that the color kernel lies on a fixed ray of this operator space, yielding a universal maximum of the outgoing entanglement for scattering at right angles, $E_\star^{(2)}=\tfrac{3}{4}$ for $SU(2)$ and $E_\star^{(3)}\simeq0.91$, independent of kinematics. Dimension-six operators preserve this universality, while dimension-eight deformations populate new color sectors and shift $E_\star^{(N)}$, suggesting that entanglement in color space functions as a tomographic probe of effective operators. In helicity space, requiring maximally entangled inputs to scatter into maximally entangled outputs uniquely selects the Yang-Mills quartic coupling and enforces the color Jacobi identity, restating the on-shell Ward constraints as conditions on entanglement preservation. Our results suggest that the information-theoretic viewpoint unifies algebraic, geometric, and dynamical aspects of scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of multiple light axions in the infrared is a generic feature of many ultraviolet (UV) scenarios. In many cases the number of axions ${\cal N}$ is ${\cal O}(10-100)$ or more. Even in the scenario where these axions interact very weakly with the Standard Model (SM), the presence of ${\cal N}$ light axions poses a challenge to the stringent constraint on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$. In order to remain agnostic about the UV, we adopt an effective field theory (EFT) approach, and parametrize the interactions of ${\cal N}$ axions with the SM to quantify the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$. We consider operators up to dimension six, uncovering one previously-unconsidered charge radius operator, and pay particular attention to the flavor structure of the axion-SM fermion couplings and consider EFTs based on anarchy, textures, and minimal flavor violation. For various choices of such EFTs, we identify the discovery space for current and future cosmic microwave background surveys, including the Simons Observatory and CMB-HD. We show this discovery space depends sensitively on the flavor structure and exhibits a rich interplay with terrestrial and astrophysical probes.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Probes of Quantum Geometry in Gapless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of our understanding of gapless many-body quantum systems stems from their low-energy descriptions as conformal field theories. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models.</description>

      <title>Ladder Symmetry: The Necessary and Sufficient Condition for Vanishing Love Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes in four-dimensional, asymptotically flat general relativity have vanishing static tidal Love numbers (TLNs), a property tied to a hidden symmetry of the perturbation equations. Within the Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) parametrization, a subclass of spacetimes was previously shown to admit such Ladder symmetry, which enforces the absence of static scalar TLNs. In this work, we introduce parametric deformations to such Ladder-symmetric spacetimes and analyze the resultant linear tidal response. Using the parametrized formalism for TLNs, we show that any deviation from a Ladder-symmetric background leads to non-zero static scalar TLNs. This establishes Ladder symmetry as a necessary, as well as sufficient condition, for the vanishing of static TLNs in static, spherically symmetric black holes and in rotating black holes of the KRZ class.</description>

      <title>Two-Mode Janus States: non-Gaussian generalizations of thermofield double</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Two-Mode Janus State (TMJS), a non-Gaussian quantum state defined as a coherent superposition of two distinct Two-Mode Squeezed States (TMSS). This construction serves as a direct, non-Gaussian generalization of the canonical thermofield double (TFD) state, which is itself a single, Gaussian TMSS. We develop a complete analytical framework for the TMJS's arbitrary $k$-th order photon statistics, identifying a new family of "squeezing polynomials" that govern all diagonal and off-diagonal moments. Our central result is that the state's non-Gaussianity is dynamically steerable via an external "Janus phase." This phase acts as a switch, allowing the higher-order coherences ($g^{(k)}$) to be tuned from perfectly thermal (matching the TFD marginal) to deeply sub-Poissonian, a regime marked by strong Wigner negativity. We further establish a physical realization for the TMJS, proposing its generation via coherently superposed Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) trajectories, distinguishing it from the static, observer-dependent Unruh effect. The TMJS provides a versatile, interference-enhanced platform for engineering Unruh-DeWitt detector responses and probing non-Gaussian physics in relativistic settings.</description>

      <title>Theory and algorithms for clusters of cycles in graphs for material networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysis of complex networks, particularly material networks such as the carbon skeleton of hydrocarbons generated in hydrocarbon pyrolysis in carbon-rich systems, is essential for effectively describing, modeling, and predicting their features. An important and the most challenging part of this analysis is the extraction and effective description of cycles, when many of them coalesce into complex clusters. A deterministic minimum cycle basis (MCB) is generally non-unique and biased to the vertex enumeration. The union of all MCBs, called the set of relevant cycles, is unique, but may grow exponentially with the graph size. To resolve these issues, we propose a method to sample an MCB uniformly at random. The output MCB is statistically well-defined, and its size is proportional to the number of edges. We review and advance the theory of graph cycles from previous works of Vismara, Gleiss et al., and Kolodzik et al. In particular, we utilize the polyhedron-interchangeability (pi) and short loop-interchangeability (sli) classes to partition the relevant cycles. We introduce a postprocessing step forcing pairwise intersections of relevant cycles to consist of a single path. This permits the definition of a dual graph whose nodes are cycles and edges connect pairs of intersecting cycles. The pi classes identify building blocks for crystalline structures. The sli classes group together sets of large redundant cycles. We present the application to an amorphous hydrocarbon network, where we (i) theorize how the number of relevant cycles may explode with system size and (ii) observe small polyhedral structures related to diamond.</description>

      <title>Veiled Singularities in Einstein-Weyl Gravity: Stability and Physical Interpretation of Horizonless Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of horizonless solutions in Einstein-Weyl gravity, corresponding to the so-called attractive naked singularities of the (-2,2) type. In contrast to General Relativity, where naked singularities are generically unstable and excluded by the cosmic censorship conjecture, we show that these configurations are linearly stable under tensor perturbations. By numerically evolving the perturbation equations in the time domain, we find that all modes decay with characteristic oscillatory tails, a behavior consistent with the dynamics of massive field perturbations in quadratic gravity. This establishes that attractive naked singularities in Einstein-Weyl gravity are dynamically stable and can persist as stationary configurations. We argue that these horizonless configurations are observationally concealed, and therefore we refer to them as veiled singularities. Their stability and phenomenological similarity to black holes suggest that they may represent viable horizonless alternatives in higher-derivative theories of gravity, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between singularity resolution, stability, and effective field dynamics beyond Einstein's theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic nature of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a clean method for comparing different approaches for modeling the two-body problem in general relativity. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code, to explore the self-force and post-Minkowskian expansions of the scattering angle. First, we use a set of unequal-mass simulations to extract the self-force contributions to the scattering angle. Our main result is that using information up to second-order in the symmetric mass ratio (2SF) reproduces numerical relativity within the error bars across the full range of mass-ratios, including equal mass. Next, we compare our numerical relativity results to state-of-the-art post-Minkowskian predictions at larger impact parameters than previously explored. We find good agreement in the weak-field regime and discuss the relative importance of higher-order terms.</description>

      <title>Probing thermal leptogenesis and dark matter through primordial gravitational waves from a supercooled universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the cosmological dynamics of a supercooled first-order phase transition in the classically conformal $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model, where radiative symmetry breaking simultaneously generates the right-handed neutrino (RHN) masses, and a strong stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. The slow decay of the scalar field into RHNs can induce an early matter-dominated (EMD) era whose duration is sensitive to the RHN mass and gauge coupling $g^\prime$. This non-standard cosmological phase reshapes the GW spectrum and leaves a distinctive RHN-mass-dependent spectral distortion that correlates with the flavour regime of thermal leptogenesis. Within this framework, one RHN can serve as a dark matter candidate produced nonthermally from scalar decays, while the remaining states generate the baryon asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis. For $g^\prime=0.5$, we identify such a parameter region, and show that with singlet extensions, even with a smaller gauge coupling, one can realise this mechanism for the three-flavour regime. The resulting GW signals, amplified by supercooling and modified by EMD, provide a unique window to probe the scale and flavour structure of leptogenesis in future high-frequency GW observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bound states of a massive scalar field around a topological star, and show that these are strictly normal modes. This yields a genuine gravitational atom, sharply distinguishing horizonless objects from black holes. It is shown that the modes are controlled by the field's Compton wavelength compared to the size of the star. When the Compton wavelength is large, the field forms a cloud with a hydrogen-like spectrum, while in the opposite regime it localizes along timelike trajectories. When the two scales are comparable the spectrum becomes richer, and we characterize it in detail allowing the field to carry electric charge and Kaluza--Klein momentum.</description>

Abstract: This document serves as a conceptual and practical introduction to Strong-Field Quantum Electrodynamics (SFQED), written from the standpoint of experimental physicists. It was developed in the context of the "Strong-Field QED Workshop 2024" at DESY, aimed at supporting early-career researchers entering the field from the experimental side. Rather than providing a comprehensive theoretical review, the document focuses on the core ideas, terminology, and challenges in SFQED that are most relevant to experimental design and interpretation. Our goal is to offer a first point of contact with the subject, bridging the gap between foundational theory and hands-on experimental work, and complementing more formal literature in the field.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Structure of Nonlocal Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal interactions are known to generate volume-law entanglement entropy. However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \(A\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.</description>

      <title>Straight and Wiggly Cosmic Strings in Horndeski Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, the behavior of a straight cosmic string is studied for the linearized version of Horndeski theory in cases where the scalar field is massless or massive. Several physical properties of such solutions are discussed in detail regarding the effects of the scalar field of this theory. The mass of the scalar field induces a screening effect such that, in the massive theory, the string solution approaches to the general relativistic one. We also consider wiggly cosmic strings, obtain the solutions for both massless and massive cases, discuss their properties and observe similar screening effects.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter from Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have examined the holographic principle as a means of producing dark energy. Here we propose instead the possibility of holographic dark matter. In this case, dark matter does not arise in the framework of particle physics but is derived from the infrared cutoff set by the horizon scale. Using the Ricci cutoff, and a universe containing only baryons and radiation, we can account for the dark matter and naturally explain the coincidence between baryonic and nonbaryonic contributions to the density. In the presence of a pre-existing vacuum energy density our model reverses the sign of this density, thus accounting for the fact that certain string theories generically predict a negative vacuum energy, but observations require a positive value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build upon previous analytical treatments of scalar perturbations in curved inflationary universes to obtain analytical templates for the primordial tensor power spectrum in models with non-zero primordial spatial curvature. These templates are derived without assuming a particular inflaton potential, thereby isolating the universal imprints of curvature on tensor modes. Our results predict characteristic large-scale features -- including low-$\ell$ cut-offs and oscillatory patterns -- that are consistent with numerical solutions and provide a clear physical interpretation of how curvature modifies the underlying dynamics. In particular, we show that curvature effects manifest mathematically as systematic shifts in the dynamically relevant wavevectors, mirroring the behaviour previously identified in the scalar power spectrum. These features translate into distinctive signatures in the large-angle $B$-mode polarisation spectrum, offering a potential discriminant for spatial curvature in forthcoming CMB observations.</description>

Abstract: By studying the Raychaudhuri equation for the gravitational force resulting from a string T-duality modified propagator, we present an analysis of the geodesic compression beyond the conventional classical limit. The result is that gravity on short length scales is subject to a screening effect similar to the Debye screening in electrostatics, which prevents the formation of curvature singularities. Using model-independent arguments, we conclude that the conventional attractive nature of gravity is only a low-energy effect.</description>

      <title>Loops in inflation with strongly non-geodesic motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study loop corrections in the effective field theory of inflation with imaginary speed of sound, which has been shown to provide an effective description of multi-field inflationary models characterized by strongly non-geodesic motion and heavy entropic perturbations. We focus on the one-loop corrections to the scalar and tensor power spectra, taking into account all relevant vertices at leading order in derivatives and in slow-roll. We find a power-law dependence of the scalar two-point function on the scale that defines the range of validity of the effective theory, analogous to the enhancement observed in tree-level correlation functions. Even more dramatic, the relative correction to the tensor spectrum is exponentially enhanced, albeit also suppressed in the slow-roll limit. In spite of these large effects, our results show that this class of models can satisfy the requirement of perturbative control and a consistent loop expansion within a range of parameters of phenomenological interest. On the other hand, models predicting large values of the power spectrum on small scales are found to be under strong tension. As a technical bonus, we carefully explain the prescription for the regularization and manipulation of loop integrals in this set-up, where one has a non-trivial domain of integration for time and momentum integrals owing to the regime of validity of the effective field theory. This procedure is general enough to be of potential applicability in other contexts.</description>

      <title>The landscape of complexity measures in 2D gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the broad landscape of holographic complexity measures for theories dual to two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity. Previous studies have largely focused on the complexity=volume and complexity=action proposals for holographic complexity. Here we systematically construct and analyze a wide class of generalized complexity functionals, focusing on codimension-one bulk observables. Two complementary approaches are presented: one inspired by dimensional reduction of codimension-one observables from higher-dimensional gravity, and another that adopts a purely 2D perspective. We verify the resulting observables exhibit hallmark features of complexity, such as linear growth at late times and the switchback effect. We further offer heuristic interpretations of the role of multiple extremal surfaces when they appear. Finally, we comment on the bulk-to-boundary dictionary via the covariant Peierls bracket in 2D gravity. Our work lays the groundwork for a richer understanding of quantum complexity in low-dimensional holographic dualities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine, regular, and star triangulations (FRSTs) of four-dimensional reflexive polytopes give rise to toric varieties, within which generic anticanonical hypersurfaces yield smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds. We introduce CYTransformer, a deep learning model based on the transformer architecture, to automate the generation of FRSTs. We demonstrate that CYTransformer efficiently and unbiasedly samples FRSTs for polytopes across a range of sizes, and can self-improve through retraining on its own output. These results lay the foundation for AICY: a community-driven platform designed to combine self-improving machine learning models with a continuously expanding database to explore and catalog the Calabi-Yau landscape.</description>

Abstract: We construct AdS$_5 \times \Sigma$ solutions of $D=7$ gauged supergravity where $\Sigma$ is a disc, also known as a half-spindle, and uplift them to $D=11$ supergravity. By computing the anomaly polynomial of the M5-brane theory compactified on $\Sigma$ in the large $N$ limit, we obtain the off-shell central charges of the dual $D=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theory to disc solutions. These off-shell central charges decompose into contributions from the center and the boundary of the disc and are referred to as the gravitational blocks for disc. By suitably gluing the gravitational blocks for two discs along their boundaries, we reproduce the off-shell central charge for a single spindle.</description>

      <title>Critical Non-Abelian Vortex String and 2D N=2 Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12972v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that the non-Abelian vortex string in 4D $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD with the U(2) gauge group and $N_f=4$ flavors becomes a critical superstring. Its 10D target space is a product of the flat 4D space and an internal noncompact Calabi-Yau threefold, namely, the conifold. It was also shown that the Coulomb branch of the associated string sigma model, which opens up at strong coupling, can be described by $\mathcal{N}=2$ Liouville theory. We continue here the study of the recently proposed mass deformation of the U(2) theory with $N_f=4$, interpolating to SQCD with the U(4) gauge group and $N_f=8$ quarks, by analyzing the mass-deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ Liouville theory on the string world sheet, and show that it is always described by the trumpet geometry of the target space, which is $T$-dual to the 2D $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric black hole. We use this correspondence to find the low-lying hadron spectrum in the deformed SQCD, and explain the expected increase in the number of hadronic states in the theory with more gauge fields and quarks by considering the near-Hagedorn behavior of the 2D black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the large $N$ limit of spectral duality between rational Gaudin models introduced by Adams, Harnad and Hurtubise. The limit of the ${\rm gl}_N$ model is performed by means of a noncommutative torus algebra represented by the fields on a torus with the Moyal-Weyl star product. We apply the approach developed by Hoppe, Olshanetsky and Theisen to the Gaudin-type models and describe the corresponding integrable field theory (2d hydrodynamics) on a torus. The dual model is the large $N$ limit of the ${\rm gl}_M$ Gaudin model with $N$ marked points written in the form of the Gaudin model with irregular singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the Casimir energy for the configuration of two parallel plates coupled to nonabelian gauge fields with a Yang-Mills action. We consider both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions in the manifestly gauge-invariant formalism we have pursued over the last several years which allows us to factor out the gauge degrees of freedom. A boundary action in the functional integral, equivalent to the insertion of operators representing the plates, is used to enforce the required boundary conditions for the gauge fields. The result is for a kinematic regime corresponding to the exchange of gluons with a dynamically generated mass. We find good agreement in 2+1 dimensions and reasonable agreement in 3+1 dimensions with lattice-based numerical evaluations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of 't Hooft anomalies, backgrounds for the symmetries of a quantum field theory can lead to non-conservation of Noether currents, or more generally, to the presence of charged insertions in the path integral. When there is a net background charge, the partition function evaluated on closed manifolds will vanish. For anomalous symmetries, this statement can also be understood as the anomaly theory giving rise to a non-trivial anomalous phase for the partition function even for "rigid" transformations which leave all background fields unchanged. We use the generalisation of this second viewpoint to the setting of anomalous higher-form symmetries in order to show vanishing of the partition function for a number of examples, both with and without a Lagrangian description. In particular, we show how to derive from these considerations the analogue of the Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation condition for the M5-brane, and also that for the D3-brane in S-fold backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: We compute thermal holographic correlators by combining their analytic structure with the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition and multi-stress tensor OPE coefficients determined from the dual AdS description. We focus on two-point functions of identical scalar operators with integer conformal dimensions at zero spatial separation. In the black brane background, we show explicitly that holographic two-point functions split into three contributions: a principal one, computed exactly, plus regularized and arcs contributions, both approximated through the use of OPE coefficients asymptotics. For $\Delta_\phi=3$, we show that the principal contribution agree with good approximation with the numerical solution of the bulk wave equation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expansion in generalized free field correlators proposed in [Barrat,6/2025] admits a natural interpretation in terms of Witten diagrams. Finally, we initiate the study of thermal correlators in the spherically symmetric black hole background, computing their principal contributions.</description>

Abstract: In a recent work, Herderschee and Wall (HW) proved a bound on scalar field excursions in spatially flat FRW cosmologies. In this note, we give an alternate proof of their bound using the Friedmann equations, and we prove that it can be saturated only in universes with vanishing acceleration, $\ddot a =0$. We argue that in a realistic (eternal) inflation scenario, the bound is robust against quantum corrections and spacetime curvature, and it can be violated by higher-derivative corrections only at the expense of a superluminal speed of sound. We further speculate on possible connections between the swampland program and the vacuum estimates given in the work of HW.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As is well known, the chiral Gross-Neveu model at finite density can be solved semi-classically with the help of the chiral spiral mean field. The fermion spectrum has a single gap right at the Fermi energy, a reflection of the Peierls instability. Here, we divide the N fermion flavors up into two subsets to which we attribute two different densities. The Hartree-Fock ground state of such a system can again be found analytically, using as mean field the ``twisted kink crystal" of Basar and Dunne. Its spectrum displays two gaps with lower edges coinciding with the two Fermi energies. This solution is favored over the homogeneous one, providing us with an explicit example of a multiple Peierls instability.</description>

Abstract: The ever-increasing number of detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binaries by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors allows us to perform ever-more sensitive tests of general relativity (GR) in the dynamical and strong-field regime of gravity. We perform a suite of tests of GR using the compact binary signals observed during the second half of the third observing run of those detectors. We restrict our analysis to the 15 confident signals that have false alarm rates $\leq 10^{-3}\, {\rm yr}^{-1}$. In addition to signals consistent with binary black hole (BH) mergers, the new events include GW200115_042309, a signal consistent with a neutron star--BH merger. We find the residual power, after subtracting the best fit waveform from the data for each event, to be consistent with the detector noise. Additionally, we find all the post-Newtonian deformation coefficients to be consistent with the predictions from GR, with an improvement by a factor of ~2 in the -1PN parameter. We also find that the spin-induced quadrupole moments of the binary BH constituents are consistent with those of Kerr BHs in GR. We find no evidence for dispersion of GWs, non-GR modes of polarization, or post-merger echoes in the events that were analyzed. We update the bound on the mass of the graviton, at 90% credibility, to $m_g \leq 1.27 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}/c^2$. The final mass and final spin as inferred from the pre-merger and post-merger parts of the waveform are consistent with each other. The studies of the properties of the remnant BHs, including deviations of the quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times, show consistency with the predictions of GR. In addition to considering signals individually, we also combine results from the catalog of GW signals to calculate more precise population constraints. We find no evidence in support of physics beyond GR.</description>

      <title>Canonicalizing zeta generators: genus zero and genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zeta generators are derivations associated with odd Riemann zeta values that act freely on the Lie algebra of the fundamental group of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.</description>

      <title>Building blocks for $W$-algebras of classical types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra $W_{\infty}$ of type $W(2,3,4,\dots)$ serves as a classifying object for vertex algebras of type $W(2,3,\dots,N)$ for some $N$ in the sense that under mild hypothesis, all such vertex algebras arise as quotients of $W_{\infty}$. There is an $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ family of such $1$-parameter vertex algebras which, after tensoring with a Heisenberg algebra, are known as $Y$-algebras. They were introduced by Gaiotto and Rap\v{c}\'ak and are expected to be the building blocks for all $W$-algebras in type $A$, i.e., every $W$-(super) algebra in type $A$ is an extension of a tensor product of finitely many $Y$-algebras. Similarly, the orthosymplectic $Y$-algebras are $1$-parameter quotients of a universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra $W^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$ of type $W(2,4,6,\dots)$, which is a classifying object for vertex algebras of type $W(2,4,\dots, 2N)$ for some $N$. Unlike type $A$, these algebras are not all the building blocks for $W$-algebras of types $B$, $C$, and $D$. In this paper, we construct a new universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra of type $W(1^3, 2, 3^3, 4, 5^3,6,\dots)$ which we denote by $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ since it contains a copy of the affine vertex algebra $V^k(\mathfrak{sp}_2)$. We identify $8$ infinite families of $1$-parameter quotients of $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ which are analogues of the $Y$-algebras. We regard $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ as a fundamental object on equal footing with $W_{\infty}$ and $W^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$, and we give some heuristic reasons for why we expect the $1$-parameter quotients of these three objects to be the building blocks for all $W$-algebras of classical types. Finally, we prove that $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ has many quotients which are strongly rational. This yields new examples of strongly rational $W$-superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function localization induced by nonHermitian colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantum field theory based on random nonHermitian actions, which upon quantization lead to stochastic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics for the state vector. In this framework, Lorentz and spacetime translation symmetries are preserved only in a statistical sense: the probability distribution of the action remains invariant under these transformations. As a result, the theory describes ensembles of quantum-state trajectories whose probability distributions remain invariant under changes of reference frame. As a concrete example, we augment the Dirac action with a purely imaginary term coupling the fermion density operator to a universal colored noise. This noise is constructed by solving the d'Alembert equation with white noise as its source, using a generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3 dimensions. We demonstrate that the colored noise drives stochastic localization of wave packets and derive the localization length analytically. Remarkably, the localization length decreases as the size of the observable universe increases. Our model thus provides a potential framework for relativistic spontaneous wave-function collapse. While establishing consistency with Born's law remains an open challenge, the present work constitutes a step toward embedding collapse models into a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative effective field theory of the lowest Landau level superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A 2+1D superfluid in a rapidly rotating trap forms an array of vortices, with collective excitations called Tkachenko modes. Du et al. (2024) argued from an effective field theory viewpoint that these excitations are described by a field theory living on a non-commutative space. We elucidate the microscopic origin of these non-commutative fields, and present a novel derivation of the effective field theory for this superfluid using a lowest Landau level projected coherent state path integral approach. Besides conceptual clarity, this approach makes quantitative predictions about the long-wavelength, low-energy behavior in terms of the microscopic parameters of the short-range interacting lowest Landau level superfluid -- relevant to trapped Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature bubble nucleation with shifting scale hierarchies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Focusing on supercooled phase transitions in models with classical scale symmetry, we formulate a state-of-the art framework for computing the bubble-nucleation rate, accounting for the presence of various energy scales. In particular, we examine the limitations of derivative expansions in constructing a thermal effective field theory for bubble nucleation. We show that for gauge field fluctuations, derivative expansions diverge after the leading two orders due to the strong variation in gauge field masses between the high- and low-temperature phases. By directly computing these contributions using the fluctuation determinant, we capture these effects while also accounting for large explicit logarithms at two loops, utilising the exact renormalisation group structure of the EFT. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach significantly improves nucleation rate calculations compared to leading-order results, providing a more robust framework for predicting gravitational-wave signals from supercooled phase transitions in models such as the SU(2)cSM.</description>

      <title>Effects of bumblebee gravity on neutrino motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores how the spontaneous violation of Lorentz symmetry -- modeled through a black hole solution in the context of bumblebee gravity -- affects the propagation and dynamics of neutrinos. The investigation centers on three distinct aspects: the rate of energy deposition due to neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation, modifications to the neutrino oscillation phase driven by the underlying spacetime structure, and the influence of gravitational lensing on flavor conversion probabilities. To support the theoretical considerations, numerical simulations are conducted for oscillation probabilities in a two-flavor framework, taking into account both normal and inverted mass orderings. For comparison, the outcomes are juxtaposed with those obtained in a different Lorentz-violating background, namely, a black hole solution within Kalb-Ramond gravity.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for the integrand-level reduction of two-loop helicity amplitudes in both $d=4-2\epsilon$ and $d=4$ dimensions. The amplitude is expressed in terms of a set of Feynman integrals and their coefficients that depend on the external kinematics. The analysis presented in this paper, in conjunction with the ongoing development of the computational framework $\text{HELAC-2LOOP}$, paves the road for the construction of an automated program for two-loop amplitude calculations for arbitrary scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Universality of scaling entropy in charged hadron multiplicity distributions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the scaling behavior of the entropy associated with the charged hadron multiplicity distribution P(N) in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the growth of this entropic indicator as a function of the Bjorken x variable exhibits a universal behavior, consistent with observations from deep inelastic scattering (DIS). This universality suggests that the entropy scaling is a property of the initial state and reflects the diffusive nature of gluon dynamics at small x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high-multiplicity events are not accurately described by traditional KNO scaling and require a more precise description based on a diffusion scaling framework. This new scaling emerges naturally from the universal growth of partonic entropy and offers a deeper insight into the dynamics of particle production in high-energy hadronic collisions.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium in a QCD medium with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the properties of quarkonia in a hot QCD medium using a newly proposed collision kernel that consistently incorporates the particle's momentum dependence into the relaxation time scale of the medium. The longitudinal component of the gluon self-energy, along with the Debye screening mass, is computed within the one-loop hard thermal loop framework by incorporating non-equilibrium corrections. A modified kinetic theory with an extended relaxation time approximation is employed to model the non-equilibrium dynamics of the QCD medium. The sensitivity of the heavy quarkonia potential to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time is studied. Further, we studied the binding energy and thermal width of quarkonia states within this new kinetic theory. Sizable variations in the temperature behavior of these quantities are observed in comparison with the standard relaxation time approximation method due to the particle momentum dependence on the relaxation timescale of the QCD medium. Our findings highlight that accounting for the microscopic nature of the collision timescale is crucial for understanding the quarkonium behavior in a QCD medium.</description>

      <title>On the fate of spacetime singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I investigate spacetime singularities from the point of view of the wavefunction of the universe. In order to extend the classical notion of geodesic incompleteness one has to include the proper time of an observer as a degree of freedom in the Wheeler DeWitt equation. This leads to a Schr\"odinger equation along the observer worldline. Near the singularity, as in the classical BLK treatment, I ignore spatial gradients and effectively describe the spacetime around the worldline in the mini-superspace approximation. Then the problem proves identical to a spherically symmetric scattering of a quantum particle off a central potential and singularity avoidance is tantamount to unitary evolution for this system. Standard types of matter (dust, radiation) correspond to regular potentials and thus lead to a bounce. The most singular component, spatial anisotropy, is associated to a conserved charge and yields a negative inverse-square potential -- like standard angular momentum, but with opposite sign. This potential is critical, in that the unitarity of the evolution depends on the actual numerical factor in front of it, i.e., on the anisotropy charge.</description>

      <title>Is the $\Lambda$CDM Model in Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present strong evidence for dynamical dark energy that challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Several dark energy scenarios are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, and BA parameterizations, along with non-flat cosmologies allowing for spatial curvature ($\Omega_k \neq 0$). Our analysis supports a flat Universe with $\Omega_k \approx 0$. Using MCMC techniques, we constrain these models with observational data from DESI~DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, Type~Ia supernovae, and compressed CMB likelihoods. The results provide strong statistical evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, favoring dynamical dark-energy behavior consistent with a Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$). We also derive upper bounds on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu$, using CMB + DESI~DR2 data: $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.066~\mathrm{eV}$ for $\Lambda$CDM and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.075~\mathrm{eV}$ for $\omega$CDM. In the non-flat extensions, o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM, the limits relax to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.263~\mathrm{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.520~\mathrm{eV}$, respectively. For the other models $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE the constraints range between $&lt;0.043$ and $&lt;0.127~\mathrm{eV}$. The effective number of relativistic species remains consistent with the standard value, $N_{\mathrm{eff}} = 3.044$, across all models. Bayesian evidence further shows that combining DES-SN5Y or Union3 supernova samples with CMB + DESI~DR2 produces measurable deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Although no model reaches the $5\sigma$ significance threshold, several exhibit tensions exceeding $3\sigma$, suggesting emerging cracks in the cosmological constant paradigm.</description>

      <title>Localized five-dimensional rotating brane-world black hole Analytically Connected to an to an AdS$_5$ boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a method to describe the geometry of an analytic, exponentially localized $5D$ rotating braneworld black hole, using the $5D$ Janis Newman algorithm in Hopf coordinates. The induced metric on the brane matches the standard $4D$ Kerr spacetime. Two curvature singularities arise: one confined to the $3$-brane at $z = r = 0$, and another that, on the brane, reproduces the Kerr singularity at $r = 0$, $\bar{\theta} = \pi/2$. The inner and event horizons, together with the stationary limit hypersurfaces, extend into the extra dimension in a pancake-like shape. We describe their behavior in the bulk.
  The energy momentum tensor represents a source transitioning from an anisotropic, non diagonal structure to a vacuum with negative cosmological constant. Thus, the localized black hole connects to an AdS$_5$ boundary. The geometry is supported by a non-diagonal anisotropic fluid in the bulk, requiring no matter on the brane. To evaluate the energy conditions, we use a one form from the dual basis that yields a diagonal energy momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Variational problem and Hamiltonian formulation of the Lagrange-d'Alembert equations with nonlinear nonholonomic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how any given system of ordinary differential equations in $n$-dimensional configuration space can be obtained from a peculiar variational problem with one local symmetry. The obtained action functional leads to the Hamiltonian formulation in $(4n+2)$-dimensional phase space. As concrete examples, we discuss the cases of Lagrange-d'Alembert equations with nonlinear nonholonomic constraints, as well as the equations of motion with dissipative (frictional) forces.</description>

      <title>Regularization of Gauss-Bonnet Gravity in Riemann-Cartan Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the conformal dimensional-derivative regularization of four-dimensional Gauss- Bonnet gravity to Riemann-Cartan geometry, obtaining a regularized action whose torsionless limit equals the well-known regularized four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet model. Varying independently with respect to the scalar, tetrad, and spin connection yields field equations that remain strictly second order in covariant derivatives, thereby avoiding Ostrogradsky-type instabil- ities. Within this framework we obtain static, spherically symmetric black holes carrying torsion hair, showing that the regularized Gauss-Bonnet interaction can support long-range torsion hair without invoking extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified categorical framework for gauging both continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our construction applies to geometric categories i.e. categories internal to stacks. This generalizes the familiar setting of fusion categories, which describe finite group symmetries, to the case of Lie group symmetries. Within this framework, we obtain a functorial Symmetry Topological Field Theory together with its natural boundaries, allowing us to compute associated endomorphism categories and Drinfeld centers in a uniform way. For a given symmetry group $G$, our framework recovers the electric and magnetic higher-form symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. Moreover, it naturally encodes electric breaking symmetry in the presence of charged matter, reproducing known physical phenomena in a categorical setting.</description>
