      <title>Quantum-number projected generator coordinate method for $^{21}$Ne with a chiral two-nucleon-plus-three-nucleon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a study of the low-lying states of deformed $^{21}$Ne within the framework of quantum-number projected generator coordinate method (PGCM), starting from a chiral two-nucleon-plus-three-nucleon (NN+3N) interaction. The wave functions of states are constructed as a linear combination of a set of axially-deformed Hartree-Fock-Bogliubov (HFB) wave functions with different quadrupole deformations. These HFB wave functions are projected onto different angular momenta and the correct neutron and proton numbers for $^{21}$Ne. The results of calculations based on the effective Hamiltonians derived by normal-ordering the 3N interaction with respect to three different reference states, including the quantum-number projected HFB wave functions for $^{20}$Ne, $^{22}$Ne, and an ensemble of them with equal weights, are compared. This study serves as a key step towards ab initio calculations of odd-mass deformed nuclei with the in-medium GCM.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars as a dense liquid drop at equilibrium within the effective surface approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a liquid drop for the equilibrium at zero temperature, $T=0$, is formulated for derivations of the equation of state (EoS) for the pressure $P=P(\rho)$, the particle number density $\rho$, and the NS mass $M$ expressions in the leptodermic approximation $a/R \ll 1$, where $a$ is the diffused NS effective surface (ES), and $R$ is the effective NS radius. The macroscopic gravitation is taken into account in terms of the potential $\Phi(\rho)$ as a second order expansion in powers of $\rho-\overline{\rho} $, where $\overline{\rho}$ is the saturation density. The density distribution $\rho$ across the NS ES in the normal direction to the ES was obtained analytically for a general form of the energy density $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$, in the leading order of the approximation $a/R \ll 1$ for both spherical and deformed ES shapes. For a spherically symmetric NS and its typical parameters such as a crust thickness, $a \sim 1$ km, effective radii, $R\sim 10$ km, and central particle-number density (saturation) value, $\overline{\rho} \sim 2\cdot 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$, we find the leading expression for the particle number density $\rho$. The surface NS mass correction $M_{\rm S}$ to the volume part, $M_{\rm V}$, is found as $M_{\rm S} \approx - (2a/R) M_{\rm V}$. The analytical solution to the Tolman-Oppenhamer-Volkoff (TOV) equations for the pressure $P$ at different typical experimentally known N masses, $M=(1.4-2.0) M_\odot$, is in good agreement with the corresponding numerical results. As shown from their comparison with our EoS pressure, $P=P(\rho)$, we emphasize importance of its surface corrections $P_{\rm S}$ near the NS edge.</description>

      <title>Shell-cluster transition in $^{48}$Ti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Whether or not the $\alpha$ ($^4$He nucleus) clustering exists in the medium-mass region of nuclear systems is a fundamental and intriguing question. However, the recent analysis of the $\alpha$ knockout reaction on $^{48}$Ti [Phys. Rev. C 103, L031305 (2021)] poses a puzzle: The microscopic wave function gives an $\alpha$ knockout cross section that is two orders of magnitude smaller than the experiment, while basic nuclear properties such as the charge radius and the electromagnetic transition probabilities are well explained.
  Purpose: The ground-state structure of $^{48}$Ti is investigated by using proton- and $\alpha$-nucleus elastic scattering at a few to several hundred MeV, which offers different sensitivity to the region of the nuclear density profiles.
  Method: Four types of density distributions, the $jj$-coupling shell model and three cluster model configurations, are generated in a single scheme by the antisymmetrized quasi-cluster model (AQCM). The angular distribution of the proton- and $\alpha$-$^{48}$Ti elastic scattering cross sections are obtained with a reliable high-energy reaction theory, the Glauber model.
  Results: The $jj$-coupling shell model configuration is found to best reproduce the proton-nucleus elastic scattering cross section. On the other hand, the trace of the $\alpha$ cluster structure in the tail region of the wave function is embedded in the $\alpha$-nucleus elastic scattering cross section.
  Conclusion: Our results suggest that the structure of the nucleus changes as a function of distance from the center, from the $jj$-coupling shell model structure in the surface region to the $\alpha$+$^{44}$Ca cluster structure in the tail region. This picture is consistent with the finding of the $\alpha$ knockout reaction on $^{48}$Ti.</description>

      <title>Density-dependent quark mean-field model for nuclear matter and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a density-dependent quark mean-field (DDQMF) model to study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars, where the coupling strength between $\sigma$ meson and nucleon is generated by the degree of freedom of quarks, while other meson coupling constants are regarded as density-dependent ones. Two values for the nucleon effective mass, $M^*_{N0}/M_N=0.556,~0.70$ at the saturation density are chosen based on the consideration of the core-collapse supernova simulation and finite nuclei when the meson-nucleon coupling constants are fixed. We find that the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the symmetry energy, the mass-radius relations, and the tidal deformabilities of neutron stars with larger nucleon effective mass are more sensitive to the skewness coefficient $J_0$. The EOSs with $M^*_{N0}/M_N=0.70$ are softer when the skewness coefficient $J_0=-800$ MeV. However, the maximum masses of the neutron star can be around $2.32M_\odot$ with $J_0=400$ MeV regardless of the value of the nucleon effective mass. By manipulating the coupling strength of the isovector meson to generate different slopes of symmetry energy, we construct the neutron star EOSs that can satisfy the different variables from the simultaneous mass-radius measurements of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620 by the NICER collaboration, the mass-radius relations of HESS J1731-347, and the radius constraints from the gravitational-wave signal GW170817 in the framework of DDQMF model. At the same time, most of these constructed EOSs can also satisfy the constraints of the tidal deformability from GW170817 event.</description>

      <title>Eigenphase shift decomposition of the RPA strength function based on the Jost-RPA method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The S-matrix which satisfies the unitarity, giving the poles as RPA excited states, is derived using the extended Jost function within the framework of the RPA theory. An analysis on the correspondence between the component decomposition of the RPA strength function by the eigenphase shift obtained by diagonalisation of the S-matrix and the S- and K-matrix poles was performed in the calculation of the $^{16}$O quadrupole excitations. The results show the possibility that the states defined by the eigenphase shift can be expressed as RPA-excited eigenstates corresponding to the S-matrix poles in the continuum region.</description>

      <title>Isospin-forbidden electric dipole transition of the 9.64 MeV state of $^{12}$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric dipole transition of the 3$^-$ state at 9.64 MeV of $^{12}$C to the 2$^+$ state at 4.44 MeV is speculated to play a key role in the triple-$\alpha$ reaction at high temperatures. A theoretical prediction of its transition width is a challenge to nuclear theory because it belongs to a class of isospin-forbidden transitions. We extend a microscopic 3$\alpha$ cluster-model to include isospin 1 impurity components, and take into account both isovector and isoscalar electirc dipole operators. Several sets of $2^+$ and $3^-$ wave functions are generated by solving a radius-constrained equation of motion with the stochastic variational method, resulting in reproducing very well the electric quadrupole and octupole transition probabilities to the ground state. The electric dipole transition width is found to be 7--31 meV, 16 meV on the average, and more than half of the width is contributed by the isospin mixing of $\alpha$ particles.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Model of $J/\Psi$ photo-production on the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamical model based on a phenomenological charm quark-nucleon($c$-N) potential $v_{cN}$ and the Pomeron-exchange mechanism is constructed to investigate the $J/\Psi$ photo-production on the nucleon from threshold to invariant mass $W=300$ GeV. The $J/\Psi$-N potential,$V_{J/\Psi N}(r)$,is constructed by folding $v_{cN}$ into the wavefunction $\Phi_{J/\Psi}(c\bar{c})$ of $J/\Psi$ within a Constituent Quark Model(CQM) of Ref.[43]. A photo-production amplitude is also generated by $v_{cN}$ by a $c\bar{c}$-loop integration over the $\gamma\rightarrow c\bar{c}$ vertex function and $\Phi_{J/\Psi}(c\bar{c})$. No commonly used Vector Meson Dominance assumption is used to define this photo-production amplitude which is needed to describe the data near the threshold. The potential $v_{cN}(r)$ is parameterized in a form such that the predicted $V_{J/\Psi N}(r)$ at large distances has the same Yukawa potential form extracted from a Lattice QCD(LQCD) calculation of Ref.[18]. The parameters of $v_{cN}$ are determined by fitting the total cross section data of JLab by performing calculations that include $J/\Psi$-N final state interactions(FSI). The resulting differential cross sections are found in good agreements with the data. It is shown that the FSI effects dominate the cross section in the very near threshold region, allowing for sensitive testing of the predicted $J/\Psi$-N scattering amplitudes. By imposing the constraints of $J/\Psi$-N potential extracted from the LQCD calculation, we have obtained three $J/\Psi$-N potentials which fit the JLab data equally well. The resulting $J/\Psi$-N scattering lengths are in the range of $a=(-0.05$ fm $\sim$ $-0.25$ fm). With the determined $v_{cN}(r)$ and the wavefunctions generated from the same CQM, the constructed model is used to predict the cross sections of photo-production of $\eta_c(1S)$ and $\Psi(2S)$ mesons for future experimental tests.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of cluster radioactivity in trans-lead nuclei within various versions of proximity potential formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, based on the framework of the Coulomb and proximity potential model (CPPM), we systematically study the cluster radioactivity half-lives of 26 trans-lead nuclei by considering the cluster preformation probability which is found to possess a simple mass dependence on the emitted cluster by R. Blendowske and H. Walliser [Phys. Rev. Lett. 61, 1930(1988)]. Meanwhile, we investigate 28 different versions of the proximity potential formalisms, which are the most complete known proximity potential formalisms and have been proposed for the description of proton radioactivity, two-proton radioactivity, {\alpha} decay, heavy-ion radioactivity, quasi-elastic scattering, fusion reactions and other applications. The calculated results show that the modified forms of proximity potential 1977 denoted as Prox.77-12 and the proximity potential 1981 denoted as Prox.81 are the most appropriate proximity potential formalisms for the study of cluster radioactivity as the root-mean-square deviation between experimental data and relevant theoretical results obtained are least and the both values are 0.681. For comparison, a universal decay law (UDL) proposed by Qi et al. [Phys. Rev. C 80, 044326 (2009)], a unified formula of half-lives for {\alpha} decay and cluster radioactivity proposed by Ni et al. [Phys. Rev. C 78, 044310 (2008)] and a scaling law (SL) in cluster decay proposed by Horoi et al. [J. Phys. G 30, 945 (2004)] are also used. In addition, utilizing CPPM with Prox.77- 12, Prox.77-1, Prox.77-2 and Prox.81, we predict the half-lives of 51 potential cluster radioactive candidates whose cluster radioactivity is energetically allowed or observed but not yet quantified in NUBASE2020. The predicted results are in the same order of magnitude with those obtained by using the compared semi-empirical and/or empirical formulae.</description>

      <title>Relativistic corrections to energy spectrum of hydrogen due to the full one-photon-exchange interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we estimate the relativistic corrections to the energy spectrum of hydrogen resulting from the full one-photon-exchange interaction using a highly precise numerical method. In the frame of the effective Schrodinger-like equation, which is derived exactly from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in quantum electrodynamics, we express the effective potential corresponding to the full one-photon-exchange interaction in terms of eight scalar functions. Unlike the usual calculations performed in the references, where the effective potential is expanded in terms of momenta order by order, we retain the exact momentum dependence in the effective potential to estimate its corrections to the energy spectrum of hydrogen using a highly precise numerical method. We also use the same numerical method to double-check the results in the non-relativistic case to ensure accuracy. We discuss the comparison of the numerical results with those obtained using the usual bound-state perturbative theory. Our calculations suggest that it is possible to accurately account for all the relativistic contributions using this method. It would be interesting to extent these calculations to positronium, muonic hydrogen, and cases involving nuclear structure and radiative corrections.</description>

      <title>The utilization of magneto-hydrodynamics framework in expansion of magnetized viscous conformal flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of magnetized quark gluon plasma (QGP) in the framework of magneto-hydrodynamics is the focus of our study. We are investigating the temporal and spatial evolution of QGP using a second order viscous hydrodynamic framework. The fluid is considered to be magnetized and subjected to the influence of a magnetic field that is generated during the early stages of relativistic heavy ion collisions.We assume boost invariance along the beam line, which is represented by the $z$ coordinate, and fluid expansion in the $x$ direction. Additionally, we assume that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the reaction plane, which corresponds to the $y$ direction. The fluid is considered to have infinite electrical conductivity. To analyze this system, we solve the coupled Maxwell and conservation equations. By doing so, we are able to determine the time and space dependence of the energy density, velocity, and magnetic field in the transverse plane of the viscous magnetized hot plasma. Furthermore, we obtain the spectrum of hadrons and compare it with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Study of forbidden $\beta$ decays within the realistic shell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, half-lives and energy spectra of forbidden $\beta$ decays are calculated within the realistic shell model. Namely, we approach this issue starting from a realistic nucleon-nucleon potential and deriving effective Hamiltonians and decay operators. Our goal is to explore the sensitivity of the shape of calculated energy spectra to the renormalization of forbidden $\beta$ -decay operators, an operation that allows to take into account those configurations that are not explicitly included in the chosen model space. The region that has been considered for this investigation are nuclei outside the $^{78}$Ni core, more precisely we have studied the second-forbidden $\beta$ decays of $^{94}$Nb and $^{99}$Tc, and fourth-forbidden $\beta$ decays of $^{113}$Cd and $^{115}$In, that are currently of a renewed experimental interest in terms of novel spectroscopic techniques. Our results evidence that the introduction of a renormalized $\beta$-decay operator leads to a marked improvement of the reproduction of experimental half-lives. As regards the spectra of both second-forbidden and fourth-forbidden decays, we have found that their calculated shapes are in good agreement with the observed ones, even if scarcely responsive to the renormalization of the decay operator. We carry out also a detailed inspection of the different components of the calculated spectra for a deeper insight about their role in reproducing the experimental shapes.</description>

      <title>Strangeness plus-one ($S=+1$) resonance-state $P^{+*}_0$ via $K^+n\to K^{*0}p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our current study, we delve into the peak-like structure observed during the reaction process of $K^+n\to K^{0}p$ at approximately $\sqrt{s}\sim2.5$ GeV. Our focus centers on exploring the potential $S=+1$ resonance $P^{+*}_0\equiv P^*_0$ as an excited state within the extended vector-meson and baryon ($VB$) antidecuplet. To achieve this aim, we employ the effective Lagrangian method in conjunction with the $(u,t)$-channel Regge approach, operating within the tree-level Born approximation. We thoroughly examine various spin-parity quantum numbers for the resonance, resulting in a compelling description of the data, where $M_{P^*_0}\approx2.5$ GeV and $\Gamma_{P^*_0}\approx100$ MeV. Furthermore, we propose an experimental technique to amplify the signal-to-noise ratio ($S/N$) for accurately measuring the resonance. Notably, our findings reveal that background interference diminishes significantly within the $K^*$ forward-scattering region in the center-of-mass frame when the $K^*$ is perpendicularly polarized to the reaction plane. Additionally, we explore the recoil-proton spin asymmetry to definitively determine the spin and parity of the resonance. This study stands to serve as a valuable reference for designing experimental setups aimed at investigating and comprehending exotic phenomena in QCD. Specifically, our insights will inform future J-PARC experiments, particularly those employing higher kaon beam energies.</description>

      <title>Study of identified particle production as a function of transverse event activity classifier, $S_{T}$ in p$-$p collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new observable, $S_{T}$, is introduced in terms of the sum of the transverse momentum of charged particles ($\sum_{i} p_{T_{i}}$ ) produced in proton proton (p$-$p) collisions at LHC energies to probe the underlying events (UE). The UE are defined as those aspects of proton-proton collisions that are not attributed to the primary hard scattering process, but rather to the accompanying interactions of the rest of the proton. The conventional approach of studying underlying events is usually carried out by defining topological regions with respect to the leading particle in an event. The transverse region is generally sensitive to UE and various classifiers have been used to discriminate the extent of UE activity regions. The production of identified particles like $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, p , $K_{S}^{0}$, and $\Lambda^{0}$ are studied in different ranges of transverse activity classifier in p$-$p collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13 $ TeV using pQCD inspired PYTHIA 8 event generator. A comparative analysis of the identified particle spectra, mean multiplicity and mean transverse momentum has been carried out with respect to $S_{T}$ and the performance of this new observable is gauged by comparing the results with previously defined $R_{T}$ observable.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium are likely to be modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and observables, such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Knudsen number, elliptic flow, specific heat at constant pressure, specific heat at constant volume, trace anomaly, thermal diffusion constant and isothermal compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them. In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the angular velocity plays an important role and enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said approximations are more pronounced at high temperature than at low temperature. Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the rotation of the QGP medium.</description>

      <title>Identify the new state $Y(3872)$ as the P-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration recently observed a new charmonium-like vector state $Y(3872)$ in $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar{D}$, which should be the first P-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ molecular resonance. The experimental and theoretical identification of the P-wave dimeson state holds paramount importance in enhancing our comprehension of the non-perturbative QCD and few-body physics. Its existence is firmly established in a unified meson-exchange model which simultaneously depicts the features of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, $Z_c(3900)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$. This scenario can be directly examined in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ cross section to see whether a resonance exists at the threshold. The credibility of the investigations is also ensured by the fact that the P-wave interaction dominantly arises from the well-known long-range pion exchange. Additionally, the existence of the P-wave resonance only depends on the interaction strength and is less sensitive to the potential shapes. We extensively calculate all systems up to P-wave with various quantum numbers and predict a dense population of the $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ and $DD^*$ states, where the S-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ state with $I^G (J^{PC})=0^- (1^{+-})$, P-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ state with $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(0^{-+})$, and P-wave $DD^*$ state with $I(J^P)=0(0^-)$ are more likely to be observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>A Global View of the EDM Landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs) are sensitive probes of the symmetry structure of elementary particles, which in turn is closely tied to the baryon asymmetry in the universe. A meaningful interpretation framework for EDM measurements has to be based on effective quantum field theory. We interpret the measurements performed to date in terms of a hadronic-scale Lagrangian, using the SFitter global analysis framework. We find that part of this Lagrangian is constrained very well, while some of the parameters suffer from too few high-precision measurements. Theory uncertainties lead to weaker model constraints, but can be controlled within the global analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cooling of isolated neutron stars, employing different nuclear equations of state with or without active direct Urca process, and investigate the interplay with the nuclear pairing gaps. We find that a consistent description of all current cooling data requires fast DU cooling and reasonable proton 1S0 gaps, but no neutron 3P2 pairing. We then deduce the neutron star mass distributions compatible with the cooling analysis and compare with current theoretical models. Reduced 1S0 gaps and unimodal mass distributions are preferred by the analysis.</description>

      <title>On the study of new proxies for second order cumulants of conserved charges in heavy-ion collisions with EPOS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proxies for cumulants of baryon number $B$, electric charge $Q$ and strangeness $S$ are usually measured in heavy-ion collisions via moments of net-number distribution of given hadronic species. Since these cumulants of conserved charges are expected to be sensitive to the existence of a critical point in the phase diagram of nuclear matter, it is crucial to ensure that the proxies used as substitutes are as close to them as possible. Hence, we use the EPOS4 framework to generate Au+Au collisions at several collision energies of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan. We compute $2^\text{nd}$ order net-cumulants of $\pi$, $K$ and $p$, for which experimental data has been published, as well as the corresponding conserved charge cumulants. We then compare them with proxies, defined in previous lattice QCD and Hadron Resonance Gas model studies, which are shown to reproduce more accurately their associated conserved charge cumulants. We investigate the impact of hadronic re-scatterings occurring in the late evolution of the system on these quantities, as well as the amount of signal actually originating from the bulk medium which endures a phase transition.</description>

      <title>Momentum transport of chiral modes in a thermal QCD medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the effect of a weak magnetic field on momentum transport in a thermal QCD medium at finite quark chemical potential using a semiclassical kinetic theory. In the presence of a magnetic field, the momentum transport coefficients acquire a tensor structure, reflected by the five shear $\left(\eta_0, \eta_1, \eta_2, \eta_3\right.$ and $\left.\eta_4\right)$ and two bulk viscous components $\left(\zeta_0\right.$ and $\left. \zeta_1\right)$. The weak magnetic field removes the degeneracy in the effective mass of flavours, leading to different masses for the left-handed (L) and right-handed (R) chiral modes of quarks. The coefficients, $\eta_0, \eta_1$ and $\eta_3$ decrease with magnetic field in L mode and increase in $\mathrm{R}$ mode, whereas, $\eta_2$ and $\eta_4$ increase in both L and $\mathrm{R}$ mode. The bulk viscous coefficients, $\zeta_0$ and $\zeta_1$ increase with magnetic field for both L and R mode. The shear and bulk viscous coefficients positively amplify with baryon asymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it has been argued that a spherical-like spectrum emerges in the SU3-IBM, opening up new approaches to understand the {\gamma}-softness in realistic nuclei. In a previous paper, {\gamma}-softness with degeneracy of the ground and quasi-{\gamma} bands was observed. In this paper, another special point connected with the middle degenerate point is discussed, which is found to be related with the properties of 196Pt. This emergent {\gamma}-softness has also been shown to be important for understanding the prolate-oblate asymmetric shape phase transition. The low-lying spectra, B(E2) values and quadrupole moments in 196Pt are discussed showing that the new model can account for several observed features. This is the first part of the discussions on the {\gamma}-soft-like spectrum of 196Pt.</description>

      <title>Lattice-based equation of state with 3D Ising critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BEST Collaboration equation of state combining lattice data with the 3D Ising critical point encounters limitations due to the truncated Taylor expansion up to $\frac{\mu_B}{T} \sim 2.5$. This truncation consequently restricts its applicability at high densities. Through a resummation scheme, the lattice results have been extended to $\frac{\mu_B}{T} = 3.5$. In this article, we amalgamate these ideas with the 3D-Ising model, yielding a family of equations of state valid up to $\mu_B=700 \text{MeV}$ with the correct critical behavior. Our equations of state feature tunable parameters, providing a stable and causal framework-a crucial tool for hydrodynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Generator coordinate method with proton--neutron pairing fluctuations and magnetic properties of $N=Z$ odd--odd nuclei</title>

Abstract: Pairing correlations play an important role in a variety of nuclear phenomena. However, a quantitative understanding of proton--neutron $(pn)$ pairing, especially isoscalar $pn$ pairing $(S=1, T=0)$ remains elusive. To clarify the property of $pn$ pairing, we investigate the roles of $pn$ pairing in the $M1$ transition of $N=Z$ odd--odd nuclei. We develop a theoretical model based on the generator coordinate method (GCM) in which the isoscalar and isovector $pn$-pair amplitudes are used as the generator coordinates. Using the particle and the angular-momentum projections, the $pn$-pair GCM well reproduces the $M1$ transition of odd--odd nuclei for the exactly solvable SO(8) model. We apply the method to $N=Z$ odd--odd nuclei and find that the experimental values of $B(M1)$ are well reproduced. We also study the sensitivity of $B(M1)$ to the strength of the isoscalar pairing interaction.</description>

      <title>$\gamma Z$-Exchange Contributions in Low-Energy Parity-Violating $ep$ Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the $\gamma Z$-exchange contributions in the low-energy elastic parity-violating $ep$ scattering are discussed with the approximation $m_e=0$. By expanding the $\gamma pp$ and $Zpp$ interactions on the momentum of photon and considering both the leading-order and the next-to-leading order interactions, we calculate the amplitudes of the $\gamma Z$-exchange diagrams. After performing the loop integral, we expand the results in the low energy limit, and obtain the analytic expressions for the amplitudes. Numerical comparisons show that the analytic expressions are very close to the full results over a large region. We investigate the power behaviors of these contributions and find that some are enhanced by a kinematic factor in the low energy limit. Additionally, in some cases, the imaginary parts of the contributions from the next-to-leading-order interactions are at the same order as those from the leading-order interactions. Furthermore, the corresponding contributions to the physical observable quantity $A_{\textrm{PV}}$ are also discussed. Combining all the properties together, we conclude that these analytic expressions describe the leading-order contributions of all $\gamma Z$-exchange helicity amplitudes in the region with $\alpha_e\ll Q/M_N\sim \delta/M_N^2\ll 1$, where $\alpha_{e}$ is the fine structure constant, $M_N$ is the mass of proton, $Q$ and $\delta$ are the small quantities related to the momentum transfer and the center-of-mass energy.</description>

      <title>Corrections to the Forward Limit Dispersion Relations for $\gamma Z$-Exchange Contributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak charge of the proton $Q_{\textrm{w}}$ is one of the most fundamental quantities in physics. It can be determined by measuring the parity asymmetry $A_{\textrm{PV}}$ in elastic $ep$ scattering, where the $\gamma Z$-exchange contributions are crucial. For the past fifteen years, dispersion relations (DRs) in the forward limit have been widely used as a model-independent method to estimate these contributions. In this work, we study corrections to these forward-limit DRs. We first estimate these corrections using pointlike interactions as an illustrative example. We then estimate the $\gamma Z$-exchange contributions for the upcoming P2 experiment through both direct calculation and the forward-limit DRs, within the framework of low-energy effective interactions. The results indicate that the correction to the forward-limit DR for $\Box_{\gamma Z}^{V}$ is around 47\% for the upcoming P2 experiment, which will significantly modify the extracted value of $Q_{\textrm{w}}$.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos are known to play important roles in many astrophysical scenarios from the early period of the big bang to current stellar evolution being a unique messenger of the fusion reactions occurring in the center of our sun. In particular, neutrinos are crucial in determining the dynamics and the composition evolution in explosive events such as core-collapse supernovae and the merger of two neutron stars. In this paper, we review the current understanding of supernovae and binary neutron star mergers by focusing on the role of neutrinos therein. Several recent improvements on the theoretical modeling of neutrino interaction rates in nuclear matter as well as their impact on the heavy element nucleosynthesis in the supernova neutrino-driven wind are discussed, including the neutrino-nucleon opacity at the mean field level taking into account the relativistic kinematics of nucleons, the effect due to the nucleon-nucleon correlation, and the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. We also review the framework used to compute the neutrino-nucleus interactions and the up-to-date yield prediction for isotopes from neutrino nucleosynthesis occurring in the outer envelope of the supernova progenitor star during the explosion. Here improved predictions of energy spectra of supernova neutrinos of all flavors have had significant impact on the nucleosynthesis yields. Rapid progresses in modeling the flavor oscillations of neutrinos in these environments, including several novel mechanisms for collective neutrino oscillations and their potential impacts on various nucleosynthesis processes are summarized.</description>

Abstract: We explore the possibility that the initial transverse momentum distribution of unpolarized and polarized partons within unpolarized nucleons, both with and without the anisotropy of unpolarized hadrons produced in the fragmentation of outgoing partons, could lead to the observed azimuthal anisotropy of high transverse momentum (high-$p_T$) hadrons produced in high energy proton-proton ($p$-$p$) or proton-ion ($p$-$A$) collisions. Including simple Gaussian forms for transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (PDF) and fragmentation functions, and assuming an $A^{1/3}$ enhancement of a PDF in $p$-$Pb$ collisions, we show that the observed anisotropy, with \emph{no modification} to the angle integrated spectra ($R_{pA}=1$) for 5~GeV~$\lesssim p_T\lesssim 50$~GeV, can be straightforwardly understood as arising from a few processes dominated by gluon-gluon to gluon-gluon scattering.</description>

Abstract: Precision measurements of antineutrino elastic scattering on hydrogen from future neutrino experiments offer a unique opportunity to access the low-energy structure of protons and neutrons. We discuss the determination of the nucleon axial-vector form factor and radius from antineutrino interactions on hydrogen that can be collected at the future Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility, and study the sources of theoretical and experimental uncertainties. The projected accuracy would improve existing measurements by $1$ order of magnitude and be competitive with contemporary lattice-QCD determinations, potentially helping to resolve the corresponding tension with measurements from (anti)neutrino elastic scattering on deuterium. We find that the current knowledge of the nucleon vector form factors could be one of the dominant sources of uncertainty. We also evaluate the constraints that can be simultaneously obtained on the absolute $\bar \nu_\mu$ flux normalization.</description>

      <title>On thermal transition in QCD</title>

Abstract: We describe how the general mechanism of partial deconfinement applies to large-$N$ QCD and the partially-deconfined phase inevitably appears between completely-confined and completely-deconfined phases. Furthermore, we propose how the partial deconfinement can be observed in the real-world QCD with the SU(3) gauge group. For this purpose, we employ lattice configurations obtained by the WHOT-QCD collaboration and examine our proposal numerically. In the discussion, the Polyakov loop plays a crucial role in characterizing the phases, without relying on center symmetry, and hence, we clarify the meaning of the Polyakov loop in QCD at large $N$ and finite $N$.
  Both at large $N$ and finite $N$, the complete confinement is characterized by the Haar-random distribution of the Polyakov line phases. Haar-randomness, which is stronger than unbroken center symmetry, indicates that Polyakov loops in any nontrivial representations have vanishing expectation values and deviation from the Haar-random distribution at higher temperatures is quantified with the loops. We discuss that the transitions separating the partially-deconfined phase are characterized by the behaviors of Polyakov loops in various representations. The lattice QCD data provide us with the signals exhibiting two different characteristic temperatures: deconfinement of the fundamental representation and deconfinement of higher representations. As a nontrivial test for our proposal, we also investigate the relation between partial deconfinement and instanton condensation and confirm the consistency with the lattice data.
  To make the presentation more easily accessible, we provide a detailed review of the previously known aspects of partial deconfinement.</description>

Abstract: The long-range near-side ridge phenomenon in two-particle correlation is crucial for understanding the motion of partons after high-energy heavy-ion collisions. While it has been well explained by the hydrodynamic flow effect of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions, the recent observation of the ridge structure in small systems has led to debates about the applicability of hydrodynamic models to explain the phenomenon since the collisions in small systems could not be sufficient to produce the medium required by the QGP matter. The Momentum Kick Model (MKM), on the other hand, explains the long-range near-side ridge phenomenon by the kinematic process; the high-momentum jet particles collide with medium partons, transfer their momentum to them (called the ``kick" process), and induce collective motion of the kicked-partons resulting in the ridge phenomenon. This MKM has successfully described the ridge structure in heavy-ion collisions at the RHIC. Furthermore, since the ridge phenomenon in small systems is prominent in high-multiplicity events, the MKM with multiplicity dependence (MKMwM) has been studied in $pp$ collisions at the LHC using a relationship between the number of kicked-partons and the multiplicity through an impact parameter. In this research, we extend the previous study with more recent experimental data-driven parameters and apply them to the new measurements that have a wider multiplicity range with $p_T$ and $\Delta\Phi$ bins at the LHC. Simultaneously, we not only provide a theoretical basis for the ridge behavior from the new measurements but also predict the ridge structure at the energies scheduled by the LHC in the upcoming Run 3 experiments.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation holds promise of enabling a complete description of high-energy scattering processes rooted in gauge theories of the Standard Model. A first step in such simulations is preparation of interacting hadronic wave packets. To create the wave packets, one typically resorts to adiabatic evolution to bridge between wave packets in the free theory and those in the interacting theory, rendering the simulation resource intensive. In this work, we construct a wave-packet creation operator directly in the interacting theory to circumvent adiabatic evolution, taking advantage of resource-efficient schemes for ground-state preparation, such as variational quantum eigensolvers. By means of an ansatz for bound mesonic excitations in confining gauge theories, which is subsequently optimized using classical or quantum methods, we show that interacting mesonic wave packets can be created efficiently and accurately using digital quantum algorithms that we develop. Specifically, we obtain high-fidelity mesonic wave packets in the $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions. Our method is applicable to both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of couplings. The wave-packet creation circuit for the case of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory is built and implemented on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using 13 qubits and up to 308 entangling gates. The fidelities agree well with classical benchmark calculations after employing a simple symmetry-based noise-mitigation technique. This work serves as a step toward quantum computing scattering processes in quantum chromodynamics.</description>
