      <title>Adaptive partition Factor Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Factor Analysis has traditionally been utilized across diverse disciplines to extrapolate latent traits that influence the behavior of multivariate observed variables. Historically, the focus has been on analyzing data from a single study, neglecting the potential study-specific variations present in data from multiple studies. Multi-study factor analysis has emerged as a recent methodological advancement that addresses this gap by distinguishing between latent traits shared across studies and study-specific components arising from artifactual or population-specific sources of variation. In this paper, we extend the current methodologies by introducing novel shrinkage priors for the latent factors, thereby accommodating a broader spectrum of scenarios -- from the absence of study-specific latent factors to models in which factors pertain only to small subgroups nested within or shared between the studies. For the proposed construction we provide conditions for identifiability of factor loadings and guidelines to perform straightforward posterior computation via Gibbs sampling. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits competing performance across a variety of scenarios compared to existing methods, yet providing richer insights. The practical benefits of our approach are further illustrated through applications to bird species co-occurrence data and ovarian cancer gene expression data.</description>

      <title>Causal Regime Detection in Energy Markets With Augmented Time Series Structural Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy markets exhibit complex causal relationships between weather patterns, generation technologies, and price formation, with regime changes occurring continuously rather than at discrete break points. Current approaches model electricity prices without explicit causal interpretation or counterfactual reasoning capabilities. We introduce Augmented Time Series Causal Models (ATSCM) for energy markets, extending counterfactual reasoning frameworks to multivariate temporal data with learned causal structure. Our approach models energy systems through interpretable factors (weather, generation mix, demand patterns), rich grid dynamics, and observable market variables. We integrate neural causal discovery to learn time-varying causal graphs without requiring ground truth DAGs. Applied to real-world electricity price data, ATSCM enables novel counterfactual queries such as "What would prices be under different renewable generation scenarios?".</description>

      <title>Towards Causal Market Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04469v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Sequential Causal Normal Form Games: Theory, Computation, and Strategic Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can classical game-theoretic frameworks be extended to capture the bounded rationality and causal reasoning of AI agents? We investigate this question by extending Causal Normal Form Games (CNFGs) to sequential settings, introducing Sequential Causal Multi-Agent Systems (S-CMAS) that incorporate Pearl's Causal Hierarchy across leader-follower interactions. While theoretically elegant -- we prove PSPACE-completeness, develop equilibrium refinements, and establish connections to signaling theory -- our comprehensive empirical investigation reveals a critical limitation: S-CNE provides zero welfare improvement over classical Stackelberg equilibrium across all tested scenarios. Through 50+ Monte Carlo simulations and hand-crafted synthetic examples, we demonstrate that backward induction with rational best-response eliminates any strategic advantage from causal layer distinctions. We construct a theoretical example illustrating conditions where benefits could emerge ($\epsilon$-rational satisficing followers), though implementation confirms that even relaxed rationality assumptions prove insufficient when good instincts align with optimal play. This negative result provides valuable insight: classical game-theoretic extensions grounded in rational choice are fundamentally incompatible with causal reasoning advantages, motivating new theoretical frameworks beyond standard Nash equilibrium for agentic AI.</description>
