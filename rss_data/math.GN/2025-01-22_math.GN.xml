Abstract: We prove that every Lindel\"of scattered subspace of a $\Sigma$-product of first-countable spaces is $\sigma$-compact. In particular, we obtain the result stated in the title. This answers some questions of Tkachuk from [Houston J. Math. 48 (2022), no. 1, 171--181].</description>

      <title>Arrangements of small circles for Morse-Bott functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a topic of mathematics, "arrangements", systems of hyperplanes, circles, and general (regular) submanifolds, attract us strongly. We present a natural elementary study of arrangements of circles. It is also a kind of new studies. Our study is closely related to geometry and singularity theory of Morse(-Bott) functions. Regions surrounded by circles are regarded as images of real algebraic maps and composing them with projections gives Morse-Bott functions: this observation is natural, and surprisingly, recently presented first, by the author. We present a systematic way of constructing such arrangements by choosing small circles centered at existing circles inductively. We are interested in graphs the regions surrounded by the circles naturally collapse. We have studied local changes of the graphs in adding these circles. These graphs are essentially so-called {\it Reeb graphs} of the previous Morse-Bott functions: they are spaces of all components of preimages of single points for the functions.</description>

      <title>Construction, Transformation and Structures of 2x2 Space-Filling Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16962v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2x2 space-filling curve is a type of generalized space-filling curve characterized by a basic unit is in a "U-shape" that traverses a 2x2 grid. In this work, we propose a universal framework for constructing general 2x2 curves where self-similarity is not strictly required. The construction is based on a novel set of grammars that define the expansion of curves from level 0 (a single point) to level 1 (units in U-shapes), which ultimately determines all $36 \times 2^k$ possible forms of curves on any level $k$ initialized from single points. We further developed an encoding system in which each unique form of the curve is associated with a specific combination of an initial seed and a sequence of codes that sufficiently describes both the global and local structures of the curve. We demonstrated that this encoding system is a powerful tool for studying 2x2 curves and we established comprehensive theoretical foundations from the following three key perspectives: 1) We provided a deterministic encoding for any unit on any level and position on the curve, enabling the study of curve generation across arbitrary parts on the curve and ranges of iterations; 2) We gave deterministic encodings for various curve transformations, including rotations, reflections and reversals; 3) We provided deterministic forms of families of curves exhibiting specific structures, including homogeneous curves, curves with identical shapes, and with completely distinct shapes. We also explored families of recursive curves, subunit identically shaped curves, symmetric curves and closed curves. Finally, we proposed a method to calculate the location of any point on the curve arithmetically, within a time complexity linear to the level of the curve.</description>

      <title>Isometries between spaces of metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a metrizable space $Z$, denote by ${\rm PM}(Z)$ the space of continuous bounded pseudometrics on $Z$,
  and denote by ${\rm AM}(Z)$ the one of continuous bounded admissible metrics on $Z$,
  the both of which are equipped with the sup-norm $\|\cdot\|$. Let ${\rm Pc}(Z)$ be the subspace of ${\rm AM}(Z)$ satisfying the following: \begin{itemize}
  \item for every $d \in {\rm Pc}(Z)$, there exists a compact subset $K \subset Z$ such that if $d(x,y) = \|d\|$,
  then $x, y \in K$. \end{itemize} Moreover, set
  $${\rm Pp}(Z) = \{d \in {\rm AM}(Z) \mid \text{ there only exists } \{z,w\} \subset Z \text{ such that } d(z,w) = \|d\|\},$$
  and let ${\rm M}(Z)$ be ${\rm Pc}(Z)$ or ${\rm Pp}(Z)$. In this paper, we shall prove the Banach-Stone type theorem on spaces of metrics,
  that is, for metrizable spaces $X$ and $Y$, the following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic;
  \item there exists a surjective isometry $T : {\rm PM}(X) \to {\rm PM}(Y)$ with $T({\rm M}(X)) = {\rm M}(Y)$;
  \item there exists a surjective isometry $T : {\rm AM}(X) \to {\rm AM}(Y)$ with $T({\rm M}(X)) = {\rm M}(Y)$;
  \item there exists a surjective isometry $T : {\rm M}(X) \to {\rm M}(Y)$.
  \end{enumerate} Then for each surjective isometry $T : {\rm PM}(X) \to {\rm PM}(Y)$ with $T({\rm M}(X)) = {\rm M}(Y)$, there is a homeomorphism $\phi : Y \to X$ such that for any $d \in {\rm PM}(X)$ and for any $x, y \in Y$, $T(d)(x,y) = d(\phi(x),\phi(y))$. Except for the case where the cardinality of $X$ or $Y$ is equal to $2$, the homeomorphism $\phi$ can be chosen uniquely.</description>
