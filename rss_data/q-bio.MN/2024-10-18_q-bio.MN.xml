      <title>Modeling Platelet P2Y$_1$/$_{12}$ Pathway to Integrin Activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through experimental studies, many details of the pathway of integrin $\alpha_{\rm IIb}\beta_3$ activation by ADP during the platelet aggregation process have been mapped out. ADP binds to two separate G protein coupled receptors on platelet surfaces, leading to alterations in the regulation of the small GTPase RAP1. We seek to (1) gain insights into the relative contributions of both pathways to RAP1-mediated integrin activation and to (2) predict cell behavior in response to a continuous range of external agonist concentrations. To this end, we develop a dynamical systems model detailing the action of each protein in the two pathways up to the regulation of RAP1. We perform a parameter estimation using flow cytometry data to determine a number of unknown rate constants. We then validate with already published data; in particular, the model confirmed the effect of impaired P2Y$_1$ receptor desensitization or reduced RASA3 expression on RAP1 activation. We then predict the effect of protein expression levels on integrin activation and show that components of the P2Y$_{12}$ pathway are critical to the regulation of integrin. This model aids in our understanding of interindividual variability in platelet response to ADP and therapeutic P2Y$_{12}$ inhibition. It also provides a more detailed view of platelet activation in the ongoing mathematical study of platelet aggregation.</description>

      <title>Inferring the dynamics of quasi-reaction systems via nonlinear local mean-field approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the modelling of stochastic phenomena, such as quasi-reaction systems, parameter estimation of kinetic rates can be challenging, particularly when the time gap between consecutive measurements is large. Local linear approximation approaches account for the stochasticity in the system but fail to capture the nonlinear nature of the underlying process. At the mean level, the dynamics of the system can be described by a system of ODEs, which have an explicit solution only for simple unitary systems. An analytical solution for generic quasi-reaction systems is proposed via a first order Taylor approximation of the hazard rate. This allows a nonlinear forward prediction of the future dynamics given the current state of the system. Predictions and corresponding observations are embedded in a nonlinear least-squares approach for parameter estimation. The performance of the algorithm is compared to existing SDE and ODE-based methods via a simulation study. Besides the increased computational efficiency of the approach, the results show an improvement in the kinetic rate estimation, particularly for data observed at large time intervals. Additionally, the availability of an explicit solution makes the method robust to stiffness, which is often present in biological systems. An illustration on Rhesus Macaque data shows the applicability of the approach to the study of cell differentiation.</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We apply TE-PWS to linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>
