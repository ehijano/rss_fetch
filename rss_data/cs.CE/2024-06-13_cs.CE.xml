      <title>Illustrating the benefits of efficient creation and adaption of behavior models in intelligent Digital Twins over the machine life cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of the Digital Twin, which in the context of this paper is the virtual representation of a production system or its components, can be used as a "digital playground" to master the increasing complexity of these assets. Central subcomponents of the Digital Twin are behavior models that can provide benefits over the entire machine life cycle. However, the creation, adaption and use of behavior models throughout the machine life cycle is very time-consuming, which is why approaches to improve the cost-benefit ratio are needed. Furthermore, there is a lack of specific use cases that illustrate the application and added benefit of behavior models over the machine life cycle, which is why the universal application of behavior models in industry is still lacking compared to research. This paper first presents the fundamentals, challenges and related work on Digital Twins and behavior models in the context of the machine life cycle. Then, concepts for low-effort creation and automatic adaption of Digital Twins are presented, with a focus on behavior models. Finally, the aforementioned gap between research and industry is addressed by demonstrating various realized use cases over the machine life cycle, in which the advantages as well as the application of behavior models in the different life phases are shown.</description>

      <title>Domain-specific ReAct for physics-integrated iterative modeling: A case study of LLM agents for gas path analysis of gas turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of large language models (LLMs) with callable tools in energy and power engineering domain, focusing on gas path analysis of gas turbines. We developed a dual-agent tool-calling process to integrate expert knowledge, predefined tools, and LLM reasoning. We evaluated various LLMs, including LLama3, Qwen1.5 and GPT. Smaller models struggled with tool usage and parameter extraction, while larger models demonstrated favorable capabilities. All models faced challenges with complex, multi-component problems. Based on the test results, we infer that LLMs with nearly 100 billion parameters could meet professional scenario requirements with fine-tuning and advanced prompt design. Continued development are likely to enhance their accuracy and effectiveness, paving the way for more robust AI-driven solutions.</description>

      <title>A Parameterized Nonlinear Magnetic Equivalent Circuit for Design and Fast Analysis of Radial Flux Magnetic Gears</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic gears offer advantages over mechanical gears, including contactless power transfer, but require robust analysis tools for optimization and commercialization. This study proposes a rapid and accurate 2D nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) model for radial flux magnetic gears (RFMG). The model, featuring a parameterized gear geometry and adjustable flux tube distribution, accommodates nonlinear effects like magnetic saturation while maintaining quick simulation times. Comparison with a nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) model demonstrates the MEC's accuracy in torque and flux density predictions across diverse designs. Additionally, a parametric optimization study of 140,000 designs confirms the MEC's high accuracy, achieving close agreement with FEA torque predictions, with simulations running up to 100 times faster. Finally, the MEC shows good agreement with 2D FEA for a prototype RFMG.</description>

      <title>A face-centred finite volume method for laminar and turbulent incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work develops, for the first time, a face-centred finite volume (FCFV) solver for the simulation of laminar and turbulent viscous incompressible flows. The formulation relies on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with the negative Spalart-Allmaras (SA) model and three novel convective stabilisations, inspired by Riemann solvers, are derived and compared numerically. The resulting method achieves first-order convergence of the velocity, the velocity-gradient tensor and the pressure. FCFV accurately predicts engineering quantities of interest, such as drag and lift, on unstructured meshes and, by avoiding gradient reconstruction, the method is less sensitive to mesh quality than other FV methods, even in the presence of highly distorted and stretched cells. A monolithic and a staggered solution strategies for the RANS-SA system are derived and compared numerically. Numerical benchmarks, involving laminar and turbulent, steady and transient cases are used to assess the performance, accuracy and robustness of the proposed FCFV method.</description>
