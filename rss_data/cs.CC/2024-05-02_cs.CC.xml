      <title>Maximizing Network Phylogenetic Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Phylogenetic Diversity (Network-PD) is a measure for the diversity of a set of species based on a rooted phylogenetic network (with branch lengths and inheritance probabilities on the reticulation edges) describing the evolution of those species. We consider the \textsc{Max-Network-PD} problem: given such a network, find~$k$ species with maximum Network-PD score. We show that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) for binary networks, by describing an optimal algorithm running in $\mathcal{O}(2^r \log (k)(n+r))$~time, with~$n$ the total number of species in the network and~$r$ its reticulation number. Furthermore, we show that \textsc{Max-Network-PD} is NP-hard for level-1 networks, proving that, unless P$=$NP, the FPT approach cannot be extended by using the level as parameter instead of the reticulation number.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Separations in Shallow-Circuit-Based Learning with and without Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum-classical separations between classical and quantum supervised learning models based on constant depth (i.e., shallow) circuits, in scenarios with and without noises. We construct a classification problem defined by a noiseless shallow quantum circuit and rigorously prove that any classical neural network with bounded connectivity requires logarithmic depth to output correctly with a larger-than-exponentially-small probability. This unconditional near-optimal quantum-classical separation originates from the quantum nonlocality property that distinguishes quantum circuits from their classical counterparts. We further derive the noise thresholds for demonstrating such a separation on near-term quantum devices under the depolarization noise model. We prove that this separation will persist if the noise strength is upper bounded by an inverse polynomial with respect to the system size, and vanish if the noise strength is greater than an inverse polylogarithmic function. In addition, for quantum devices with constant noise strength, we prove that no super-polynomial classical-quantum separation exists for any classification task defined by shallow Clifford circuits, independent of the structures of the circuits that specify the learning models.</description>

      <title>Classically Spoofing System Linear Cross Entropy Score Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, several experimental groups have claimed demonstrations of ``quantum supremacy'' or computational quantum advantage. A notable first claim by Google Quantum AI revolves around a metric called the Linear Cross Entropy Benchmarking (Linear XEB), which has been used in multiple quantum supremacy experiments since. The complexity-theoretic hardness of spoofing Linear XEB has nevertheless been doubtful due to its dependence on the Cross-Entropy Quantum Threshold (XQUATH) conjecture put forth by Aaronson and Gunn, which has been disproven for sublinear depth circuits. In efforts on demonstrating quantum supremacy by quantum Hamiltonian simulation, a similar benchmarking metric called the System Linear Cross Entropy Score (sXES) holds firm in light of the aforementioned negative result due to its fundamental distinction with Linear XEB. Moreover, the hardness of spoofing sXES complexity-theoretically rests on the System Linear Cross-Entropy Quantum Threshold Assumption (sXQUATH), the formal relationship of which to XQUATH is unclear. Despite the promises that sXES offers for future demonstration of quantum supremacy, in this work we show that it is an unsound benchmarking metric. Particularly, we prove that sXQUATH does not hold for sublinear depth circuits and present a classical algorithm that spoofs sXES for experiments corrupted with noise larger than certain threshold.</description>

      <title>NP-completeness of Tiling Finite Simply Connected Regions with a Fixed Set of Wang Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational complexity of tiling finite simply connected regions with a fixed set of tiles is studied in this paper. We show that the problem of tiling simply connected regions with a fixed set of $23$ Wang tiles is NP-complete. As a consequence, the problem of tiling simply connected regions with a fixed set of $111$ rectangles is NP-complete. Our results improve that of Igor Pak and Jed Yang by using fewer numbers of tiles. Notably in the case of Wang tiles, the number has decreased by more than one third from $35$ to $23$.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set Parameterized by Vertex Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, a subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ is called a resolving set of $G$ if, for any two vertices $u,v\in V(G)$, there exists a vertex $w\in S$ such that $d(w,u)\neq d(w,v)$. The Metric Dimension problem takes as input a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and a positive integer $k$, and asks whether there exists a resolving set of size at most $k$. In another metric-based graph problem, Geodetic Set, the input is a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, and the objective is to determine whether there exists a subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $k$ such that, for any vertex $u \in V(G)$, there are two vertices $s_1, s_2 \in S$ such that $u$ lies on a shortest path from $s_1$ to $s_2$.
  These two classical problems turn out to be intractable with respect to the natural parameter, i.e., the solution size, as well as most structural parameters, including the feedback vertex set number and pathwidth. Some of the very few existing tractable results state that they are both FPT with respect to the vertex cover number $vc$.
  More precisely, we observe that both problems admit an FPT algorithm running in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(vc^2)}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, and a kernelization algorithm that outputs a kernel with $2^{\mathcal{O}(vc)}$ vertices. We prove that unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set, even on graphs of bounded diameter, neither admit an FPT algorithm running in time $2^{o(vc^2)}\cdot n^{\mathcal(1)}$, nor a kernelization algorithm that reduces the solution size and outputs a kernel with $2^{o(vc)}$ vertices. The versatility of our technique enables us to apply it to both these problems.
  We only know of one other problem in the literature that admits such a tight lower bound. Similarly, the list of known problems with exponential lower bounds on the number of vertices in kernelized instances is very short.</description>

      <title>Top-Down Lower Bounds for Depth-Four Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a top-down lower-bound method for depth-$4$ boolean circuits. In particular, we give a new proof of the well-known result that the parity function requires depth-$4$ circuits of size exponential in $n^{1/3}$. Our proof is an application of robust sunflowers and block unpredictability.</description>

      <title>Solvable Initial Value Problems Ruled by Discontinuous Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study initial value problems having dynamics ruled by discontinuous ordinary differential equations with the property of possessing a unique solution. We identify a precise class of such systems that we call solvable intitial value problems and we prove that for this class of problems the unique solution can always be obtained analytically via transfinite recursion. We present several examples including a nontrivial one whose solution yields, at an integer time, a real encoding of the halting set for Turing machines; therefore showcasing that the behavior of solvable systems is related to ordinal Turing computations.</description>

      <title>Faster maximal clique enumeration in large real-world link streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Link streams offer a good model for representing interactions over time. They consist of links $(b,e,u,v)$, where $u$ and $v$ are vertices interacting during the whole time interval $[b,e]$. In this paper, we deal with the problem of enumerating maximal cliques in link streams. A clique is a pair $(C,[t_0,t_1])$, where $C$ is a set of vertices that all interact pairwise during the full interval $[t_0,t_1]$. It is maximal when neither its set of vertices nor its time interval can be increased. Some of the main works solving this problem are based on the famous Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for enumerating maximal cliques in graphs. We take this idea as a starting point to propose a new algorithm which matches the cliques of the instantaneous graphs formed by links existing at a given time $t$ to the maximal cliques of the link stream. We prove its validity and compute its complexity, which is better than the state-of-the art ones in many cases of interest. We also study the output-sensitive complexity, which is close to the output size, thereby showing that our algorithm is efficient. To confirm this, we perform experiments on link streams used in the state of the art, and on massive link streams, up to 100 million links. In all cases our algorithm is faster, mostly by a factor of at least 10 and up to a factor of $10^4$. Moreover, it scales to massive link streams for which the existing algorithms are not able to provide the solution.</description>
