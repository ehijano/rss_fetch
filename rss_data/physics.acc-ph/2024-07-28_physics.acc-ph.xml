      <title>Planar channeling of 855 MeV electrons in a boron-doped (110) diamond undulator -- a case study</title>

Abstract: A 4-period diamond undulator with a thickness of 20 $\mu$m was produced with the method of Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD), applying boron doping, on a straight diamond crystal with an effective thickness of 165.5 $\mu$m. A planar (110) channeling experiment was performed with the 855 MeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI accelerator facility to observe the expected undulator peak. The search was guided by simulation calculations on a personal computer. The code is based on the continuum potential picture, and a classical electrodynamic expression which involves explicitly the acceleration of the particle. As a result, an unexpected optimal observation angle was figured out, for which the undulator peak is strongest and the channeling radiation from the backing crystal being significantly suppressed. However, an undulator peak was not observed. Implications for the prepared undulator structure are discussed. All calculations were done assuming a scatter distribution as for amorphous matter. Since this approach is questionable for thin crystal plates, the scatter distribution was measured and simulated for a 50 $\sqrt{2}~\mu$m thick diamond crystal in (110) orientation. At tilted injection of the beam a clear asymmetry was observed which resembles partial beam deflection. We interpret this phenomenon heuristically as re-channeling, and the observed reduction of the width of the scatter distribution by a factor of 0.69 as coherent scattering suppression.</description>
