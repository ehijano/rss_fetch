      <title>Three Myths in Complexity Science and How to Resolve Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From bird flocking to neural dynamics, complex systems generate fascinating structures and correlations. Often, seemingly simple dynamics lead to intricate emergent properties. Despite their visceral appeal, defining complex systems lacks universal agreement. In this paper, I will debunk three prevalent myths in complex systems and propose resolutions. This work contributes by offering a contemporary interpretation of complex systems, presenting essential definitions that benefit complexity scientists.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Quantum Mechanical Statistics: Some Insights from the Research on Human Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identical systems, or entities, are indistinguishable in quantum mechanics (QM), and the symmetrization postulate rules the possible statistical distributions of a large number of identical quantum entities. However, a thorough analysis on the historical development of QM attributes the origin of quantum statistics, in particular, Bose-Einstein statistics, to a lack of statistical independence of the micro-states of identical quantum entities. We have recently identified Bose-Einstein statistics in the combination of words in large texts, as a consequence of the entanglement created by the meaning carried by words when they combine in human language. Relying on this investigation, we put forward the hypothesis that entanglement, hence the lack of statistical independence, is due to a mechanism of contextual updating, which provides deeper reasons for the appearance of Bose-Einstein statistics in human language. However, this investigation also contributes to a better understanding of the origin of quantum mechanical statistics in physics. Finally, we provide new insights into the intrinsically random behaviour of microscopic entities that is generally assumed within classical statistical mechanics.</description>
