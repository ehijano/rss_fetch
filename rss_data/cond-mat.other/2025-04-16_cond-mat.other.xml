      <title>Dynamical electronic correlation and chiral magnetism in van der Waals magnet Fe4GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the quasi-2D van der Waals magnetic systems, Fe4GeTe2 imprints a profound impact due to its near-room temperature ferromagnetic behaviour and the complex magnetothermal phase diagram exhibiting multiple phase transformations, as observed from magnetization and magnetotransport measurements. A complete analysis of these phase transformations in the light of electronic correlation and its impact on the underlying magnetic interactions remain unattended in the existing literature. Using first-principles methodologies, incorporating the dynamical nature of electron correlation, we have analysed the interplay of the direction of magnetization in the easy-plane and easy-axis manner with the underlying crystal symmetry, which reveals the opening of a pseudogap feature beyond the spin-reorientation transition (SRT) temperature. The impact of dynamical correlation on the calculated magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray absorption spectrum of the L-edge of the Fe atoms compared well with the existing experimental observations. The calculated intersite Heisenberg exchange interactions display a complicated nature, depending upon the pairwise interactions among the two inequivalent Fe sites, indicating a RKKY-like behaviour of the magnetic interactions. We noted the existence of significant anisotropic and antisymmetric exchanges interactions, resulting into a chirality in the magnetic behaviour of the system. Subsequent investigation of the dynamical aspects of magnetism in Fe4GeTe2 and the respective magnetothermal phase diagram reveal that the dynamical nature of spins and the decoupling of the magnetic properties for both sites of Fe is crucial to explain all the experimentally observed phase transformations.</description>

      <title>Bloch phonon-polaritons with anomalous dispersion in polaritonic Fourier crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently suggested concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal (PFC) is based on a harmonically-corrugated mirror substrate for a thin pristine polaritonic crystal layer. The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.</description>

      <title>Pressure-tuned spin chains in brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using high-pressure single-crystal x-ray diffraction combined with thermodynamic measurements and density-functional calculations, we uncover the microscopic magnetic model of the mineral brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$, and its evolution upon compression. The formation of antiferromagnetic spin chains with the effective intrachain coupling of $J\simeq 100$\,K is attributed to the occurrence of longer Cu--Cu distances and larger Cu--O--Cu bond angles between the structural chains within the layers of the brochantite structure. These zigzag spin chains are additionally stabilized by ferromagnetic couplings $J_2$ between second neighbors and moderately frustrated by several antiferromagnetic couplings that manifest themselves in the reduced N\'eel temperature of the material. Pressure tuning of the brochantite structure keeps its monoclinic symmetry unchanged and leads to the growth of antiferromagnetic $J$ with the rate of 3.2\,K/GPa, although this trend is primarily caused by the enhanced ferromagnetic couplings $J_2$. Our results show that the nature of magnetic couplings in brochantite and in other layered Cu$^{2+}$ minerals is controlled by the size of the lattice translation along their structural chains and by the extent of the layer buckling.</description>
