      <title>Density and geometry of excitations in supercooled liquids up to the activation energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm to uncover the activated particle rearrangements, or excitations, regulating structural relaxation in glasses at much higher energies than previously achieved. We use it to investigate the density and geometric properties of excitations in a model system. We find that the density of excitations behaves as a shifted power-law, and confirm that this shift accounts for the increase in the activation energy controlling the relaxation dynamics. Remarkably, we find that excitations comprise a core whose properties, including the displacement of the particle moving the most, scale as a power-law of their activation energy and do not depend on temperature. Excitations also present an outer deformation field that depends on the material stability and, hence, on temperature. Our analysis suggests that while excitations suppress the transition of dynamical arrest predicted by mean-field theories, they are strongly influenced by it.</description>

      <title>Scaling of phase count in multicomponent liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixtures with many components can segregate into coexisting phases, e.g., in biological cells and synthetic materials such as metallic glass. The interactions between components dictate what phases form in equilibrium, but quantifying this relationship has proven difficult. We derive scaling relations for the number of coexisting phases in multicomponent liquids with random interactions and compositions, which we verify numerically. Our results indicate that interactions only need to increase logarithmically with the number of components for the liquid to segregate into many phases. In contrast, a stability analysis of the homogeneous state predicts a power-law scaling. This discrepancy implies an enormous parameter regime where the number of coexisting phases exceeds the number of unstable modes, generalizing the nucleation and growth regime of binary mixtures to many components.</description>

      <title>Partially bonded crystals: a pathway to porosity and polymorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, experimental and theoretical investigations have shown that anisotropic colloids can self-organise into ordered porous monolayers, where the interplay of localised bonding sites, so called patches, with the particle's shape is responsible for driving the systems away from close-packing and towards porosity. Until now it has been assumed that patchy particles have to be fully bonded with their neighbouring particles for crystals to form, and that, if full bonding cannot be achieved due to the choice of patch placement, disordered assemblies will form instead. In contrast, we show that by deliberately displacing the patches such that full bonding is disfavored, a different route to porous crystalline monolayers emerges, where geometric frustration and partial bonding are pivotal in the structure formation process. The resulting dangling bonds lead to the emergence of effectively chiral units which then act as building blocks for energetically equivalent crystal polymorphs.</description>

      <title>Chirotactic response of microswimmers in fluids with odd viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd viscosity is a property of chiral active fluids with broken time-reversal and parity symmetries. We show that the flow of such a fluid around a rotating axisymmetric body is exactly solvable and use this solution to determine the orientational dynamics of surface-driven microswimmers. Swimmers with a force-dipole moment exhibit precession around the axis of the odd viscosity. In addition, pushers show bimodal chirotaxis, i.e., alignment parallel or antiparallel to the axis, while pullers orbit in a plane perpendicular to it. A chiral swimmer that itself has a broken parity symmetry can exhibit unimodal chirotaxis and always align in the same direction.</description>

      <title>Graph topological transformations in space-filling cell aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell rearrangements are fundamental mechanisms driving large-scale deformations of living tissues. In three-dimensional (3D) space-filling cell aggregates, cells rearrange through local topological transitions of the network of cell-cell interfaces, which is most conveniently described by the vertex model. Since these transitions are not yet mathematically properly formulated, the 3D vertex model is generally difficult to implement. The few existing implementations rely on highly customized and complex software-engineering solutions, which cannot be transparently delineated and are thus mostly non-reproducible. To solve this outstanding problem, we propose a reformulation of the vertex model. Our approach, called Graph Vertex Model (GVM), is based on storing the topology of the cell network into a knowledge graph with a particular data structure that allows performing cell-rearrangement events by simple graph transformations. Importantly, when these same transformations are applied to a two-dimensional (2D) polygonal cell aggregate, they reduce to a well-known T1 transition, thereby generalizing cell-rearrangements in 2D and 3D space-filling packings. This result suggests that the GVM's graph data structure may be the most natural representation of cell aggregates and tissues. We also develop a Python package that implements GVM, relying on a graph-database-management framework Neo4j. We use this package to characterize an order-disorder transition in 3D cell aggregates, driven by active noise and we find aggregates undergoing efficient ordering close to the transition point. In all, our work showcases knowledge graphs as particularly suitable data models for structured storage, analysis, and manipulation of tissue data.</description>

      <title>Force renormalization for probes immersed in an active bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Langevin equations or generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) are popular models for describing the motion of a particle in a fluid medium in an effective manner. Here we examine particles immersed in an inherently nonequilibrium fluid, i.e., an active bath, which are subject to an external force. Specifically, we consider two types of forces that are highly relevant for microrheological studies: A harmonic, trapping force and a constant, "drag" force. We study such systems by molecular simulations and use the simulation data to derive an effective GLE description. We find that, in an active bath, the external force in the GLE is not equal to the physical external force, but rather a renormalized external force, which can be significantly smaller. The effect cannot be attributed to the mere temperature renormalization, which is also observed.</description>

      <title>Mass-based separation of active Brownian particles in an asymmetric channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inertial effects should be considered for micro- and nano-swimmers moving in a low-density medium confined by irregular structures that create entropic barriers, where viscous effects are no longer paramount. Here, we present a separation mechanism of self-propelled particles in a two-dimensional asymmetric channel, which leads to the drift of particles of different masses in opposite directions. In particular, this mechanism is based on the combined action of the spatial asymmetry of the channel structure, the temporal asymmetry inherent in particles dynamics, and an external static force. This work is relevant for potential applications that can be found in the development of lab-on-a-chip devices and artificial channels for separating particles of different masses.</description>

      <title>Connection between partial pressure, volatility, and the Soret effect elucidated using simulations of non-ideal supercritical fluid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on recent simulation work, it is demonstrated using molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of two-component fluid mixtures that the chemical contribution to the Soret effect in two-component non-ideal fluid mixtures arises due to differences in how the partial pressures of the components respond to temperature and density gradients. Further insight is obtained by reviewing the connection between activity and deviations from Raoult's law in the measurement of the vapor pressure of a liquid mixture. A new parameter $\gamma_{s}^{S}$, defined in a manner similar to the activity coefficient, is used to characterize differences deviations from ``ideal'' behavior. It is then shown that the difference $\gamma_{2}^{S}-\gamma_{1}^{S}$ is predictive of the sign of the Soret coefficient and is correlated to its magnitude. We hence connect the Soret effect to the relative volatility of the components of a fluid mixture, with the more volatile component enriched in the low-density, high-temperature region, and the less volatile component enriched in the high-density, low-temperature region. Because $\gamma_{s}^{S}$ is closely connected to the activity coefficient, this suggests the possibility that measurement of partial vapor pressures might be used to indirectly determine the Soret coefficient. It is proposed that the insight obtained here is quite general and should be applicable to a wide range of materials systems. An attempt is made to understand how these results might apply to other materials systems including interstitials in solids and multicomponent solids with interdiffusion occurring via a vacancy mechanism.</description>

      <title>Variational Umbrella Seeding for Calculating Nucleation Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Variational Umbrella Seeding, a novel technique for computing nucleation barriers. This new method, a refinement of the original seeding approach, is far less sensitive to the choice of order parameter for measuring the size of a nucleus. Consequently, it surpasses seeding in accuracy, and Umbrella Sampling in computational speed. We test the method extensively and demonstrate excellent accuracy for crystal nucleation of nearly hard spheres and of two distinct models of water: mW and TIP4P/ICE. This method can easily be extended to calculate nucleation barriers for homogeneous melting, condensation, and cavitation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Poisson effect in affine semiflexible polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stretching an elastic material along one axis typically induces contraction along the transverse axes, a phenomenon known as the Poisson effect. From these strains, one can compute the specific volume, which generally either increases or, in the incompressible limit, remains constant as the material is stretched. However, in networks of semiflexible or stiff polymers, which are typically highly compressible yet stiffen significantly when stretched, one instead sees a significant reduction in specific volume under finite strains. This volume reduction is accompanied by increasing alignment of filaments along the strain axis and a nonlinear elastic response, with stiffening of the apparent Young's modulus. For semiflexible networks, in which entropic bending elasticity governs the linear elastic regime, the nonlinear Poisson effect is caused by the nonlinear force-extension relationship of the constituent filaments, which produces a highly asymmetric response of the constituent polymers to stretching and compression. The details of this relationship depend on the geometric and elastic properties of the underlying filaments, which can vary greatly in experimental systems. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the nonlinear Poisson effect in an affine network model and explore the influence of filament properties on essential features of the macroscopic response, including strain-driven alignment and volume reduction.</description>

      <title>Capillary-Assisted Printing of Droplets at a Solid-Like Liquid-Liquid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Capillary forces guide the motion of biomolecular condensates, water-borne insects, and breakfast cereal. These surface-mediated interactions can be harnessed to build units into materials with exotic properties deriving from mesoscale structure. Droplets are promising building blocks for these materials, finding applications in tissue engineering, adaptive optics, and structural colour. However, the instability of water droplets at many liquid-liquid interfaces hampers the use of capillarity for the assembly of droplet-based materials. Here, we use nanoparticle surfactants to form solid-like oil-water interfaces at which aqueous droplets sit for extended periods. We find that microlitre-sized droplets at these interfaces attract each other over millimetric scales. We rationalize this interaction with a modified theory of capillarity. Applying printing methods allows us to finely control initial droplet positions, from which they self-assemble into cellular materials. Finally, by functionalising the interface with gold nanoparticles, we use plasmon-assisted optofluidics to manipulate these droplet-based materials with temperature gradients.</description>
