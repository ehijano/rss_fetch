      <title>Breaking the Bottlenecks: Scalable Diffusion Models for 3D Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models for molecular design, capable of capturing complex structural distributions and achieving high fidelity in 3D molecule generation. However, their widespread use remains constrained by long sampling trajectories, stochastic variance in the reverse process, and limited structural awareness in denoising dynamics. The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance. Empirically, we demonstrate that RTK-guided deterministic denoising achieves faster convergence and higher structural fidelity than stochastic diffusion models, while preserving chemical validity across GEOM-DRUGS dataset. Code, models, and datasets are publicly available in our project repository.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric estimation of GLMs with interval-censored covariates via an augmented Turnbull estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interval-censored covariates are frequently encountered in biomedical studies, particularly in time-to-event data or when measurements are subject to detection or quantification limits. Yet, the estimation of regression models with interval-censored covariates remains methodologically underdeveloped. In this article, we address the estimation of generalized linear models when one covariate is subject to interval censoring. We propose a likelihood-based approach, GELc, that builds upon an augmented version of Turnbull's nonparametric estimator for interval-censored data. We prove that the GELc estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal under mild regularity conditions, with available standard errors. Simulation studies demonstrate favorable finite-sample performance of the estimator and satisfactory coverage of the confidence intervals. Finally, we illustrate the method using two real-world applications: the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 359 and an observational nutrition study on circulating carotenoids. The proposed methodology is available as an R package at github.com/atoloba/ICenCov.</description>

      <title>Geometric Stability: The Missing Axis of Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysis of learned representations has a blind spot: it focuses on $similarity$, measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce $geometric$ $stability$, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present $Shesha$, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($\rho \approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($\rho = 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling. By quantifying $how$ $reliably$ systems maintain structure, geometric stability provides a necessary complement to similarity for auditing representations across biological and computational systems.</description>

      <title>SGAC: A Graph Neural Network Framework for Imbalanced and Structure-Aware AMP Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classifying Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) from the vast collection of peptides derived from metagenomic sequencing offers a promising avenue for combating antibiotic resistance. However, most existing AMP classification methods rely primarily on sequence-based representations and fail to capture the spatial structural information critical for accurate identification. Although recent graph-based approaches attempt to incorporate structural information, they typically construct residue- or atom-level graphs that introduce redundant atomic details and increase structural complexity. Furthermore, the class imbalance between the small number of known AMPs and the abundant non-AMPs significantly hinders predictive performance. To address these challenges, we employ lightweight OmegaFold to predict the three-dimensional structures of peptides and construct peptide graphs using C {\alpha} atoms to capture their backbone geometry and spatial topology. Building on this representation, we propose the Spatial GNN-based AMP Classifier (SGAC), a novel framework that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract structural features and generate discriminative graph representations. To handle class imbalance, SGAC incorporates Weight-enhanced Contrastive Learning to cluster structurally similar peptides and separate dissimilar ones through adaptive weighting, and applies Weight-enhanced Pseudo-label Distillation to generate high-confidence pseudo labels for unlabeled samples, achieving balanced and consistent representation learning. Experiments on publicly available AMP and non-AMP datasets demonstrate that SGAC significantly achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>A Hypothesis-First Framework for Mechanistic Modeling in Neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turning rich neuroimaging data into mechanistic insight remains challenging. Statistical models capture associations but remain largely agnostic to underlying mechanisms. Biophysical models embody candidate mechanisms but remain difficult to deploy without specialized expertise. Here, we present a hypothesis-first framework recasting model specifications as testable mechanistic hypotheses and streamlines the procedure for rejecting inappropriate hypotheses before moving to typical analyses. The key innovation is an expectation of model behavior under feature generalization constraints: we compute the model's expected $Y$ output across the parameter space based on the likelihood for a broader/distinct feature $Z$. Mirror statistical models are derived from these expected outputs and compared to the empirical ones with standard statistics. In synthetic experiments, our framework rejected mis-specified hypotheses and penalized unnecessary degrees of freedom while retaining valid hypotheses. These results demonstrate a practical hypothesis-driven approach for using mechanistic models in neuroimaging without requiring advanced training, complementing traditional analyses.</description>

      <title>geohabnet: An R package for mapping habitat connectivity for biosecurity and conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mapping habitat suitability, based on factors like host availability and environmental suitability, is a common approach to determining which locations are important for the spread of a species. Mapping habitat connectivity takes geographic analyses a step further, evaluating the potential roles of locations in biological invasions, pandemics, or species conservation. Locations with high habitat suitability may play a minor role in species spread if they are geographically isolated. Yet, a location with lower habitat suitability may play a major role in a species' spread if it acts as a bridge between regions that would otherwise be physically fragmented.
  Here we introduce the geohabnet R package, which evaluates the potential importance of locations for the spread of species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet incorporates key factors such as dispersal probabilities and habitat suitability in a network framework, for better understanding habitat connectivity for host-dependent species, such as pathogens, arthropod pests, or pollinators.
  geohabnet uses publicly available or user-provided datasets, six network centrality metrics, and a user-selected geographic scale. We provide examples using geohabnet for surveillance prioritization of emerging plant pests in Africa and the Americas. These examples illustrate how users can apply geohabnet for their species of interest and generate maps of the estimated importance of geographic locations for species spread.
  geohabnet provides a quick, open-source, and reproducible baseline to quantify a species' habitat connectivity across a wide range of geographic scales and evaluates potential scenarios for the expansion of a species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet supports biosecurity programs, invasion science, and conservation biology when prioritizing management efforts for transboundary pathogens, pests, or endangered species.</description>
