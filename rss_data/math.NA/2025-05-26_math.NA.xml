      <title>Locally Adaptive Non-Hydrostatic Shallow Water Extension for Moving Bottom-Generated Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a locally adaptive non-hydrostatic model and apply it to wave propagation generated by a moving bottom. This model is based on the non-hydrostatic extension of the shallow water equations (SWE) with a quadratic pressure relation, which is suitable for weakly dispersive waves. The approximation is mathematically equivalent to the Green-Naghdi equations. Applied globally, the extension requires solving an elliptic system of equations in the whole domain at each time step. Therefore, we develop an adaptive model that reduces the application area of the extension and by that the computational time. The elliptic problem is only solved in the area where the dispersive effect might play a crucial role. To define the non-hydrostatic area, we investigate several potential criteria based on the hydrostatic SWE solution. We validate and illustrate how our adaptive model works by first applying it to simulate a simple propagating solitary wave, where exact solutions are known. Following that, we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach in more complicated cases involving moving bottom-generated waves, where measured laboratory data serve as reference solutions. The adaptive model yields similar accuracy as the global application of the non-hydrostatic extension while reducing the computational time by more than 50%.</description>

      <title>A brief review of the Deep BSDE method for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) pose significant challenges for numerical computation due to the curse of dimensionality, which limits the applicability of traditional mesh-based methods. Since 2017, the Deep BSDE method has introduced deep learning techniques that enable the effective solution of nonlinear PDEs in very high dimensions. This innovation has sparked considerable interest in using neural networks for high-dimensional PDEs, making it an active area of research. In this short review, we briefly sketch the Deep BSDE method, its subsequent developments, and future directions for the field.</description>

      <title>Thermal quasi-geostrophic model on the sphere: derivation and structure-preserving simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the global model of thermal quasi-geostrophy on the sphere via asymptotic expansion of the thermal rotating shallow water equations. The model does not rely on the asymptotic expansion of the Coriolis force and extends the quasi-geostrophic model on the sphere by including an additional transported buoyancy field acting as a source term for the potential vorticity. We give its Hamiltonian description in terms of semidirect product Lie--Poisson brackets. The Hamiltonian formulation reveals the existence of an infinite number of conservation laws, Casimirs, parameterized by two arbitrary smooth functions. A structure-preserving discretization is provided based on Zeitlin's self-consistent matrix approximation for hydrodynamics. A Casimir-preserving time integrator is employed to numerically fully preserve the resulting finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson structure. Simulations reveal the formation of vorticity and buoyancy fronts, and large-scale structures in the buoyancy dynamics induced by the buoyancy-bathymetry interaction.</description>

      <title>Fast and Flexible Quantum-Inspired Differential Equation Solvers with Data Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational mathematics. Traditional numerical methods, while effective in low-dimensional settings or on coarse grids, often struggle to deliver the precision required in practical applications. Recent machine learning-based approaches offer flexibility but frequently fall short in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in industrial contexts. In this work, we explore a quantum-inspired method based on quantized tensor trains (QTT), enabling efficient and accurate solutions to PDEs in a variety of challenging scenarios. Through several representative examples, we demonstrate that the QTT approach can achieve logarithmic scaling in both memory and computational cost for linear and nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, we introduce a novel technique for data-driven learning within the quantum-inspired framework, combining the adaptability of neural networks with enhanced accuracy and reduced training time.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium-distribution-function based mesoscopic finite-difference methods for partial differential equations: Modeling and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, based on the idea of direct modeling with equilibrium distribution functions (EDFs) we develop a general framework of mesoscopic numerical method (MesoNM) for macroscopic partial differential equations (PDEs), including but not limited to nonlinear convection-diffusion equation (NCDE) and the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs). Different from the mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann method, this kind of MesoNM is an EDF-based mesoscopic finite-difference (MesoFD) method, and through taking the moments of MesoFD scheme its macroscopic version, called MMFD method, can be derived directly. Both MesoFD scheme and MMFD schemes are muti-level FD methods, MesoFD scheme being mesoscopic, and MMFD scheme being its macroscopic form which has the form of the central FD scheme. They are unified FD schemes for PDEs and can be implicit or explicit forms as needed. The macroscopic moment equations (MEs) can be derived from the MesoFD or MMFD scheme through the Taylor expansion method, and the common PDEs can be recovered from the MEs by using direct Taylor expansion method. Moreover, the stability of MMFD scheme is analyzed for linear CDE with anisotropic diffusion, and the stability conditions of a two-level explicit MMFD scheme and a two-level $\theta$-MMFD scheme (hybrid explicit and implicit MMFD scheme) are obtained, respectively. Finally, we note that some existing lattice Boltzmann (LB) based macroscopic FD models for the NSEs and NCDE are the special cases of present MMFD, which can be considered as a unified framework of FD schemes for PDEs, from this point of view.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive-rank Approach with Greedy Sampling for Multi-scale BGK Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive-rank method for simulating multi-scale BGK equations, based on a greedy sampling strategy. The method adaptively selects important rows and columns of the solution matrix and updates them using a local semi-Lagrangian solver. An adaptive cross approximation then reconstructs the full solution matrix. This extends our prior semi-Lagrangian adaptive-rank framework, developed for the Vlasov-Poisson system, to nonlinear collisional kinetic equations. Unlike step-and-truncate low-rank integrators, our greedy sampling approach avoids explicit low-rank decompositions of nonlinear terms, such as the local Maxwellian in the BGK operator. To ensure conservation, we introduce a locally macroscopic conservative correction that implicitly couples the kinetic and macroscopic systems, enforcing mass, momentum, and energy conservation. Through asymptotic analysis, we show that this correction preserves the full-grid scheme's asymptotic behavior, and that the proposed method is conditionally asymptotic-preserving in the low-rank setting. A key advantage of our approach is its use of a local semi-Lagrangian solver, which allows large time steps. This flexibility is retained in the macroscopic solver using high-order stiffly accurate diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta methods. The resulting nonlinear systems are solved efficiently using a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method, avoiding the need for preconditioning at modest CFL numbers. Each nonlinear iteration provides a self-consistent correction to a provisional kinetic solution, which serves as a dynamic closure for the macroscopic model. Numerical results demonstrate the method's accuracy in capturing shocks and its robustness across mixed-regime problems with wide-ranging Knudsen numbers.</description>

      <title>Primitive variable regularization to derive novel Hyperbolic Shallow Water Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow Water Moment Equations are reduced-order models for free-surface flows that employ a vertical velocity expansion and derive additional so-called moment equations for the expansion coefficients. Among desirable analytical properties for such systems of equations are hyperbolicity, accuracy, correct momentum equation, and interpretable steady states. In this paper, we show analytically that existing models fail at different of these properties and we derive new models overcoming the disadvantages. This is made possible by performing a hyperbolic regularization not in the convective variables (as done in the existing models) but in the primitive variables. Via analytical transformations between the convective and primitive system, we can prove hyperbolicity and compute analytical steady states of the new models. Simulating a dam-break test case, we demonstrate the accuracy of the new models and show that it is essential for accuracy to preserve the momentum equation.</description>

      <title>Finite element spaces of double forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensor product of two differential forms of degree $p$ and $q$ is a multilinear form that is alternating in its first $p$ arguments and alternating in its last $q$ arguments. These forms, which are known as double forms or $(p,q)$-forms, play a central role in certain differential complexes that arise when studying partial differential equations. We construct piecewise polynomial finite element spaces for all of the natural subspaces of the space of $(p,q)$-forms, excluding one subspace which fails to admit a piecewise constant discretization. As special cases, our construction recovers known finite element spaces for symmetric matrices with tangential-tangential continuity (the Regge finite elements), symmetric matrices with normal-normal continuity, and trace-free matrices with normal-tangential continuity. It also gives rise to new spaces, like a finite element space for tensors possessing the symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Closure Strategies for Parametrized Reduced Order Models via Deep Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an equation-based parametric Reduced Order Model (ROM), whose accuracy is improved with data-driven terms added into the reduced equations. These additions have the aim of reintroducing contributions that in standard reduced-order approaches are not taken into account. In particular, in this work we focus on a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)-based formulation and our goal is to build a closure or correction model, aimed to re-introduce the contribution of the discarded modes. The approach has been investigated in previous works, and the goal of this manuscript is to extend the model to a parametric setting making use of machine learning procedures, and, in particular, of deep operator networks. More in detail, we model the closure terms through a deep operator network taking as input the reduced variables and the parameters of the problem. We tested the methods on three test cases with different behaviors: the periodic turbulent flow past a circular cylinder, the unsteady turbulent flow in a channel-driven cavity, and the geometrically-parametrized backstep flow. The performance of the machine learning-enhanced ROM is deeply studied in different modal regimes, and considerably improved the pressure and velocity accuracy with respect to the standard POD-Galerkin approach.</description>

      <title>The GMRES method for solving the large indefinite least squares problem via an accelerated preconditioner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, to solve the large indefinite least squares problem, we firstly transform its normal equation into a sparse block three-by-three linear systems, then use GMRES method with an accelerated preconditioner to solve it. The construction idea of the preconditioner comes from the thought of Luo et.al [Luo, WH., Gu, XM., Carpentieri, B., BIT 62, 1983-2004(2022)], and the advantage of this is that the preconditioner is closer to the coefficient matrix of the block three-by-three linear systems when the parameter approachs zero. Theoretically, the iteration method under the preconditioner satisfies the conditional convergence, and all eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are real numbers and gathered at point $(1,0)$ as parameter is close to $0$. In the end, numerical results reflect that the theoretical results is correct and the proposed preconditioner is effective by comparing with serval existing preconditioners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of equilibrium is a general tool to fill the gap between macroscopic and mesoscopic information, both within kinetic systems and kinetic schemes. This work explores the use of equilibria to devise numerical boundary conditions for multi-dimensional vectorial lattice Boltzmann schemes tackling systems of hyperbolic conservation laws. In the scalar case, we prove convergence for schemes with monotone relaxation to the weak entropy solution by Bardos, Leroux, and N{\'e}delec [Commun. Partial Differ. Equ., 4 (9), 1979], following the path by Crandall and Majda [Math. Comput., 34, 149 (1980)]. Numerical experiments are conducted both for scalar and vectorial problems, and demonstrate the effectiveness of equilibrium boundary conditions in capturing significant physical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, nonstandard multistep methods are observed. It is shown that under some (sufficient and necessary) conditions, these methods attain the same order as their standard counterparts - to prove this statement, a nonstandard version of Taylor's series is constructed. The preservation of some qualitative properties (boundedness, a weak form of monotonicity, and the linear combination of the components) is also proven for all step sizes. The methods are applied to a one-dimensional equation and a system of equations, in which the numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Stage-Parallel Implicit Runge--Kutta methods via low-rank matrix equation corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Runge--Kutta (IRK) methods are highly effective for solving stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) but can be computationally expensive for large-scale problems due to the need of solving coupled algebraic equations at each step. This study improves IRK efficiency by leveraging parallelism to decouple stage computations and reduce communication overhead, specifically we stably decouple a perturbed version of the stage system of equations and recover the exact solution by solving a Sylvester matrix equation with an explicitly known low-rank right-hand side. Two IRK families -- symmetric methods and collocation methods -- are analyzed, with extensions to nonlinear problems using a simplified Newton method. Implementation details, shared memory parallel code, and numerical examples, particularly for ODEs from spatially discretized PDEs, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed IRK technique.</description>

      <title>Computational Math with Neural Networks is Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that under some widely believed assumptions, there are no higher-order algorithms for basic tasks in computational mathematics such as: Computing integrals with neural network integrands, computing solutions of a Poisson equation with neural network source term, and computing the matrix-vector product with a neural network encoded matrix. We show that this is already true for very simple feed-forward networks with at least three hidden layers, bounded weights, bounded realization, and sparse connectivity, even if the algorithms are allowed to access the weights of the network. The fundamental idea behind these results is that it is already very hard to check whether a given neural network represents the zero function. The non-locality of the problems above allow us to reduce the approximation setting to deciding whether the input is zero or not. We demonstrate sharpness of our results by providing fast quadrature algorithms for one-layer networks and giving numerical evidence that quasi-Monte Carlo methods achieve the best possible order of convergence for quadrature with neural networks.</description>

      <title>Application of troubled-cells to finite volume methods -- an optimality study using a novel monotonicity parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt a troubled-cell indicator from discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to finite volume methods (FVM) with MUSCL reconstruction and using a novel monotonicity parameter show there is a trade-off between convergence and quality of the solution. Employing two dimensional compressible Euler equations for flows with oblique shocks, this trade-off is studied by varying the number of troubled-cells systematically. An oblique shock is characterized primarily by the upstream Mach number, the shock angle $\beta$, and the deflection angle $\theta$. We study these factors and their combinations and find that the degree of the shock misalignment with the grid determines the optimal number of troubled-cells. On each side of the shock, the optimal set consists of three troubled-cells for aligned shocks, and the troubled-cells identified by tracing the shock and four lines parallel to it, separated by the grid spacing, for nonaligned shocks. We show that the adapted troubled-cell indicator identifies a set of cells that is close to and contains the optimal set of cells for a threshold constant $K = 0.05$, and consequently, produces a solution close to that obtained by limiting everywhere, but with improved convergence.</description>

      <title>A sparse $hp$-finite element method for piecewise-smooth differential equations with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an efficient $hp$-finite element method for piecewise-smooth differential equations with periodic boundary conditions, using orthogonal polynomials defined on circular arcs. The operators derived from this basis are banded and achieve optimal complexity regardless of $h$ or $p$, both for building the discretisation and solving the resulting linear system in the case where the operator is symmetric positive definite. The basis serves as a useful alternative to other bases such as the Fourier or integrated Legendre bases, especially for problems with discontinuities. We relate the convergence properties of these bases to regions of analyticity in the complex plane, and further use several differential equation examples to demonstrate these properties. The basis spans the low order eigenfunctions of constant coefficient differential operators, thereby achieving better smoothness properties for time-evolution partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>A new class of finite difference methods: The zigzag schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of finite difference approximations, termed zigzag schemes, that employ a hybrid stencil that is neither symmetrical, nor fully one-sided. These zigzag schemes often enjoy more permissive stability constraints and see their coefficients vanish as the order tends to infinity. This property permits the formulation of higher order schemes. An explicit formula is given for both collocated and staggered grids for an arbitrary order and a closed-form expression for the infinite-order scheme is also provided. A linear stability analysis indicates that the zigzag scheme offer a broader range of conditional stability compared to the centred and upwind schemes, sometimes being the only stable scheme. Additionally, the asymmetrical structure of the stencil of zigzag schemes prevents some issues such as the formation of ``ghost solutions''. Moreover, implementing zigzag schemes is relatively easy when a code using classical finite differences is available, that is an important feature for well-tested legacy codes. Overall, zigzag schemes provide a compelling alternative for finite differences methods by enabling faster and more stable numerical simulations without sacrificing accuracy or ease of use.</description>

      <title>A novel parameter-free and locking-free enriched Galerkin method for linear elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel parameter-free and locking-free enriched Galerkin (EG) method for solving the linear elasticity problem in both two and three dimensions. Unlike existing locking-free EG methods, our method enriches the first-order continuous Galerkin (CG) space with piecewise constants along edges in two dimensions or faces in three dimensions. This enrichment acts as a correction to the normal component of the CG space, ensuring the locking-free property and delivering an oscillation-free stress approximation without requiring post-processing. Our theoretical analysis establishes the well-posedness of the method and derives optimal error estimates. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Inference of Substructured Reduced-Order Models for Dynamic Contact from Contact-free Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an operator-inference-based reduction approach for contact problems, leveraging snapshots from simulations without active contact. Contact problems are solved using adjoint methods, by switching to the dual system, where the corresponding Lagrange multipliers represent the contact pressure. The Craig-Bampton-like substructuring method is incorporated into the inference process to provide the reduced system matrices and the coupling of the contact and interior nodes. The maximum possible set of contact nodes must be known a priori. Characteristic properties of the inferred matrices, such as symmetry and positive definiteness, are enforced by appending additional constraints to the underlying least-squares problem. The resulting dual system, which forms a linear complementarity problem, is well-defined and can be effectively solved using methods such as Lemke's algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is validated on three-dimensional finite element models.</description>

      <title>An Eigenfunction Approach to Conversion of the Laplace Transform of Point Masses on the Real Line to the Fourier Domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in magnetic resonance relaxometry, we consider the following problem: Given samples of a function $t\mapsto \sum_{k=1}^K A_k\exp(-t\lambda_k)$, where $K\ge 2$ is an integer, $A_k\in\mathbb{R}$, $\lambda_k&gt;0$ for $k=1,\cdots, K$, determine $K$, $A_k$'s and $\lambda_k$'s. Unlike the case in which the $\lambda_k$'s are purely imaginary, this problem is notoriously ill-posed. Our goal is to show that this problem can be transformed into an equivalent one in which the $\lambda_k$'s are replaced by $i\lambda_k$. We show that this may be accomplished by approximation in terms of Hermite functions, and using the fact that these functions are eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform. We present a preliminary numerical exploration of parameter extraction from this formalism, including the effect of noise. We do not claim to have eliminated the inherent ill-posedness of the original problem, as reflected in the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Parameter choice strategies for regularized least squares approximation of noisy continuous functions on the unit circle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the incorporation of Tikhonov regularization into the least squares approximation scheme using trigonometric polynomials on the unit circle. This approach encompasses interpolation and hyperinterpolation as specific cases. With the aid of the de la Vall\'ee-Poussin approximation, we derive a uniform error bound and a concrete $L_2$ error bound. These error estimates demonstrate the effectiveness of Tikhonov regularization in the denoising process. A new regularity condition for the selection of regularization parameters is proposed. We investigate three strategies for choosing regularization parameters: Morozov's discrepancy principle, the L-curve, and generalized cross-validation, by explicitly combining these error bounds of the approximating trigonometric polynomial. We show that Morozov's discrepancy principle satisfies the proposed regularity condition, while the other two methods do not. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate how the aforementioned methodologies, when applied with well-chosen parameters, can significantly improve the quality of approximation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive hp-Polynomial Based Sparse Grid Collocation Algorithms for Piecewise Smooth Functions with Kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional interpolation problems appear in various applications of uncertainty quantification, stochastic optimization and machine learning. Such problems are computationally expensive and request the use of adaptive grid generation strategies like anisotropic sparse grids to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. However, it is well known that the standard dimension-adaptive sparse grid method converges very slowly or even fails in the case of non-smooth functions. For piecewise smooth functions with kinks, we construct two novel hp-adaptive sparse grid collocation algorithms that combine low-order basis functions with local support in parts of the domain with less regularity and variable-order basis functions elsewhere. Spatial refinement is realized by means of a hierarchical multivariate knot tree which allows the construction of localised hierarchical basis functions with varying order. Hierarchical surplus is used as an error indicator to automatically detect the non-smooth region and adaptively refine the collocation points there. The local polynomial degrees are optionally selected by a greedy approach or a kink detection procedure. Four numerical benchmark examples with different dimensions are discussed and comparison with locally linear, quadratic and highest degree basis functions are given to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Subspaces of Ensemble Kalman Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) methods are a family of iterative methods for solving weighted least-squares problems, especially those arising in scientific and engineering inverse problems in which unknown parameters or states are estimated from observed data by minimizing the weighted square norm of the data misfit. Implementation of EKI requires only evaluation of the forward model mapping the unknown to the data, and does not require derivatives or adjoints of the forward model. The methods therefore offer an attractive alternative to gradient-based optimization approaches in inverse problem settings where evaluating derivatives or adjoints of the forward model is computationally intractable. This work presents a new analysis of the behavior of both deterministic and stochastic versions of basic EKI for linear observation operators, resulting in a natural interpretation of EKI's convergence properties in terms of ``fundamental subspaces'' analogous to Strang's fundamental subspaces of linear algebra. Our analysis directly examines the discrete EKI iterations instead of their continuous-time limits considered in previous analyses, and provides spectral decompositions that define six fundamental subspaces of EKI spanning both observation and state spaces. This approach verifies convergence rates previously derived for continuous-time limits, and yields new results describing both deterministic and stochastic EKI convergence behavior with respect to the standard minimum-norm weighted least squares solution in terms of the fundamental subspaces. Numerical experiments illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Exploring low-rank structure for an inverse scattering problem with far-field data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel low-rank structure tailored for solving the inverse scattering problem. The particular low-rank structure is given by the generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions, computed stably and accurately via a Sturm-Liouville problem. We first process the far-field data to obtain a post-processed data set within a disk domain. Subsequently, the post-processed data are projected onto a low-rank space given by the low-rank structure. The unknown is approximately solved in this low-rank space, by dropping higher-order terms. The low-rank structure leads to an explicit stability estimate for unknown functions belonging to standard Sobolev spaces, and a Lipschitz stability estimate for unknowns belonging to a finite dimensional low-rank space. Various numerical experiments are conducted to validate its performance, encompassing assessments of resolution capability, robustness against randomly added noise and modeling errors, and demonstration of increasing stability.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Stiff Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) are an effective approach for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems arising from simulations and experiments. One of the major shortcomings of NODEs, especially when coupled with explicit integrators, is its long-term stability, which impedes their efficiency and robustness when encountering stiff problems. In this work we present a structure-preserving NODE approach that learns a transformation into a system with a linear and nonlinear split. It is then integrated using an exponential integrator, which is an explicit integrator with stability properties comparable to implicit methods. We demonstrate that our model has advantages in both learning and deployment over standard explicit or even implicit NODE methods. The long-time stability is further enhanced by the Hurwitz matrix decomposition that constrains the spectrum of the linear operator, therefore stabilizing the linearized dynamics. When combined with a Lipschitz-controlled neural network treatment for the nonlinear operator, we show the nonlinear dynamics of the NODE are provably stable near a fixed point in the sense of Lyapunov. For high-dimensional data, we further rely on an autoencoder performing dimensionality reduction and Higham's algorithm for the matrix-free application of the matrix exponential on a vector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NODE approach in various examples, including the Robertson chemical reaction problem and the Kuramoto-Sivashinky equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Gegenbauer-based fractional approximation (GBFA) method for high-precision approximation of the left Riemann-Liouville fractional integral (RLFI). By using precomputable fractional-order shifted Gegenbauer integration matrices (FSGIMs), the method achieves super-exponential convergence for smooth functions, delivering near machine-precision accuracy with minimal computational cost. Tunable shifted Gegenbauer (SG) parameters enable flexible optimization across diverse problems, while rigorous error analysis verifies a fast reduction in approximation error when appropriate parameter choices are applied. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the GBFA method outperforms MATLAB's integral, MATHEMATICA's NIntegrate, and existing techniques by up to two orders of magnitude in accuracy, with superior efficiency for varying fractional orders 0 &lt; {\alpha} &lt; 1. Its adaptability and precision make the GBFA method a transformative tool for fractional calculus, ideal for modeling complex systems with memory and non-local behavior, where understanding underlying structures often benefits from recognizing inherent symmetries or patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to approximate a continuously differentiable function $u:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by a composition of functions $f\circ g$ where $g:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, $m\leq d$, and $f : \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are built in a two stage procedure. For a fixed $g$, we build $f$ using classical regression methods, involving evaluations of $u$. Recent works proposed to build a nonlinear $g$ by minimizing a loss function $\mathcal{J}(g)$ derived from Poincar\'e inequalities on manifolds, involving evaluations of the gradient of $u$. A problem is that minimizing $\mathcal{J}$ may be a challenging task. Hence in this work, we introduce new convex surrogates to $\mathcal{J}$. Leveraging concentration inequalities, we provide sub-optimality results for a class of functions $g$, including polynomials, and a wide class of input probability measures. We investigate performances on different benchmarks for various training sample sizes. We show that our approach outperforms standard iterative methods for minimizing the training Poincar\'e inequality based loss, often resulting in better approximation errors, especially for rather small training sets and $m=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stable and accurate finite element methods are presented for Darcy flow in heterogeneous porous media with an interface of discontinuity of the hydraulic conductivity tensor. Accurate velocity fields are computed through global or local post-processing formulations that use previous approximations of the hydraulic potential. Stability is provided by combining Galerkin and Least Squares (GLS) residuals of the governing equations with an additional stabilization on the interface that incorporates the discontinuity on the tangential component of the velocity field in a strong sense. Numerical analysis is outlined and numerical results are presented to illustrate the good performance of the proposed methods. Convergence studies for a heterogeneous and anisotropic porous medium confirm the same orders of convergence predicted for homogeneous problem with smooth solutions, for both global and local post-processings.</description>

Abstract: We propose and analyze a posteriori error estimates for a control-constrained optimal control problem with bang-bang solutions. We consider a solution strategy based on the variational approach, where the control variable is not discretized; no Tikhonov regularization is made. We design, for the proposed scheme, a residual-type a posteriori error estimator that can be decomposed as the sum of two individual contributions related to the discretization of the state and adjoint equations. We explore reliability and efficiency properties of the aforementioned error estimator. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples.</description>

Model-based image reconstruction provides an alternative to conventional methods that rely on a measured system matrix, eliminating the need for laborious calibration measurements. Nevertheless, model-based approaches must account for the complexities of the imaging chain to maintain high image quality. A recently proposed direct reconstruction method leverages weighted Chebyshev polynomials in the frequency domain, removing the need for a simulated system matrix. However, the underlying model neglects key physical effects, such as nanoparticle anisotropy, leading to distortions in reconstructed images. To mitigate these artifacts, an adapted direct Chebyshev reconstruction (DCR) method incorporates a spatially variant deconvolution step, significantly improving reconstruction accuracy at the cost of increased computational demands. In this work, we evaluate the adapted DCR on six experimental phantoms, demonstrating enhanced reconstruction quality in real measurements and achieving image fidelity comparable to or exceeding that of simulated system matrix reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient approximation for the spatially variable deconvolution, reducing both runtime and memory consumption while maintaining accuracy. This method achieves computational complexity of O(N log N ), making it particularly beneficial for high-resolution and three-dimensional imaging. Our results highlight the potential of the adapted DCR approach for improving model-based MPI reconstruction in practical applications.</description>
