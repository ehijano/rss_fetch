      <title>LLM Meets the Sky: Heuristic Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Secure Heterogeneous UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work tackles the physical layer security (PLS) problem of maximizing the secrecy rate in heterogeneous UAV networks (HetUAVNs) under propulsion energy constraints. Unlike prior studies that assume uniform UAV capabilities or overlook energy-security trade-offs, we consider a realistic scenario where UAVs with diverse payloads and computation resources collaborate to serve ground terminals in the presence of eavesdroppers. To manage the complex coupling between UAV motion and communication, we propose a hierarchical optimization framework. The inner layer uses a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based S2DC algorithm combining penalty functions and difference-of-convex (d.c.) programming to solve the secrecy precoding problem with fixed UAV positions. The outer layer introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (LLM-HeMARL) for trajectory optimization. LLM-HeMARL efficiently incorporates expert heuristics policy generated by the LLM, enabling UAVs to learn energy-aware, security-driven trajectories without the inference overhead of real-time LLM calls. The simulation results show that our method outperforms existing baselines in secrecy rate and energy efficiency, with consistent robustness across varying UAV swarm sizes and random seeds.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form and Boundary Expressions for Task-Success Probability in Status-Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely and efficient dissemination of server status is critical in compute-first networking systems, where user tasks arrive dynamically and computing resources are limited and stochastic. In such systems, the access point plays a key role in forwarding tasks to a server based on its latest received server status. However, modeling the task-success probability suffering the factors of stochastic arrivals, limited server capacity, and bidirectional link delays. Therefore, we introduce a unified analytical framework that abstracts the AP forwarding rule as a single probability and models all network and waiting delays via their Laplace transforms. This approach yields a closed form expression for the end to end task success probability, together with upper and lower bounds that capture Erlang loss blocking, information staleness, and random uplink/downlink delays. We validate our results through simulations across a wide range of parameters, showing that theoretical predictions and bounds consistently enclose observed success rates. Our framework requires only two interchangeable inputs (the forwarding probability and the delay transforms), making it readily adaptable to alternative forwarding policies and delay distributions. Experiments demonstrate that our bounds are able to achieve accuracy within 0.01 (upper bound) and 0.016 (lower bound) of the empirical task success probability.</description>

      <title>Custody Transfer and Compressed Status Reporting for Bundle Protocol Version 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As space missions increase, there is a growing need to replace point-to-point communication with an efficient and reliable network-centric communication approach. Disruption/Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) with the Bundle Protocol (BP) has been selected as an interoperable network protocol in the LunaNet Interoperability Specification. It is also considered for future Earth Observation and Mars communication scenarios. In a DTN, the "bundle" -- the fundamental data unit of BP -- requires dedicated mechanisms to ensure reliability due to the challenges posed by intermittent connectivity and long delays. The previous version of BP, BPv6, contained a mechanism for reliable transfer between "custodial nodes" called "custody transfer". However, this approach has been removed from the core protocol specification for BPv7, which requires a corresponding BP reliability extension to be defined separately. This paper introduces a new custody transfer process for BPv7 (expected to be published by CCSDS as an experimental specification in 2025). The core features of this new custody transfer method for BPv7 are: (1) A strategy to efficiently identify sets of bundles by sequence numbering (2) A new Custody Transfer Extension Block and a corresponding administrative record, Compressed Custody Signal, to efficiently report on the acceptance or rejection of custody using sequence numbering (3) A new Compressed Reporting Extension Block requesting reporting on bundle processing steps using a corresponding administrative record with sequence numbering for efficiency. The paper will describe those concepts and their design, specification, and implementation in detail. These mechanisms have been prototyped in the ESA BP implementation and tested in Earth Observation and Lunar communication simulation scenarios. The results will be presented, as will an outlook on future work in the DTN reliable transfer domain.</description>

      <title>SoK: Securing the Final Frontier for Cybersecurity in Space-Based Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of modern technology, critical infrastructure, communications, and national security depend increasingly on space-based assets. These assets, along with associated assets like data relay systems and ground stations, are, therefore, in serious danger of cyberattacks. Strong security defenses are essential to ensure data integrity, maintain secure operations, and protect assets in space and on the ground against various threats. Previous research has found discrete vulnerabilities in space systems and suggested specific solutions to address them. Such research has yielded valuable insights, but lacks a thorough examination of space cyberattack vectors and a rigorous assessment of the efficacy of mitigation techniques. This study tackles this issue by taking a comprehensive approach to analyze the range of possible space cyber-attack vectors, which include ground, space, satellite, and satellite constellations. In order to address the particular threats, the study also assesses the efficacy of mitigation measures that are linked with space infrastructures and proposes a Risk Scoring Framework. Based on the analysis, this paper identifies potential research challenges for developing and testing cutting-edge technology solutions, encouraging robust cybersecurity measures needed in space.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Post-Quantum Cryptography in User Equipment in 5G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing threatens the security of classical public-key cryptographic systems, prompting the transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). While PQC has been analyzed in theory, its performance in practical wireless communication environments remains underexplored. This paper presents a detailed implementation and performance evaluation of NIST-selected PQC algorithms in user equipment (UE) to UE communications over 5G networks. Using a full 5G emulation stack (Open5GS and UERANSIM) and PQC-enabled TLS 1.3 via BoringSSL and liboqs, we examine key encapsulation mechanisms and digital signature schemes across realistic network conditions. We evaluate performance based on handshake latency, CPU and memory usage, bandwidth, and retransmission rates, under varying cryptographic configurations and client loads. Our findings show that ML-KEM with ML-DSA offers the best efficiency for latency-sensitive applications, while SPHINCS+ and HQC combinations incur higher computational and transmission overheads, making them unsuitable for security-critical but time-sensitive 5G scenarios.</description>

      <title>Active Attack Resilience in 5G: A New Take on Authentication and Key Agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As 5G networks expand into critical infrastructure, secure and efficient user authentication is more important than ever. The 5G-AKA protocol, standardized by 3GPP in TS 33.501, is central to authentication in current 5G deployments. It provides mutual authentication, user privacy, and key secrecy. However, despite its adoption, 5G-AKA has known limitations in both security and performance. While it focuses on protecting privacy against passive attackers, recent studies show its vulnerabilities to active attacks. It also relies on a sequence number mechanism to prevent replay attacks, requiring perfect synchronization between the device and the core network. This stateful design adds complexity, causes desynchronization, and incurs extra communication overhead. More critically, 5G-AKA lacks Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), exposing past communications if long-term keys are compromised-an increasing concern amid sophisticated threats. This paper proposes an enhanced authentication protocol that builds on 5G-AKA's design while addressing its shortcomings. First, we introduce a stateless version that removes sequence number reliance, reducing complexity while staying compatible with existing SIM cards and infrastructure. We then extend this design to add PFS with minimal cryptographic overhead. Both protocols are rigorously analyzed using ProVerif, confirming their compliance with all major security requirements, including resistance to passive and active attacks, as well as those defined by 3GPP and academic studies. We also prototype both protocols and evaluate their performance against 5G-AKA and 5G-AKA' (USENIX'21). Our results show the proposed protocols offer stronger security with only minor computational overhead, making them practical, future-ready solutions for 5G and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Quantum Network Prototype for Open Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of quantum networks has revolutionized domains such as communication, sensing, and cybersecurity. Despite this progress, current quantum network systems remain limited in scale, are highly application-specific (e.g., for quantum key distribution), and lack a clear road map for global expansion. These limitations are largely driven by a shortage of skilled professionals, limited accessibility to quantum infrastructure, and the high complexity and cost associated with building and operating quantum hardware. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an open-access software-based quantum network virtualization platform designed to facilitate scalable and remote interaction with quantum hardware. The system is built around a cloud application that virtualizes the core hardware components of a lab-scale quantum network testbed, including the time tagger and optical switch, enabling users to perform coincidence counts of the photon entanglements while ensuring fair resource allocation. The fairness is ensured by employing the Hungarian Algorithm to allocate nearly equal effective entanglement rates among users. We provide implementation details and performance analysis from the perspectives of hardware, software, and cloud platform, which demonstrates the functionality and efficiency of the developed prototype.</description>

      <title>Rethinking HSM and TPM Security in the Cloud: Real-World Attacks and Next-Gen Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As organizations rapidly migrate to the cloud, the security of cryptographic key management has become a growing concern. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), traditionally seen as the gold standard for securing encryption keys and digital trust, are increasingly challenged by cloud-native threats. Real-world breaches have exposed weaknesses in cloud deployments, including misconfigurations, API abuse, and privilege escalations, allowing attackers to access sensitive key material and bypass protections. These incidents reveal that while the hardware remains secure, the surrounding cloud ecosystem introduces systemic vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes notable security failures involving HSMs and TPMs, identifies common attack vectors, and questions longstanding assumptions about their effectiveness in distributed environments. We explore alternative approaches such as confidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key management. Our findings highlight that while HSMs and TPMs still play a role, modern cloud security requires more adaptive, layered architectures. By evaluating both current weaknesses and emerging models, this research equips cloud architects and security engineers with strategies to reinforce cryptographic trust in the evolving threat landscape.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic Agents: A Novel Paradigm for Trustworthy AGI-driven Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents are expected to play a vital role in the evolution of 6G networks, by empowering real-time decision-making related to management and service provisioning to end-users. This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach, where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers, and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy with a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of 82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%. Drawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the symbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven networks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even as LLMs advance.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Private Information Retrieval (SPIR) on Graph-Based Replicated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) on replicated databases modeled by a simple graph. In this model, each vertex corresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers if and only if there is an edge between them. We consider the setting where the server-side common randomness necessary to accomplish SPIR is also replicated at the servers according to the graph, and we call this as message-specific common randomness. In this setting, we establish a lower bound on the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum download rate, for general graphs, by proposing an achievable SPIR scheme. Next, we prove that, for any SPIR scheme to be feasible, the minimum size of message-specific randomness should be equal to the size of a message. Finally, by providing matching upper bounds, we derive the exact SPIR capacity for the class of path and regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for O-RAN Mobility Management: A Link Prediction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobility performance has been a key focus in cellular networks up to 5G. To enhance handover (HO) performance, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handover (CHO) and Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM) mechanisms in 5G. While these reactive HO strategies address the trade-off between HO failures (HOF) and ping-pong effects, they often result in inefficient radio resource utilization due to additional HO preparations. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a proactive HO framework for mobility management in O-RAN, leveraging user-cell link predictions to identify the optimal target cell for HO. We explore various categories of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for link prediction and analyze the complexity of applying them to the mobility management domain. Two GNN models are compared using a real-world dataset, with experimental results demonstrating their ability to capture the dynamic and graph-structured nature of cellular networks. Finally, we present key insights from our study and outline future steps to enable the integration of GNN-based link prediction for mobility management in O-RAN networks.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Ray Tracing-Based Wireless Channels Generation for Real-Time Network Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ray tracing (RT) simulation is a widely used approach to enable modeling wireless channels in applications such as network digital twins. However, the computational cost to execute ray tracing (RT) is proportional to factors such as the level of detail used in the adopted 3D scenario. This work proposes RT pre-processing algorithms that aim at simplifying the 3D scene without distorting the channel, by reducing the scenario area and/or simplifying object shapes in the scenario. It also proposes a post-processing method that augments a set of RT results to achieve an improved time resolution. These methods enable using RT in applications that use a detailed and photorealistic 3D scenario while generating consistent wireless channels over time. Our simulation results with different urban scenarios scales, in terms of area and object details, demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the simulation time by more than 50% without compromising the accuracy of the multipath RT parameters, such as angles of arrival and departure, delay, phase, and path gain.</description>

      <title>ORANSight-2.0: Foundational LLMs for O-RAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across critical domains such as healthcare, customer service, and business marketing, their integration into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) remains limited. This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative to develop specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 models spanning five open-source LLM frameworks -- Mistral, Qwen, Llama, Phi, and Gemma -- ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1B to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance in O-RAN-specific tasks. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents -- a Mistral-based Question Generator and a Qwen-based Answer Generator -- to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack.</description>
