      <title>Fairness-Aware Static and Dynamic Assortment Optimization: Optimal Selection with Balanced Market Share</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assortment optimization is a critical tool for online retailers aiming to maximize revenue. However, optimizing purely for revenue can lead to imbalanced sales across products, potentially causing supplier disengagement and reduced product diversity. To address these fairness concerns, we introduce a market share balancing constraint that limits the disparity in expected sales between any two offered products to a factor of a given parameter $\alpha$. We study both static and dynamic assortment optimization under the multinomial logit (MNL) model with this fairness constraint. In the static setting, the seller selects a distribution over assortments that satisfies the market share balancing constraint while maximizing expected revenue. We show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time, and we characterize the structure of the optimal solution: a product is included if and only if its revenue and preference weight exceed certain thresholds. We further extend our analysis to settings with additional feasibility constraints on the assortment and demonstrate that, given a $\beta$-approximation oracle for the constrained problem, we can construct a $\beta$-approximation algorithm under the fairness constraint. In the dynamic setting, each product has a finite initial inventory, and the seller implements a dynamic policy to maximize total expected revenue while respecting both inventory limits and the market share balancing constraint in expectation. We design a policy that is asymptotically optimal, with its approximation ratio converging to one as inventories grow large.</description>

      <title>Minimal balanced collections and their applications to core stability and other topics of game theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal balanced collections are a generalization of partitions of a finite set of n elements and have important applications in cooperative game theory and discrete mathematics. However, their number is not known beyond n = 4. In this paper we investigate the problem of generating minimal balanced collections and implement the Peleg algorithm, permitting to generate all minimal balanced collections till n = 7. Secondly, we provide practical algorithms to check many properties of coalitions and games, based on minimal balanced collections, in a way which is faster than linear programming-based methods. In particular, we construct an algorithm to check if the core of a cooperative game is a stable set in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern. The algorithm implements a theorem according to which the core is a stable set if and only if a certain nested balancedness condition is valid. The second level of this condition requires generalizing the notion of balanced collection to balanced sets.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Pricing in Energy Markets: Pay-as-Bid vs Pay-as-Clear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of energy markets is a subject of ongoing debate, particularly concerning the choice between the widely adopted Pay-as-Clear (PC) pricing mechanism and the alternative Pay-as-Bid (PB). These mechanisms determine how energy producers are compensated: under PC, all selected producers are paid the market-clearing price (i.e., the highest accepted bid), while under PB, each selected producer is paid their own submitted bid. The overarching objective is to meet the total demand for energy at minimal cost in the presence of strategic behavior. We present two key theoretical results. First, no mechanism can uniformly dominate PC or PB. This means that for any mechanism $\mathcal{M}$, there exists a market configuration and a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of PC (respectively for PB) that yields strictly lower total energy costs than under $\mathcal{M}$. Second, in terms of worst-case equilibrium outcomes, PB consistently outperforms PC: across all market instances, the highest possible equilibrium price under PB is strictly lower than that under PC. This suggests a structural robustness of PB to strategic manipulation. These theoretical insights are further supported by extensive simulations based on no-regret learning dynamics, which consistently yield lower average market prices in several energy market settings.</description>

      <title>An efficiency ordering of k-price auctions under complete information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $k$-price auctions in a complete information environment and characterize all pure-strategy Nash equilibrium outcomes. In a setting with $n$ agents having ordered valuations, we show that any agent, except those with the lowest $k-2$ valuations, can win in equilibrium. As a consequence, worst-case welfare increases monotonically as we go from $k=2$ (second-price auction) to $k=n$ (lowest-price auction), with the first-price auction achieving the highest worst-case welfare.</description>

      <title>A Directed Lazy Random Walk Model to Three-Way Dynamic Matching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel extension of dynamic matching theory by analyzing a three-way matching problem involving agents from three distinct populations, each with two possible types. Unlike traditional static or two-way dynamic models, our setting captures more complex team-formation environments where one agent from each of the three populations must be matched to form a valid team. We consider two preference structures: assortative or homophilic, where agents prefer to be matched with others of the same type, and dis-assortative or heterophilic, where diversity within the team is valued. Agents arrive sequentially and face a trade-off between matching immediately or waiting for a higher quality match in the future albeit with a waiting cost. We construct and analyze the corresponding transition probability matrices for each preference regime and demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of stationary distributions. Our results show that stable and efficient outcomes can arise in dynamic, multi-agent matching environments, offering a deeper understanding of how complex matching processes evolve over time and how they can be effectively managed.</description>

      <title>Aligned Textual Scoring Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scoring rules elicit probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent by scoring the prediction against a ground truth state. A scoring rule is proper if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the expected score. With the development of language models, Wu and Hartline (2024) proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical (i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with human preference while maintaining properness.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Pure Strategy Relevant Equilibria in Concurrent Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rational synthesis problems for concurrent games with $\omega$-regular objectives. Our model of rationality considers only pure strategy Nash equilibria that satisfy either a social welfare or Pareto optimality condition with respect to an $\omega$-regular objective for each agent. This extends earlier work on equilibria in concurrent games, without consideration about their quality. Our results show that the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying social welfare conditions can be computed as efficiently as the constrained Nash equilibrium existence problem. On the other hand, the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying the Pareto optimality condition possibly involves a higher upper bound, except in the case of B\"uchi and Muller games, for which all three problems are in the classes P and PSPACE-complete, respectively.</description>

      <title>Online Budget-Feasible Mechanism Design with Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Augmenting the input of algorithms with predictions is an algorithm design paradigm that suggests leveraging a (possibly erroneous) prediction to improve worst-case performance guarantees when the prediction is perfect (consistency), while also providing a performance guarantee when the prediction fails (robustness). Recently, Xu and Lu [2022] and Agrawal et al. [2024] proposed to consider settings with strategic agents under this framework. In this paper, we initiate the study of budget-feasible mechanism design with predictions. These mechanisms model a procurement auction scenario in which an auctioneer (buyer) with a strict budget constraint seeks to purchase goods or services from a set of strategic agents, so as to maximize her own valuation function. We focus on the online version of the problem where the arrival order of agents is random. We design mechanisms that are truthful, budget-feasible, and achieve a significantly improved competitive ratio for both monotone and non-monotone submodular valuation functions compared to their state-of-the-art counterparts without predictions. Our results assume access to a prediction for the value of the optimal solution to the offline problem. We complement our positive results by showing that for the offline version of the problem, access to predictions is mostly ineffective in improving approximation guarantees.</description>

Abstract: The independent chip model (ICM) forms a cornerstone of all modern poker tournament strategy. However, despite its prominence, the ICM's performance in the real world has not been sufficiently scrutinized, especially at a large scale. In this paper, we introduce our new dataset of poker tournaments, consisting of results of over ten thousand events. Then, using this dataset, we perform two experiments as part of a large-scale empirical validation of the ICM. First, we verify that the ICM performs more accurately than a baseline we propose. Second, we obtain empirical evidence of the ICM underestimating the performances of players with larger stacks while overestimating those who are short-stacked. Our contributions may be useful to future researchers developing new algorithms for estimating a player's value in poker tournaments.</description>

      <title>Horus: A Protocol for Trustless Delegation Under Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00631v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correctness is an emergent property of systems where exposing error is cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers, challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Two-sided Assortment Optimization: Revenue Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study adaptive two-sided assortment optimization for revenue maximization in choice-based matching platforms. The platform has two sides of agents, an initiating side, and a responding side. The decision-maker sequentially selects agents from the initiating side, shows each an assortment of agents from the responding side, and observes their choices. After processing all initiating agents, the responding agents are shown assortments and make their selections. A match occurs when two agents mutually select each other, generating pair-dependent revenue. Choices follow Multinomial Logit (MNL) models. This setting generalizes prior work focused on maximizing the number of matches under submodular demand assumptions, which do not hold in our revenue-maximization context. Our main contribution is the design of polynomial-time approximation algorithms with constant-factor guarantees. In particular, for general pairwise revenues, we develop a randomized algorithm that achieves a $(\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon)$-approximation in expectation for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. The algorithm is static and provides guarantees under various agent arrival settings, including fixed order, simultaneous processing, and adaptive selection. When revenues are uniform across all pairs involving any given responding-side agent, the guarantee improves to $(1 - \frac{1}{e} - \epsilon)$. In structural settings where responding-side agents share a common revenue-based ranking, we design a simpler adaptive deterministic algorithm achieving a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation. Our approach leverages novel linear programming relaxations, correlation gap arguments, and structural properties of the revenue functions.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent contract design with a budget</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a multi-agent contract design problem with moral hazard. In our model, each agent exerts costly effort towards an individual task at which it may either succeed or fail, and the principal, who wishes to encourage effort, has an exclusive-use budget that it can use to reward the agents. A motivating application is crowdsourcing for innovation, where a fixed budget is provided to a crowdsourcing platform to use for rewarding participants based on their submissions. Our main contribution is to introduce a novel class of contracts, which we call Luce contracts, and show that there is always a Luce contract that is optimal. A (generic) Luce contract assigns weights to the agents and distributes the entire budget among the successful agents in proportion to their weights. Furthermore, we characterize effort profiles that can be implemented by Luce contracts and show that Luce contracts offer a way to mitigate the uncertainty in total payments compared to alternative contracts-such as piece-rate or bonus-pool contracts-suggesting their desirability even in environments without budget constraints.</description>

      <title>An AI Theory of Mind Will Enhance Our Collective Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective intelligence plays a central role in many fields, from economics and evolutionary theory to neural networks and eusocial insects, and is also core to work on emergence and self-organisation in complex-systems theory. However, in human collective intelligence there is still much to understand about how specific psychological processes at the individual level give rise to self-organised structures at the social level. Psychological factors have so far played a minor role in collective-intelligence studies because the principles are often general and applicable to agents without sophisticated psychologies. We emphasise, with examples from other complex adaptive systems, the broad applicability of collective-intelligence principles, while noting that mechanisms and time scales differ markedly between cases. We review evidence that flexible collective intelligence in human social settings is improved by a particular cognitive tool: our Theory of Mind. We then hypothesise that AIs equipped with a theory of mind will enhance collective intelligence in ways similar to human contributions. To make this case, we step back from the algorithmic basis of AI psychology and consider the large-scale impact AI can have as agential actors in a 'social ecology' rather than as mere technological tools. We identify several key characteristics of psychologically mediated collective intelligence and show that the development of a Theory of Mind is crucial in distinguishing human social collective intelligence from more general forms. Finally, we illustrate how individuals, human or otherwise, integrate within a collective not by being genetically or algorithmically programmed, but by growing and adapting into the socio-cognitive niche they occupy. AI can likewise inhabit one or multiple such niches, facilitated by a Theory of Mind.</description>

      <title>Nested Removal of Strictly Dominated Strategies in Infinite Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two procedures for the iterated removal of strictly dominated strategies. In the nested procedure, a strategy of a player is removed only if it is dominated by an unremoved strategy. The universal procedure is more comprehensive for it allows the removal of strategies that are dominated by previously removed ones. Outside the class of finite games, the two procedures may lead to different outcomes in that the universal one is always order independent while the other is not. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the two procedures. The conditions we give are based on completely bounded subsets of strategy profiles, which are variations of the bounded mechanisms from the literature on full implementation. The two elimination procedures are also shown to be equivalent in quasisupermodular games as well as in games with compact strategy spaces and upper semicontinuous payoff functions. We show by example that order independence of the nested procedure is not sufficient for its being equivalent to the universal one.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that perfect hallucination control in large language models is mathematically impossible. No LLM inference mechanism can simultaneously achieve truthful response generation, semantic information conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is fundamental, arising from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself rather than engineering limitations. The proof spans three mathematical frameworks: auction theory, proper scoring theory for probabilistic predictions, and log-sum-exp analysis for transformer architectures. In each setting, we demonstrate that information aggregation creates unavoidable violations of conservation principles. The Jensen gap in transformer probability aggregation provides a direct measure of this impossibility. These results reframe hallucination from an engineering bug to an inevitable mathematical feature of distributed intelligence. There are fundamental trade-offs between truthfulness, knowledge utilization, and response completeness, providing principled foundations for managing rather than eliminating hallucination. This work reveals deep connections between neural network inference, philosophy of knowledge and reasoning, and classical results in game theory and information theory, opening new research directions for developing beneficial AI systems within mathematical constraints.</description>
