      <title>The nucleon-$\Delta$ elastic cross section in isospin-asymmetric nuclear medium with the inclusion of scalar-isovector $\delta$ meson field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production, dynamic evolution, and decay of $\Delta$ particles play a crucial role in understanding the properties of high baryon density nuclear matter in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions. In this work, the energy-, density-, and isospin-dependent nucleon-$\Delta$ elastic cross section ($\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$) is studied within the relativistic Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck framework, in which the $\delta$ meson field is further considered. The results show that the $\delta$ and $\rho$ meson related exchange terms have a nonnegligible contribution to the $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$ compared to only considering the $\rho$ meson exchange terms, although there is a significant cancellation on the cross section among these meson exchange terms. In addition, due to the different effects of the medium correction on the effective mass of neutrons, protons, and differently charged $\Delta$s, the individual $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$ exhibits an ordered isospin-asymmetry ($\alpha$) dependence, and $\sigma^{*}_{n\Delta}$ and $\sigma^{*}_{p\Delta}$ have opposite $\alpha$ dependencies. And the $\alpha$ dependence of the ratio $R(\alpha)=\sigma^{*}(\alpha)/\sigma^{*}(\alpha=0)$ for $n\Delta$ reaction channels follow $n\Delta^{++}&gt;n\Delta^{+}&gt;n\Delta^{0}&gt;n\Delta^{-}$, while for $p\Delta$ it is $p\Delta^{-}&gt;p\Delta^{0}&gt;p\Delta^{+}&gt;p\Delta^{++}$. Moreover, the results also indicate that the isospin effect on the $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$, which is dominantly caused by the isovector $\rho$ and $\delta$ meson fields, is still pronounced at densities up to 3 times normal nuclear density. Finally, a parametrization of the energy-, density-, and isospin-dependent $N\Delta$ elastic cross section is proposed based on the microscopic calculated results, and the in-medium $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$ in the energy range of $\sqrt{s}$=2.3$\sim$3.0 GeV can be well described.</description>

      <title>Salient features of charge-changing cross section and interaction cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To establish credibility for the use of Slater determinant harmonic oscillator (SDHO) density in predicting root-mean-square proton and neutron radii for Be, B, C, N, O, and F isotopes [Phys. Rev. C 110, 014623 (2024)], we, in this work, propose to study charge-changing and interaction cross sections for the said isotopes on 12C at a wider range of incident energies (200-1050 MeV/nucleon), involving different density distributions; the calculations also assess the importance of nuclear medium effects. Working within the framework of Glauber model, we involve two-parameter Fermi (2pF) and three-parameter Fermi (3pF) shapes of density distributions, and use the in-medium as well as free behavior of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) amplitude. The results provide enough ground in support of the matter radii of exotic isotopes obtained using SDHO densities.</description>

      <title>Neutrino nucleus Quasi-Elastic and resonant Neutral Current scatterings with Non-Standard Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As well known, the cross sections of the resonance and Quasi-Elastic (QE) scattering off nucleons depend on quantities known as form factors that describe the nucleon structure. There are alternative approaches to determine the values of these non-perturbative quantities, some of them relying on the Neutral Current (NC) scattering of neutrinos off nucleons. In the presence of NC Non-Standard Interactions (NSI), such derivations must be revisited. The aim of the present paper is to discuss how information on NSI can be extracted by combining alternative approaches for deriving the form factors. We discuss how the KamLAND atmospheric neutrino data with $E_\nu&lt;{\rm GeV}$ (used to determine the axial strange form factor $g_A^s$) can already constrain the axial NSI of $\nu_\tau$ with nucleons. We also argue that if the precision measurement of $\nu_\mu$ NC QE scattering establishes unexpectedly large vector strange form factor (e.g., $F_1^s(Q^2)\sim 0.01$), it will be an indication for nonzero NSI coupling with $u$ and $d$ quarks ($\epsilon_{\mu\mu}^{Au/d}\sim 0.01$). We study the QE and resonance scattering cross sections of $\nu_\tau$ and $\nu_e$ off Argon and show that if their axial NSI is of the order of (but of course below) the present bounds, the deviation of QE cross sections from the SM prediction will be sizable and distinct from the uncertainties induced by the form factors.</description>

      <title>Kernel methods for evolution of generalized parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) characterize the 3-dimensional structure of hadrons, combining information about their internal quark and gluon longitudinal momentum distributions and transverse position within the hadron. The dependence of GPDs on the factorization scale $Q^2$ allows one to connect hard exclusive processes involving GPDs at disparate energy and momentum scales, which is needed in global analyses of experimental data. In this work we explore how finite element methods can be used to construct fast and differentiable $Q^2$ evolution codes for GPDs in momentum space, which can be used in a machine learning framework. We show numerical benchmarks of the methods' accuracy, including a comparison to an existing evolution code from PARTONS/APFEL++, and provide a repository where the code can be accessed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the large-$N_c$ structure of the baryon-baryon potential derived in the framework of SU(3) chiral perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order including contact interactions as well as one-meson and two-meson exchange diagrams. Moreover, we assess the impact of SU(3) symmetry breaking from a large-$N_c$ perspective and show that the leading order results can successfully be applied to the hyperon-nucleon potential.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Hot QCD Matter 2024 -- Hard Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot and dense QCD matter, known as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), is explored through heavy-ion collision experiments at the LHC and RHIC. Jets and heavy flavors, produced from the initial hard scattering, are used as hard probes to study the properties of the QGP. Recent experimental observations on jet quenching and heavy-flavor suppression have strengthened our understanding, allowing for fine-tuning of theoretical models in hard probes. The second conference, HOT QCD Matter 2024, was organized to bring the community together for discussions on key topics in the field. This article comprises 15 sections, each addressing various aspects of hard probes in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, offering a snapshot of current experimental observations and theoretical advancements. The article begins with a discussion on memory effects in the quantum evolution of quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma, followed by an experimental review, new insights on jet quenching at RHIC and LHC, and concludes with a machine learning approach to heavy flavor production at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Gluon Unpolarized, Polarized, and Transversity GPDs from Lattice QCD: Lorentz-Covariant Parametrization (Part I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the matrix elements necessary to determine the chiral-even $H_g,~E_g,~\widetilde{H}_g,~\widetilde{E}_g$ and chiral-odd $H^T_g,~E^T_g, \widetilde{H}^T_g ,~\widetilde{E}^T_g$ gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in lattice QCD calculations. We present a method to achieve a Lorentz-covariant parameterization of the matrix elements in terms of a linearly independent basis of tensor structures. This parameterization is crucial for projecting lattice QCD matrix elements onto lightcone distributions. For the first time, we determine the corresponding components that project onto the linear combinations of invariant amplitudes, which reduce to the different gluon GPDs in the lightcone limit and enable their separation in a lattice QCD calculation for spin-$0$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadrons. Hence, this work lays the foundation for the numerical determination of the gluon GPDs from first-principle lattice QCD calculations, directly advancing our understanding of the mass and spin structures, and mechanical properties of the nucleon, as well as the physics underlying deeply virtual Compton scattering and deeply virtual meson production in a range of experimental processes.</description>

      <title>Leading-Twist Flavor Singlet Quark TMDs at Small-$x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the small-$x$ asymptotics of the flavor singlet, leading-twist quark Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). We apply the recently developed Light-Cone Operator Treatment to rewrite the TMD operator definitions at small $x$ in terms of polarized dipole amplitudes, present the small-$x$ evolution equations and their solutions in the large-$N_c$, linearized, Double-Logarithmic Approximation (DLA), where $N_c$ is the number of quark colors. Previously, this approach was used to determine the small-$x$ asymptotics of the unpolarized and helicity TMDs. In this work we obtain the small-$x$ asymptotics of the Sivers function, helicity worm-gear, transversity, pretzelosity, Boer-Mulders and transversity worm-gear TMDs, thus completing the set of the asymptotic small-$x$ behavior of all the leading-twist flavor-singlet quark TMDs.</description>

      <title>$2\nu\beta\beta$ Spectrum in Chiral Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate two-neutrino double beta decay ($2\nu\beta\beta$) in chiral effective field theory. We find contributions from weak magnetism and double-weak pion-exchange at next-to-leading-order in the chiral power counting. We discuss the impact of the chiral corrections on the electron spectra and find that they should be included in analyses of $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay that aim to uncover new physics signatures in the electron spectrum. We illustrate this point by revisiting the effect of sterile neutrinos and non-standard charged interactions. We also find that the pion-exchange contributions involve nuclear matrix elements that are related to those appearing in neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu \beta \beta$). We investigate whether the $0\nu \beta \beta$ nuclear matrix elements can be obtained from detailed measurements of the energy spectrum of the outgoing electrons in $2\nu\beta\beta$ transitions.</description>

Abstract: We combine, for the first time, event-by-event $\rm T_RENTo$ initial conditions with the relativistic viscous hydrodynamic model v-USPhydro and the Monte Carlo event generator JEWEL to make predictions for the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and jet azimuthal anisotropies $v_n\left\{2\right\}$ in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02 \, \rm TeV$ PbPb collisions for multiple centralities and values of the jet cone radius $R$. The $R$-dependence of $R_{AA}$ and $v_2\left\{2\right\}$ strongly depends on the presence of recoiling scattering centers. We find a small jet $v_3\left\{2\right\}$ in mid-central collisions and consistent results in wide jet $p_T$ regions and centralities with ATLAS data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As thermonuclear reaction rates using the latest experimental input supplemented with theoretical nuclear spectroscopic information. The experimental input consists of the latest proton thresholds of $^{64}$Ge and $^{65}$As, and the nuclear spectroscopic information of $^{65}$As, whereas the theoretical nuclear spectroscopic information for $^{64}$Ge and $^{65}$As are deduced from the full pf-shell space configuration-interaction shell-model calculations with the GXPF1A Hamiltonian. Both thermonuclear reaction rates are determined with known uncertainties at the energies that correspond to the Gamow windows of the temperature regime relevant to Type I X-ray bursts, covering the typical temperature range of the thermonuclear runaway of the GS 1826$-$24 periodic bursts and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion bursts.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear de-excitations associated with neutrino-nucleus interactions and nucleon decays are playing an increasingly significant role in neutrino experiments. We explore the GEMINI++ code and estimate its ability to account for the de-excitation processes of highly excited $^{11}$B$^*$ and $^{15}$N$^*$, which can be created in the liquid scintillator and water Cherenkov detectors respectively. It is found that GEMINI++ can not describe the nuclear experimental data of $^{11}$B$^*$ and $^{15}$N$^*$ well. To improve its performance for de-excitations of light nuclei, we modify GEMINI++ and then develop a code of GEMINI++4$\nu$, which can give the best predictions compared with experimental measurements among some widely used statistical model codes.</description>

      <title>Scalar field with a time-independent classical source, not trivial after all: from vacuum decay to scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Historically it has been believed that a time-independent classical source has no effect on the scattering of relativistic uncharged field, in contrast with single particle quantum mechanics. In this work we show that the dynamics is not trivial. We solve exactly for the scattering amplitudes and find that a key ingredient is the production of particles from the unstable vacuum, conceptually similar to the Schwinger mechanism. We compute exactly the probabilities for the vacuum to decay in $n$ particles. The time dependence of such probabilities displays interesting properties such as the quantum Zeno effect and in particular has no regime where the exponential decay law is a good approximation. We show that the trivial scattering found in the past is the byproduct of the adiabatic switching of the interaction. In fact, it is not possible to switch off the interaction (adiabatically or otherwise) at distant times and recover the exact results. Finally, this non trivial vacuum behavior is a source of particle production. We argue that such non-perturbative calculations can be phenomenologically relevant for the production processes that are suppressed at the lower orders in perturbation theory, for instance dilaton production in a medium.</description>

Abstract: Collective anisotropic flow, where particles are correlated over the entire event, is a prominent phenomenon in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and is sensitive to the properties of the matter created in those collisions. It is often measured by two- and multi-particle correlations and is therefore contaminated by nonflow, those genuine few-body correlations unrelated to the global event-wise correlations. Many methods have been devised to estimate nonflow contamination with various degrees of successes and difficulties. Here, we review those methods pedagogically, discussing the pros and cons of each method, and give examples of ballpark estimate of nonflow contamination and associated uncertainties in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We hope such a review of the various nonflow estimation methods in a single place would prove helpful to future researches.</description>

      <title>Prominent bump in the two-neutron separation energies of neutron-rich lanthanum isotopes revealed by high-precision mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on high-precision atomic mass measurements of $^{148\text{-}153}$La and $^{151}$Ce performed with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap using the Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance technique. The masses of $^{152,153}$La were experimentally determined for the first time. We confirm the sharp kink in the two-neutron separation energies at the neutron number ${N=93}$ in the cerium (${Z=58}$) isotopic chain. Our precision mass measurements of the most exotic neutron-rich lanthanum (${Z=57}$) isotopes reveal a sudden increase in two-neutron separation energies from ${N=92}$ to ${N=93}$. Unlike in the cerium isotopic chain, the kink is not sharp but extends to ${N=94}$ forming a prominent bump. The gain in energy is about 0.4 MeV, making it one of the strongest changes in two-neutron separation energies over the whole chart of nuclides, away from nuclear shell closures. The results call for further studies to elucidate the structure of neutron-rich lanthanum isotopes.</description>

      <title>Baryon and Meson Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11196v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The masses of eight baryon sets and nine meson sets of three or more equal-quantum excited states are fitted by a simple two-parameter logarithm function, M(n) = a Ln(n) + b, where $n$ is the order of excitation. The conjecture is made that accurately measured masses of all equal-quantum baryon and meson excited states would be related by the logarithm function used here; at least for the mass range of currently known excited states.</description>

      <title>Jet substructure of light and heavy flavor jets at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jet substructure studies at the Large Hadron Collider have been used to constrain parton distribution functions, test perturbative QCD, measure the strong-coupling constant, and probe the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. We extend these studies to lower energies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider that would additionally allow us to test existing models of non-perturbative physics. In this study, we present a PYTHIA8-based Monte Carlo study of substructure of jets produced in $p+p$ collisions at 200 GeV. The selection criteria is adapted for a feasible measurement at sPHENIX. We consider different types of jet substructure observables such as jet angularities and primary Lund Plane with a special focus on suppression of collinear radiation around emitting heavy quark known as a dead cone effect.</description>
