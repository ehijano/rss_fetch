      <title>Nash epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faced with a dangerous epidemic humans will spontaneously social distance to reduce their risk of infection at a socio-economic cost. Compartmentalised epidemic models have been extended to include this endogenous decision making: Individuals choose their behaviour to optimise a utility function, self-consistently giving rise to population behaviour. Here we study the properties of the resulting Nash equilibria, in which no member of the population can gain an advantage by unilaterally adopting different behaviour. We leverage a new analytic solution to obtain, (1) a simple relationship between rational social distancing behaviour and the current number of infections; (2) new scaling results for how the infection peak and number of total cases depend on the cost of contracting the disease; (3) characteristic infection costs that divide regimes of strong and weak behavioural response and depend only on the basic reproduction number of the disease; (4) a closed form expression for the value of the utility. We discuss how these analytic results provide a deep and intuitive understanding into the disease dynamics, useful for both individuals and policymakers. In particular the relationship between social distancing and infections represents a heuristic that could be communicated to the population to encourage, or "bootstrap", rational behaviour.</description>

      <title>Finite Tests from Functional Characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03737v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classically, testing whether decision makers belong to specific preference classes involves two main approaches. The first, known as the functional approach, assumes access to an entire demand function. The second, the revealed preference approach, constructs inequalities to test finite demand data. This paper bridges these methods by using the functional approach to test finite data through preference learnability results. We develop a computationally efficient algorithm that generates tests for choice data based on functional characterizations of preference families. We provide these restrictions for various applications, including homothetic and weakly separable preferences, where the latter's revealed preference characterization is provably NP-Hard. We also address choice under uncertainty, offering tests for betweenness preferences. Lastly, we perform a simulation exercise demonstrating that our tests are effective in finite samples and accurately reject demands not belonging to a specified class.</description>

      <title>Two-Person Adversarial Games are Zero-Sum: An Elaboration of a Folk Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04029v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation that every two-person adversarial game is an affine transformation of a zero-sum game is traceable to Luce-Raiffa (1957) and made explicit in Aumann (1987). Recent work of (ADP) Adler-Daskalakis-Papadimitriou (2009), and of Raimondo (2023) in increasing generality, proves what has so far remained a conjecture. We present two proofs of an even more general formulation: the first draws on multilinear utility theory developed by Fishburn-Roberts (1978); the second is a consequence of the ADP proof itself for a special case of a two-player game with a set of three actions.</description>

      <title>Local non-bossiness and preferences over colleagues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The student-optimal stable mechanism (DA), the most popular mechanism in school choice, is the only one that is both stable and strategy-proof. However, when DA is implemented, a student can change the schools of others without changing her own. We show that this drawback is limited: a student cannot change her classmates without modifying her school. We refer to this new property as {\it{local non-bossiness}} and use it to provide a new characterization of DA that does not rely on stability. Furthermore, we show that local non-bossiness plays a crucial role in providing incentives to be truthful when students have preferences over their colleagues. As long as students first consider the school to which they are assigned and then their classmates, DA induces the only stable and strategy-proof mechanism. There is limited room to expand this preference domain without compromising the existence of a stable and strategy-proof mechanism.</description>
