      <title>Phase-sensitive pump-probe measurement of the complex nonlinear susceptibility of silicon across the direct band edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pump-probe supercontinuum (SC) spectral interferometry in reflection is used to measure time-dependent variations in the complex dielectric function ($n$, $k$) over the visible wavelength range in bulk silicon. Changes in $n$ ($\Delta n$) due to a near infrared pump pulse are derived from transient fluctuations in the reflected SC probe amplitude, as is measured in conventional pump-probe experiments. Additionally, modifications to $k$ ($\Delta k$) are derived from phase shifts in the reflected SC. The ultrafast response is attributed to two-photon absorption ($\Delta k$) and the optical Kerr effect ($\Delta n$), enabling measurement of effective two-photon ($\beta$) and Kerr ($n_2$) coefficients. The onset of strong two-photon absorption as the two-photon energy is tuned through the $E_1$ = 3.4 eV direct band edge of silicon is observed for the first time to our knowledge. These constitute the first measurements of the complex nonlinear response of a bulk medium from reflectivity alone. The technique allows straightforward spectroscopic measurements of the $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear response at the surface of absorbing materials.</description>

      <title>Spectral multiplexing based on multi-distance lensless imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have demonstrated the capability of spectral multiplexing in multi-distance diffractive imaging, enabling the reconstruction of samples with diverse spectral responses. While previous methods like ptychography utilize redundancy in radial diffraction data to achieve information multiplexing, they typically require capturing a substantial amount of diffraction data. In contrast, our approach effectively harnesses the redundancy information in axial diffraction data. This significantly reduces the amount of diffraction data required and relaxes the stringent requirements on optical path stability.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Optical Anisotropy of the Morpho Butterfly Wing for Quantitative, Stain-Free, and Contact-Free Assessment of Biological Tissue Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changes in the density and organization of fibrous biological tissues often accompany the progression of serious diseases ranging from fibrosis to neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease and cancer. However, challenges in cost, complexity, or precision faced by existing imaging methodologies pose barriers to elucidating the role of tissue microstructure in disease. Here, we leverage the intrinsic optical anisotropy of the Morpho butterfly wing and introduce Morpho-Enhanced Polarized Light Microscopy (MorE-PoL), a stain- and contact-free imaging platform which enhances and quantifies the birefringent material properties of fibrous biological tissues. We develop a mathematical model, based on Jones calculus, which quantifies fibrous tissue density and organization. As a representative example, we analyze collagen-dense and collagen-sparse human breast cancer tissue sections and leverage our technique to assess the microstructural properties of distinct regions of interest. We compare our results with conventional Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining procedures and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy for fibrillar collagen detection. Our findings demonstrate that our MorE-PoL technique provides a robust, quantitative, and accessible route toward analyzing biological tissue microstructures, with great potential for application to a broad range of biological materials.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomedical applications of plasmonic nanoparticle conjugates need control over their optical properties modulated by surface coating with stabilizing or targeting molecules often attached to or embedded in the secondary functionalization shell, such as silica. Although current numerical techniques can simulate the plasmonic response of such structures, it is desirable in practice to have analytical models based on simple physical ideas that can be implemented without considerable computer resources. Here, we present two efficient analytical methods based on improved electrostatic approximation (IEA) and model expansion method (MEM) combined with the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The last approach avoids additional electromagnetic simulations and provides a direct bridge between analytical IEA and MEM models for bare particles and those with multilayer shells. As simple as the original IEA and MEM, the developed analytical extensions provide accurate extinction and scattering spectra for coated particles compared to exact calculations by separation of variable method and COMSOL. The possibility and accuracy of analytical models are illustrated by extensive simulations for prolate and oblate gold and silver nanoparticles with a maximal size of up to 200 nm, aspect ratio from 2 to 6, and 3-30 nm dielectric coating.</description>

      <title>Polarized sub-meV Photoluminescence in 2D PbS Nanoplatelets at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are promising materials for classical and quantum light sources due to their versatile chemistry and efficient photoluminescence (PL) properties. While visible emitters are well-established, the pursuit of excellent (near-)infrared sources continues. One notable candidate in this regard are photoluminescent two-dimensional (2D) PbS nanoplatelets (NPLs) exhibiting excitonic emission at 720 nm (1.7 eV) directly tying to the typical emission range limit of CdSe NPLs. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of low-temperature PL from this material class. Ultrathin 2D PbS NPLs exhibit high crystallinity confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, and revealing Moire patterns in overlapping structures. At 4K, we observe unique PL features in single PbS NPLs, including narrow zero-phonon lines with line widths down to 0.6 meV and a linear degree of polarization up to 90%. Time-resolved measurements identify trions as the dominant emission source with a 2.3 ns decay time. Sub-meV spectral diffusion and no immanent blinking over minutes is observed, as well as discrete spectral jumps without memory effects. These findings advance the understanding and underpin the potential of colloidal PbS NPLs for optical and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Integrated diode lasers for the generation of sub-GHz repetition rate frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate absorber-free passive and hybrid mode-locking at sub-GHz repetition rates using a hybrid integrated extended cavity diode laser around 1550 nm. The laser is based on InP as gain medium and a long Si$_3$N$_4$ feedback circuit, with three highly frequency selective microring resonators. The feedback resonators not only increases the cavity length up to 0.6 m to achieve sub-GHz repetition rates but also serve as a dispersive narrowband mirror for sharp spectral filtering, which enables Fourier domain mode-locking. We observe passive mode-locking with repetition rates below 500 MHz, with $\approx$ 15 comb lines at around 0.2 mW total power. To stabilize the repetition rate, hybrid mode-locking is demonstrated by weak RF modulation of the diode current at frequencies around 500 MHz. The RF injection reduces the Lorentzian linewidth component from 8.9 kHz to a detection limited value around 300 mHz. To measure the locking range of the repetition rate, the injected RF frequency is tuned with regard to the passive mode-locking frequency and the injected RF power is varied. The locking range increases approximately as a square-root function of the injected RF power. At 1 mW injection a wide locking range of about 80 MHz is obtained. We observe the laser maintaining stable mode-locking also when the DC diode pump current is increased from 40 mA to 190 mA, provided that the cavity length is maintained constant with thermo-refractive tuning.</description>

      <title>High topological charge lasing in quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic modes exhibiting a polarization winding akin to a vortex possess an integer topological charge. Lasing with topological charge 1 or 2 can be realized in periodic lattices of up to six-fold rotational symmetry. Higher order charges require symmetries not compatible with any two-dimensional Bravais lattice. Here, we experimentally demonstrate lasing with topological charges as high as -5, +7, -17 and +19 in quasicrystals. We discover rich ordered structures of increasing topological charges in the reciprocal space. Our quasicrystal design utilizes group theory in determining electromagnetic field nodes, where lossy plasmonic nanoparticles are positioned to maximize gain. Our results open a new path for fundamental studies of higher-order topological defects, coherent light beams of high topological charge, and realizations of omni-directional, flat-band-like lasing.</description>

      <title>Self-locked broadband Raman-electro-optic microcomb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs (OFCs), composed of equally spaced frequency tones, have spurred advancements in communications, spectroscopy, precision measurement and fundamental physics research. A prevalent method for generating OFCs involves the electro-optic (EO) effect, i.e., EO comb, renowned for its rapid tunability via precise microwave field control. Recent advances in integrated lithium niobate (LN) photonics have greatly enhanced the efficiency of EO effect, enabling the generation of broadband combs with reduced microwave power. However, parasitic nonlinear effects, such as Raman scattering and four-wave mixing, often emerge in high quality nonlinear devices, impeding the expansion of comb bandwidth and the minimization of frequency noise. Here, we tame these nonlinear effects and present a novel type of OFC, i.e., the self-locked Raman-electro-optic (REO) microcomb by leveraging the collaboration of EO, Kerr and Raman scattering processes. The spectral width of the REO microcomb benefits from the Raman gain and Kerr effect, encompassing nearly 1400 comb lines spanning over 300 nm with a fine repetition rate of 26.03 GHz, much larger than the pure EO combs. Remarkably, the system can maintain a self-locked low-noise state in the presence of multiple nonlinearities without the need for external active feedback. Our approach points to a direction for improving the performance of microcombs and paves the way for exploring new nonlinear physics, such as new laser locking techniques, through the collaboration of inevitable multiple nonlinear effects in integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Multi-watt 1 GHz single-cycle frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cycle optical pulses offer a strong carrier-envelope-offset (CEO) dependent electric field and the highest peak intensity for a given pulse energy. Absence of demonstrated GHz single-cycle lasers constrains exploration of single/sub-cycle dynamics at this repetition rate. By leveraging fiber soliton effects and suppressing higher-order dispersion, we achieve single-cycle pulse generation at a 1 GHz repetition rate in an all-fiber format. The laser produces 7.1 fs (1.1-cycle) pulses with 1.8 W average power, centered around 1970 nm. Temporal characterization shows 60% of the pulse energy is concentrated in the pulse center, yielding a peak power of 110 kW. The seed laser demonstrates a 43 dB signal-to-noise ratio for the CEO frequency, facilitating comb stabilization and CEO control. Our model, which matches experimental observations, identifies conditions for achieving single-cycle duration and predicts scalability to a 2 GHz repetition rate. This work presents the first GHz single-cycle source. We envision these advances will drive studies in single/sub-cycle light-matter interaction, spectroscopy, microscopy, and CEO-sensitive nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Control of the local and nonlocal electromagnetic response in all-dielectric reconfigurable metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable metasurfaces are potent platforms to control the propagation properties of light dynamically. Among different reconfiguration mechanisms available at optical frequencies, using non-volatile phase change materials is one of the most prominent. Tuning the refractive index of these materials, and thus changing the electromagnetic response of the device, can be achieved by external modulation that enables the transition between their amorphous and crystalline structural states. In this work, we study a structure that exploits these materials to fully control the electromagnetic response, i.e., electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic coupling. Powered by this controllability, we present how the metasurface can be designed to perform beam steering and switchable one-way absorption applications. In addition, we demonstrate that the same platform can be designed to work in a nonlocal regime to implement a more efficient way of controlling light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental emulation of trembling quantum motion, or Zitterbewegung, of exciton polaritons in a perovskite microcavity at room temperature. By introducing liquid crystal molecules into the microcavity, we achieve spinor states with synthetic Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling and tunable energy splitting. Under a resonant excitation, the polariton fluid exhibits clear trembling motion perpendicular to its flowing direction, accompanied by a unique spin pattern resembling interlocked fingers. Furthermore, leveraging on the sizable tunability of energy gaps by external electrical voltages, we observe the continuous transition of polariton Zitterbewegung from relativistic (small gaps) to non-relativistic (large gaps) regimes. Our findings pave the way for using exciton polaritons in the emulation of relativistic quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Influence of deposition parameters on the plasmonic properties of gold nanoantennas fabricated by focused ion beam lithography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of plasmonic antennas is influenced by a variety of factors, including their size, shape, and material. Even minor changes in the deposition parameters during the thin film preparation process may have a significant impact on the dielectric function of the film, and thus on the plasmonic properties of the resulting antenna. In this work, we deposited gold thin films with thicknesses of 20 nm, 30 nm, and 40 nm at various deposition rates using an ion-beam-assisted deposition. We evaluate their morphology and crystallography by atomic force microscopy, X ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Next, we examined the ease of fabricating plasmonic antennas using focused-ion-beam lithography. Finally, we evaluate their plasmonic properties by electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements of individual antennas. Our results show that the optimal gold thin film for plasmonic antenna fabrication of a thickness of 20 and 30 nm should be deposited at the deposition rate of around 0.1 nm/s. The thicker 40 nm film should be deposited at a higher deposition rate like 0.3 nm/s.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced narrowband spectral filters using rare-earth ions doped in thin-film lithium niobate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-chip optical filters are fundamental components in optical signal processing. While rare-earth ion-doped crystals offer ultra-narrow optical filtering via spectral hole burning, their applications have primarily been limited to those using bulk crystals, restricting their utility. In this work, we demonstrate cavity-enhanced spectral filtering based on rare-earth ions in an integrated nonlinear optical platform. We incorporate rare-earth ions into high quality-factor ring resonators patterned in thin-film lithium niobate. By spectral hole burning at 4K in a critically coupled resonance mode, we achieve bandpass filters ranging from 7 MHz linewidth, with 13.0 dB of extinction, to 24 MHz linewidth, with 20.4 dB of extinction. By reducing the temperature to 100 mK to eliminate phonon broadening, we achieve an even narrower linewidth of 681 kHz, which is comparable to the narrowest filter linewidth demonstrated in an integrated photonic device, while only requiring a small device footprint. Moreover, the cavity enables reconfigurable filtering by varying the cavity coupling rate. For instance, as opposed to the bandpass filter, we demonstrate a bandstop filter utilizing an under-coupled ring resonator. Such versatile integrated spectral filters with high extinction ratio and narrow linewidth could serve as fundamental components for optical signal processing and optical memories on-a-chip.</description>

      <title>Wide-Field, High-Resolution Reconstruction in Computational Multi-Aperture Miniscope Using a Fourier Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional fluorescence microscopy is constrained by inherent trade-offs among resolution, field-of-view, and system complexity. To navigate these challenges, we introduce a simple and low-cost computational multi-aperture miniature microscope, utilizing a microlens array for single-shot wide-field, high-resolution imaging. Addressing the challenges posed by extensive view multiplexing and non-local, shift-variant aberrations in this device, we present SV-FourierNet, a novel multi-channel Fourier neural network. SV-FourierNet facilitates high-resolution image reconstruction across the entire imaging field through its learned global receptive field. We establish a close relationship between the physical spatially-varying point-spread functions and the network's learned effective receptive field. This ensures that SV-FourierNet has effectively encapsulated the spatially-varying aberrations in our system, and learned a physically meaningful function for image reconstruction. Training of SV-FourierNet is conducted entirely on a physics-based simulator. We showcase wide-field, high-resolution video reconstructions on colonies of freely moving C. elegans and imaging of a mouse brain section. Our computational multi-aperture miniature microscope, augmented with SV-FourierNet, represents a major advancement in computational microscopy and may find broad applications in biomedical research and other fields requiring compact microscopy solutions.</description>

      <title>A symmetric silicon microring resonator optical crossbar array for accelerated inference and training in deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits are emerging as a promising platform for accelerating matrix multiplications in deep learning, leveraging the inherent parallel nature of light. Although various schemes have been proposed and demonstrated to realize such photonic matrix accelerators, the in-situ training of artificial neural networks using photonic accelerators remains challenging due to the difficulty of direct on-chip backpropagation on a photonic chip. In this work, we propose a silicon microring resonator (MRR) optical crossbar array with a symmetric structure that allows for simple on-chip backpropagation, potentially enabling the acceleration of both the inference and training phases of deep learning. We demonstrate a $4 \times 4$ circuit on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform and use it to perform inference tasks of a simple neural network for classifying Iris flowers, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.3%. Subsequently, we train the neural network using simulated on-chip backpropagation and achieve an accuracy of 91.1% in the same inference task after training. Furthermore, we simulate a convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition, using a $9 \times 9$ MRR crossbar array to perform the convolution operations. This work contributes to the realization of compact and energy-efficient photonic accelerators for deep learning.</description>
