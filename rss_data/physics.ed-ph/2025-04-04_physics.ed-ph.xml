      <title>Do evidence-based active-engagement courses reduce the gender gap in introductory physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior research suggests that using evidence-based pedagogies can not only improve learning for all students, it can also reduce the gender gap. We describe the impact of physics education research based pedagogical techniques in flipped and active-engagement non-flipped courses on the gender gap observed with validated conceptual surveys. We compare male and female students' performance in courses which make significant use of evidence-based active engagement (EBAE) strategies with courses that primarily use lecture-based (LB) instruction. The analysis presented here includes data from two-semester sequences of introductory algebra-based and calculus-based introductory physics courses. The surveys used to assess student learning in the first and second semester courses were the Force Concept Inventory and the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism, respectively. The performance of male and female students in EBAE courses at a particular level is compared with LB courses in two situations: (I) the same instructor taught two courses, one of which was an EBAE course and the other an LB course, while the homework, recitations and final exams were kept the same, (II) student performance in all of the EBAE courses taught by different instructors was averaged and compared with LB courses of the same type also averaged over different instructors. In all cases, we find that students in courses which make significant use of EBAE strategies, on average, outperformed students in courses of the same type using primarily LB instruction even though there was no statistically significant difference on the pretest before instruction. However, the gender gap persisted even in courses using EBAE methods. We also discuss correlations between the performance of male and female students on the validated conceptual surveys and the final exam, which had a heavy weight on quantitative problem solving.</description>

      <title>Uncovering shifts in the history of Physics education: a systematic, NLP-based, thematic analysis of articles from The Physics Teacher and Physics Education journals (1966-2019)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the thematic evolution of articles in The Physics Teacher and Physics Education journals, over a critical period in modern history, from the Cold War era to the pre-pandemic world (1966 - 2019). Using an NLP-based inductive topic modeling approach, we identify recurring themes that have shaped the physics education literature, including content-based topics, teaching methodologies, laboratory practices, curriculum development, and the influence of Physics Education Research (PER). Our findings reveal both overarching trends and distinct thematic preferences between the journals. Physics Education has historically emphasized curriculum structures, social aspects of education, and interdisciplinary connections, whereas The Physics Teacher has focused more on pedagogical strategies, demonstrations, and practical teaching tools. Over the past three decades, both journals have increasingly incorporated discussions on technology, computation, and PER-driven instructional practices. By tracing these developments over five decades, this study provides a broader perspective on how physics education has responded to changing educational priorities, technological advancements, and research developments.</description>

      <title>Impact of evidence-based flipped or active-engagement non-flipped courses on student performance in introductory physics</title>

Abstract: We describe the impact of physics education research-based pedagogical techniques in flipped and active-engagement non-flipped courses on student performance on validated conceptual surveys. We compare student performance in courses which make significant use of evidence-based active engagement (EBAE) strategies with courses that primarily use lecture-based (LB) instruction. All courses had large enrollment and often had 100-200 students. The analysis of data for validated conceptual surveys presented here includes data from large numbers of students from two-semester sequences of introductory algebra-based and calculus-based introductory physics courses. The conceptual surveys used to assess student learning in the first and second semester courses were the Force Concept Inventory and the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism, respectively. In the research discussed here, the performance of students in EBAE courses at a particular level is compared with LB courses in two situations: (I) the same instructor taught two courses, one of which was a flipped course involving EBAE methods and the other an LB course, while the homework, recitations and final exams were kept the same, (II) student performance in all of the EBAE courses taught by different instructors were averaged and compared with LB courses of the same type also averaged over different instructors. In all cases, we find that students in courses which make significant use of active-engagement strategies, on average, outperformed students in courses using primarily lecture-based instruction of the same type on conceptual surveys even though there was no statistically significant difference on the pretest before instruction. We also discuss correlation between the performance on the validated conceptual surveys and the final exam, which typically placed a heavy weight on quantitative problem solving.</description>
