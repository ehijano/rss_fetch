      <title>Geminal theory within the seniority formalism and bi-variational principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of the mathematical structure of geminal theory within the seniority formalism and bi-variational principle. Named after the constellation, geminal wavefunctions provide the mean-field like representation of paired-electron wavefunctions in quantum chemistry, tying in with the Lewis picture of chemical bonding via electron pairs. Unfortunately, despite its mean-field product wave function description, the computational cost of computing geminal wavefunctions is dominated by the permanent overlaps with Slater determinant reference states. We review recent approaches to reduce the factorial scaling of the permanent, and present the bi-variational principle as a consistent framework for the projected Schr\"odinger Equation and the computation of reduced density matrices.</description>

      <title>Application of the shift-invert Lanczos algorithm to a non-equilibrium Green function for transport problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Green's function theory and related methods are widely used to describe transport phenomena in many-body systems, but they often require a costly inversion of a large matrix. We show here that the shift-invert Lanczos method can dramatically reduce the computational effort. We apply the method to two test problems, namely a simple model Hamiltonian and to a more realistic Hamiltonian for nuclear fission. For a Hamiltonian of dimension 66103 we find that the computation time is reduced by a factor of 33 compared to the direct calculation of the Green's function.</description>

      <title>Dissociative recombination of rotationally cold ArH$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have experimentally studied dissociative recombination (DR) of electronically and vibrationally relaxed ArH$^+$ in its lowest rotational levels, using an electron--ion merged-beams setup at the Cryogenic Storage Ring. We report measurements for the merged-beams rate coefficient of ArH$^+$ and compare it to published experimental and theoretical results. In addition, by measuring the kinetic energy released to the DR fragments, we have determined the internal state of the DR products after dissociation. At low collision energies, we find that the atomic products are in their respective ground states, which are only accessible via non-adiabatic couplings to neutral Rydberg states. Published theoretical results for ArH$^+$ have not included this DR pathway. From our measurements, we have also derived a kinetic temperature rate coefficient for use in astrochemical models.</description>

      <title>Optical line shapes of color centers in solids from classical autocorrelation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers play key roles in applications, including, e.g., solid state lighting and quantum information technology, for which the coupling between their optical and vibrational properties is crucial. Established methodologies for predicting the optical lineshapes of such emitters rely on the generating function (GF) approach and impose tight constraints on the shape of and relationship between the ground and excited state landscapes, which limits their application range. Here, we describe an approach based on direct sampling of the underlying auto-correlation functions through molecular dynamics simulations (MD-ACF) that overcomes these restrictions. The energy landscapes are represented by a machine-learned potential, which provides an accurate yet efficient description of both the ground and excited state landscapes through a single model, guaranteeing size-consistent predictions. We apply this methodology to the (VSiVC)kk(0) divacancy defect in 4H-SiC, a prototypical color center, which has been studied both experimentally and theoretically. We demonstrate that at low temperatures the present MD-ACF approach yields predictions in agreement with earlier GF calculations. Unlike the latter it is, however, also applicable at high temperatures as it is not subject to the same limitations, especially with respect to handling of anharmonicity, and can be applied to study non-crystalline materials. While we discuss remaining challenges and possible extensions, the methodology presented here already holds the potential to substantially widen the range of computational predictions of the optical properties of color centers and related defects, especially for cases with pronounced anharmonicity and/or large differences between the initial and final states.</description>

      <title>Computing linear optical spectra in the presence of nonadiabatic effects on Graphics Processing Units using molecular dynamics and tensor-network approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare two recently developed strategies, implemented in open source software packages, for computing linear optical spectra in condensed phase environments in the presence of nonadiabatic effects. Both approaches rely on computing excitation energy and transition dipole fluctuations along molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, treating molecular and environmental degrees of freedom on the same footing. Spectra are then generated in two ways: In the recently developed Gaussian Non-Condon Theory (GNCT), the linear response functions are computed in terms of independent adiabatic excited states, with non-Condon effects described through spectral densities of transition dipole fluctuations. For strongly coupled excited states, we instead parameterize a linear vibronic coupling (LVC) Hamiltonian directly from spectral densities of energy fluctuations and diabatic couplings computed along the MD trajectory. The optical spectrum is then calculated using powerful, numerically exact tensor-network approaches. Both the electronic structure calculations to sample system fluctuations and the quantum dynamics simulations using tensor-network methods are carried out on graphics processing units (GPUs), enabling rapid calculations on complex condensed phase systems. We assess the performance of the approaches using model systems in the presence of a conical intersection (CI), and the pyrazine molecule in different solvent environments.</description>

      <title>Refining the weighted subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver: compression of ans\"atze into a single pure state and optimization of weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weighted subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE) is a prominent algorithm for calculating excited-state properties of molecular quantum systems. In this work, we elaborate on some of its fundamental features with the aim of improving its practical realization. First, we demonstrate that the initial ans\"atze for various excited states could be prepared into a single pure state through a minimal number of ancilla qubits, followed by the optimization of a subsequent global unitary rotation in the targeted subspace. Since the ancillas' sole purpose is to purify an underlying ensemble $\rho_{\boldsymbol{w}}$ state with spectral weights $\boldsymbol{w}$, their measurement would just collapse $\rho_{\boldsymbol{w}}$ with probabilities $w_j$ to one of its eigenstates $|\Psi_j \rangle$. We thus observe that our realization of SSVQE is equivalent to the original SSVQE improved by importance sampling. Then, we elaborate by numerical means on the potential influence of the auxiliary weights $\boldsymbol{w}$ on the accuracy of the sought-after eigenstates and eigenenergies. Clear trends are discovered which are contrasted with some recent mathematical results concerning the ensemble variational principle that underlies SSVQE.</description>

      <title>Mpemba effects in nonequilibrium open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect was originally referred to as the faster icing of a higher-temperature system than a lower-temperature system, and was later generalized to anomalous decays of both classical and quantum observables to equilibrium states. Mpemba effect is mostly considered in classical systems and during cooling processes towards equilibrium states. We investigate the emergence of the effect in nonequilibrium quantum systems where the system has no asymptotic equilibrium state to approach. Instead, the system is put in contact with two different baths, and only a nonequilibrium state exists, sustained by constant energy injection from the surrounding thermal baths. Firstly, we show that the nonequilibrium conditions can dramatically enlarge the parameter regimes where the MPE emerges. Secondly, we demonstrate that the anomalous MPEs and inverse MPEs emerge in the evolution of quantum correlations in the two-site fermionic system and that nonequilibrium conditions can expedite or delay the MPEs. Thirdly, we show that the nonequilibrium-induced quantum coherence can have considerable contributions to the emergence of the MPE which the conventional Lindbladian dynamics fails to capture.</description>

      <title>Variational time reversal for free energy estimation in nonequilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the structure of systems in nonequilibrium steady states necessitates tools that quantify population shifts and associated deformations of equilibrium free energy landscapes under persistent currents. Within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, we establish a variant of the Kawasaki-Crooks equality that relates nonequilibrium free energy corrections in overdamped Langevin systems to heat dissipation statistics along time-reversed relaxation trajectories computable with molecular simulation. Using stochastic control theory, we arrive at a general variational approach to evaluate the Kawasaki-Crooks equality, and use it to estimate distribution functions of order parameters in specific models of driven and active matter, attaining substantial improvement in accuracy over simple perturbative methods.</description>

      <title>SOFI: Finding point group symmetries in atomic clusters as finding the set of degenerate solutions in a shape-matching problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point Group (PG) symmetries play a fundamental role in many aspects of theoretical chemistry and computational materials science. With the objective to automatize the search of PG symmetry operations of generic atomic clusters, we present a new algorithm called Symmetry Operation FInder (SOFI). SOFI addresses the problem of identifying PG symmetry by framing it as a degenerate shape-matching problem, where the multiple solutions correspond to distinct symmetry operations. The developed algorithm is compared against three other algorithms dedicated to PG identification, on a large set of atomic clusters. The results, along with some illustrative use cases, showcase the effectiveness of SOFI. The SOFI algorithm is released as part of the IRA library, accessible at https://github.com/mammasmias/IterativeRotationsAssignments.</description>
