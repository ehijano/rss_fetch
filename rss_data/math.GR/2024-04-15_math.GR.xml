      <title>On a coarse invertibility spectrum for coarse groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a coarse algebraic invariant for coarse groups and use it to differentiate various coarsifications of the group of integers. This lets us answer two questions posed by Leitner and the second author. The invariant is obtained by considering the set of exponents n such that taking n-th powers defines a coarse equivalence of the coarse group.</description>

      <title>The algebra of the monoid of order-preserving functions on an $n$-set and other reduced $E$-Fountain semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With every reduced $E$-Fountain semigroup $S$ which satisfies the generalized right ample condition we associate a category with partial composition $\mathcal{C}(S)$. Under some assumptions we prove an isomorphism of $\Bbbk$-algebras $\Bbbk S\simeq\Bbbk\mathcal{C}(S)$ between the semigroup algebra and the category algebra where $\Bbbk$ is any commutative unital ring. This is a simultaneous generalization of a former result of the author on reduced E-Fountain semigroups which satisfy the congruence condition, a result of Junying Guo and Xiaojiang Guo on strict right ample semigroups and a result of Benjamin Steinberg on idempotent semigroups with central idempotents. The applicability of the new isomorphism is demonstrated with two well-known monoids which are not members of the above classes. The monoid $\mathcal{O}_{n}$ of order-preserving functions on an $n$-set and the monoid of binary relations with demonic composition.</description>

      <title>On the structure of graph product von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive study of structural properties of graph products of von Neumann algebras equipped with faithful, normal states, as well as properties of the graph products relative to subalgebras coming from induced subgraphs. Among the technical contributions in this paper include a complete bimodule calculation for subalgebras arising from subgraphs. As an application, we obtain a complete classification of when two subalgebras coming from induced subgraphs can be amenable relative to each other. We also give complete characterizations of when the graph product can be full, diffuse, or a factor. Our results are obtained in a broad generality, and we emphasize that they are new even in the tracial setting. They also allow us to deduce new results about when graph products of groups can be amenable relative to each other.</description>

      <title>A unique Cartan subalgebra result for Bernoulli actions of weakly amenable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if $\Gamma\curvearrowright (X^\Gamma,\mu^\Gamma)$ is a Bernoulli action of an i.c.c. nonamenable group $\Gamma$ which is weakly amenable with Cowling-Haagerup constant $1$, and $\Lambda\curvearrowright(Y,\nu)$ is a free ergodic p.m.p. algebraic action of a group $\Lambda$, then the isomorphism $L^\infty(X^\Gamma)\rtimes\Gamma\cong L^\infty(Y)\rtimes\Lambda$ implies that $L^\infty(X^\Gamma)$ and $L^\infty(Y)$ are unitarily conjugate. This is obtained by showing a new rigidity result of non properly proximal groups and combining it with a rigidity result of properly proximal groups from \cite{BIP21}.</description>

      <title>Group theory in OSCAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OSCAR is an innovative new computer algebra system which combines and extends the power of its four cornerstone systems - GAP (group theory), Singular (algebra and algebraic geometry), Polymake (polyhedral geometry), and Antic (number theory). Assuming little familiarity with the subject, we give an introduction to computations in group theory using OSCAR, as a chapter of the upcoming OSCAR book.</description>

      <title>Finite quotients of 3-manifold groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $G$ and $H_1,\dots, H_n$ finite groups, does there exist a $3$-manifold group with $G$ as a quotient but no $H_i$ as a quotient? We answer all such questions in terms of the group cohomology of finite groups. We prove non-existence with topological results generalizing the theory of semicharacteristics. To prove existence of 3-manifolds with certain finite quotients but not others, we use a probabilistic method, by first proving a formula for the distribution of the (profinite completion of) the fundamental group of a random 3-manifold in the Dunfield-Thurston model of random Heegaard splittings as the genus goes to infinity. We believe this is the first construction of a new distribution of random groups from its moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01973v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study crystallographic sphere packings and Kleinian sphere packings, introduced first by Kontorovich and Nakamura in 2017 and then studied further by Kapovich and Kontorovich in 2021. In particular, we solve the problem of existence of crystallographic sphere packings in certain higher dimensions posed by Kontorovich and Nakamura. In addition, we present a geometric doubling procedure allowing to obtain sphere packings from some Coxeter polyhedra without isolated roots, and study "properly integral" packings (that is, ones which are integral but not superintegral). Our techniques rely extensively on computations with Lorentzian quadratic forms, their orthogonal groups, and associated higher-dimensional hyperbolic polyhedra.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of isomorphism problems for tensors, groups, and polynomials IV: linear-length reductions and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many isomorphism problems for tensors, groups, algebras, and polynomials were recently shown to be equivalent to one another under polynomial-time reductions, prompting the introduction of the complexity class TI (Grochow &amp; Qiao, ITCS '21; SIAM J. Comp., '23). Using the tensorial viewpoint, Grochow &amp; Qiao (CCC '21) then gave moderately exponential-time search- and counting-to-decision reductions for a class of $p$-groups. A significant issue was that the reductions usually incurred a quadratic increase in the length of the tensors involved. When the tensors represent $p$-groups, this corresponds to an increase in the order of the group of the form $|G|^{\Theta(\log |G|)}$, negating any asymptotic gains in the Cayley table model.
  In this paper, we present a new kind of tensor gadget that allows us to replace those quadratic-length reductions with linear-length ones, yielding the following consequences:
  1. If Graph Isomorphism is in P, then testing equivalence of cubic forms in $n$ variables over $F_q$, and testing isomorphism of $n$-dimensional algebras over $F_q$, can both be solved in time $q^{O(n)}$, improving from the brute-force upper bound $q^{O(n^2)}$ for both of these.
  2. Combined with the $|G|^{O((\log |G|)^{5/6})}$-time isomorphism-test for $p$-groups of class 2 and exponent $p$ (Sun, STOC '23), our reductions extend this runtime to $p$-groups of class $c$ and exponent $p$ where $c&lt;p$, and yield algorithms in time $q^{O(n^{1.8}\cdot \log q)}$ for cubic form equivalence and algebra isomorphism.
  3. Polynomial-time search- and counting-to-decision reduction for testing isomorphism of $p$-groups of class $2$ and exponent $p$ when Cayley tables are given. This answers questions of Arvind and T\'oran (Bull. EATCS, 2005) for this group class, thought to be one of the hardest cases of Group Isomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that divergent, extended geometrically finite (in the sense of Weisman arXiv:2205.07183) representations can be interpreted as restricted Anosov (in the sense of Tholozan--Wang arXiv:2307.02934) representations over certain flow spaces. We also show that the representations of this type are stable under small type preserving deformations. As an example, we show that a representation induced from a geometrically finite one through a Galois covering, constructed in Tholozan--Wang arXiv:2307.02934, is divergent and extended geometrically finite with a non-homeomorphic boundary extension.</description>

      <title>Low Acceptance Agreement Tests via Bounded-Degree Symplectic HDXs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the derandomized direct product testing question in the low acceptance regime, by constructing new high dimensional expanders that have no small connected covers. We show that our complexes have swap cocycle expansion, which allows us to deduce the agreement theorem by relying on previous work.
  Derandomized direct product testing, also known as agreement testing, is the following problem. Let X be a family of k-element subsets of [n] and let $\{f_s:s\to\Sigma\}_{s\in X}$ be an ensemble of local functions, each defined over a subset $s\subset [n]$. Suppose that we run the following so-called agreement test: choose a random pair of sets $s_1,s_2\in X$ that intersect on $\sqrt k$ elements, and accept if $f_{s_1},f_{s_2}$ agree on the elements in $s_1\cap s_2$. We denote the success probability of this test by $Agr(\{f_s\})$. Given that $Agr(\{f_s\})=\epsilon&gt;0$, is there a global function $G:[n]\to\Sigma$ such that $f_s = G|_s$ for a non-negligible fraction of $s\in X$ ?
  We construct a family X of k-subsets of $[n]$ such that $|X| = O(n)$ and such that it satisfies the low acceptance agreement theorem. Namely,
  $Agr (\{f_s\}) &gt; \epsilon \; \; \longrightarrow$ there is a function $G:[n]\to\Sigma$ such that $\Pr_s[f_s\overset{0.99}{\approx} G|_s]\geq poly(\epsilon)$.
  A key idea is to replace the well-studied LSV complexes by symplectic high dimensional expanders (HDXs). The family X is just the k-faces of the new symplectic HDXs. The later serve our needs better since their fundamental group satisfies the congruence subgroup property, which implies that they lack small covers. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm to construct this family of symplectic HDXs.</description>
