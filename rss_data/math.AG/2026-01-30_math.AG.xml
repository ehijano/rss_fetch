      <title>Non-abelian Rees construction and pure motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Rees construction (of common use in commutative algebra and Hodge theory) interpolates between filtrations, viewed as ${\mathbb G}_m$-equivariant vector bundles on the affine line, and their associated gradings. Various non-abelian versions have been proposed, where the multiplicative group ${\mathbb G}_m$ is replaced by an arbitrary reductive group. Building on a construction due to P. O'Sullivan, we present a Galois correspondence between quasi-homogeneous spaces and certain monoidal categories, and apply it to monoidal categories of motives with concrete applications to algebraic cycles. In particular, we give a new proof and generalization of the Clozel-Deligne theorem about numerical equivalence on abelian varieties over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Real gamma distribution on analytic bundles of flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces four matrix normal distributions extending the separable covariance $ \varPhi \otimes \varPsi$ with potentially variable-level ($ \varPsi$) and/or sample-level ($ \varPhi$) correlations. The joint distribution of sample variances and covariances, leading to the product-moment distribution, is considered when precision matrices admit a specific tensor form. Several well-known results, including the non-central Wishart distribution and normal quadratic forms, now appear as corollaries. Moreover, we propose a conjecture concerning the analytic continuation of the real gamma distribution. By applying these results to the flag varieties, we classify the double flag and the single flag.</description>

      <title>Classification of low degree del Pezzo orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we classify low degree del Pezzo orbifolds with irreducible boundaries. In order to achieve desired boundaries, we classify low degree curves on low degree del Pezzo surfaces. The notion of Campana orbifolds was introduced by Campana in 2004. A del Pezzo orbifold is a Campana orbifold whose underlying surface is a del Pezzo surface. The classification is elementary applications of adjunction formula, Riemann-Roch theorem, Hodge Index theorem and Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem.</description>

      <title>A note on irreducible slice algebraic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note we prove that if $I$ is a right radical and quasi prime ideal in the ring of quaternionic slice regular polynomials, then the symmetrization $\mathbb S_{V_c(I)}$ is an irreducible algebraic set, where $V_c(I)$ is the set of common zeros with commuting components of polynomials in $I$. Combining this fact with the results proved in our previous paper [3], we obtain that for $I$ radical, $V_c(I)$ is irreducible if and only if $I$ is quasi prime.</description>

      <title>New examples of non-Fourier-Mukai exact functors via non-isomorphic octahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a triangulated category $\mathscr S$ that admits a full and strong exceptional sequence of three objects with one-dimensional Hom spaces. We show that the isomorphism classes of exact functors from $\mathscr S$ to another triangulated category $\mathscr T$ are in bijection with the isomorphism classes of octahedra in $\mathscr T$ satisfying a natural condition. As an application, we construct an exact functor from $\mathscr S$ to $\mathbf D^b(\Bbbk[x]\text{-}\mathrm{mod})$ that does not admit a dg lift. This provides an explicit example of a non-Fourier-Mukai exact functor between $\mathbf D^b(\mathbb P^2)$ and $\mathbf D^b(\mathbb P^1)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study "polync varieties", whose singularities are locally products of normal crossing (nc) singularities. We introduce the notion of d-semistability of such varieties, and generalize work of Friedman and Kawamata-Namikawa to address the smoothability of d-semistable, K-trivial, polync varieties. These results are applications of recent breakthroughs on the logarithmic Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem, due to Chan-Leung-Ma and Felten-Filip-Ruddat. We generalize the combinatorial description of Kulikov models for K3 surfaces to the setting of a multiparameter base and describe some interesting examples.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of tropical Tevelev degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tropical Tevelev degrees arising from maps between certain tropical moduli spaces of curves. Building on work of Dawson and Cavalieri, who defined and computed tropical Tevelev degrees in the case of degree $d = g+1$ and $n = g+3$ marked points, we extend the theory by introducing an additional integer parameter $\ell$. In our framework the curve degree and number of marked points vary as $d = g + 1 + \ell$ and $n = g + 3 + 2\ell$, and we analyze the resulting tropical Tevelev degrees for both positive and negative values of $\ell$. This tropicalizes results of Cela, Pandharipande, and Schmitt on algebraic Tevelev degrees. We then further broaden the framework by introducing generalized tropical Tevelev degrees, providing the tropical counterpart to the generalized Tevelev degrees studied by Cela and Lian. These results establish a wider set of computational and structural patterns for intersection calculations on tropical moduli spaces and reveal new behavior beyond the classical setting.</description>

      <title>Highest weight categories via pairs of dual exceptional sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present criteria in terms of dual pairs of exceptional sequences for an abelian category to be highest weight. The criteria are applied in three situations of geometric origin. We give new proofs for the facts that the category of perverse sheaves of middle perversity on complex-analytic manifolds with suitable conditions on the stratification is highest weight and that the derived coherent category of any Grassmannian has a $t$-structure with highest weight heart. Also we show that the abelian null category of any proper birational morphism of regular surfaces is highest weight. For this null category, we give a geometric description of some special objects related to the highest weight structure, such as standard, costandard and characteristic tilting objects.</description>

      <title>On singularities of determinantal hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a closed subscheme $Z$ in a smooth variety $X$, defined by the maximal minors of an $s\times r$ matrix of regular functions, with $s\geq r$, we consider the corresponding incidence correspondence $W$ in $Y=X\times {\mathbf P}^{r-1}$, and relate the log canonical thresholds of $(X,Z)$ and $(Y,W)$. In particular, when $r=s$, we show that ${\rm lct}(X,Z)=1$ if and only if ${\rm lct}(Y,W)=r$. Moreover, in this case, we show that $Z$ has rational singularities if and only if $W$ has pure codimension $r$ in $Y$ and has rational singularities. As a consequence, we deduce that for a configuration hypersurface with a connected configuration matroid, the corresponding configuration incidence variety has rational singularities.</description>

      <title>Quiver-Invariant Dualities between Brane Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study pairs of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories that share the same vacuum moduli space and the same chiral field content, encoded by a common quiver, but differ in their superpotentials. These theories arise as worldvolume theories on a D3-brane probing a toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold and admit a description in terms of bipartite graphs on a 2-torus, known as brane tilings. Using an explicit example, we show that the correspondence is realized by a single `tilting' mutation along the diagonals of hexagonal faces in the brane tiling, which is equivalent to a specific sequence of Seiberg dualities performed at distinct gauge nodes in the quiver.</description>

      <title>Local cohomology with support in Schubert varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with local cohomology sheaves on generalized flag varieties supported in closed Schubert varieties, which carry natural structures as (mixed Hodge) D-modules. We employ Kazhdan--Lusztig theory and Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules to describe a general strategy to calculate the simple composition factors, Hodge filtration, and weight filtration on these modules. Our main tool is the Grothendieck--Cousin complex, introduced by Kempf, which allows us to relate the local cohomology modules in question to parabolic Verma modules over the corresponding Lie algebra. We show that this complex underlies a complex of mixed Hodge modules, and is thus endowed with Hodge and weight filtrations. As a consequence, strictness implies that computing cohomology commutes with taking associated graded with respect to both of these filtrations. We execute this strategy to calculate the composition factors and weight filtration for Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian, in particular showing that the weight filtration is controlled by the augmented Dyck patterns of Raicu--Weyman. As an application, upon restriction to the opposite big cell, we recover the simple composition factors and weight filtration on local cohomology with support in generic determinantal varieties.</description>

      <title>Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the birational geometry of the Kummer surfaces associated to the Jacobian varieties of genus two curves, with a particular focus on fields of characteristic two. In order to do so, we explicitly compute a projective embedding of the Jacobian of a general genus two curve and, from this, we construct its associated Kummer surface. This explicit construction produces a model for desingularised Kummer surfaces over any field of characteristic not two, and specialising these equations to characteristic two provides a model of a partial desingularisation. Adapting the classic description of the Picard lattice in terms of tropes, we also describe how to explicitly find completely desingularised models of Kummer surfaces whenever the $p$-rank is not zero. In the final section of this paper, we compute an example of a Kummer surface with everywhere good reduction over a quadratic number field, and draw connections between the models we computed and a criterion that determines when a Kummer surface has good reduction at two.</description>

      <title>On certain noncommutative geometries via categories of sheaves of PI-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to study noncommutative geometry using the language of categories of sheaves of algebras with polynomial identities and their properties, introducing new (graded) noncommutative geometries. These include, for example, superalgebras, $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded superalgebras, Azumaya algebras, Clifford and quaternion algebras, the algebra of upper triangular matrices, quantum groups at roots of unity, and also some NC-schemes. More precisely, fix a group $G$, a $G$-graded associative algebra $A$ over a field $F$ of characteristic $0$, and a topological space $X$. We construct a locally $G$-graded ringed space structure on $X$, where the structure sheaf takes values in the $G$-graded variety $\mathbf{G\text{-}var}(A)$ of algebras generated by $A$. This provides a framework that classifies geometric spaces whose local models belong to $\mathbf{G\text{-}var}(A)$. We study conditions under which two such geometries can be compared in a (graded) Morita context, as well as the compatibility of their corresponding differential calculi. As an application, we prove a Morita-equivariant Betti/Riemann--Hilbert theorem: varying the coefficients along the Morita $(2,1)$-groupoid, the fixed-coefficient equivalences are compatible with transport and hence induce a biequivalence of Grothendieck totals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complete toric variety. We give a criterion to decide whether $X$ decomposes as a product of complete toric varieties by analyzing the $1$-skeleton of its fan. More precisely, we prove that any direct-sum decomposition of the 1-skeleton induces a corresponding direct-sum decomposition of the fan itself. As an application, we show that if the identity component of the automorphism group is semisimple, then $X$ must be a product of projective spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we solve an open question formulated in the original paper of twisted skew group codes regarding when a twisted skew group code is checkable. Also, we prove that all ideals of dimension 3 over a twisted group algebra are abelian group codes, generalising another previous result over group algebras. Finally, we prove a bound on the dimension and distance of a twisted group code, as well as when such bound is reached.</description>

      <title>Abelian varieties are de Rham $K(\pi,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Esnault-Hai, one has the notion of de Rham $K(\pi,1)$ schemes, defined as follows. Given a smooth proper geometrically connected scheme $X$ over a field $k$ of characteristic 0 and a base point $x \in X (k)$, one can define its differential fundamental group $\pi^{\mathrm{diff}}(X/k)$, which comes from the Tannakian duality of the category of coherent integrable connections on $X$. Using the formalism of $\delta$-functors, one can define natural morphisms between the group-scheme cohomology of $\pi^{\mathrm{diff}}(X/k)$ and the de Rham cohomology of $X$. One says that $X$ with $x\in X(k)$ is de Rham $K(\pi,1)$ if such morphisms are all isomorphisms. In this article, we first prove that abelian varieties in characteristic $0$ are de Rham $K(\pi,1)$. In the second part of the article, we study the group-scheme cohomology of the abelianization of the differential fundamental group of a smooth proper geometrically connected scheme via its Albanese variety.</description>

      <title>On cellular rational approximations to $\zeta(5)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse a certain family of cellular integrals, which are period integrals on the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,8}$ of curves of genus zero with eight marked points, and give rise to simultaneous rational approximations to $\zeta(3)$ and $\zeta(5)$. By exploiting the action of a large symmetry group on these integrals, we construct an infinite $effective$ sequence of rational approximations $p/q$ to $\zeta(5)$ satisfying \[ 0&lt;\bigg|\zeta(5)-\frac pq\bigg|&lt;\frac1{q^{0.86}}. \]</description>

      <title>$(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over relatively discrete algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over rings which are "combinations of discrete algebras and affinoid $\mathbb{Q}_p$-algebras", and prove basic results such as the existence of a fully faithful functor from the category of Galois representations, the deperfection of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over perfect period rings, and the dualizability of the cohomology of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules, and the classification of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules of rank $1$. This work is motivated by the categorical $p$-adic Langlands correspondence for locally analytic representations, as proposed by Emerton-Gee-Hellmann, and the $GL_1$ case, as formulated and proved by Rodrigues Jacinto-Rodr\'iguez Camargo.</description>

      <title>Emergent Strings in Type IIB Calabi--Yau Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of Type IIB compactifications on Calabi--Yau threefolds, in light of the Emergent String Conjecture. We focus on the so-called type II limits, which, based on the asymptotic behaviour of the physical couplings in the low-energy effective theory, are candidates for emergent string limits. However, due to the absence of Type IIB branes of suitable dimensionality, the emergence of a unique critical string accompanied by a tower of Kaluza--Klein states has so far remained elusive. By considering a broad class of type II$_b$ limits, corresponding to so-called Tyurin degenerations, and studying the asymptotic behaviour of four-dimensional EFT strings in this geometry, we argue that the worldsheet theory of the latter describes a unique critical heterotic string on $T^2\times\mathrm{K3}$ with a gauge bundle whose rank depends on $b$. In addition, we establish the presence of an infinite tower of BPS particles arising from wrapped D3-branes by identifying a suitable set of special Lagrangian 3-cycles in the geometry. The associated BPS invariants are conjectured to be counted by generalisations of modular forms. As a consistency check, we further show that in special cases mirror symmetry identifies the EFT strings with the well-understood emergent string limits in the K\"ahler moduli space of Type IIA compactifications on K3-fibred Calabi--Yau threefolds. Finally, we discuss the implications of the Emergent String Conjecture for type II limits which do not correspond to Tyurin degenerations, and predict new constraints on the possible geometries of type II degenerations which resemble those arising in the Kulikov classification of degenerations of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Finiteness and duality of cohomology of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules and the 6-functor formalism of locally analytic representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finiteness and duality of cohomology of families of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules were proved by Kedlaya-Pottharst-Xiao. In this paper, we study solid locally analytic representations introduced by Rodrigues Jacinto-Rodr\'iguez Camargo in terms of analytic stacks and 6-functor formalisms, which are developed by Clausen-Scholze, Heyer-Mann, respectively. By using this, we provide a generalization of the result of Kedlaya-Pottharst-Xiao, giving a new proof for cases already proved there.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of the modularity of an abelian variety defined over the rational number field extending the modularity of an elliptic curve. We discuss the modularity of an abelian variety over the rational number field. We conjecture that a simple abelian variety over the rational number field is modular.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral K\"ahler metrics on $\mathbb{CP}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of polyhedral K\"ahler metrics on $\mathbb{CP}^n$ whose singular set is a hyperplane arrangement and whose cone angles are in $(0, 2\pi)$. These conditions take the form of linear and quadratic constraints on the cone angles and are entirely determined by the intersection poset of the arrangement. Our proof of existence relies on a parabolic version of the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence, due to T. Mochizuki.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Kato-Kuzumaki's properties under field extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1986, Kato and Kuzumaki introduced some Diophantine properties of fields, called the $C_i^q$ properties, and they hoped they would provide a good characterization of the cohomological dimension of fields. In this paper, we study the stability of some variants of the $C_i^q$ properties under transcendental and algebraic extensions. As an application, we obtain the $C_n^1$ property for the field $\mathbf{F}_p(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry for Spin-Adapted Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</description>
