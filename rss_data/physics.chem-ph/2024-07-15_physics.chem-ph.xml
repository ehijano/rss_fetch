      <title>"Best" iterative coupled-cluster triples model: More evidence for 3CC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To follow up on the unexpectedly-good performance of several coupled-cluster models with approximate inclusion of 3-body clusters [J. Chem. Phys. 151, 064102 (2019)] we performed a more complete assessment of the 3CC method [J. Chem. Phys. 125, 204105 (2006)] for accurate computational thermochemistry in the standard HEAT framework. New spin-integrated implementation of the 3CC method applicable to closed- and open-shell systems utilizes a new automated toolchain for derivation, optimization, and evaluation of operator algebra in many-body electronic structure. We found that with a double-zeta basis set the 3CC correlation energies and their atomization energy contributions are almost always more accurate (with respect to the CCSDTQ reference) than the CCSDT model as well as the standard CCSD(T) model. The mean absolute errors in cc-pVDZ {3CC, CCSDT, and CCSD(T)} electronic (per valence electron) and atomization energies relative to the CCSDTQ reference for the HEAT dataset [J. Chem. Phys. 121, 11599 (2004)], were {24, 70, 122} $\mu E_h/e$ and {0.46, 2.00, 2.58} kJ/mol, respectively. The mean absolute errors in the complete-basis-set limit {3CC, CCSDT, and CCSD(T)} atomization energies relative to the HEAT model reference, were {0.52, 2.00, and 1.07} kJ/mol, The significant and systematic reduction of the error by the 3CC method and its lower cost than CCSDT suggests it as a viable candidate for post-CCSD(T) thermochemistry applications, as well as the preferred alternative to CCSDT in general.</description>

      <title>Reference CC3 Excitation Energies for Organic Chromophores: Benchmarking TD-DFT, BSE/$GW$ and Wave Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To expand the QUEST database of highly-accurate vertical transition energies, we consider a series of large organic chromogens ubiquitous in dye chemistry, such as anthraquinone, azobenzene, BODIPY, and naphthalimide. We compute, at the CC3 level of theory, the singlet and triplet vertical transition energies associated with the low-lying excited states. This leads to a collection of more than 120 new highly-accurate excitation energies. Subsequently, we employ these reference values to benchmark a series of lower-order wave function approaches, including the popular ADC(2) and CC2 schemes, as well as time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT), both with and without applying the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA). At the TD-DFT level, we evaluate a large panel of global, range-separated, local, and double hybrid functionals. Additionally, we assess the performance of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism relying on both $G_0W_0$ and ev$GW$ quasiparticle energies evaluated from various starting points. It turns out that CC2 and ADC(2.5) are the most accurate models amongst those with respective $\mathcal{O}(N^5)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ scalings with system size. In contrast, CCSD does not outperform CC2. The best performing exchange-correlation functionals include BMK, M06-2X, M06-SX, CAM-B3LYP, $\omega$B97X-D, and LH20t, with average deviations of approximately 0.20 eV or slightly below. Errors on vertical excitation energies can be further reduced by considering double hybrids. Both SOS-$\omega$B88PP86 and SOS-$\omega$PBEPP86 exhibit particularly attractive performances with overall quality on par with CC2, whereas PBE0-DH and PBE-QIDH are only slightly less efficient. BSE/ev$GW$ calculations based on Kohn-Sham starting points have been found to be particularly effective for singlet transitions, but much less for their triplet counterparts.</description>

      <title>Long-range configuration interaction with an ab initio short-range correction and an asymptotic lower bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-range corrections to long-range selected configuration interaction calculations are derived from perturbation theory considerations and applied to harmonium (with two to six electrons for some low-lying states). No fitting to reference data is used, and the method is applicable to ground and excited states. The formulas derived are rigorous when the physical interaction is approached. In this regime, the second-order expression provides a lower bound to the long-range full configuration interaction energy. A long-range/short-range separation of the interaction between electrons at a distance of the order of one atomic unit provides total energies within chemical accuracy, and, for the systems studied, provide better results than short-range density functional approximations.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine-to-rotational energy transfer in ultracold atom-molecule collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy transfer between different mechanical degrees of freedom in atom-molecule collisions has been widely studied and largely understood. However, systems involving spins remain less explored, especially with a state-to-state precision. Here, we directly observed the energy transfer from atomic hyperfine to molecular rotation in the $^{87}$Rb ($|F_a,M_{F_a}\rangle = |2,2\rangle$) + $^{40}$K$^{87}$Rb (in the rovibronic ground state $N=0$) $\longrightarrow$ Rb ($ |1,1\rangle$) + KRb ($N=0,1,2$) exothermic collision. We probed the quantum states of the collision products using resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization followed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We also carried out state-of-the-art quantum scattering calculations, which rigorously take into account the coupling between the spin and rotational degrees of freedom at short range, and assume that the KRb monomer can be treated as a rigid rotor moving on a single potential energy surface. The calculated product rotational state distribution deviates from the observations even after extensive tuning of the atom-molecule potential energy surface, suggesting that vibrational degrees of freedom and conical intersections play an important part in ultracold Rb + KRb collisions. Additionally, our ab initio calculations indicate that spin-rotation coupling is dramatically enhanced near a conical intersection, which is energetically accessible at short range. The observations confirm that spin is coupled to mechanical rotation at short range and establish a benchmark for future theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence-detected two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy of a single molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is a powerful method that avoids ensemble averaging, but its temporal resolution is limited by the fluorescence lifetime to nanoseconds at most. At the ensemble level, two-dimensional spectroscopy provides insight into ultrafast femtosecond processes such as energy transfer and line broadening, even beyond the Fourier limit, by correlating pump and probe spectra. Here, we combine these two techniques and demonstrate 2D spectroscopy of individual molecules at room temperature using the example of dibenzoterrylene (DBT) in a polymer matrix. We excite the molecule in a confocal microscope with a phase-modulated train of femtosecond pulses and detect the emitted fluorescence with single-photon counting detectors. Using a phase sensitive detection scheme, we were able to measure the nonlinear 2D spectra of most of the DBT molecules we studied. Our method is applicable to a wide range of single emitters and opens new avenues for understanding energy transfer in single quantum objects on ultrafast time scales.</description>

      <title>Grain boundaries control lithiation of solid solution substrates in lithium metal batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of sustainable transportation and communication systems requires an increase in both energy density and capacity retention of Li-batteries. Using substrates forming a solid solution with body centered cubic Li enhances the cycle stability of anode-less batteries. However, it remains unclear how the substrate microstructure affects the lithiation behavior. Here, we deploy a correlative, near-atomic scale probing approach through combined ion- and electron-microscopy to examine the distribution of Li in Li-Ag diffusion couples as model system. We reveal that Li regions with over 93.8% at.% nucleate within Ag at random high angle grain boundaries, whereas grain interiors are not lithiated. We evidence the role of kinetics and mechanical constraint from the microstructure over equilibrium thermodynamics in dictating the lithiation process. The findings suggest that grain size and grain boundary character are critical to enhance the electrochemical performance of interlayers/electrodes, particularly for improving lithiation kinetics and hence reducing dendrite formation.</description>

      <title>Effect of strength of gravitational field on the rate of chemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.05285v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnitude of the rate of chemical reactions also depends on the position in the gravitational field, where a chemical reaction is being carried out. At weaker gravitational field rate of reaction is greater than the rate of reaction at the stronger gravitational field provided temperature and pressure are kept constant at two positions in the gravitational field. Effect of gravity on the rates of reactions has been shown by formulating the rate constants from basic theories of chemical kinetics i.e. transition state theory, collision theory, RRKM and Marcus theory in the language of the general theory of relativity. Gravitational transformation of Boltzmann constant and energy quantum levels of molecules has been developed quantum mechanically. Gravitational transformation of thermodynamic state functions has been formulated that successfully explains quasi-equilibrium existing between reactants and activated complex; at different gravitational fields. Gravitational mass dilation has been developed that explains at higher gravitational fields the transition states possess more kinetic energy to sweep translation on the reaction coordinate, resulting in the faster conversion of reactants into products. Gravitational transformation of the half-life equation shows gravitational time dilation for the half-life period of chemical reactions and thus renders the general theory of relativity and present theory are in accord with each other.</description>

      <title>3DReact: Geometric deep learning for chemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric deep learning models, which incorporate the relevant molecular symmetries within the neural network architecture, have considerably improved the accuracy and data efficiency of predictions of molecular properties. Building on this success, we introduce 3DReact, a geometric deep learning model to predict reaction properties from three-dimensional structures of reactants and products. We demonstrate that the invariant version of the model is sufficient for existing reaction datasets. We illustrate its competitive performance on the prediction of activation barriers on the GDB7-22-TS, Cyclo-23-TS and Proparg-21-TS datasets in different atom-mapping regimes. We show that, compared to existing models for reaction property prediction, 3DReact offers a flexible framework that exploits atom-mapping information, if available, as well as geometries of reactants and products (in an invariant or equivariant fashion). Accordingly, it performs systematically well across different datasets, atom-mapping regimes, as well as both interpolation and extrapolation tasks.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) inspired mixed basis sets for small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods such as Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods is that these methods are all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips Kleinman and PAW methods we show that there is an all electron formulation. In the all electron formulation there are regular low wavevector basis wave functions and several, specially chosen, high wavevector basis wave functions that are specialized to the atomic environment. Using this as inspiration here we propose a new, PAW method inspired, basis set for small molecules, where we use the recently introduced LO or lo (Localized orbitals) basis set is paired with a Gaussian basis, Gaussian type orbitals (GTO), for a hybrid basis for small molecules. Contracted Gaussian functions are also possible (CGFs). We also show how to extend this idea to Slater basis set, Slater type orbitals (STO), instead of GTO orbitals combined with LO or lo orbitals.</description>
