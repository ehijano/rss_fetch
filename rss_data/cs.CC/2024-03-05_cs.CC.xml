      <title>Atropos-k is PSPACE-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burke and Teng introduced a two-player combinatorial game Atropos based on Sperner's lemma, and showed that deciding whether one has a winning strategy for Atropos is PSPACE-complete. In the original Atropos game, the players must color a node adjacent to the last colored node. Burke and Teng also mentioned a variant Atropos-k in which each move is at most of distance k of the previous move, and asked a question on determining the computational complexity of this variant. In this paper, we answer this question by showing that for any fixed integer k (k&gt;=2), Atropos-k is PSPACE-complete by reduction from True Quantified Boolean Formula (TQBF).</description>

      <title>Towards Deterministic Algorithms for Constant-Depth Factors of Constant-Depth Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a deterministic subexponential time algorithm that takes as input a multivariate polynomial $f$ computed by a constant-depth circuit over rational numbers, and outputs a list $L$ of circuits (of unbounded depth and possibly with division gates) that contains all irreducible factors of $f$ computable by constant-depth circuits. This list $L$ might also include circuits that are spurious: they either do not correspond to factors of $f$ or are not even well-defined, e.g. the input to a division gate is a sub-circuit that computes the identically zero polynomial.
  The key technical ingredient of our algorithm is a notion of the pseudo-resultant of $f$ and a factor $g$, which serves as a proxy for the resultant of $g$ and $f/g$, with the advantage that the circuit complexity of the pseudo-resultant is comparable to that of the circuit complexity of $f$ and $g$. This notion, which might be of independent interest, together with the recent results of Limaye, Srinivasan and Tavenas, helps us derandomize one key step of multivariate polynomial factorization algorithms - that of deterministically finding a good starting point for Newton Iteration for the case when the input polynomial as well as the irreducible factor of interest have small constant-depth circuits.</description>

      <title>Bounded Depth Frege Lower Bounds for Random 3-CNFs via Deterministic Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major open problem in proof complexity is to show that random 3-CNFs with linear number of clauses require super-polynomial size refutations in bounded depth Frege. We make a first step towards this question by showing a super-linear lower bound: for every $k$, there exists $\epsilon &gt; 0$ such that any depth-$k$ Frege refutation of a random $n$-variable 3-CNF with $\Theta(n)$ clauses has $\Omega(n^{1 + \epsilon})$ steps w.h.p. Our proof involves a novel adaptation of the deterministic restriction technique of Chaudhuri and Radhakrishnan (STOC'96).</description>

      <title>Phase Transition of a Non-Linear Opinion Dynamics with Noisy Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several real \emph{Multi-Agent Systems} (MAS), it has been observed that only weaker forms of\emph{metastable consensus} are achieved, in which a large majority of agents agree on some  opinion  while other opinions continue to be supported  by  a (small) minority of agents. In this work, we take a step towards the investigation of metastable consensus for complex (non-linear) \emph{opinion dynamics} by considering the famous \undecided dynamics in the binary setting, which is known to reach consensus exponentially faster than the \voter dynamics.   We propose a simple form of uniform noise in which each message can change to another one with probability $p$ and we prove that the persistence of a \emph{metastable consensus} undergoes a \emph{phase transition} for $p=\frac 16$. In detail, below this threshold, we prove the system  reaches with high probability a metastable regime where  a large majority of agents keeps supporting the same opinion  for polynomial time. Moreover, this opinion turns out to be the initial majority opinion, whenever the initial bias is slightly larger than its standard deviation.On the contrary, above the threshold, we show that the information about the initial majority opinion is  "lost" within  logarithmic time even when the initial bias is maximum.Interestingly, using a simple coupling argument, we show the equivalence between our noisy model above and the model where a subset of agents behave in a \emph{stubborn} way.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition of the 3-Majority Dynamics with Uniform Communication Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.03543v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Communication noise is a common feature in several real-world scenarios where systems of agents need to communicate in order to pursue some collective task. In particular, many biologically inspired systems that try to achieve agreements on some opinion must implement resilient dynamics that are not strongly affected by noisy communications. In this work, we study the popular 3-Majority dynamics, an opinion dynamics which has been proved to be an efficient protocol for the majority consensus problem, in which we introduce a simple feature of uniform communication noise, following (d'Amore et al. 2020). We prove that in the fully connected communication network of n agents and in the binary opinion case, the process induced by the 3-Majority dynamics exhibits a phase transition. For a noise probability $p &lt; 1/3$, the dynamics reaches in logarithmic time an almost-consensus metastable phase which lasts for a polynomial number of rounds with high probability. Furthermore, departing from previous analyses, we further characterize this phase by showing that there exists an attractive equilibrium value $s_{\text{eq}} \in [n]$ for the bias of the system, i.e. the difference between the majority community size and the minority one. Moreover, the agreement opinion turns out to be the initial majority one if the bias towards it is of magnitude $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$ in the initial configuration. If, instead, $p &gt; 1/3$, no form of consensus is possible, and any information regarding the initial majority opinion is lost in logarithmic time with high probability. Despite more communications per-round are allowed, the 3-Majority dynamics surprisingly turns out to be less resilient to noise than the Undecided-State dynamics (d'Amore et al. 2020), whose noise threshold value is $p = 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Envy-Free House Allocation with Minimum Subsidy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: House allocation refers to the problem where $m$ houses are to be allocated to $n$ agents so that each agent receives one house. Since an envy-free house allocation does not always exist, we consider finding such an allocation in the presence of subsidy. We show that computing an envy-free allocation with minimum subsidy is NP-hard in general, but can be done efficiently if $m$ differs from $n$ by an additive constant or if the agents have identical utilities.</description>

      <title>Online Locality Meets Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs) from the classical LOCAL model to a number of other models that have been studied recently, including the quantum-LOCAL model, finitely-dependent processes, non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL model, and online-LOCAL model [e.g. STOC 2024, ICALP 2023].
  First, we demonstrate the advantage that finitely-dependent processes have over the classical LOCAL model. We show that all LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\log^* n)$ in the LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution (with constant locality). In particular, this gives a finitely-dependent coloring for regular trees, answering an open question by Holroyd [2023]. This also introduces a new formal barrier for understanding the distributed quantum advantage: it is not possible to exclude quantum advantage for any LCL in the $\Theta(\log^* n)$ complexity class by using non-signaling arguments.
  Second, we put limits on the capabilities of all of these models. To this end, we introduce a model called randomized online-LOCAL, which is strong enough to simulate e.g. SLOCAL and dynamic-LOCAL, and we show that it is also strong enough to simulate any non-signaling distribution and hence any quantum-LOCAL algorithm. We prove the following result for trees: if we can solve an LCL problem with locality $o(\log^{(5)} n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL model, we can solve it with locality $O(\log^* n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model.
  Put together, these results show that in trees the set of LCLs that can be solved with locality $O(\log^* n)$ is the same across all these models: locality $O(\log^* n)$ in quantum-LOCAL, non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL, or online-LOCAL is not stronger than locality $O(\log^* n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model.</description>

      <title>Payment Scheduling in the Interval Debt Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The network-based study of financial systems has received considerable attention in recent years but has seldom explicitly incorporated the dynamic aspects of such systems. We consider this problem setting from the temporal point of view and introduce the Interval Debt Model (IDM) and some scheduling problems based on it, namely: Bankruptcy Minimization/Maximization, in which the aim is to produce a payment schedule with at most/at least a given number of bankruptcies; Perfect Scheduling, the special case of the minimization variant where the aim is to produce a schedule with no bankruptcies (that is, a perfect schedule); and Bailout Minimization, in which a financial authority must allocate a smallest possible bailout package to enable a perfect schedule. We show that each of these problems is NP-complete, in many cases even on very restricted input instances. On the positive side, we provide for Perfect Scheduling a polynomial-time algorithm on (rooted) out-trees although in contrast we prove NP-completeness on directed acyclic graphs, as well as on instances with a constant number of nodes (and hence also constant treewidth). When we allow non-integer payments, we show by a linear programming argument that the problem Bailout Minimization can be solved in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Approximately Counting Answers to Conjunctive Queries with Disequalities and Negations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.12468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of approximating the number of answers to a small query $\varphi$ in a large database $\mathcal{D}$. We establish an exhaustive classification into tractable and intractable cases if $\varphi$ is a conjunctive query with disequalities and negations:
  $\bullet$ If there is a constant bound on the arity of $\varphi$, and if the randomised Exponential Time Hypothesis (rETH) holds, then the problem has a fixed-parameter tractable approximation scheme (FPTRAS) if and only if the treewidth of $\varphi$ is bounded.
  $\bullet$ If the arity is unbounded and we allow disequalities only, then the problem has an FPTRAS if and only if the adaptive width of $\varphi$ (a width measure strictly more general than treewidth) is bounded; the lower bound relies on the rETH as well.
  Additionally we show that our results cannot be strengthened to achieve a fully polynomial randomised approximation scheme (FPRAS): We observe that, unless $\mathrm{NP} =\mathrm{RP}$, there is no FPRAS even if the treewidth (and the adaptive width) is $1$. However, if there are neither disequalities nor negations, we prove the existence of an FPRAS for queries of bounded fractional hypertreewidth, strictly generalising the recently established FPRAS for conjunctive queries with bounded hypertreewidth due to Arenas, Croquevielle, Jayaram and Riveros (STOC 2021).</description>

      <title>On the hull and interval numbers of oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, for a given oriented graph $D$, we study its interval and hull numbers, respectively, in the oriented geodetic, P3 and P3* convexities. This last one, we believe to be formally defined and first studied in this paper, although its undirected version is well-known in the literature.
  Concerning bounds, for a strongly oriented graph D, and the oriented geodetic convexity, we prove that $ohng(D)\leq m(D)-n(D)+2$ and that there is at least one such that $ohng(D) = m(D)-n(D)$. We also determine exact values for the hull numbers in these three convexities for tournaments, which imply polynomial-time algorithms to compute them. These results allow us to deduce polynomial-time algorithms to compute $ohnp(D)$ when the underlying graph of $D$ is split or cobipartite.
  Moreover, we provide a meta-theorem by proving that if deciding whether $oing(D)\leq k$ or $ohng(D)\leq k$ is NP-hard or W[i]-hard parameterized by $k$, for some $i\in\mathbb{Z_+^*}$, then the same holds even if the underlying graph of $D$ is bipartite. Next, we prove that deciding whether $ohnp(D)\leq k$ or $ohnps(D)\leq k$ is W[2]-hard parameterized by $k$, even if $D$ is acyclic and its underlying graph is bipartite; that deciding whether $ohng(D)\leq k$ is W[2]-hard parameterized by $k$, even if $D$ is acyclic; that deciding whether $oinp(D)\leq k$ or $oinps(D)\leq k$ is NP-complete, even if $D$ has no directed cycles and the underlying graph of $D$ is a chordal bipartite graph; and that deciding whether $oinp(D)\leq k$ or $oinps(D)\leq k$ is W[2]-hard parameterized by $k$, even if the underlying graph of $D$ is split.
  Finally, also argue that the interval and hull numbers in the oriented P3 and P3* convexities can be computed in cubic time for graphs of bounded clique-width by using Courcelle's theorem.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Logical Zonotopes: A Set Representation for Reachability Analysis of Logical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set representation called polynomial logical zonotopes for performing exact and computationally efficient reachability analysis on logical systems. Polynomial logical zonotopes are a generalization of logical zonotopes, which are able to represent up to 2^n binary vectors using only n generators. Due to their construction, logical zonotopes are only able to support exact computations of some logical operations (XOR, NOT, XNOR), while other operations (AND, NAND, OR, NOR) result in over-approximations in the reduced space, i.e., generator space. In order to perform all fundamental logical operations exactly, we formulate a generalization of logical zonotopes that is constructed by dependent generators and exponent matrices. We prove that through this polynomial-like construction, we are able to perform all of the fundamental logical operations (XOR, NOT, XNOR, AND, NAND, OR, NOR) exactly in the generator space. While we are able to perform all of the logical operations exactly, this comes with a slight increase in computational complexity compared to logical zonotopes. We show that we can use polynomial logical zonotopes to perform exact reachability analysis while retaining a low computational complexity. To illustrate and showcase the computational benefits of polynomial logical zonotopes, we present the results of performing reachability analysis on two use cases: (1) safety verification of an intersection crossing protocol and (2) reachability analysis on a high-dimensional Boolean function. Moreover, to highlight the extensibility of logical zonotopes, we include an additional use case where we perform a computationally tractable exhaustive search for the key of a linear feedback shift register.</description>

      <title>Flat origami is Turing Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat origami refers to the folding of flat, zero-curvature paper such that the finished object lies in a plane. Mathematically, flat origami consists of a continuous, piecewise isometric map $f:P\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$ along with a layer ordering $\lambda_f:P\times P\to \{-1,1\}$ that tracks which points of $P$ are above/below others when folded. The set of crease lines that a flat origami makes (i.e., the set on which the mapping $f$ is non-differentiable) is called its \textit{crease pattern}. Flat origami mappings and their layer orderings can possess surprisingly intricate structure. For instance, determining whether or not a given straight-line planar graph drawn on $P$ is the crease pattern for some flat origami has been shown to be an NP-complete problem, and this result from 1996 led to numerous explorations in computational aspects of flat origami. In this paper we prove that flat origami, when viewed as a computational device, is Turing complete. We do this by showing that flat origami crease patterns with \textit{optional creases} (creases that might be folded or remain unfolded depending on constraints imposed by other creases or inputs) can be constructed to simulate Rule 110, a one-dimensional cellular automaton that was proven to be Turing complete by Matthew Cook in 2004.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom and Pseudoentangled States from Subset States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudorandom states (PRS) are an important primitive in quantum cryptography. In this paper, we show that subset states can be used to construct PRSs. A subset state with respect to $S$, a subset of the computational basis, is \[
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{|S|}}\sum_{i\in S} |i\rangle. \] As a technical centerpiece, we show that for any fixed subset size $|S|=s$ such that $s = 2^n/\omega(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ and $s=\omega(\mathrm{poly}(n))$, where $n$ is the number of qubits, a random subset state is information-theoretically indistinguishable from a Haar random state even provided with polynomially many copies. This range of parameter is tight. Our work resolves a conjecture by Ji, Liu and Song. Since subset states of small size have small entanglement across all cuts, this construction also illustrates a pseudoentanglement phenomenon.</description>
