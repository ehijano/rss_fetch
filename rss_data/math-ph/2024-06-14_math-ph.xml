      <title>Alternative representation of Magnus series by exact proper operator exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report the emphasis is on an alternative representation of the Magnus series by proper operator (matrix) exponential solutions to differential equations (systems), both linear and nonlinear ODEs and PDEs. The main idea here is in \emph{exact} \emph{linear} representations of the \emph{nonlinear} DEs. We proceeded from Dyson's time-ordered solutions, and using only generalizations of the well-known Baker-Campbell- Hausdorff (BCH) and Zassenhaus formulae for $t$-dependent operators directly converted them to simple proper operator exponents. The method being explicit both in terms of the operator and in terms of expressing the formal solution as an ordinary exponential, makes it quite easy to calculate analytical expressions to solutions in the form of a Taylor function series in one variable $t$. If introduce a mutually invertible change of variable $t$ into the original equations and then find a solution to this new equation in the form with ordinary exponential, one can obtain a completely different Taylor expansion of the desired function. The essence of this method comes down to resuming the series.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the auxetic behavior of anisotropic laminates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic laminates with a negative Poisson's ratio for at least some directions are called auxetic. In this paper, we consider the conditions for optimizing the auxeticity of an orthotropic laminate, namely: for a laminate composed by a given material, (i) how to obtain the lowest, i.e. the highest negative, Poisson's ratio and (ii) how to maximize the auxetic zone, i.e. the set of directions where the Poisson's ratio is negative. It is shown that in both the cases the optimal solution is found on the boundary of the feasible domain and in particular that it can be obtained using angle-ply sequences of identical layers. The polar method with dimensionless moduli is employed for representing the anisotropic behavior of the laminate, which allows, on the one hand, to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and, on the other hand, to have an effective mathematical representation of anisotropy by dimensionless invariants.</description>

      <title>Ground state energy of a dilute Bose gas with three-body hard-core interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a gas of bosons interacting through a three-body hard-core potential in the thermodynamic limit. We derive an upper bound on the ground state energy of the system at the leading order using a Jastrow factor. Our result matches the lower bound proven by Nam-Ricaud-Triay and therefore resolves the leading order. Moreover, a straightforward adaptation of our proof can be used for systems interacting via combined two-body and three-body interactions to generalise Theorem 1.2. from arXiv:2402.05646 to hard-core potentials.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Bohnenblust--Hille Inequality for qudit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous noncommutative Bohnenblust--Hille (BH) inequalities addressed operator decompositions in the tensor-product space $M_2(\mathbb{C})^{\otimes n}$; \emph{i.e.,} for systems of qubits \cite{HCP22,VZ23}. Here we prove noncommutative BH inequalities for operators decomposed in tensor-product spaces of arbitrary local dimension, \emph{i.e.,} $M_K(\mathbb{C})^{\otimes n}$ for any $K\geq2$ or on systems of $K$-level qudits. We treat operator decompositions in both the Gell-Mann and Heisenberg--Weyl basis, reducing to the recently-proved commutative hypercube BH \cite{DMP} and cyclic group BH \cite{SVZ} inequalities respectively. As an application we discuss learning qudit quantum observables.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the packing-field route to craft custom time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time crystals are many-body systems that spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, and thus exhibit long-range spatiotemporal order and robust periodic motion. Recent results have demonstrated how to build time-crystal phases in driven diffusive fluids using an external packing field coupled to density fluctuations. Here we exploit this mechanism to engineer and control on-demand custom continuous time crystals characterized by an arbitrary number of rotating condensates, which can be further enhanced with higher-order modes. We elucidate the underlying critical point, as well as general properties of the condensates density profiles and velocities, demonstrating a scaling property of higher-order traveling condensates in terms of first-order ones. We illustrate our findings by solving the hydrodynamic equations for various paradigmatic driven diffusive systems, obtaining along the way a number of remarkable results, e.g. the possibility of explosive time crystal phases characterized by an abrupt, first-order-type transition. Overall, these results demonstrate the versatility and broad possibilities of this promising route to time crystals.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Birkhoff-Violation in Operational Theories: Thermodynamic Implications and Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In accordance with the entropy principle of thermodynamics, under spontaneous evolutions, physical systems always evolve towards states with equal or greater randomness. But, where does this randomness originate? Renowned Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem, often referred to as Birkhoff theorem, identifies source of this randomness to be the stochastic application of reversible operations on the system under study, thereby ensuring its epistemic origin. Analogue of this theorem is known to fail in the quantum case. Here, we extend this investigation beyond quantum mechanics to a broader class of operational theories described within the framework of general probabilistic theories (GPTs). In this generalized framework, we establish Birkhoff-violation as the prevalent trait; in fact the asymptotic variant of the theorem gets violated. We then demonstrate that Birkhoff-violation in GPTs can lead to consequences that are atypical to quantum theory. For instance, we report manifestation of Birkhoff-violation in a communication task, which otherwise is not observed in quantum world. We also show that, unlike the quantum case, in other operational theories the state transformation criteria can be distinct under mixtures of reversible transformations and doubly stochastic evolutions, leading to different resource theories of purity. Despite these exotic implications, we analyze how to define a coherent notion of entropy in this generalized framework, while upholding alignment with von Neumann's thought experiment.</description>

      <title>The Dissipative Effect of Caputo--Time-Fractional Derivatives and its Implications for the Solutions of Nonlinear Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In honor of the great Russian mathematician A. N. Kolmogorov, we would like to draw attention in the present paper to a curious mathematical observation concerning fractional differential equations describing physical systems, whose time evolution for integer derivatives has a time-honored conservative form. This observation, although known to the general mathematical community, has not, in our view, been satisfactorily addressed. More specifically, we follow the recent exploration of Caputo-Riesz time-space-fractional nonlinear wave equation, in which two of the present authors introduced an energy-type functional and proposed a finite-difference scheme to approximate the solutions of the continuous model. The relevant Klein-Gordon equation considered here has the form: \begin{equation} \frac {\partial ^\beta \phi (x , t)} {\partial t ^\beta} - \Delta ^\alpha \phi (x , t) + F ^\prime (\phi (x , t)) = 0, \quad \forall (x , t) \in (-\infty,\infty) \end{equation} where we explore the sine-Gordon nonlinearity $F(\phi)=1-\cos(\phi)$ with smooth initial data. For $\alpha=\beta=2$, we naturally retrieve the exact, analytical form of breather waves expected from the literature. Focusing on the Caputo temporal derivative variation within $1&lt; \beta &lt; 2$ values for $\alpha=2$, however, we observe artificial dissipative effects, which lead to complete breather disappearance, over a time scale depending on the value of $\beta$. We compare such findings to single degree-of-freedom linear and nonlinear oscillators in the presence of Caputo temporal derivatives and also consider anti-damping mechanisms to counter the relevant effect. These findings also motivate some interesting directions for further study, e.g., regarding the consideration of topological solitary waves, such as kinks/antikinks and their dynamical evolution in this model.</description>

      <title>Quantum space-time Poincar\'e inequality for Lindblad dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mixing properties of primitive hypocoercive Lindblad dynamics. By extending the variational framework originally developed for underdamped Langevin dynamics, we derive fully explicit and constructive exponential decay estimates for the convergence in the noncommutative $L^2$-norm. Our analysis relies on establishing a quantum analog of space-time Poincar\'{e} inequalities. To complement these hypocoercive estimates, we also analyze the limiting behavior of the spectral gap for Lindblad dynamics with a large coherent contribution, providing sharper convergence rate estimates in this asymptotic regime. A number of concrete examples are provided as applications of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Sparse reconstruction in spin systems II: Ising and other factor of IID measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a sequence of Boolean functions $f_n : \{-1, 1\}^{V_n} \longrightarrow \{-1, 1\}$, with random input given by some probability measure $\mathbb{P}_n$, we say that there is sparse reconstruction for $f_n$ if there is a sequence of subsets $U_n \subseteq V_n$ of coordinates satisfying $|U_n| = o(|V_n|)$ such that knowing the spins in $U_n$ gives us a non-vanishing amount of information about the value of $f_n$.
  In the first part of this work, we showed that if the $\mathbb{P}_n$s are product measures, then no sparse reconstruction is possible for any sequence of transitive functions. In this sequel, we consider spin systems that are relatives of IID measures in one way or another, with our main focus being on the Ising model on finite transitive graphs or exhaustions of lattices. We prove that no sparse reconstruction is possible for the entire high temperature regime on Euclidean boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, while sparse reconstruction for the majority function of the spins is possible in the critical and low temperature regimes. We give quantitative bounds for two-dimensional boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, sharp in the latter case.
  The proofs employ several different methods, including factor of IID and FK random cluster representations, strong spatial mixing, a generalization of discrete Fourier analysis to Divide-and-Color models, and entropy inequalities.</description>

Abstract: Classical mechanical systems with internal constraints will be examined using the extended symplectic formalism of Faddeev-Jackiw. We will derive the generalized brackets of the theory and the corresponding equations of motion. The investigation will include the analysis of a gauge system, leading to the identification of associated gauge transformations. The obtained results will be compared with those obtained through the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, as previously documented in the literature. The symplectic approach turns out to be simpler and efficient compared to the Dirac methods in its mathematical operations, and easy for computer implementation.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative probability insights into the double-scaling limit SYK Model with constant perturbations: moments cumulants and $q$-independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending our previous results, we study the double-scaling limit SYK (DSSYK) model with an additional diagonal matrix with a fixed number $c$ of nonzero constant entries $\theta$. This constant diagonal term can be rewritten in terms of Majorana fermion products. Its specific formula depends on the value of $c$. We find exact expressions for the moments of this model. More importantly, by proposing a moment-cumulant relation, we reinterpret the effect of introducing a constant term in the context of non-commutative probability theory. This gives rise to a $\tilde{q}$ dependent mixture of independences within the moment formula. The parameter $\tilde{q}$, derived from the $q$-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck ($q$-OU) process, controls this transformation. It interpolates between classical independence ($\tilde{q}=1$) and Boolean independence ($\tilde{q}=0$). The underlying combinatorial structures of this model provide the non-commutative probability connections. Additionally, we explore the potential relation between these connections and their gravitational path integral counterparts.</description>

Abstract: Consider a topologically transitive unilateral countable Markov shift $\Sigma$, a locally constant potential $\phi : \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying suitable conditions, and assume that $\mu_t$ is the unique stationary Markov equilibrium state associated to the potential $t\phi$ for each $t \geq 1$. In this paper we prove a first level large deviations principle at zero temperature for the family of equilibrium states $(\mu_t)_{t \geq 1}$ and we extend the result to the setting of bilateral countable Markov shifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel and efficient approach for the computation of energy eigenvalues in quantum semiconductor heterostructures. Accurate determination of the electronic states in these heterostructures is crucial for understanding their optical and electronic properties, making it a key challenge in semiconductor physics. The proposed method is based on utilizing series expansions of zero-order Bessel functions to numerically solve the Schr\"odinger equation using boundary integral method for bound electron states in a computationally efficient manner. To validate the proposed technique, we applied it to address previously explored issues by other research groups. The results clearly demonstrate the computational efficiency and high precision of our approach. Notably, the proposed technique significantly reduces the computational time compared to the conventional method for searching the energy eigenvalues in quantum structures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic approach to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly in open quantum systems. Owing to nontrivial couplings to the environment, symmetries in such systems manifest as either strong or weak type. By representing their symmetry transformation through superoperators, we incorporate them in a unified framework that enables a direct calculation of their anomalies. In the case where the full symmetry group is $K\times G$, with $K$ the strong symmetry and $G$ the weak symmetry, we find that anomalies of bosonic systems are classified by $H^{d+2}(K\times G,U(1))/H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. To illustrate the power of anomalies in open quantum systems, we generally prove that anomaly must lead to nontrivial mixed-state quantum phases as long as the weak symmetry is imposed. Analogous to the ``anomaly matching" condition ensuring nontrivial low-energy physics in closed systems, anomaly also guarantees nontrivial steady states and long-time dynamics for open quantum systems governed by Lindbladians. Notably, we identify a novel $(1+1)$-D mixed-state quantum phase that has no counterpart in closed systems, where the steady state shows no nontrivial correlation function in the bulk, but displays spontaneous symmetry breaking order on the boundary, which is enforced by anomalies. We further establish the general relations between mixed-state anomalies and such unconventional boundary correlation. Finally, we explore the generalization of the ``anomaly inflow" mechanism in open quantum systems. We construct $(1+1)$-D and $(2+1)$-D Lindbladians whose steady states have mixed-state symmetry-protected-topological order in the bulk, with corresponding edge theories characterized by nontrivial anomalies.</description>

      <title>Constraints and Time Evolution in Generic $f$(Riemann) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a detailed canonical analysis of the $n$-dimensional $f$(Riemann) gravity, correcting the earlier results in the literature. We also write the field equations in the Fischer-Marsden form which is amenable to identifying the non-stationary energy on a spacelike hypersurface. We give pure $R^{2}$ theory as an example.</description>

      <title>Braided scalar quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate scalar field theories in a curved braided $L_\infty$-algebra formalism and analyse their correlation functions using Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. We perform detailed calculations in cubic braided scalar field theory up to two-loop order and three-point multiplicity. The divergent tadpole contributions are eliminated by a suitable choice of central curvature for the $L_\infty$-structure, and we confirm the absence of UV/IR mixing. The calculations of higher loop and higher multiplicity correlators in homological perturbation theory are facilitated by the introduction of a novel diagrammatic calculus. We derive an algebraic version of the Schwinger-Dyson equations based on the homological perturbation lemma, and use them to prove the braided Wick theorem.</description>

      <title>On the zeros of partition functions with multi-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be probability spaces, let $X$ be their direct product, let $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: X \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ be random variables, each depending only on a few coordinates of a point $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and let $f=\phi_1 + \ldots + \phi_m$. The expectation $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f}$, where $\lambda \in {\Bbb C}$, appears in statistical physics as the partition function of a system with multi-spin interactions, and also in combinatorics and computer science, where it is known as the partition function of edge-coloring models, tensor network contractions or a Holant polynomial. Assuming that each $\phi_i$ is 1-Lipschitz in the Hamming metric of $X$, that each $\phi_i(x)$ depends on at most $r \geq 2$ coordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of $x \in X$, and that for each $j$ there are at most $c \geq 1$ functions $\phi_i$ that depend on the coordinate $x_j$, we prove that $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f} \ne 0$ provided $| \lambda | \leq \ (3 c \sqrt{r-1})^{-1}$ and that the bound is sharp up to a constant factor. Taking a scaling limit, we prove a similar result for functions $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: {\Bbb R}^n \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ that are 1-Lipschitz in the $\ell^1$ metric of ${\Bbb R}^n$ and where the expectation is taken with respect to the standard Gaussian measure in ${\Bbb R}^n$. As a corollary, the value of the expectation can be efficiently approximated, provided $\lambda$ lies in a slightly smaller disc.</description>
