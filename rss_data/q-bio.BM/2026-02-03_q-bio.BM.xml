      <title>AutoBinder Agent: An MCP-Based Agent for End-to-End Protein Binder Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AI technologies for drug discovery are distributed across heterogeneous platforms-including web applications, desktop environments, and code libraries-leading to fragmented workflows, inconsistent interfaces, and high integration overhead. We present an agentic end-to-end drug design framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) in conjunction with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to dynamically coordinate access to biochemical databases, modular toolchains, and task-specific AI models. The system integrates four state-of-the-art components: MaSIF (MaSIF-site and MaSIF-seed-search) for geometric deep learning-based identification of protein-protein interaction (PPI) sites, Rosetta for grafting protein fragments onto protein backbones to form mini proteins, ProteinMPNN for amino acid sequences redesign, and AlphaFold3 for near-experimental accuracy in complex structure prediction. Starting from a target structure, the framework supports de novo binder generation via surface analysis, scaffold grafting and pose construction, sequence optimization, and structure prediction. Additionally, by replacing rigid, script-based workflows with a protocol-driven, LLM-coordinated architecture, the framework improves reproducibility, reduces manual overhead, and ensures extensibility, portability, and auditability across the entire drug design process.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Unsupervised Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying minimal and informative feature sets is a central challenge in data analysis, particularly when few data points are available. Here we present a theoretical analysis of an unsupervised feature selection pipeline based on the Differentiable Information Imbalance (DII). We consider the specific case of structural and physico-chemical features describing a set of proteins. We show that if one considers the features as coordinates of a (hypothetical) statistical physics model, this model undergoes a phase transition as a function of the number of retained features. For physico-chemical descriptors, this transition is between a glass-like phase when the features are few and a liquid-like phase. The glass-like phase exhibits bimodal order-parameter distributions and Binder cumulant minima. In contrast, for structural descriptors the transition is less sharp. Remarkably, for physico-chemical descriptors the critical number of features identified from the DII coincides with the saturation of downstream binary classification performance. These results provide a principled, unsupervised criterion for minimal feature sets in protein classification and reveal distinct mechanisms of criticality across different feature types.</description>

      <title>Controlling Repetition in Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have enabled advances in structure prediction and de novo protein design, yet they frequently collapse into pathological repetition during generation. Unlike in text, where repetition merely reduces readability, in proteins it undermines structural confidence and functional viability. To unify this problem, we present the first systematic study of repetition in PLMs. We first propose quantitative metrics to characterize motif-level and homopolymer repetition and then demonstrate their negative impact on folding reliability. To address this challenge, we propose UCCS (Utility-Controlled Contrastive Steering), which steers protein generation with a constrained dataset. Instead of naively contrasting high- vs. low-repetition sequences, we construct contrastive sets that maximize differences in repetition while tightly controlling for structural utility. This disentanglement yields steering vectors that specifically target repetition without degrading foldability. Injected at inference, these vectors consistently reduce repetition without retraining or heuristic decoding. Experiments with ESM-3 and ProtGPT2 in CATH, UniRef50, and SCOP show that our method outperforms decoding penalties and other baselines, substantially lowering repetition while preserving AlphaFold confidence scores. Our results establish repetition control as a central challenge for PLMs and highlight dataset-guided steering as a principled approach for reliable protein generation.</description>

      <title>ProDCARL: Reinforcement Learning-Aligned Diffusion Models for De Novo Antimicrobial Peptide Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance threatens healthcare sustainability and motivates low-cost computational discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). De novo peptide generation must optimize antimicrobial activity and safety through low predicted toxicity, but likelihood-trained generators do not enforce these goals explicitly. We introduce ProDCARL, a reinforcement-learning alignment framework that couples a diffusion-based protein generator (EvoDiff OA-DM 38M) with sequence property predictors for AMP activity and peptide toxicity. We fine-tune the diffusion prior on AMP sequences to obtain a domain-aware generator. Top-k policy-gradient updates use classifier-derived rewards plus entropy regularization and early stopping to preserve diversity and reduce reward hacking. In silico experiments show ProDCARL increases the mean predicted AMP score from 0.081 after fine-tuning to 0.178. The joint high-quality hit rate reaches 6.3\% with pAMP $&gt;$0.7 and pTox $&lt;$0.3. ProDCARL maintains high diversity, with $1-$mean pairwise identity equal to 0.929. Qualitative analyses with AlphaFold3 and ProtBERT embeddings suggest candidates show plausible AMP-like structural and semantic characteristics. ProDCARL serves as a candidate generator that narrows experimental search space, and experimental validation remains future work.</description>

      <title>SEISMO: Increasing Sample Efficiency in Molecular Optimization with a Trajectory-Aware LLM Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the structure of molecules to achieve desired properties is a central bottleneck across the chemical sciences, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry where it underlies the discovery of new drugs. Since molecular property evaluation often relies on costly and rate-limited oracles, such as experimental assays, molecular optimization must be highly sample-efficient. To address this, we introduce SEISMO, an LLM agent that performs strictly online, inference-time molecular optimization, updating after every oracle call without the need for population-based or batched learning. SEISMO conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, combining natural-language task descriptions with scalar scores and, when available, structured explanatory feedback. Across the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO achieves a 2-3 times higher area under the optimisation curve than prior methods, often reaching near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls. Our additional medicinal-chemistry tasks show that providing explanatory feedback further improves efficiency, demonstrating that leveraging domain knowledge and structured information is key to sample-efficient molecular optimization.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spatio-Temporal SE(3) Diffusion for Long-Horizon Protein Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain the gold standard for studying protein dynamics, but their computational cost limits access to biologically relevant timescales. Recent generative models have shown promise in accelerating simulations, yet they struggle with long-horizon generation due to architectural constraints, error accumulation, and inadequate modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics. We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals severe limitations in current models for long-horizon generation, while demonstrating that STAR-MD's joint spatio-temporal modeling enables robust dynamics simulation at biologically relevant timescales, paving the way for accelerated exploration of protein function.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Dataset for Molecular Structure-Language Description via a Rule-Regularized Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular function is largely determined by structure. Accurately aligning molecular structure with natural language is therefore essential for enabling large language models (LLMs) to reason about downstream chemical tasks. However, the substantial cost of human annotation makes it infeasible to construct large-scale, high-quality datasets of structure-grounded descriptions. In this work, we propose a fully automated annotation framework for generating precise molecular structure descriptions at scale. Our approach builds upon and extends a rule-based chemical nomenclature parser to interpret IUPAC names and construct enriched, structured XML metadata that explicitly encodes molecular structure. This metadata is then used to guide LLMs in producing accurate natural-language descriptions. Using this framework, we curate a large-scale dataset of approximately $163$k molecule-description pairs. A rigorous validation protocol combining LLM-based and expert human evaluation on a subset of $2,000$ molecules demonstrates a high description precision of $98.6\%$. The resulting dataset provides a reliable foundation for future molecule-language alignment, and the proposed annotation method is readily extensible to larger datasets and broader chemical tasks that rely on structural descriptions.</description>

      <title>MERGE-RNA: a physics-based model to predict RNA secondary structure ensembles with chemical probing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RNA function is deeply tied to secondary structure, with most molecules operating through dynamic and heterogeneous structural ensembles. While current analysis tools typically output single static structures or averaged contact maps, chemical probing methods like DMS capture nucleotide-resolution signals that represent the full structural ensemble, which however remain of difficult structural interpretation. To address this, we present MERGE-RNA, a framework that explicitly describes and outputs RNA as a structural ensemble. By modeling the experimental pipeline through a statistical physics framework, MERGE-RNA learns a small set of transferable and interpretable parameters, enabling the seamless integration of measurements across different molecules, probe concentrations, and replicates in a single optimization to improve robustness. Our model employs a maximum-entropy principle to predict thermodynamic populations, introducing only the minimal sequence-specific adjustments necessary to align the ensemble with experimental data. We validate MERGE-RNA on diverse RNAs, showing that it achieves strong structural accuracy and the ability to fill knowledge gaps in single-conformation reference structures. Furthermore, in a designed RNA construct for which we report new DMS data, MERGE-RNA deconvolves mixed states to reveal transient intermediate populations involved in strand displacement, dynamics that remain invisible to traditional analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Reaction Prediction via Interaction Modeling of Symmetric Difference Shingle Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06356v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction prediction remains a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry, where existing machine learning models face two critical limitations: sensitivity to input permutations (molecule/atom orderings) and inadequate modeling of substructural interactions governing reactivity. These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which extends the differential reaction fingerprint (DRFP) by representing shingles as continuous high-dimensional embeddings, capturing structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks. It shows enhanced robustness with an average improvement of 8.76% on R$^2$ under permutation perturbations.</description>
