      <title>Method for Evaluating the Number of Signal Sources and Application to Non-invasive Brain-computer Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a brief introduction of the mathematical theory behind the time series unfolding method.
  The algorithms presented serve as a valuable mathematical and analytical tool for analyzing data collected from brain-computer interfaces.
  In our study, we implement a mathematical model based on polyharmonic signals to interpret the data from brain-computer interface sensors.
  The analysis of data coming to the brain-computer interface sensors is based on a mathematical model of the signal in the form of a polyharmonic signal.
  Our main focus is on addressing the problem of evaluating the number of sources, or active brain oscillators.
  The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated through analysis of data recorded from a non-invasive brain-computer interface developed by the author.</description>

      <title>Neuropsychology of AI: Relationship Between Activation Proximity and Categorical Proximity Within Neural Categories of Synthetic Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuropsychology of artificial intelligence focuses on synthetic neural cog nition as a new type of study object within cognitive psychology. With the goal of making artificial neural networks of language models more explainable, this approach involves transposing concepts from cognitive psychology to the interpretive construction of artificial neural cognition. The human cognitive concept involved here is categorization, serving as a heuristic for thinking about the process of segmentation and construction of reality carried out by the neural vectors of synthetic cognition.</description>

      <title>Body Maps for Feeling of Creativity in Musical Chord Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how musical stimuli evoke feelings of creativity through predictive mechanisms, while also examining the role of interoceptive bodily sensations, particularly those linked to the heart and stomach regions. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between interoceptive sensibility and the intensity of the feeling of creativity. By employing body-mapping assessments and emotional evaluations on 353 participants exposed to various chord progressions, we revealed the critical role of heart sensations in eliciting feelings of creativity. Our findings indicate that musical chord progressions characterized by high uncertainty and surprise generated heightened feelings of creativity alongside increased arousal. Notably, heart sensations correlated positively with the feeling of creativity, suggesting the crucial role of interoceptive bodily sensations in the experience of creativity. In contrast, the feelings of beauty and valence were more strongly influenced by predictable, low-uncertainty progressions, suggesting that the feelings of creativity may operate through a somewhat different cognitive mechanism than that of beauty and valence. This study highlights the complex interplay between bodily sensations and feelings of creativity based on predictive processing. By framing creativity within the framework of interoception, our research contributes to a deeper understanding of the emotional and embodied processes that shape the experience of creativity. Future research should explore these relationships to enrich our comprehension of creativity in both artistic endeavors and everyday life.</description>

      <title>Are Grid Cells Hexagonal for Performance or by Convenience?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether the hexagonal structure of grid cells provides any performance benefits or if it merely represents a biologically convenient configuration. Utilizing the Vector-HaSH content addressable memory model as a model of the grid cell -- place cell network of the mammalian brain, we compare the performance of square and hexagonal grid cells in tasks of storing and retrieving spatial memories. Our experiments across different path types, path lengths and grid configurations, reveal that hexagonal grid cells perform similarly to square grid cells with respect to spatial representation and memory recall. Our results show comparable accuracy and robustness across different datasets and noise levels on images to recall. These findings suggest that the brain's use of hexagonal grids may be more a matter of biological convenience and ease of implementation rather than because they provide superior performance over square grid cells (which are easier to implement in silico).</description>

      <title>Linton Stereo Illusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new illusion that challenges our understanding of stereo vision. The illusion consists of a larger circle at 50cm, and smaller circle in front of it at 40cm, with constant angular sizes throughout. We move the larger circle forward by 10cm (to 40cm) and then back again (to 50cm). The question is, what distance should we move the smaller circle forward and back to maintain a constant perceived separation in depth between the circles? Constant physical distance (10cm) or constant retinal disparity (6.7cm)? Observers choose constant disparity. We therefore argue the 'Linton Stereo Illusion' appears to suggest that perceived stereo depth reflects retinal disparities rather than 3D geometry.</description>

      <title>COMPASS: Computational Mapping of Patient-Therapist Alliance Strategies with Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The therapeutic working alliance is a critical factor in predicting the success of psychotherapy treatment. Traditionally, working alliance assessment relies on questionnaires completed by both therapists and patients. In this paper, we present COMPASS, a novel framework to directly infer the therapeutic working alliance from the natural language used in psychotherapy sessions. Our approach utilizes advanced large language models (LLMs) to analyze transcripts of psychotherapy sessions and compare them with distributed representations of statements in the working alliance inventory. Analyzing a dataset of over 950 sessions covering diverse psychiatric conditions including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and suicidal tendencies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in providing fine-grained mapping of patient-therapist alignment trajectories and offering interpretability for clinical psychiatry and in identifying emerging patterns related to the condition being treated. By employing various deep learning-based topic modeling techniques in combination with prompting generative language models, we analyze the topical characteristics of different psychiatric conditions and their evolution at a turn-level resolution. This combined framework enhances the understanding of therapeutic interactions, enabling timely feedback for therapists regarding the quality of therapeutic relationships and providing interpretable insights to improve the effectiveness of psychotherapy.</description>
