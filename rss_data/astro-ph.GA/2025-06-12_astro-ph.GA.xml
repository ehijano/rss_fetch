      <title>The Cosmic Owl: Twin Active Collisional Ring Galaxies with Starburst Merging Front at $z=1.14$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers play a critical role in driving galaxy evolution, especially by transforming galaxy morphology, redistributing the gas around galaxies, triggering AGN activity and star formation. We present the Cosmic Owl, a galaxy merger at $z=1.14$, identified in the COSMOS field. Deep imaging and spectroscopy from JWST, ALMA, and VLA reveal a complex system of twin collisional ring galaxies, exhibiting a nearly identical morphology. The grism spectra from the JWST COSMOS-3D program confirm that both galaxies host an AGN. A bipolar radio jet from one AGN extends to strike the merging front. In addition, we detect a starburst at the merging front, characterized by luminous extended nebular line emission and a massive cold gas reservoir. This starburst is likely triggered by interstellar shocks induced by galaxy collision and the AGN jet. The twin ring structure of the Cosmic Owl requires further numerical simulations to clarify the precise conditions that lead to the formation of this rare morphology. This system exemplifies how shock-induced star formation, driven by galaxy collision or AGN jet, can act as a previously underappreciated yet crucial mechanism for efficient gas-to-star conversion and rapid stellar mass assembly in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Time-scales of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and dust continuum emission from gas clouds compared to molecular gas cloud lifetimes in PHANGS-JWST galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST mid-infrared (mid-IR) images, tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dust continuum emission, provide detailed views of the interstellar medium (ISM) in nearby galaxies. Leveraging PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 and PHANGS-MUSE data, we measure the PAH and dust continuum emission lifetimes of gas clouds across 17 nearby star-forming galaxies by analyzing the relative spatial distributions of mid-IR (7.7-11.3$\mu$m) and H$\alpha$ emission at various scales. We find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale of gas clouds in galaxy disks (excluding centers) ranges from 10 to 30Myr. After star formation is detected in H$\alpha$, mid-IR emission persists for 3-7Myr during the stellar feedback phase, covering 70-80% of the H$\alpha$ emission. This significant overlap is due to intense radiation from star-forming regions, illuminating the surrounding PAHs and dust grains. In most galaxies, the mid-IR time-scale closely matches the molecular cloud lifetime measured with CO. Although mid-IR emission is complex as influenced by ISM distribution, radiation, and abundances of dust and PAHs, the similarity between the two time-scales suggests that once gas clouds form with compact mid-IR emission, they quickly provide sufficient shielding for stable CO formation. This is likely due to our focus on molecular gas-rich regions of galaxies with near-solar metallicity. Finally, we find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale is longer in galaxies with well-defined HII regions and less structured backgrounds, allowing photons to more efficiently heat the ambient ISM surrounding the HII regions, rather than contributing to diffuse emission. This suggests that the shape of the ISM also influences mid-IR emission.</description>

      <title>Bayesian luminosity function estimation in multidepth datasets with selection effects: a case study for $3&lt;z&lt;5$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework designed to infer the luminosity function of any class of objects by jointly modeling data from multiple surveys with varying depth, completeness, and sky coverage. Our method explicitly accounts for selection effects and measurement uncertainties (e.g., in luminosity) and could be generalized to any extensive quantity, such as mass. We validate the model using mock catalogs, recovering how deep data reaching $\gtrsim 1.5$ dex below a characteristic luminosity $\tilde{L}^\star$ are essential to reduce biases at the faint end ($\lesssim 0.1$ dex), while wide-area data help constrain the bright end. As proof of concept, we consider a combined sample of 1176 Ly$\alpha$ emitters at redshift $3 &lt; z &lt; 5$ drawn from several MUSE surveys, ranging from ultra-deep ($\gtrsim 90$ hr) and narrow ($\lesssim 1$ arcmin$^2$) fields to shallow ($\lesssim 5$ hr) and wide ($\gtrsim 20$ arcmin$^2$) fields. With this complete sample, we constrain the luminosity function parameters $\log(\Phi^\star/\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}) = -2.86^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$, $\log(L^\star/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) = 42.72^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, and $\alpha = -1.81^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$, where the uncertainties represent the $90\%$ credible intervals. These values are in agreement with studies based on gravitational lensing that reach $\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \approx 41$, although differences in the faint-end slope underscore how systematic errors are starting to dominate. In contrast, wide-area surveys represent the natural extension needed to constrain the brightest Ly$\alpha$ emitters [$\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \gtrsim 43$], where statistical uncertainties still dominate.</description>

      <title>A novel method to trace the dark matter density profile around supermassive black holes with AGN reverberation mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method to determine the dark matter density profile in the vicinity of distant supermassive black holes (SMBH) using reverberation mapping measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN). For some AGN, the mapping of multiple emission lines allows us to measure the enclosed mass within different radii from the central SMBH, which allows us to infer or constrain the dark matter density profile on sub-pc scales. We find that for five out of fourteen AGN in our identified sample, the observed enclosed mass grows with radii, hinting evidence for the presence of a dark matter component at the 1-2 $\sigma$ level. For these sources, we find global evidence for a universal dark matter profile with a preferred radial steepness of index $\gamma \sim 1.6$, consistent with the scenario expected for a dark matter spike mildly relaxed by stellar heating processes. For the remaining AGN in our sample, we are able to derive upper limits on the dark matter density profile parameters. Interestingly, the strongest evidence for a dark matter component arises from the farthest object considered, 3C 390. This new method allows us to measure or constrain for the first time the dark matter density in the vicinity of extragalactic SMBHs, which is crucial to our understanding of the dynamics and nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Confirmation of a Remarkable Linear Trail of Galaxies in the NGC 1052 Field, Consistent with Formation in a High-Speed Bullet Dwarf Collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unique linear trail of diffuse galaxies was recently identified in the NGC 1052 field. This trail includes the remarkable, ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and DF4 which lack dark matter and host unusually luminous globular clusters. It has been proposed that the trail formed via a high-speed collision between two gas-rich dwarf galaxies. This scenario predicts that the trail galaxies are kinematically connected and follow a specific trend in radial velocity as a function of position, based on the known velocities and positions of DF2 and DF4. To test this hypothesis, we measured radial velocities for seven additional galaxies on the trail. While the galaxies' low surface brightnesses presented observational challenges, we employ several methods to obtain measurements for galaxies with effective surface brightnesses up to 28.6 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, including a narrow slit placed over globular clusters and a novel wide slit mode on Keck/LRIS, as well as a 'light bucket' mode on Keck/KCWI. We find that five of our seven targets follow the precise velocity trend predicted by DF2 and DF4, to a degree with just a 2% chance of randomly occurring. Moreover, the trail galaxies' radial velocities are significantly higher than those of the NGC 1052 group, setting it apart as a separate, kinematically connected system. Our findings support the theory that this trail of galaxies, including DF2 and DF4, formed together in a single event. A 'bullet dwarf' collision remains the only known explanation for all the unusual properties of DF2, DF4, and the associated trail of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Precipitation plausible: magnetized thermal instability in the intracluster medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of galaxy-cluster cores reveal that AGN feedback is strongly associated with both a short central cooling time ($t_{\rm c} \lesssim 10^9 \, {\rm yr}$) and accumulations of cold gas ($\lesssim 10^4 \, {\rm K}$). Also, the central ratio of cooling time to freefall time is rarely observed to drop below $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 10$, and large accumulations of cold gas are rarely observed in environments with $t_{\rm c} / t_{\rm ff} \gtrsim 30$. Here we show that the critical range -- $10 \lesssim t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \lesssim 30$ -- plausibly results from magnetized thermal instability. We present numerical simulations of magnetized stratified atmospheres with an initially uniform magnetic field. Thermal instability in an otherwise static atmosphere with $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 10$ progresses to nonlinear amplitudes, causing cooler gas to accumulate, as long as the background ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure is $\beta \lesssim 100$. And in atmospheres with $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 20$, cooler gas accumulates for $\beta \lesssim 10$. Magnetized atmospheres are therefore much more likely to precipitate than unmagnetized atmospheres with otherwise identical properties. We hypothesize that AGN feedback triggered by accumulations of cold gas prevents $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}$ from dropping much below 10, because cold gas inevitably precipitates out of magnetized galactic atmospheres with lower ratios, causing $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}$ to rise.</description>

      <title>Stellar Ancestry Unlocked: Chemical and Orbital Clues Link Metal Poor Stars to Globular Clusters and the Galaxy's Thick Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed chemical, kinematic, and orbital dynamic analysis of five metal poor stars in the solar neighborhood: HD 2665, HD 5916, HD 122956, HD 189349, and HD 218857. Using high-resolution spectroscopic data from the ELODIE and ESPaDOnS instruments, we derived elemental abundances for 29 species (25 elements: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd, and Sm) via LTE based analysis with ATLAS9 model atmospheres. Notably, we report first time detections of Ce and Nd in HD2665; Al, V, Sm, and Mn in HD5916; Al in HD 122956; and C, O, S, Sc, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Sr, Zr, Nd, and Sm in HD 189349. Dynamical and chemical diagnostics reveal distinct origins: HD 2665 shows strong orbital and chemical similarity to GC NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen), while HD 218857 exhibits chemodynamic signatures consistent with NGC 5634. HD 122956 aligns with NGC 6864 (M75), though intriguingly shares age, metallicity ([Fe/H]), and [Mg/Fe] ratios with NGC 6517, a cluster whose reported abundances are derived solely from one star with APOGEE $H$-band spectroscopic measurements, as no optical spectroscopic data exist for its members. In contrast, HD 5916 and HD 189349 exhibit kinematic and chemical properties consistent with the field-star population and are classified as thick disk members.</description>

      <title>Open clusters in the outer disc studied with MEGARA@GTC Auner 1 and Berkeley 102</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open clusters offer crucial insights into stellar nucleosynthesis and the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc, as their ages and distances can be determined with higher accuracy compared to field stars. In this study, we investigate the outermost regions of the Milky Way disc using two previously unstudied open clusters -Auner 1 and Berkeley 102- located at Galactocentric distances of approximately 14 kpc in largely uncharted areas of the Galaxy. We obtained medium-resolution spectra (R &gt; 18,700) using the MEGARA integral-field unit (IFU) spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), targeting red giant member stars in both clusters. From these spectra, we derived radial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances for six elements: Fe, Ca, Co, Ni, Ba, and Eu. Additionally, we provide updated estimates of the clusters' ages and distances. Both clusters are old (3.2 +- 0.7 Ga), distant (d ~ 8 kpc), and lie below the Galactic plane (Z Gal ~ -0.7 kpc), with moderate extinction (AV ~ 1.3 mag). We find that Auner 1 has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.30 +- 0.09 and Berkeley 102 of [Fe/H] = -0.35 +- 0.06, consistent with other clusters at similar Galactocentric radii and indicating minimal azimuthal variation in metallicity. The [X/Fe] abundance ratios align with expected trends, although [Ca/Fe] is slightly higher in both clusters, and [Eu/Fe] is notably enhanced in Berkeley 102 ([Eu/Fe] = 0.64 +- 0.05). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of GTC/MEGARA in IFU mode for Galactic archaeology and emphasize the need for further medium-to-high resolution spectroscopic studies of remote open clusters to refine models of the outer Galactic disc's chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Characterizing gas flows through observations of the disk-CGM interface with the HWO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How gas gets into, through, and out of galaxies is critical to understanding galactic ecosystems. The disk-CGM interface region is uniquely suited for studying processes that drive gas flows. Matter and energy that enter and leave a galaxy pass through this region; however, the precise pathways are yet to be explored. In this paper, we discuss future observations that will facilitate the discovery of the gas flow pathways in galaxies and the telescope parameters necessary for making those observations. We advocate for high spectral resolution ultraviolet spectroscopic capabilities on the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) that will enable observations in a wavelength range of 940 - 3500 A (minimum range: 970 - 3000 A) and at a resolution of 100,000 (minimum of 50,000). We advocate 19 for a multi-object spectrograph with thousands of sub-arcsec slitlets and a field of view 6' x 6'. We also recommend that the spectrograph be sensitive enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 or higher within a few hours for a continuum source of 21 AB magnitude and estimate an optimal aperture size of 8 meters. These capabilities would enable the characterization of gas in the disk-halo interface, leading to breakthroughs in our understanding of the gas flows and galactic ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Origin of Radio Emission in Three Nearby Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies with Signatures of Luminous Buried Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 2.3 and 8.4GHz of three nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies, identified via mid-infrared spectroscopic analyses as hosting deeply embedded active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Milliarcsecond-scale observations at both frequencies reveal compact continuum emission in IRAS F00188$-$0856 and IRAS F01298$-$0744, accounting for $\sim10$% of the flux density measured on arcsecond scales. The non-detection in IRAS F00091$-$0738 and the lower limit on the intrinsic 8.4 GHz brightness temperature of $10^{6.1}$ K in IRAS F01298$-$0744 yield no conclusive evidence of AGN-driven radio emission, whereas the measurement of $10^{7.8}$ K in IRAS F00188$-$0856 confirms an AGN origin. Thus, the mid-infrared AGN classification remains robust, with at least one object exhibiting compact radio emission indicative of AGN activity. We further investigate the high-frequency spectral steepening observed in all three galaxies. In each case, this steepening arises from spectral aging in diffuse kpc-scale emission, which is resolved out by the VLBA observations. One possible explanation for the steepening of the sample is merger-induced particle acceleration. IRAS F00188$-$0856 exhibits a peaked radio spectrum, characteristic of a young radio source, with the high-frequency steepening attributable to this AGN activity. Consequently, the spectral steepening at high frequencies arises from particles accelerated by merger dynamics or AGN activity.</description>

      <title>Str\"omgren photometric metallicity map of the Magellanic Cloud stars using Gaia DR3--XP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One important key in understanding a galaxy's evolution is to study the consequences of its past dynamical interactions that influenced its shape. By measuring the metallicity distribution of stellar populations with different ages, one can learn about these interactions. The Magellanic Clouds, being the nearest pair of interacting dwarf galaxies with a morphology characterised by different tidal and kinematic sub-structures as well as a vast range of stellar populations, represent an excellent place to study the consequences of dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions and with their large host, the Milky Way. We aim to determine the metallicities ([Fe/H]) of red giant branch (old) and supergiant (young) stars covering the entire galaxies, estimate their radial metallicity gradients and produce homogeneous metallicity maps. We use the XP spectra from Gaia Data Release 3 to calculate synthetic Str\"omgren magnitudes from the application of the GaiaXPy tool and adopt calibration relations from the literature to estimate the metallicities. We present photometric metallicity maps for ~90,000 young stars and ~270,000 old stars within ~11 deg of the Small Magellanic Cloud and ~20 deg of the Large Magellanic Cloud from a homogeneous dataset. We find that the overall radial metallicity gradients decrease linearly in agreement with previous studies. We apply piecewise-regression fitting to derive the gradients within different radial regions. The overall metallicity gradients, traced by young and old stars, decrease from the centre to the outskirts of both galaxies. However, they show multiple breakpoints depicting regions following different and sometime opposite trends. These are associated to the structure of the galaxies, their history of star formation and chemical evolution but may be influenced by a low number of sources, especially at the centre (due to crowding) and in the outermost regions.</description>

      <title>Gas-Poor Hosts and Gas-Rich Companions of $z\approx$3.5 Radio AGN: ALMA insights into jet triggering and feedback</title>

Abstract: Cold gaseous systems play important roles in galaxy evolution by possibly providing fuel to ignite active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and star-formation. In this work, we analyze [CII]$158\rm \mu m$ and continuum observations from ALMA for a sample of four radio AGN at $z \approx 3.5$, focusing on eight associated companion cloud systems discovered within projected distances of tens of kiloparsecs or less. The spatial distribution of these companions indicates that the majority of cold gas is not located at the AGN position, i.e., not in their host galaxies. With the assistance of [CII] at 0.2" resolution, we further confirm the gas-poor nature of the hosts by re-analyzing archival [CI] (a tracer of H$_{2}$) at $\sim2"$ resolution. Our sample has [CII] luminosities in a range of $2.8\times10^{8}&lt;L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\odot}&lt;4.2\times10^{9}$. The $L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\rm IR}$ ratio, $\sim 9.4\times10^{-4}$, is consistent with sources discussed in the literature. Our findings show the gas-poor radio AGN hosts have nearby gas-rich companions. We propose that these companions, which may be stripped clouds in merger process and by interaction with the energy output from the AGN, could also be a trigger of radio-loud AGN. They may also be a signature of negative AGN feedback (e.g., shock heating) on these infalling companions and on the host galaxy. In general, our analysis shows that powerful AGN at and before Cosmic Noon are impacting and being impacted by cold gaseous clouds in their circum-galactic or proto-intracluster media.</description>

      <title>No influence of passing stars on paleoclimate reconstructions over the past 56 million years</title>

Abstract: Passing stars (also called stellar flybys) have notable effects on the solar system's long-term dynamical evolution, injection of Oort cloud comets into the solar system, properties of trans-Neptunian objects, and more. Based on a simplified solar system model, omitting the Moon and the Sun's quadrupole moment J2, it has recently been suggested that passing stars are also an important driver of paleoclimate before ~50 Myr ago, including a climate event called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (~56 Myr ago). In contrast, using a state-of-the-art solar system model, including a lunar contribution and J2, and random stellar parameters (&gt;400 simulations), we find no influence of passing stars on paleoclimate reconstructions over the past 56 Myr. Even in an extreme flyby scenario in which the Sun-like star HD 7977 (m = 1.07 M_Sun) would have passed within ~3,900 au about 2.8 Myr ago (with 5% likelihood), we detect no discernible change in Earth's orbital evolution over the past 70 Myr, compared to our standard model. Our results indicate that a complete physics model is essential to accurately study the effects of stellar flybys on Earth's orbital evolution.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the mystery of Sr synthesis in the early Galaxy through analysis of barium isotopes in very metal-poor stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the contributions of the rapid (r) and slow (s) neutron capture processes to the Ba isotope mixture, along with Ba, Eu, and Sr NLTE abundances, in a sample of very metal-poor stars. The selected stars formed before the contribution from the main s-process in low- and intermediate-mass stars became significant. Some of our sample stars are enhanced in Sr, with [Sr/Ba] reaching up to 0.7. These stars gained their high Sr abundance from a poorly understood process, which may appear to be a weak s-process or a weak r-process. Our aim is to uncover the nature of this additional Sr source. The abundances derived from the resonance Ba II lines are influenced by the adopted Ba isotope mixture. We compute Ba isotope mixtures corresponding to different r- to s-process contributions and determine the corresponding abundances from the Ba II resonance lines in each sample star. Additionally, we determine Ba abundances from weak subordinate Ba II lines, which are unaffected by the adopted Ba isotope mixture. We then compare the Ba abundances derived from the subordinate lines with those from the Ba II resonance lines. We find a higher s-process contribution to Ba isotopes in stars with greater [Sr/Eu] and [Sr/Ba] overabundances, suggesting that the additional Sr synthesis was due to the early s-process occurring in massive stars. We estimate the [Sr/Ba] ratio produced by the early s-process and obtain [Sr/Ba]_earlyS = 1.1 +- 0.2. Regarding the potential synthesis of Sr and Ba in the i-process in massive stars, our results argue that there was no detectable contribution from this process within the error bars in our sample stars. In the early Galaxy, before significant main s-process enrichment, barium and strontium were produced primarily by the main r-process and the early s-process, which occurred in rapidly rotating massive stars.</description>

Abstract: Black hole shadows are a widespread topic in astrophysics. This paper searches for an optical view of the black hole and the relationship between black hole shadow and photon sphere with curvature. We were inspired by the observations of Sagittarius $A^*$ and supermassive black hole M87$*$ through the Event Horizon Telescope. We have found the signature of the modified theory of gravity on the photon sphere and shadow. We considered $f(R)$ modified theory of gravity and new scalar degree of freedom $F$ appears in the expressions of photon sphere and shadow.</description>

      <title>Testing the local supervoid solution to the Hubble tension with direct distance tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several observational studies suggest that the local few hundred Mpc around the Local Group are significantly underdense based on source number counts in redshift space across much of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in near-infrared galaxy counts. This ``Keenan--Barger--Cowie (KBC) void'', ``Local Hole'', or ``local supervoid'', would have significant ramifications for the Hubble tension by generating outflows that masquerade as an enhanced local expansion rate. We evaluate models for the KBC void capable of resolving the Hubble tension with a background Planck cosmology. We fit these models to direct distances from the Tully--Fisher catalogue of the CosmicFlows-4 compilation using a field-level forward model. Depending on the adopted void density profile, we find the derived velocity fields to prefer a void size of less than 70 Mpc, which is less than 10 per cent of the fiducial size found by Haslbauer et al. based on the KBC luminosity density data. The predicted local Hubble constant is $72.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$, $70.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$, or $70.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ km/s/Mpc for an initial underdensity profile that is exponential, Gaussian, or Maxwell-Boltzmann, respectively. The latter two ameliorate the Hubble tension to within $3\sigma$ of the 4-anchor distance ladder approach of Breuval et al. giving $73.2 \pm 0.9$ km/s/Mpc. The exponential profile does achieve consistency with this measurement at just over $1\sigma$, but it is disfavoured by the Bayesian evidence. The preferred models produce bulk flow curves that disagree with recent estimates from CosmicFlows-4, despite the void models being flexible enough to match such estimates.</description>

      <title>The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS) V: properties of volume-limited samples of Galactic evolved stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a meta-study of the statistical and individual properties of two volume-complete sets of evolved stars in the Solar Neighbourhood: (1) 852 stars from the Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS), and (2) a partially overlapping set of 507 evolved stars within 300 pc. We also investigate distance determinations to these stars, their luminosity functions and their spatial distribution. Gaia APSIS GSP-Phot AENEAS temperatures of bright giant stars often appear to be underestimated. Existing literature on AGB stars under-samples both the most and least extreme nearby dust-producing stars. We reproduce the literature star-formation history of the solar neighbourhood, though stellar-evolution models over-predict the number of AGB stars of ages around 500 Myr. The distribution of AGB stars broadly matches the known 300 pc scale height of the Galactic disc and shows concentration in the direction of the Galactic centre. Most dust-producing carbon stars belong to the Galactic thick-disc population.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): I. Program Overview and Summary of First Results</title>

Abstract: We present the ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO), a Large Program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). AGE-PRO aims to systematically trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. It uses a carefully selected sample of 30 disks around M3-K6 stars in three nearby star-forming regions: Ophiuchus (0.5-1 Myr), Lupus (1-3 Myr), and Upper Sco (2-6 Myr). Assuming the three regions had similar initial conditions and evolutionary paths, we find the median gas disk mass appears to decrease with age. Ophiuchus disks have the highest median gas mass (6 M$_{\rm Jup}$), while the Lupus and Upper Sco disks have significantly lower median masses (0.68 and 0.44 M$_{\rm Jup}$, respectively). Notably, the gas and dust disk masses appear to evolve on different timescales. This is evidenced by the median gas-to-dust mass ratio, which decreases from 122 in the youngest disks ($&lt;$1 Myr) to 46 in Lupus disks, and then increases to 120 in the Upper Sco disks. The median gas disk sizes range between 74-110 au, suggesting that typical gas disks are much smaller than those of well-studied, massive disks. Population synthesis models suggest that magneto-hydrodynamic wind-driven accretion can reproduce median disk properties across all three regions, when assuming compact disks with a declining magnetic field over time. In contrast, turbulent-driven models overestimate gas masses of $&gt;$1 Myr disks by an order of magnitude. Here we discuss the program's motivation, survey design, sample selection, observation and data calibration processes, and highlight the initial results.</description>

Abstract: We present Band 6 and Band 7 observations of 10 Lupus disks around M3-K6 stars from the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program. In addition to continuum emission in both bands, our Band 6 setup covers the $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$ and $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 lines, while our Band 7 setup covers the $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 line. All of our sources are detected in $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$ and $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$, 7 out of 10 are detected in $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$, and 3 are detected in $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$. We find strong correlations between the CO isotopologue line fluxes and the continuum flux densities. With the exception of one disk, we also identify a strong correlation between the $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 fluxes, indicating similar CO abundances across this sample. For the two sources with well-resolved continuum and $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}\,J$=2-1 images, we find that their gas-to-dust size ratio is consistent with the median value of $\sim 2$ inferred from a larger sample of Lupus disks. We derive dust disk masses from continuum flux densities. We estimate gas disk masses by comparing $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 line fluxes with those predicted by the limited grid of self-consistent disk models of Ruaud et al. (2022). A comparison of these mass estimates with those derived by Trapman et al. (2025), using a combination of CO isotopologue and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$ line emission, shows that the masses are consistent with each other. Some discrepancies appear for small and faint disks, but they are still within the uncertainties. Both methods find gas disk masses increase with dust disk masses, and gas-to-dust mass ratios are between $10-100$ in the AGE-PRO Lupus sample.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of the gas mass of planet-forming disks around young stars is crucial for our understanding of planet formation, yet it has proven hard to constrain observationally, due both to the difficulties of measuring gas masses and the lack of a homogeneous sample. Here we present a large grid of thermochemical models which we use to measure protoplanetary gas disk masses of AGE-PRO, the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks. AGE-PRO covers a sample of 30 disks around similar spectral type (M3-K6) stars with ages between 0.1 and 10 Myr. Our approach is to simultaneously fit observations of CO isotopologues and N2H+, a complementary molecule produced when CO freezes out. We find that the median gas mass of the three regions decreases over time, from 7.0(+4.4,-2.6)x10^-3 Msun in Ophiuchus (&lt;1 Myr) to 9.4(+5.4,-3.4)x10^-4 Msun for Lupus (~1-3 Myr) and 6.8(+5.1,-2.8)x10^-4 Msun for Upper Sco (~2-6 Myr), with ~1 dex scatter in gas mass in each region. We note that the gas mass distributions for Lupus and Upper Sco look very similar, which could be due to survivorship bias for the latter. The median bulk CO abundance in the CO emitting layer is found to be a factor ~10 lower than the ISM value but does not significantly change between Lupus and Upper Sco. From Lupus to Upper Sco the median gas-to-dust mass ratio increases by a factor ~3 from ~40 to ~120, suggesting efficient inward pebble drift and/or the formation of planetesimals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential for planet formation of a circumstellar disk depends on the dust and gas reservoirs, which evolve as a function of the disk age. The ALMA Large Program AGE-PRO has measured several disk properties across three star-forming regions of different ages, and in this study we compare the observational results to dust evolution simulations. Using DustPy for the dust evolution, and RADMC-3D for the radiative transfer, we ran a large grid of models spanning stellar masses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 $M_\odot$, with different initial conditions, including: disk sizes, disk gas masses, and dust-to-gas ratio, and viscosity. Our models are performed assuming smooth, weakly, or strongly substructured disks, aiming to investigate if any observational trend can favor or exclude the presence of dust traps. The observed gas masses in the disks of the AGE-PRO sample are not reproducible with our models, which only consider viscous evolution with constant $\alpha$, suggesting that additional physical mechanisms play a role in the evolution of the gas mass of disks. When comparing the dust continuum emission fluxes and sizes at 1.3 mm, we find that most of the disks in the AGE-PRO sample are consistent with simulations that have either weak or strong dust traps. The evolution of spectral index in the AGE-PRO sample is also suggestive of an unresolved population of dust traps. Future observations at high angular resolution are still needed to test several hypotheses that result from comparing the observations to our simulations, including that more massive disks in gas mass have the potential to form dust traps at larger disk radii.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): XII. Extreme millimetre variability detected in a Class II disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variability of millimetre wavelength continuum emission from Class II protoplanetary disks is extremely rare, and when detected it is usually interpreted as originating from non-thermal emission mechanisms that relate to the host star itself rather than its disk. During observations made as part of the AGE-PRO ALMA Large program, significant variability in the brightness of the 2MASS J16202863-2442087 system was detected between individual executions. We report the observed properties of the variability detected at millimetre wavelengths and investigate potential driving mechanisms. To investigate the nature of the variability we construct a light curve from the continuum observations and analyse imaged constructed from both flaring and quiescent emission. We characterise the dust disk around the star through analysis in the image and visibility plane, and carry out kinematic analysis of the CO(2-1) emission from the gas disk. The continuum flux decays by a factor of 8 in less than an hour, and by a factor of 13 within 8 days. The peak brightness coincides with an expected brightness maximum extrapolated from the periodicity of previously observed optical variability. The flare is most likely the product of synchrotron emission in the close vicinity of the star. The nature of the millimetre flare closely resembles those detected in very close binary systems, and may be due to the interaction of magnetic fields in an as yet undetected binary. Alternatively if the central host is a single-star object, the flare may be due to the interaction of magnetic field loops at the stellar surface or a strong accretion burst.</description>

      <title>Detectability of massive binary black holes with sub-mHz gravitational wave missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond LISA, proposed space-based gravitational wave (GW) missions aim to explore the sub-millihertz to microhertz frequency band, with one key objective being the detection of massive binary black hole (MBBH) mergers across cosmic distances. In this work, we investigate the detection and localization capabilities of future sub-mHz GW observatories for MBBH coalescences. Including the full galactic foreground noise, we find that signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) can reach several thousand across a wide range of redshifts. We evaluate three representative orbital configurations--non-precessing and precessing with different inclination angles--and analyze their localization performance for various MBBH populations. In the non-precessing case, a two-hemisphere degeneracy arises when only the dominant (2,2) mode is considered, which is effectively resolved by including higher-order modes. These modes contribute to a more uniform performance across all configurations, thereby mitigating the prior advantage of precessing mission orbits. Sub-mHz missions operating in the [10 $\mu$Hz, 10 mHz] band partially overlap with LISA's range but provide enhanced sensitivity to lower-frequency GWs due to their longer interferometric baselines. This results in significantly improved localization of high-mass MBBHs, enhancing the prospects for multi-messenger astronomy and precision cosmology. Moreover, the high SNRs attainable with sub-mHz detectors could enable stringent tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Two coincidences are a clue: Probing a GeV-scale dark QCD sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The similarity between dark matter and baryon energy densities suggests the existence of a dark sector analogous to the visible QCD sector. In addition, small-scale structure issues can be addressed by dark matter self-interactions with a cross section comparable to that of QCD. Both observations point to a GeV-scale dark QCD sector. In this letter, guided by these two coincidences, we investigate how a chiral dark QCD model with a MeV-scale dark photon can resolve the core-cusp problem. A potential third coincidence, associated with the latest measurement of $N_{\rm eff}$ being lower than the Standard Model prediction, is also discussed. Current constraints leave a finite window in the parameter space, which can be tested by future experiments such as Gamma Factory.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Feedback-driven Outflows on Bar Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the coupling between the temporal variation from galaxy-formation feedback and the bar instability. We show that fluctuations from mass outflow on star-formation time scales affect the radial motion of disk orbits. The resulting incoherence in orbital phase leads to the disruption of the bar-forming dynamics. Bar formation is suppressed in starburst galaxies that have fluctuation time scales within the range 10 Myr to 200 Myr with repeated events with wind mass 15% of the disk within 0.5 scale lengths or 1.4% of the total disk mass. The work done by feedback is capable of reducing the amplitude or, with enough amplitude, destroying an existing bar. AGN feedback with similar amplitude and timescales would have similar behavior. To model the dynamics of the coupling and interpret the results of the full N-body simulations, we introduce a generalization of the Hamiltonian mean-field (HMF) model, drawing inspiration from the Lynden-Bell (1979) mechanism for bar growth. Our non-linear 'BarHMF' model is designed to reproduce linear perturbation theory in the low-amplitude limit. Notably, without star-formation feedback, this model exhibits exponential growth whose rate depends on disk mass and reproduces the expected saturation of bar growth observed in N-body simulations. We describe several promising applications of the BarHMF model beyond this study.</description>

      <title>The angular momentum of stars reflects the relationship between star-forming environment and galactic evolution history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on stars with masses above the Kraft break in the \textit{Kepler} field. Their rotational angular momenta are essentially the same as those at the zero-age main sequence. The angular momentum dissipation experienced by these stars during their pre-main sequence phase is also relatively weak, so their rotational angular momentum can reflect the parameters of their parental molecular clouds. The reliability of angular momentum measurements was evaluated based on the phenomenon of angular momentum conservation observed in stars before and after the turn-off point in observational data. We find that stars with masses between 1.4$M_\odot$ and 1.8$M_\odot$ show an inverse proportionality between angular momentum and isochrone age. We propose that the angular momentum-age correlation reflects changes in the star-forming environment in the Milky Way's history. Besides, the observed inverse proportionality implies that, as the Milky Way has evolved, the stars formed within it tend to possess greater rotational angular momenta. This trend would promote the fragmentation of stars during the pre-main sequence phase and inhibit the formation of massive stars, providing a useful perspective for explaining variations in the initial mass function.</description>

      <title>A MARVEL-ous study of how well galaxy shapes reflect Dark Matter halo shapes in Cold Dark Matter Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a 3D shape analysis of both dark matter (DM) and stellar matter (SM) in simulated dwarf galaxies to determine whether stellar shape traces DM shape. Using 80 central and satellite galaxies from three simulation suites (Marvelous Massive Dwarfs, Marvelous Dwarfs, and DC Justice League) spanning stellar masses of $10^6$--$10^{10}$ $M_\odot$, we measure 3D shapes through the moment of inertia tensor at two times the effective radius to derive axis ratios ($C/A$, $B/A$) and triaxiality. We find that stellar shape does indeed follow DM halo shape for our dwarf galaxies. However, the presence of a stellar disk in more massive dwarfs ($M_* \gtrsim 10^{7.5}$ $M_\odot$) pulls the distribution of stellar $C/A$ ratios to lower values, while in lower mass galaxies the gravitational potential remains predominantly shaped by DM. Similarly, stellar triaxiality generally tracks dark matter halo triaxiality, with this relationship being particularly strong for non-disky galaxies though weaker in disky systems. This correlation is reinforced by strong alignment between SM and DM axes, particularly in disk galaxies. Further, we find no detectable difference in either SM or DM shape comparing two different SNe feedback implementations, demonstrating that shape measurements may be robust to different implementations of baryonic feedback in dwarf galaxies. We also observe that a dwarf galaxy's shape is largely unperturbed by recent mergers (with merger ratios $&gt;4$). This comprehensive study demonstrates that stellar shape measurements can serve as a reliable tool for inferring DM shapes in dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Inferring Obscured Cosmic Black Hole Accretion History from AGN Found by JWST/MIRI CEERS Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents the black hole accretion history (BHAH) of obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) identified from the JWST CEERS survey by Chien et al. (2024) using mid-infrared (MIR) SED fitting. We compute black hole accretion rates (BHARs) to estimate the black hole accretion density (BHAD), $\rho_{L_{\mathrm{disk}}}$, across $0 &lt; z &lt; 4.25$. MIR luminosity functions (LFs) are also constructed for these sources, modeled with modified Schechter and double power law forms, and corresponding BHAD, $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$, is derived by integrating the LFs and multiplying by the luminosity. Both $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$ extend to luminosities as low as $10^7 \, L_{\odot}$, two orders of magnitude fainter than pre-JWST studies. Our results show that BHAD peaks between redshifts 1 and 3, with the peak varying by method and model, $z \approx 1$--2 for $\rho_{L_{\mathrm{disk}}}$ and the double power law, and $z \approx 2$--3 for the modified Schechter function. A scenario where AGN activity peaks before cosmic star formation would challenge existing black hole formation theories, but our present study, based on early JWST observations, provides an initial exploration of this possibility. At $z \sim 3$, $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$ appears higher than X-ray estimates, suggesting that MIR observations are more effective in detecting obscured AGNs missed by X-ray observations. However, given the overlapping error bars, this difference remains within the uncertainties and requires confirmation with larger samples. These findings highlight the potential of JWST surveys to enhance the understanding of co-evolution between galaxies and AGNs.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: Estimating Physical Parameters of Galaxies Using Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COSMOS-Web survey, with its unparalleled combination of multiband data, notably, near-infrared imaging from JWST's NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W), provides a transformative dataset down to $\sim28$ mag (F444W) for studying galaxy evolution. In this work, we employ Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), an unsupervised machine learning method, to estimate key physical parameters of galaxies -- redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and age -- directly from photometric data out to $z=3.5$. SOMs efficiently project high-dimensional galaxy color information onto 2D maps, showing how physical properties vary among galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions. We first validate our approach using mock galaxy catalogs from the HORIZON-AGN simulation, where the SOM accurately recovers the true parameters, demonstrating its robustness. Applying the method to COSMOS-Web observations, we find that the SOM delivers robust estimates despite the increased complexity of real galaxy populations. Performance metrics ($\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$ typically between $0.1$--$0.3$, and Pearson correlation between $0.7$ and $0.9$) confirm the precision of the method, with $\sim$ $70\%$ of predictions within 1$\sigma$ dex of reference values. Although redshift estimation in COSMOS-Web remains challenging (median $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}} = 0.04$), the overall success of the highlights its potential as a powerful and interpretable tool for galaxy parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>The Centre of Attention: a Powerful Radio Galaxy Pinpoints a NIR-Dark Protocluster at z~3.9</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a $z\sim3.9$ protocluster identified from Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array Band 3 spectral scans of a bright radio source selected from the GaLactic and Extra-galactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey. Extended CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) line emission was detected in GLEAM J005332$-$325630 confirming it to be a $z=3.879$ powerful radio galaxy with luminosity, $L_{500 MHz}=1.3\times10^{28}$ ${W Hz}^{-1}$. This source is part of a sample of candidate high redshift radio galaxies with bright radio fluxes, $S_{150MHz}&gt;0.1$ Jy, but host galaxies with $K_s({AB})\gtrsim23$ mag. The molecular gas associated with the radio galaxy host has two kinematically separate components, likely in-falling and indicative of a recent interaction or merger with another galaxy. One 100-GHz continuum source $\sim120$ pkpc away is found to have both CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) emission lines and a further five protocluster members are identified from CO(4-3) emission alone, all at similar redshift ($\Delta v&lt;700$ km s$^{-1}$) and within a radius of $1.1^{\prime}$. Using photometry from the High Acuity Widefield K-band Imager $K_s$-band and the Dark Energy Survey $g, r, i, z$ and $Y$ bands, we find this protocluster harbours a rare, optically-dark, very massive $M_*\sim10^{12}$ ${M}_\odot$ galaxy. Comparisons with the TNG300 cosmological simulation puts this galaxy in a dark matter halo of $M_{DM}\sim3\times10^{13}$ ${M}_\odot$ which will evolve into a Coma-like DM halo ($M_{DM}\sim10^{15}$ ${M}_\odot$) by the present day.</description>

      <title>Detection Prospects of Electromagnetic Signatures from OGLE-2011-BLG-0462</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. The analysis is restricted to orbits confined to the reflection-symmetric plane of the spheroidal configuration. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <title>Dissecting environmental effects with eccentric gravitational wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e&gt; 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.</description>
