      <title>Solving compressible Navier-Stokes equations using the feature-enhanced neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown remarkable prospects in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving fluid mechanics. However, the method has so far succeeded only in inviscid flows and incompressible viscous flows, while the solution of compressible viscous flows still faces significant challenges. In previous work, we proposed a feature-enhanced neural network (FENN), which enhances the ability of PINNs to approximate flows by introducing beneficial features into the network inputs, thereby improving the performance in solving PDEs. In this study, we extend FENN to compressible viscous flows, which are governed by the compressible Navier-Stokes equations including the continuity, momentum, and energy equations. By solving four forward problems under different flow conditions and geometries together with a parametric problem involving angle of attack, we validate the effectiveness of FENN. In contrast, existing advanced methods that are well established for inviscid flows and incompressible viscous flows fail in this scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a PINN-like method has successfully solved forward and parametric problems involving compressible viscous flows.</description>

      <title>Water immersion single-mirror schlieren imaging system for flow visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schlieren imaging is a popular optical technique for visualizing flow in transparent media. In-water high-sensitivity flow visualization, using schlieren imaging, is usually performed with a large-footprint two-mirror z-configuration. Here, we present a small footprint, easy-to-implement, single-mirror schlieren imaging system for in-water flow visualization. The same system is capable of high-sensitivity flow visualization in air as well. At its core, our system uses a concave mirror with water immersion. We present theoretical analysis and experimental results to show that this water immersion helps reduce the system's footprint by 25%. Our water immersion-based single-mirror schlieren imaging method additionally reduces mirror surface artifacts, increasing the sensitivity of flow visualization. This technique enables a low-cost schlieren system, as demonstrated experimentally using an inexpensive concave mirror. We also provide the experimental validation of high sensitivity in-water flow visualization for some transparent chemicals or solutions.</description>

      <title>Squirmers with arbitrary shape and slip: modeling, simulation, and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider arbitrary-shaped microswimmers of spherical topology and propose a framework for expressing their slip velocity in terms of tangential basis functions defined on the boundary of the swimmer using the Helmholtz decomposition. Given a time-independent slip velocity profile, we show that the trajectory followed by the microswimmer is a circular helix. We derive analytical expressions for the translational and rotational velocities of a prolate spheroid swimmer in terms of its Helmholtz decomposition modes and explore the effect of aspect ratio on these rigid body velocities. Then, for a given arbitrary swimmer shape of spherical topology, we investigate which slip profile minimizes the total power loss. A partial minimization is performed in which the direction of net motion of the swimmer is prescribed, followed by a global optimization procedure in which the best net motion direction is determined. The optimization results suggest that the competition between linear and rotational optimal motion is linked to symmetries in the shape of the microswimmer.</description>

      <title>A unified SPH framework for shell-related interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework is proposed to simulate interaction dynamics involving thin shells modeled by a reduced-dimensional, single-layer particle discretization, as opposed to full-dimensional SPH solids. The framework encompasses one-sided fluid-shell interactions, with the fluid present on only one side of the shell, as well as solid-shell, shell-shell, and shell-self interactions The study introduces a novel concept of imaginary shell contact particles, generated by projecting real shell particles along the local normal direction within the cut-off radius of the fluid particle, thereby mapping this reduced-dimensional shell model into a full-dimensional representation. With the volume of the imaginary particles defined based on the local shell curvature, the projection preserves kernel completeness for fluid-shell interactions while leaving the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) dynamics unchanged, such that the fluid-shell coupling algorithm is the same as in standard fluid-solid coupling. In addition, a particle-to-particle contact model for solid-solid interactions is developed by analogy to fluid dynamics: a contact density is computed using a fluid-style density initialization, and the resulting contact forces follow a momentum-equation-inspired formulation. Combined with the projection strategy, this contact formulation is directly extended to efficiently handle shell-related contact problems. The proposed method is validated using a series of benchmark tests, demonstrating stable and accurate performance across diverse interaction scenarios.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning based Ensemble Flame Regime Classification for Mesoscale Combustors based on Insights from Linear and Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaining insights into flame behaviour at small scales can lead to improvements in the efficiency of micro-reactors, compact power generation systems, fire safety technologies, and various other applications where combustion is confined to micro or mesoscales. Flame regimes observed in mesoscale combustors, namely Stable flame, Flames with repetitive extinction and ignition, and Propagating flame, exhibit unique dynamic characteristics that differentiate them from one another. In this study, we systematically examine the various flame regimes observed in mesoscale combustors from both dynamical and statistical standpoints. Our experimental methodology involves stabilizing a flame inside a quartz tube (an optically accessible mesoscale combustor) with an inner diameter of 5 mm. A premixed methane-air mixture is used as fuel, with its equivalence ratio and Reynolds number being the input parameters. Instantaneous OH* chemiluminescence and Acoustic pressure signals, along with high-speed flame imaging, were acquired for combustion dynamics characterization. The objective of this study is to analyze the distinct dynamical signatures associated with these observed flame regimes. For this purpose, Recurrence Quantification Analysis, followed by a Statistical-Spectral analysis, has been performed based on the experimentally acquired OH* Chemiluminescence and Acoustic pressure time-series signals. Subsequently, a stacking ensemble-based machine learning framework has been implemented for mesoscale flame regime classification based on the features extracted from the two aforementioned analyses. In addition, Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) scalograms and three-dimensional phase plots have been graphed to visually elucidate the evolution of system dynamics and the complex interaction of competing time scales in these flame regimes.</description>

      <title>On the importance of stochasticity in closures of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic closures for coarse-grained turbulence models help reproduce mean statistics, but often fail to capture the finite-time growth of uncertainty. Using the framework of shell models as a quantitative multi-scale testbed, we compare fully resolved simulations with large-eddy simulations using either stochastic or deterministic subgrid closures. While in the fully resolved system a single microscopic perturbation is rapidly amplified by strongly chaotic dynamics, truncation produces a strong delay and suppression of variance growth when uncertainty is introduced through initial condition perturbations only. We show that a data-driven Langevin-type stochastic closure restores the correct timing and magnitude of variance growth across scales, demonstrating that sustained stochasticity is essential for predictability in reduced turbulent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Conservation laws, fluxes, and symmetries: lessons from a perturbative approach for self-organized turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some turbulent flows self-organize into large-scale structures, rather than breaking up into ever-smaller scales. Underpinning this phenomenon is the existence of two sign-definite quantities which are conserved by the dynamics. Two-dimensional turbulence is a prime example, where large-scale mean flows, termed condensates, spontaneously emerge. We review a perturbative theoretical framework for the statistical description of such inhomogeneous turbulence, offering new perspectives on the role of the two conserved quantities. We illustrate the universal properties of the theory, comparing results from two-dimensional Navier-Stokes to those from the large-scale-quasi-geostrophic equation. These two models are limiting cases of the shallow water quasi-geostrophic equation, the former exhibiting long-range fluid element interactions, while the latter has local interactions. We then demonstrate these theoretical ideas in two new settings: first, in rotating three-dimensional turbulence, where two-dimensional condensates are known to form. Considering jet-type condensates, we derive the mean-flow profile and discuss a surprising symmetry breaking. Second, we vary the Rossby deformation radius in the shallow water quasi-geostrophic equation. We obtain novel domain-spanning condensates in all tested regimes and show that they follow two-dimensional Navier-Stokes for deformation radii above the forcing scale, and the large-scale quasi-geostrophic equation for those below, demonstrating the power of these asymptotic models.</description>

      <title>Twisted multilayer moir\'e water waves topologically robust to disorder</title>

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, stacking and twisting multilayer periodic lattices into superlattices, have become cornerstones of many physical systems from condensed matter to wave phenomena, but have never been properly studied in water waves. Here, we demonstrate twisted multilayer moir\'e water surface waves carrying robust skyrmionic topologies. Using a custom water tank of circular multi-channel phased array, we precisely generate water-wave skyrmion lattices and superimpose them into moir\'e superlattices with higher-order topological textures, e.g., skyrmion bags and clusters, programmed via the twist angle. We also quantitatively compare the topological robustness of bilayer and trilayer configurations under spatiotemporal perturbations. The trilayer moir\'e superlattices exhibit more enhanced stability, stronger field localization and energy concentration than the bilayer. Our work establishes water waves as a macroscopic, tunable, and visually accessible platform for moir\'e physics, towards robust particle manipulation and classical analogues of topological quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Data-Driven Model of the Flight Dynamics of Hawks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant analysis of bird flight, generative physics models for flight dynamics do not currently exist. Yet the underlying mechanisms responsible for various flight manoeuvres are important for understanding how agile flight can be accomplished. Even in a simple flight, multiple objectives are at play, complicating analysis of the overall flight mechanism. Using the data-driven method of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) on motion capture recordings of hawks, we show that multiple behavioral states such as flapping, turning, landing, and gliding, can be modeled by simple and interpretable modal structures (i.e. the underlying wing-tail shape) which can be linearly combined to reproduce the experimental flight observations. Moreover, the DMD model can be used to extrapolate naturalistic flapping. Flight is highly individual, with differences in style across the hawks, but we find they share a common set of dynamic modes. The DMD model is a direct fit to data, unlike traditional models constructed from physics principles which can rarely be tested on real data and whose assumptions are typically invalid in real flight. The DMD approach gives a highly accurate reconstruction of the flight dynamics with only three parameters needed to characterize flapping, and a fourth to integrate turning manoeuvres. The DMD analysis further shows that the underlying mechanism of flight, much like simplest walking models, displays a parametric coupling between dominant modes suggesting efficiency for locomotion.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis of cell aggregates: morphology and dynamics of migrating active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological tissues have been observed to display emergent fluid-like properties, owing to physical interactions between cells. However, it remains unclear in general how these fluid-like properties affect tissue structure and function. Here, we are motivated by recent experiments in which cell aggregates were observed to behave as active droplets during collective migration along chemical gradients, or chemotaxis. To understand this process, we develop a minimal model of a growing thin active droplet driven by a self-generated chemical gradient. In broad agreement with the experiments, dynamic simulations reveal that chemotacting droplets exhibit proliferation-driven morphological transitions. To fully characterise these transitions, we perform a multiple scales analysis to show that the droplet dynamics follow a sequence of travelling wave solutions defined by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem parametrised by the slowly increasing droplet volume. Our analysis reveals that morphological transitions can occur continuously or through a discontinuous bifurcation. Further asymptotic analysis of the travelling wave problem reveals that these morphological transitions arise from exponentially small ("beyond-all-orders") asymptotic terms that originate from the rear and front contact lines. Moreover, we show that the nature of the transitions is fully determined by two key dimensionless parameters, which quantify the internal stress balance within the droplet and the strength of the coupling between the droplet migration dynamics and the external chemical field. Overall, our results provide a complete characterisation of the morphodynamics of a class of migrating active thin droplets, with implications in a range of biological systems where cell aggregates exhibit fluid-like behaviour.</description>

      <title>Model for transitional turbulence in a planar shear flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central obstacle to understanding the route to turbulence in wall-bounded flows is that the flows are composed of complex, highly fluctuating, and strongly nonlinear states. In the case of pipe flow, models have deepened our understanding of turbulent onset by providing valuable theory to complement experiments and simulations. In planar cases, the large-scale flows associated with transitional turbulence are considerably more complex than for pipes, limiting our ability to develop models and provide theoretical analyses for these cases. We address this challenge here by deriving from the Navier-Stokes equations a simplified model for transitional turbulence in a planar setting. The Reynolds-averaged and turbulent-kinetic-energy equations are projected onto a minimal set of wall-normal modes and justified model closures are used for the Reynolds stresses and turbulent dissipation and transport. The model reproduces phenomena found at the onset of turbulence in planar shear flows, such as turbulent-laminar patterns (turbulent bands) oriented obliquely to the streamwise direction and large-scale flows associated with both stationary patterns and growing turbulent spots. We demonstrate the model's utility by showing that patterns arise with decreasing Reynolds number via a linear instability of uniform turbulence and by deriving a selection criterion for the pattern orientation at onset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Reynolds equation from lubrication theory and the Stokes equations for zero Reynolds number flows are distinct models for an incompressible fluid with negligible inertia. Here we investigate the sensitivity of the Reynolds equation to large surface gradients, and explore flow recirculation in corner geometries in comparison to the Stokes equation. We compare the solutions for the Reynolds and Stokes equations in the backward facing step (BFS), the regularized BFS, and the lid-driven triangular cavity. For the BFS variations listed above, we compute the error in terms of the average pressure drop through the channel and show how the error increases with increasing expansion ratio and with increasing magnitude of surface gradients. We further investigate the phenomenology of corner flow recirculation that arises in the Stokes solutions. In particular, we observe that occluding the corner separated region in the Stokes solution to the BFS does not disrupt the bulk flow characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and solving fluid dynamics equations efficiently remains a fundamental challenge in computational physics. Traditional numerical solvers and physics-informed neural networks struggle to capture the full range of frequency components in partial differential equation solutions, limiting their accuracy and efficiency. Here, we propose the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network, a novel neural architecture that integrates quantum and classical layers in parallel to improve the accuracy of solving fluid dynamics equations, namely ''Kovasznay flow'' problem. This approach decomposes the solution into separate frequency components, each predicted by independent Parallel Hybrid Networks, simplifying the training process and enhancing performance. We evaluated the proposed model against a comparable classical neural network, the Multi-stream Physics Classical Network, in both data-driven and physics-driven scenarios. Our results show that the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network achieves a reduction in root mean square error by 36% for velocity components and 41% for pressure prediction compared to the classical model, while using 24% fewer trainable parameters. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures for advancing computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>A posteriori closure of turbulence models: are symmetries preserved?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence modeling remains a longstanding challenge in fluid dynamics. Recent advances in data-driven methods have led to a surge of novel approaches aimed at addressing this problem. This work builds upon our recent work [Phys. Rev. Fluids 10, 044602 (2025)], where we introduced a new closure for a shell model of turbulence using an a posteriori (or solver-in-the-loop) approach. Unlike most deep learning-based models, our method explicitly incorporates physical equations into the neural network framework, ensuring that the closure remains constrained by the underlying physics benefiting from enhanced stability and generalizability. In this paper, we further analyze the learned closure, probing its capabilities and limitations. In particular, we look at joint probability density functions between resolved and unresolved variables, as well as the scale invariance of multipliers (ratios between adjacent shells) within the inertial range. Although our model excels in reproducing high-order statistical moments, it breaks this known symmetry near the cutoff, indicating a fundamental limitation. We discuss the implications of these findings for subgrid-scale modeling in 3D turbulence and outline directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Scale-by-scale energy transfers in bubbly flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Buoyancy-driven bubbly flows naturally have spatially-dependent density fields, which allow for multiple definitions of the scale-dependent (or filtered) energy. A priori, it is not obvious which of these provide the most physically apt scale-by-scale budget. In the present study, we compare two such definitions, based on (a) filtered momentum and filtered velocity (Pandey et al. 2020), and (b) Favre filtered energy (Aluie 2013; Pandey et al. 2023). We also derive a K\'arm\'an-Howarth-Monin (KHM) relation using the momentum-velocity correlation function and contrast it with the scale-by-scale energy budget obtained in (a). We find that for the volume fraction and Atwood number explored, irrespective of the definition, energy transfers due to the advective nonlinearity and surface tension are identical. However, discrepancies arise for the buoyancy and pressure contributions. We show that the Favre filtered definition is the more appropriate choice, within which buoyancy injects energy, pressure transfers energy to large scales, and both advective nonlinearity and surface tension transfer energy downscales where it is dissipated by viscosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A floating Leidenfrost droplet exhibits curvature inversion of its underside, due to the balance of vapor pressure and surface tension. Using interferometric imaging, we find different behavior for a levitated hydrogel sphere. Curvature inversion is observed briefly just after deposition, but quickly gives way to a steady state with no inversion. We show the essential role of vaporization on shaping the underbelly of the hydrogel, adding a new component to the interplay between vapor pressure and elastic force</description>

      <title>Learning constitutive models and rheology from partial flow measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constitutive laws relate fluid stress to deformation and underpin predictions of non-Newtonian behavior in industrial and biological fluids. Standard characterization relies on measurements in idealized flows that often miss physics relevant to complex geometries. Existing data-driven methods overfit sparse data, lack geometry portability, or presuppose constitutive forms. To unify measurement and constitutive discovery, we developed an end-to-end framework that leverages automatic differentiation through a full physics simulation. By embedding a frame-invariant tensor basis neural network (TBNN) within a differentiable non-Newtonian solver, we learn form-agnostic stress-strain mappings from any flow observable. Unlike coordinate-dependent methods, learning local material response enables prediction in unseen geometries. We then distill this closure into symbolic form via automated Bayesian model selection, extracting interpretable physical parameters. This work establishes a foundation for comprehensive characterization of complex fluids directly within their operating environment ("digital rheometry") with broad applicability to constitutive discovery across engineering and the physical sciences.</description>

      <title>Diffuse interface approach to oxygen transport and metabolism under blood flow dynamics in microcirculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between the spatiotemporal distribution of oxygen transport and blood flow dynamics, accounting for the motion and deformation of individual red blood cells (RBCs), is of fundamental importance for understanding microcirculation systems. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling is indispensable for addressing complex oxygen transport and cellular behaviors in capillary networks; however, the computational approach is formidable for enforcing interface (or jump) conditions on largely moving and deforming interfaces. In this paper, we propose a diffuse interface approach for the oxygen transport using a mixture formulation. We formulate oxygen transport using an advection-diffusion-reaction equation and rewrite all governing equations in mixture forms using phase indicator functions, where all the interface conditions are included in the governing equations. This innovation avoids the complexity associated with discontinuities for largely moving interfaces in highly dense RBC conditions. We model cellular flow as a fluid-membrane interaction problem using the immersed boundary method (IBM). The method allows the seamless calculation of coupling problems for cellular flows and oxygen transports in the cytoplasm (internal fluid) of the RBC, plasma (external fluid), and tissue regions using a fixed Cartesian coordinate mesh. The proposed method accurately captures the analytical solution for spherically symmetric diffusion, and successfully demonstrates oxygen transport in both straight capillaries and their networks. These rigorous analyses suggest that RBCs can autonomously regulate the oxygen supply to tissues in response to the local tissue oxygenation level, resulting in the establishment of homogeneous tissue oxygenation.</description>

      <title>Vortex breakdown and its topologies in turbulent flows within a typical swirl combustor geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate vortex breakdown (VB) and its dominant topologies in turbulent, non-reacting flows within a canonical swirl combustor using large-eddy simulations (LES). A baseline configuration and operating conditions are first used to validate the LES solver, then five additional cases differing only by swirler vane-angle are simulated. The onset of VB is quantified using the generic swirl-number formulation, SNg, by detecting an internal recirculation zone (IRZ) in the mean flow, excluding highly-intermittent VB cases. Analysis of the mean flow shows that SNg measured within 40 mm downstream of swirler best represents the flow's swirl-strength compared with commonly used alternatives. A stable-VB first appears in the flow with 25{\deg} vane-angle, SNg=0.35. Q-criterion iso-surfaces and velocity time-series at VC footprints show a single-helix VC to prevail across all investigated vane-angles; up to 60{\deg}, SNg=0.98. Weaker double-helix signatures also appear, resulting from quadratic self-interaction of single-helix tone for vane-angles &lt;= 50{\deg}. They are quadratically independent in 60{\deg} case, indicating association with a distinct helical hydrodynamic mode. Axisymmetric IRZ oscillations interact with helical-VC dynamics in 25{\deg} and 60{\deg} cases. VC precesses as stable limit-cycle oscillation via a marginally stable mode in 40{\deg} to 50{\deg} cases, while it waxes and wanes strongly in 25{\deg} and 60{\deg} cases driven by stochastic forcing of a slightly stable mode. Alongside the coherent VC-strand, a weakly-coherent strand originates from swirler. Its precession frequency matches with the lowest coherent precession frequency, corroborating its precession-based origin. Overall, we establish critical-values, evaluation locations and a topology-map for predicting and interpreting VB-states in isothermal swirl combustor flows.</description>

      <title>Helicity controls the direction of fluxes in rotating turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence sustains out-of-equilibrium energy fluxes shaped by conservation laws. Three-dimensional flows conserve energy and sign-indefinite helicity, both being transferred to small scales. Yet in 3D rotating turbulence, energy is observed to flow simultaneously toward large-scale two-dimensional structures and toward small-scale three-dimensional waves. We uncover the origin of this dual behavior. When sufficiently fast inertial waves interact with a large-scale 2D flow, they conserve their helicity separately by sign, enforcing an inverse transfer of energy from 3D waves to 2D motions and promoting spectral condensation. Slower modes, by contrast, exchange helicity across opposite-sign sectors and thus behave as in non-rotating turbulence, driving a forward transfer. Using a mean-wave kinetic theory, we derive analytical expressions for these competing bi-directional transfers and quantitatively predict the rotation- and Reynolds-number dependence of the large-scale 2D flow in fully nonlinear simulations, unifying the picture from zero to infinite rotation.</description>

      <title>Droplet Breakup Against an Isolated Obstacle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe combined experiments and simulations of droplet breakup during flow-driven interactions with a circular obstacle in a quasi-two-dimensional microfluidic chamber. Due to a lack of in-plane confinement, the droplets can also slip past the obstacle without breaking. Droplets are more likely to break when they have a higher flow velocity, larger size (relative to the obstacle radius R), smaller surface tension, and for head-on collisions with the obstacle. We also observe that droplet-obstacle collisions are more likely to result in breakup when the height of the sample chamber is increased. We define a nondimensional breakup number Bk ~ Ca, where Ca is the Capillary number, that accounts for changes in the likelihood of droplet break up with variations in these parameters. As Bk increases, we find in both experiments and discrete element method (DEM) simulations of the deformable particle model that the behavior changes from droplets never breaking (Bk &lt;&lt; 1) to always breaking for Bk &gt;&gt; 1, with a rapid change in the probability of droplet breakup near Bk = 1. We also find that Bk ~ S^(4/3), where S characterizes the symmetry of the collision, which implies that the minimum symmetry required for breakup is controlled by a characteristic distance h ~ R.</description>

      <title>WAKESET: A Large-Scale, High-Reynolds Number Flow Dataset for Machine Learning of Turbulent Wake Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) offers transformative potential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD), promising to accelerate simulations, improve turbulence modelling, and enable real-time flow prediction and control-capabilities that could fundamentally change how engineers approach fluid dynamics problems. However, the exploration of ML in fluid dynamics is critically hampered by the scarcity of large, diverse, and high-fidelity datasets suitable for training robust models. This limitation is particularly acute for highly turbulent flows, which dominate practical engineering applications yet remain computationally prohibitive to simulate at scale. High-Reynolds number turbulent datasets are essential for ML models to learn the complex, multi-scale physics characteristic of real-world flows, enabling generalisation beyond the simplified, low-Reynolds number regimes often represented in existing datasets. This paper introduces WAKESET, a novel, large-scale CFD dataset of highly turbulent flows, designed to address this critical gap. The dataset captures the complex hydrodynamic interactions during the underwater recovery of an autonomous underwater vehicle by a larger extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle. It comprises 1,091 high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, augmented to 4,364 instances, covering a wide operational envelope of speeds (up to Reynolds numbers of 1.09 x 10^8) and turning angles. This work details the motivation for this new dataset by reviewing existing resources, outlines the hydrodynamic modelling and validation underpinning its creation, and describes its structure. The dataset's focus on a practical engineering problem, its scale, and its high turbulence characteristics make it a valuable resource for developing and benchmarking ML models for flow field prediction, surrogate modelling, and autonomous navigation in complex underwater environments.</description>

      <title>Covariant Chu-Kovasznay Decomposition: Resolving Thermodynamic Ambiguity in Compressible Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the Covariant Chu--Kovasznay Decomposition (CCKD), a geometric framework that resolves thermodynamic ambiguity in compressible mode content by formulating the decomposition on the effective acoustic spacetime. Enforcing orthogonality in the covariant Chu energy norm, we show that shock--turbulence interaction, often treated as a scattering source, is, in the idealized linear, inviscid setting, a near-unitary (Chu-isometric) scattering map constrained by conservation of covariant Chu-energy flux. In the canonical Shu-Osher problem, CCKD characterizes the shock as a thermo-acoustic lens, mathematically demonstrating that the transfer of entropy fluctuations into sound follows a geometric blue-shift ($k_{\mathrm{out}}=\Lambda k_{\mathrm{in}}$) analogous to gravitational blue-shift. Thus, while the mean flow produces entropy across the shock, the fluctuation mapping is information-preserving on the retained subspace; practical information loss arises from noise, truncation, and model mismatch, not shock physics.</description>

Abstract: We present semi-analytical solutions for the evolution of both the temperature and chemical potentials for viscous Gubser flow with conserved charges. Such a solution can be especially useful in testing numerical codes intended to simulate relativistic fluids with large chemical potentials. The freeze-out hypersurface profiles for constant energy density are calculated, along with the corresponding normal vectors and presented as a new unit test for numerical codes. We also compare the influence of the equation of state on the semi-analytical solutions. We benchmark the newly developed Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code CCAKE that includes both shear viscosity and three conserved charges. The numerical solutions are in excellent agreement with the semi-analytical solution and also are able to accurately reproduce the hypersurface at freeze-out.</description>

      <title>Follow the curvature of viscoelastic stress: Insights into the steady arrowhead structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Focusing on simulated dilute polymer solutions, this letter investigates the interactions between flow structures and organized polymer stress sheets for the steady arrowhead coherent structure in a two-dimensional periodic channel flow. Formulating the problem in a frame of reference moving with the arrowhead velocity, streamlines, which are also pathlines in this frame, enables the identification of two distinct topological regions linked to two stagnation points. The streamlines help connecting the spatial distribution of polymer stress within the sheets and the dynamics of polymers transported by the flow. Using stresslines, lines parallel to the eigenvectors of polymer stress, a novel formulation of the viscoelastic stress term in the momentum transport equation proposes a more intuitive interpretation of the relation between the curvature of the stresslines, and the variation of stress along these lines, with the local flow topology. An approximation of this formulation is shown to explain the pressure jump observed in the arrowhead structure as a function of the local curvature of the polymer stress sheet.</description>

      <title>Osmotic forces modify lipid membrane fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In hydrodynamic descriptions of lipid bilayers, the membrane is often approximated as being impermeable to the surrounding, solute-containing fluid. However, biological and in vitro lipid membranes are influenced by their permeability and the resultant osmotic forces -- whose effects remain poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of a fluctuating, planar lipid membrane that is ideally selective: fluid can pass through it, while the electrically-neutral solutes cannot. We find that the canonical membrane relaxation mode, in which internal membrane forces are balanced by fluid drag, no longer exists over all wavenumbers. Rather, this mode only exists when it is slower than solute diffusion -- corresponding to a finite range of wavenumbers. The well-known equipartition result quantifying the size of membrane undulations due to thermal perturbations is consequently limited in its validity to the aforementioned range. Moreover, this range shrinks as the membrane surface tension is increased, and above a critical tension the membrane mode vanishes. Our findings are relevant when interpreting experimental measurements of membrane fluctuations, especially in vesicles at moderate to high tensions.</description>

      <title>Euler-Korteweg vortices: A fluid-mechanical analogue to the Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory and relativity exhibit several formal analogies with fluid mechanics. This paper extends upon known analogies by showing that under specific assumptions, an Euler-Korteweg vortex model can be cast into equations that are mathematically equivalent to the Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations. By assuming that the angular momentum of an irrotational vortex in an inviscid, barotropic, isothermal fluid with sound speed c is equal in magnitude to the reduced Planck constant, and incorporating Korteweg capillary stress, a complex wave equation describing the momentum and continuity equations of an Euler-Korteweg vortex is obtained. When uniform convection is introduced, the weak field approximation of this wave equation is formally equivalent to Schr\"odinger's equation. The model is shown to yield analogues to de Broglie wavelength, the Einstein-Planck relation, the Born rule and the uncertainty principle. Accounting for the retarded propagation of the wave field of a vortex in convection requires the Lorentz transformation and yields a wave equation mathematically equivalent to the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schr\"odinger's equation appearing as the low-Mach-number limit.</description>
