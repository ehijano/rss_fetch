      <title>Vector Flow Imaging in Layered Models With a High Speed of Sound Contrast Using Pulse-Echo Ultrasound and Photoacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop vector flow imaging techniques for multi-layered models with a high wavespeed contrast using photoacoustic and ultrasonic imaging. We use refraction-corrected delay-and-sum image reconstruction (RC-DAS), which enforces Snell's law to accurately calculate time delays within each layer. We compare RC-DAS against conventional delay-and-sum for vector flow imaging in benchtop phantoms made of transparent polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in a water bath. We study the flow beneath a PMMA layer using two phantoms, where the PMMA layer has different shapes and thicknesses. We image a slow-moving suspension of carbon microspheres (~4 mm/s) using interleaved photoacoustic and multi-angle plane wave ultrasound acquisitions measured with a 7.6 MHz linear ultrasound array. Photoacoustic waves are generated by a 1064 nm wavelength nanosecond-pulsed laser at 50 Hz, and multi-angle plane wave ultrasound data are acquired at 100 Hz for eleven steering angles between $\pm$10$^\circ$. RC-DAS improves the flow speed accuracy, reducing the mean absolute error by 0.41-0.63 mm/s compared to the expected flow profile. The error in direction estimates improves when we use RC-DAS, with the interdecile range reducing by up to 17$^\circ$. This work emphasises the importance of refraction correction for accurate flow measurements in layered media with photoacoustics and ultrasonic imaging. While both imaging modalities can quantify flow in these multi-layered models, the modality best suited for a specific application will depend on the imaging target and flow dynamics. These techniques show promise for biomedical applications such as intraosseous and transcranial blood flow quantification, and in nondestructive testing to monitor fluid motion.</description>

      <title>Cross-Axis Weighted Harmonic Method: A Frequency-Domain Approach for Enhanced Resolution in Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a promising imaging modality that tracks magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to generate real time, high-resolution images. However, achieving an optimal balance between strong signal strength and sharp image clarity remains challenging. Higher drive field frequencies improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but also risk image blurring due to nanoparticle relaxation effects. To address this, we developed an end-to-end MPI simulation framework that models MNPs behavior, magnetic field dynamics, signal acquisition, and image reconstruction across a wide frequency range (20 to 85 kHz). Central to this framework is Cross-Axis Harmonic Analysis (CAHA), a novel, frequency-domain signal processing technique that adaptively extracts high-SNR harmonics from the x, y, and z directions for improved signal reconstruction.
  Using a simulated 3D vascular phantom, CAHA significantly enhanced image quality, achieving sub-millimeter resolution (0.8 mm FWHM at 85 kHz), strong noise suppression (nRMSE as low as 0.01), and structural fidelity (SSIM up to 0.94 at 55 kHz). The peak SNR reached 29.7 dB at 85 kHz. The signal processed with CAHA was also tested with other reconstruction methods; when combined with total variation regularization, CAHA achieved a pSNR of 37.91 dB. Evaluation on the Open MPI dataset further demonstrated up to 20% resolution improvement, confirming CAHA's robustness on real-world data.
  Although minor blurring was observed at the highest frequency due to relaxation, CAHA consistently maintained image clarity. By leveraging directional harmonic content rather than the full signal, CAHA sets a new benchmark for sharper, faster, and more robust MPI imaging.</description>

      <title>Female anatomies disguise ECG abnormalities following myocardial infarction: an AI-enabled modelling and simulation study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is modulated by torso-heart anatomy, and this challenges patients' diagnosis and risk stratification. This study aims to quantify how torso-heart anatomical factors affect sex-differences in ECG biomarkers in acute and chronic myocardial infarction (MI). We exploit the perfect control of AI-augmented multiscale modelling and simulation, based on clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and ECGs for model construction and validation. A cohort of 1720 torso-ventricular anatomies (50% female) was constructed from MRIs of healthy and post-MI participants in the UK Biobank study. 8600 ECG simulations were performed considering anatomical variability and 3 electrophysiological stages (healthy, acutely ischemic, and infarcted). The effect of cardiac size, position, and orientation on each ECG biomarker was quantified. Female anatomies had larger distances between the infarct and ECG electrodes (relative to cardiac size), and larger angles between the infarct normal and ECG lead axes, both primarily caused by their more superior cardiac position. This reduced ST-elevation and caused low-amplitude late depolarisation and repolarisation tails to be missed, shortening QRS duration (QRSd) and T-peak-to-end interval (TpTe). The position and orientation of the heart impacted TpTe more severely than QRSd. AI-enabled mechanistic modelling and simulation identify smaller ventricles, superior cardiac position, and different ventricular orientation as key anatomical contributors of shorter QRS and T waves, and lower ST-elevation, in female versus male anatomies. This provides a blueprint for quantifying the impact of anatomical sex differences on functional markers and enables future work in tailoring clinical guidelines considering unique patient anatomy to reduce biased outcomes.</description>

      <title>Multiscale modeling of blood circulation with cerebral autoregulation and network pathway analysis for hemodynamic redistribution in the vascular network with anatomical variations and stenosis conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebral hemodynamics is fundamentally regulated by the Circle of Willis (CoW), which redistributes flow through communicating arteries to stabilize perfusion under anatomical variations and vascular stenosis. In this study, we develop a multiscale circulation model by coupling a systemic hemodynamic framework with a cerebral arterial network reconstructed from medical imaging. The model incorporates a cerebral autoregulation mechanism (CAM) and enables quantitative simulation of flow redistribution within the CoW under normal, anatomically varied, and stenotic conditions. Baseline simulations reproduce physiological flow distributions in which communicating arteries remain nearly inactive, showing negligible cross-flow and agreement with clinical measurements. In contrast, anatomical variations reveal distinct collateral activation patterns: the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) emerges as the earliest and most sensitive functional collateral, whereas the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) exhibit structure-dependent engagement. Progressive stenosis simulations further demonstrate a transition from a complete CoW to a fetal-type posterior cerebral artery (PCA) configuration, characterized by early ACoA flow reversal followed by ipsilateral PCoA activation, consistent with experimental and transcranial Doppler observations. Finally, a path-based quantitative analysis is introduced to illustrate how the cerebral vascular network dynamically reconfigures collateral pathways in response to structural changes. Overall, the proposed framework provides a physiologically interpretable, image-informed tool for investigating cerebral flow regulation through functional collaterals within the CoW, with potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment planning of cerebrovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>Real-time 3D Ultrasonic Needle Tracking with a Photoacoustic Beacon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many minimally invasive procedures, such as core needle biopsy of focal liver lesions, nerve blocks, and fetal and vascular interventions, are typically performed under ultrasound guidance, which provides real-time, high-resolution visualisation of tissue anatomy. Accurate and efficient localisation of the needle tip relative to patient anatomy is essential for guiding the needle towards the procedure target, avoiding adverse events and reducing the need for repeat procedures. However, the 3D nature of the procedure and poor image contrast of the needle in heterogeneous tissue or at steep insertion angles often leads to confusion over the true location of the tip within the 2D guidance images, and existing methods to enhance needle visibility largely remain limited to 2D. Here, we present a novel interventional ultrasound system capable of 2D B-mode imaging and 3D needle tracking. The tip location is determined from the time-of-flight of ultrasound generated by a photoacoustic beacon embedded in the needle bevel and received by a sparse receiver array distributed around the imaging system's curvilinear ultrasound probe. The measured tracking accuracy was better than 2 mm for depths up to 140 mm in water, and approximately 2 mm on average in an ex vivo tissue phantom, with referenced positions derived from X-ray CT. In a usability study involving 12 clinicians performing biopsy procedures in a ex vivo tissue phantom, the failure rate was reduced by 35 %, from 15.8 % to 10.3 % after only a few minutes of training. These results demonstrate that the proposed system has strong potential to support a wide range of minimally invasive procedures by enabling clinicians to accurately target anatomical structures with millimetre-level precision, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of diagnostic sampling and therapeutic delivery or ablation, and reducing the risk of adverse events.</description>

      <title>Dynamic optical coherence tomography algorithm for label-free assessment of swiftness and occupancy of intratissue moving scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) statistically analyzes fluctuations in time-sequential OCT signals, enabling label-free and three-dimensional visualization of intratissue and intracellular activities. Current DOCT methods, such as logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) and OCT correlation decay speed (OCDS) have several limitations.Namely, the DOCT values and intratissue motions are not directly related, and hence DOCT values are not interpretable in the context of the tissue motility. We introduce a new DOCT algorithm that provides more direct interpretation of DOCT in the contexts of dynamic scatterer ratio and scatterer speed in the tissue.The detailed properties of the new and conventional DOCT methods are investigated by numerical simulations, and the experimental validation with in vitro and ex vivo samples demonstrates the feasibility of the new method.</description>
