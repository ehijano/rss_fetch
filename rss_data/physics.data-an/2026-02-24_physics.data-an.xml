      <title>Symmetry-Constrained Forecasting of Periodically Correlated Energy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series in energy systems, such as solar irradiance, wind speed, or electrical load, are characterized by strong diurnal and seasonal periodicities. Accurate forecasting requires accounting for time varying statistical properties that stationary or classical persistence models cannot capture. \cyr{A family of analytical forecasting operators for cyclostationary processes is introduced, extending persistence through a closed form coefficient $\tilde{\lambda}(t,\tau)=\tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(1+\rho(t,\tau)\bigr)$, where $\rho(t,\tau)$ denotes the local correlation between the current observation and its phase aligned counterpart}. This formulation preserves periodic variance and covariance, achieving a symmetry induced reduction of effective degrees of freedom. The resulting operator defines a training free analytical limit of persistence under periodic non stationarity. Validation on synthetic cyclostationary signals and empirical renewable energy datasets demonstrates consistent accuracy gains over classical persistence, particularly at multi hour horizons. By embedding temporal symmetry into the prediction process, the framework provides a physically interpretable, reproducible, and computationally minimal baseline for forecasting periodic processes across energy and complex systems.</description>

      <title>Hearing the forest for the trees: machine learning and topological acoustics for remote sensing with seismic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring remote forests is a global challenge central to climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation, yet satellite observations are frequently limited by weather, dense canopies, and solar dependency. Here we show that passive seismic sensing offers a persistent, all-weather alternative for autonomous ecosystem monitoring by capturing characteristic learnable signatures of trees within the ambient wavefield. Using seismic data from Alaska, we demonstrate that cross-correlations between stations provide a physical basis for forest detection by approximating the empirical Green's function of the medium. Supervised machine learning models applied to these data achieve a classification accuracy of 86%, identifying key discriminating frequencies (35 to 60 Hz) consistent with known forest-wave interactions. A topological acoustics analysis of the geometric phase change independently confirms the physical origin of these data-driven classifications. Together, these results provide the first demonstration that subtle forest-wave interactions manifest in ambient seismic noise and can be harnessed as a scalable tool for continuous vegetation monitoring, offering a robust solution for tracking environmental change challenging regions.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation Limits in Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter degeneracy in blazar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is known but rarely quantified. This paper introduces a Fisher Information approach to determine theoretical limits to information extraction in the context of one-zone models. By evaluating the total Fisher Information by varying $\delta$, $B$, $p$, $\gamma_{\rm min}$ and $\gamma_{\rm max}$, we find that EC models encode Fisher information $\gtrsim10^4$ times less than that in SSC models, establishing differences in limits of physical information extraction even in the case of perfect sampling. Moreover, the Fisher information in both SSC and EC models exhibit strong fluctuations across the parameter space, but since the magnitudes are orders of magnitude lower in EC, limits of parameter inference are expected to be worse in FSRQ SEDs than BL Lacs. We also find that the Doppler factor $\delta$ carries at least $10^{2-3}$ more Fisher information than that for $p$ and $B$ in both EC and SSC, making $\delta$ the most constrained SED parameter. Applying our Fisher Information motivated framework to real flaring SEDs of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) CTA 102 and 3C 279, we show that mild variations in $\delta$ and $p$ can appreciably produce the flaring SEDs starting from the quiescent model, while two other flares in 3C 279 simple geometric and spectral considerations cannot reproduce the flares, reducing the efficacy of one-zone models. We propose that time-resolved SED models are indispensable to constraining physical parameters in EC-dominated blazars.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware, Shannon-Optimal Compression via Arithmetic Coding for Distributional Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing whether two datasets are distributionally consistent has become a central theme in modern scientific analysis, particularly as generative artificial intelligence is increasingly used to produce synthetic datasets whose fidelity must be rigorously validated against the original data on which they are trained, a task made more challenging by the continued growth in data volume and problem dimensionality. In this work, we propose the use of arithmetic coding to provide a lossless and invertible compression of datasets under a physics-informed probabilistic representation. Datasets that share the same underlying physical correlations admit comparable optimal descriptions, while discrepancies in those correlations-arising from miscalibration, mismodeling, or bias-manifest as an irreducible excess in code length. This excess codelength defines an operational fidelity metric, quantified directly in bits through differences in achievable compression length relative to a physics-inspired reference distribution. We demonstrate that this metric is global, interpretable, additive across components, and asymptotically optimal in the Shannon sense. Moreover, we show that differences in codelength correspond to differences in expected negative log-likelihood evaluated under the same physics-informed reference model. As a byproduct, we also demonstrate that our compression approach achieves a higher compression ratio than traditional general-purpose algorithms such as gzip. Our results establish lossless, physics-aware compression based on arithmetic coding not as an end in itself, but as a measurement instrument for testing the fidelity between datasets.</description>

      <title>Koopman Analysis of Sea Surface Temperature with a Signature Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a trajectory-based Koopman method for sea surface temperature (SST) that lifts annual SST segments using a signature kernel -- a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) kernel that compares paths via iterated-integral features -- and learns the one-year shift operator. By operating on annual trajectory segments rather than instantaneous fields, the method encodes finite-time history, which helps capture memory effects in SST-only evolution. The resulting operator improves out-of-sample multi-year forecast skill relative to a climatology baseline and reveals coherent spectral modes. We implement the approach via kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) on signature-kernel Gram matrices, yielding a single pipeline for forecasting and spectral diagnostics of high-dimensional SST dynamics.</description>

      <title>Confidence intervals for the Poisson distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Poisson probability distribution is frequently encountered in physical science measurements. In spite of the simplicity and familiarity of this distribution, there is considerable confusion among physicists concerning the description of results obtained via Poisson sampling. The goal of this paper is to mitigate this confusion by examining and comparing the properties of both conventional and popular alternative techniques. We concern ourselves in particular with the description of results, as opposed to interpretation. After considering performance with respect to several desirable properties we recommend summarizing the results of Poisson sampling with confidence intervals proposed by Garwood. We note that the p-values obtained from these intervals are well-behaved and intuitive, providing for consistent treatment. We also find that averaging intervals can be problematic if the underlying Poisson distributions are not used.</description>
