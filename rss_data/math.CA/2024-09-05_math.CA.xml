      <title>Hausdorff measure and decay rate of Riesz capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay rate of Riesz capacity as the exponent increases to the dimension of the set is shown to yield Hausdorff measure. The result applies to strongly rectifiable sets, and so in particular to submanifolds of Euclidean space. For strictly self-similar fractals, a one-sided decay estimate is found. Along the way, a purely measure theoretic proof is given for subadditivity of the reciprocal of Riesz energy.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotics of real solutions for the Painlev\'{e} I equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the asymptotic formulas of real Painlev\'e I transcendents as the independent variable tends to negative infinity, which were initially derived by Kapaev with the complex WKB method. Using the Riemann-Hilbert method, we improve the error estimates of the oscillatory type asymptotics and provide precise error estimates of the singular type asymptotics. We also establish the corresponding asymptotics for the associated Hamiltonians of real Painlev\'e I transcendents. In addition, two typos in the mentioned asymptotic behaviors in literature are corrected.</description>

      <title>Finite Bivariate Biorthogonal M-Konhauser Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the pair of finite bivariate biorthogonal M-Konhauser polynomials, reduced to the finite orthogonal polynomials $M_{n}^{(p,q)}(t)$, by choosing appropriate parameters in order to obtain a relation between the Jacobi Konhauser polynomials and this new finite bivariate biorthogonal polynomials $_{K}M_{n;\upsilon}^{(p,q)}(z,t)$ similar to the relation between the classical Jacobi polynomials $P_{n}^{(p,q)}(t)$ and the finite orthogonal polynomials $M_{n}^{(p,q)}(t)$. Several properties like generating function, operational/integral representation are derived and some applications like fractional calculus, Fourier transform and Laplace transform are studied thanks to that new transition relation and the definition of finite bivariate M-Konhauser polynomials.</description>

      <title>Strong Converse Inequalities for Bernstein Polynomials with Explicit Asymptotic Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain strong converse inequalities for the Bernstein polynomials with explicit asymptotic constants. We give different estimation procedures in the central and non-central regions of [0,1]. The main ingredients in our approach are the following: representation of the derivatives of the Bernstein polynomials in terms of the Krawtchouk polynomials, estimates of different inverse moments of various random variables, sharp estimates of both absolute central moments of Bernstein polynomials and the total variation distance between binomial and Poisson distributions, and iterates of the Bernstein polynomials, together with their probabilistic representations.</description>

      <title>Prolongation of solutions and Lyapunov stability for Stieltjes dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce Lyapunov-type results to investigate the stability of the trivial solution of a Stieltjes dynamical system. We utilize prolongation results to establish the global existence of the maximal solution. Using Lyapunov's second method, we establish results of (uniform) stability and (uniform) asymptotic stability by employing a Lyapunov function. Additionally, we present examples and real-life applications to study asymptotic stability of equilibria in two population dynamics models.</description>

      <title>On variants of the Furstenberg set problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $s \in (0,1]$ and $t \in [0,2]$, suppose a set $X$ in the plane has the following property:~there is a collection of lines of packing dimension $t$ such that every line from the collection intersects $X$ in a set of packing dimension at least $s$. We show that such sets must have packing dimension at least $\max\{s,t/2\}$ and that this bound is sharp. In particular this solves a variant of the Furstenberg set problem for packing dimension. We also solve the upper and lower box dimension variants of the problem. In both of these cases the sharp threshold is $\max\{s,t-1\}$.</description>

      <title>Multislicing and effective equidistribution for random walks on some homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a random walk on a homogeneous space $G/\Lambda$ where $G$ is $\mathrm{SO}(2,1)$ or $\mathrm{SO}(3,1)$ and $\Lambda$ is a lattice. The walk is driven by a probability measure $\mu$ on $G$ whose support generates a Zariski-dense subgroup. We show that for every starting point $x \in G/\Lambda$ which is not trapped in a finite $\mu$-invariant set, the $n$-step distribution $\mu^{*n}*\delta_{x}$ of the walk equidistributes toward the Haar measure. Moreover, under arithmetic assumptions on the pair $(\Lambda, \mu)$, we show the convergence occurs at an exponential rate, tempered by the obstructions that $x$ may be high in a cusp or close to a finite orbit.
  Our approach is substantially different from that of Benoist-Quint, whose equidistribution statements only hold in Ces\`aro average and are not quantitative, that of Bourgain-Furman-Lindenstrauss-Mozes concerning the torus case, and that of Lindenstrauss-Mohammadi-Wang and Yang about the analogous problem for unipotent flows. A key new feature of our proof is the use of a new phenomenon which we call multislicing. The latter is a generalization of the discretized projection theorems \`a la Bourgain and we believe it presents independent interest.</description>

      <title>Proof of the refined Dubrovin conjecture for the Lagrangian Grassmanian $LG(2,4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dubrovin conjecture predicts a relationship between the monodromy data of the Frobenius manifold associated to the quantum cohomology of a smooth projective variety and the bounded derived category of the same variety. A refinement of this conjecture was given by Cotti, Dubrovin and Guzzetti, which is equivalent to the Gamma conjecture II proposed by Galkin, Golyshev and Iritani. The Gamma conjecture II for quadrics was proved by Hu and Ke. The Lagrangian Grassmanian $LG(2,4)$ is isomorphic to the quadric in $\mathbb P^4$. In this paper, we give a new proof of the refined Dubrovin conjecture for the Lagrangian Grassmanian $LG(2,4)$ by explicit computation.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e and Sobolev inequalities with variable exponents and log-Holder continuity only at the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Sobolev-Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e inequalities in variable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p(\cdot)}(\Omega)$, with $\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ a bounded John domain, with weaker regularity assumptions on the exponent $p(\cdot)$ that have been used previously. In particular, we require $p(\cdot)$ to satisfy a new \emph{boundary $\log$-H\"older condition} that imposes some logarithmic decay on the oscillation of $p(\cdot)$ towards the boundary of the domain. Some control over the interior oscillation of $p(\cdot)$ is also needed, but it is given by a very general condition that allows $p(\cdot)$ to be discontinuous at every point of $\Omega$. Our results follows from a local-to-global argument based on the continuity of certain Hardy type operators. We provide examples that show that our boundary $\log$-H\"older condition is essentially necessary for our main results. The same examples are adapted to show that this condition is not sufficient for other related inequalities. Finally, we give an application to a Neumann problem for a degenerate $p(\cdot)$-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>An extension of Calder\'on transfer principle to weighted spaces with some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.07589v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power of Calder\'on transfer principle is well known when proving strong type and weak type inequalities for certain type of operators in ergodic theory. In this article we show that Calder\'on's argument can be extended to have a transfer principle to be able to prove weighted inequalities for those operators satisfying the conditions of Calder\'on transfer principle. We also include some applications of our results.</description>

      <title>Solution to the iterative differential equation $-\gamma g' = g^{-1}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a Picard-like operator $T$, we prove that the iterative differential equation $-\gamma g' = g^{-1}$ with parameter $\gamma&gt;0$ has a solution $g=h\colon[0,1]\to[0,1]$ for only one value $\gamma=\kappa\approx0.278877$, and that this solution $h$ is unique. As an even stronger result, we exhibit $h$ as the global limit of the operator $T$.</description>

      <title>Uniform extension of definable $C^{m,\omega}$-Whitney jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that definable Whitney jets of class $C^{m,\omega}$, where $m$ is a nonnegative integer and $\omega$ is a modulus of continuity, are the restrictions of definable $C^{m,\omega}$-functions; "definable" refers to an arbitrary given o-minimal expansion of the real field. This is true in a uniform way: any definable bounded family of Whitney jets of class $C^{m,\omega}$ extends to a definable bounded family of $C^{m,\omega}$-functions. We also discuss a uniform $C^m$-version and how the extension depends on the modulus of continuity.</description>
