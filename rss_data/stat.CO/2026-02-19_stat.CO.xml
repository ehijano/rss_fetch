      <title>Quantifying and Attributing Submodel Uncertainty in Stochastic Simulation Models and Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic simulation is widely used to study complex systems composed of various interconnected subprocesses, such as input processes, routing and control logic, optimization routines, and data-driven decision modules. In practice, these subprocesses may be inherently unknown or too computationally intensive to directly embed in the simulation model. Replacing these elements with estimated or learned approximations introduces a form of epistemic uncertainty that we refer to as submodel uncertainty. This paper investigates how submodel uncertainty affects the estimation of system performance metrics. We develop a framework for quantifying submodel uncertainty in stochastic simulation models and extend the framework to digital-twin settings, where simulation experiments are repeatedly conducted with the model initialized from observed system states. Building on approaches from input uncertainty analysis, we leverage bootstrapping and Bayesian model averaging to construct quantile-based confidence or credible intervals for key performance indicators. We propose a tree-based method that decomposes total output variability and attributes uncertainty to individual submodels in the form of importance scores. The proposed framework is model-agnostic and accommodates both parametric and nonparametric submodels under frequentist and Bayesian modeling paradigms. A synthetic numerical experiment and a more realistic digital-twin simulation of a contact center illustrate the importance of understanding how and how much individual submodels contribute to overall uncertainty.</description>

      <title>MARLEM: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Simulation Framework for Implicit Cooperation in Decentralized Local Energy Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, open-source MARL simulation framework for studying implicit cooperation in LEMs, modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and implemented as a Gymnasium environment for MARL. Our framework features a modular market platform with plug-and-play clearing mechanisms, physically constrained agent models (including battery storage), a realistic grid network, and a comprehensive analytics suite to evaluate emergent coordination. The main contribution is a novel method to foster implicit cooperation, where agents' observations and rewards are enhanced with system-level key performance indicators to enable them to independently learn strategies that benefit the entire system and aim for collectively beneficial outcomes without explicit communication. Through representative case studies (available in a dedicated GitHub repository in https://github.com/salazarna/marlem, we show the framework's ability to analyze how different market configurations (such as varying storage deployment) impact system performance. This illustrates its potential to facilitate emergent coordination, improve market efficiency, and strengthen grid stability. The proposed simulation framework is a flexible, extensible, and reproducible tool for researchers and practitioners to design, test, and validate strategies for future intelligent, decentralized energy systems.</description>

      <title>HAL-MLE Log-Splines Density Estimation (Part I: Univariate)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation of probability densities under a total variation (TV) type penalty, sectional variation norm (also named as Hardy-Krause variation). TV regularization has a long history in regression and density estimation, including results on $L^2$ and KL divergence convergence rates. Here, we revisit this task using the Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) framework. We formulate a HAL-based maximum likelihood estimator (HAL-MLE) using the log-spline link function from \citet{kooperberg1992logspline}, and show that in the univariate setting the bounded sectional variation norm assumption underlying HAL coincides with the classical bounded TV assumption. This equivalence directly connects HAL-MLE to existing TV-penalized approaches such as local adaptive splines \citep{mammen1997locally}. We establish three new theoretical results: (i) the univariate HAL-MLE is asymptotically linear, (ii) it admits pointwise asymptotic normality, and (iii) it achieves uniform convergence at rate $n^{-(k+1)/(2k+3)}$ up to logarithmic factors for the smoothness order $k \geq 1$. These results extend existing results from \citet{van2017uniform}, which previously guaranteed only uniform consistency without rates when $k=0$. We will include the uniform convergence for general dimension $d$ in the follow-up work of this paper. The intention of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the TV-penalized density estimation methods, and to connect the HAL-MLE to the existing TV-penalized methods in the univariate case, despite that the general HAL-MLE is defined for multivariate cases.</description>

      <title>Whittle-Mat\'{e}rn Fields with Variable Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a nonlocal generalization of Whittle--Mat\'ern Gaussian fields in which the smoothness parameter varies in space through the fractional order, $s=s(x)\in[\underline{s}\,,\bar{s}]\subset(0,1)$. The model is defined via an integral-form operator whose kernel is constructed from the modified Bessel function of the second kind and whose local singularity is governed by the symmetric exponent $\beta(x,y)=(s(x)+s(y))/2$. This variable-order nonlocal formulation departs from the classical constant-order pseudodifferential setting and raises new analytic and numerical challenges. We develop a novel variational framework adapted to the kernel, prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions on truncated bounded domains, and derive Sobolev regularity of the Gaussian (spectral) solution controlled by the minimal local order: realizations lie in $H^r(G)$ for every $r&lt;2\underline{s}-\tfrac{d}{2}$ (here $H^r(G)$ denotes the Sobolev space on the bounded domain $G$), hence in $L_2(G)$ when $\underline s&gt;d/4$. We also present a finite-element sampling method for the integral model, derive error estimates, and provide numerical experiments in one dimension that illustrate the impact of spatially varying smoothness on samples covariances. Computational aspects and directions for scalable implementations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Solving Fredholm Integral Equations of the Second Kind via Wasserstein Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent method for approximate solution of Fredholm equations of the first kind, we develop a corresponding method for a class of Fredholm equations of the \emph{second kind}. In particular, we consider the class of equations for which the solution is a probability measure. The approach centres around specifying a functional whose gradient flow admits a minimizer corresponding to a regularized version of the solution of the underlying equation and using a mean-field particle system to approximately simulate that flow. Theoretical support for the method is presented, along with some illustrative numerical results.</description>

      <title>Large-sample analysis of cost functionals for inference under the coalescent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coalescent is a foundational model of latent genealogical trees under neutral evolution, but suffers from intractable sampling probabilities. Methods for approximating these sampling probabilities either introduce bias or fail to scale to large sample sizes. We show that a class of cost functionals of the coalescent with recurrent mutation and a finite number of alleles converge to tractable processes in the infinite-sample limit. A particular choice of costs yields insight about importance sampling methods, which are a classical tool for coalescent sampling probability approximation. These insights reveal that the behaviour of coalescent importance sampling algorithms differs markedly from standard sequential importance samplers, with or without resampling. We conduct a simulation study to verify that our asymptotics are accurate for algorithms with finite (and moderate) sample sizes. Our results constitute the first theoretical description of large-sample importance sampling algorithms for the coalescent, provide heuristics for the a priori optimisation of computational effort, and identify settings where resampling is harmful for algorithm performance. We observe strikingly different behaviour for importance sampling methods under the infinite sites model of mutation, which is regarded as a good and more tractable approximation of finite alleles mutation in most respects.</description>

      <title>Block Empirical Likelihood Inference for Longitudinal Generalized Partially Linear Single-Index Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized partially linear single-index models (GPLSIMs) provide a flexible and interpretable semiparametric framework for longitudinal outcomes by combining a low-dimensional parametric component with a nonparametric index component. For repeated measurements, valid inference is challenging because within-subject correlation induces nuisance parameters and variance estimation can be unstable in semiparametric settings. We propose a profile estimating-equation approach based on spline approximation of the unknown link function and construct a subject-level block empirical likelihood (BEL) for joint inference on the parametric coefficients and the single-index direction. The resulting BEL ratio statistic enjoys a Wilks-type chi-square limit, yielding likelihood-free confidence regions without explicit sandwich variance estimation. We also discuss practical implementation, including constrained optimization for the index parameter, working-correlation choices, and bootstrap-based confidence bands for the nonparametric component. Simulation studies and an application to the epilepsy longitudinal study illustrate the finite-sample performance.</description>
