      <title>Generation of Phonons with Angular Momentum During Ultrafast Demagnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major question in the field of femtosecond laser-induced demagnetization is whereto the angular momentum lost by the electrons is transferred. Recent ultrafast electron diffraction measurements [Tauchert \textit{et al.}, Nature {\bf 602}, 73 (2022)] suggest that this angular momentum is transferred to the rotational motion of atoms on a sub-picosecond timescale, but a theory confirmation of this proposition has yet to be given. Here we investigate the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics during ultrafast demagnetization of L1$_0$ FePt, using Ehrenfest nuclear dynamics simulations combined with the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) framework. We demonstrate that atomic rotations appear, i.e., the generation of phonons carrying finite angular momentum following ultrafast demagnetization. We further show that both ultrafast demagnetization and the generation of phonons with angular momentum arise from symmetry constraints imposed by the spin-orbit coupling, thus providing insight in spin-phonon interaction at ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Enhancing high-order harmonic generation in two-color laser fields: A comparison of single- and two-color schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the enhancement of high-order harmonic generation in argon using 800--400 and 800--266~nm laser fields with their optimized single-color counterparts. We observe that the two-color fields generally outperform the single-color 800~nm field by factors of 2 to 3800, depending on the photon energy and generation scheme. From this comparison, we determine which scheme is optimal for each photon energy. We also observe that the divergence of HHG produced by the 800--266~nm laser fields is smaller than that of the other single- and two-color driving fields, perhaps suggesting that the 800--266~nm fields optimize the recombination probability of the so-called ``short" electron trajectories.</description>

      <title>Demonstration and frequency noise characterization of a 17 $\mu$m quantum cascade laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the spectral performance of a novel continuous-wave room-temperature distributed feedback quantum cascade laser operating at the long wavelength of 17 $\mu$m. By demonstrating broadband laser absorption spectroscopy of the $\nu$2 fundamental vibrational mode of N2O molecules, we have determined the spectral range and established the spectroscopic potential of this laser. We have characterized the frequency noise and measured the line width of this new device, uncovering a discrepancy with the current consensus on the theoretical modeling of quantum cascade lasers. Our results confirm the potential of such novel narrow-line-width sources for vibrational spectroscopy. Extending laser spectroscopy to longer wavelength is a fascinating prospect that paves the way for a wide range of opportunities from chemical detection, to frequency metrology as well as for exploring light-matter interaction with an extended variety of molecules, from ultra-cold diatomic species to increasingly complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Optical clock based on two-photon spectroscopy of the nuclear transition in ion $^{229}$Th in a monochromatic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15669v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the isotope $^{229}$Th we investigate the possibility of two-photon laser spectroscopy of the nuclear clock transition (148.38 nm) using intense monochromatic laser field at twice the wavelength (296.76 nm). Our estimates show that due to the electron bridge process in the doubly ionized ion $^{229}$Th$^{2+}$ the sufficient intensity of a continuous laser field is about 10-100 kW/cm$^2$, which is within the reach of modern laser systems. This unique possibility is an result of the presence in the electronic spectrum of the ion $^{229}$Th$^{2+}$ of an exceptionally close intermediate (for the two-photon transition) energy level, forming a strong dipole ($E1$) transition with the ground state at the wavelength of 297.86 nm, which differs from the probe field wavelength (296.76 nm) by only 1.1 nm. The obtained results can be used for the practical creation of ultra-precise nuclear optical clocks based on thorium-229 ions. Moreover, we develop an alternative approach to the description of the electron bridge phenomenon in an isolated ion (atom) using the hyperfine interaction operator, that is important for the general quantum theory of an atom. In particular, this approach shows that the contribution to the electron bridge from the nuclear quadrupole moment can be comparable to the contribution from the nuclear magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking direct and indirect dipolar spin-exchange interactions between two Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced F\"orster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Migdal transition probabilities in electron-atom inelastic cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16911v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal transition probabilities for dark matter scattering are compared to the total single-electron inelastic cross sections of electron-atom scattering for isolated Ar and Xe. The comparison is done by expressing the electron-atom scattering cross section by connecting the Migdal probability. The resultant differences are around $30 \ \%$ for Ar and $80 \ \%$ for Xe in $\sim$ 1 keV of incoming electron energy. The transition is dominated from the $3p$ shell electrons for Ar. For Xe, $5p$ states dominate the contribution, but, $4d$ states give $\sim 40\ \%$ contribution at 1 keV.</description>

      <title>In-situ mid-circuit qubit measurement and reset in a single-species trapped-ion quantum computing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement in-situ mid-circuit measurement and reset (MCMR) operations on a trapped-ion quantum computing system by using metastable qubit states in $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions. We introduce and compare two methods for isolating data qubits from measured qubits: one shelves the data qubit into the metastable state and the other drives the measured qubit to the metastable state without disturbing the other qubits. We experimentally demonstrate both methods on a crystal of two $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions using both the $S_{1/2}$ ground state hyperfine clock qubit and the $S_{1/2}$-$D_{3/2}$ optical qubit. These MCMR methods result in errors on the data qubit of about $2\%$ without degrading the measurement fidelity. With straightforward reductions in laser noise, these errors can be suppressed to less than $0.1\%$. The demonstrated method allows MCMR to be performed in a single-species ion chain without shuttling or additional qubit-addressing optics, greatly simplifying the architecture.</description>
