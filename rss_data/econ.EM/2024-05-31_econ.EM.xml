      <title>Modelling and Forecasting Energy Market Volatility Using GARCH and Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of univariate and multivariate GARCH-family models and machine learning algorithms in modeling and forecasting the volatility of major energy commodities: crude oil, gasoline, heating oil, and natural gas. It uses a comprehensive dataset incorporating financial, macroeconomic, and environmental variables to assess predictive performance and discusses volatility persistence and transmission across these commodities. Aspects of volatility persistence and transmission, traditionally examined by GARCH-class models, are jointly explored using the SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) method. The findings reveal that machine learning models demonstrate superior out-of-sample forecasting performance compared to traditional GARCH models. Machine learning models tend to underpredict, while GARCH models tend to overpredict energy market volatility, suggesting a hybrid use of both types of models. There is volatility transmission from crude oil to the gasoline and heating oil markets. The volatility transmission in the natural gas market is less prevalent.</description>

      <title>The Political Resource Curse Redux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of the Political Resource Curse (Brollo et al.,2013), the authors identified a new channel to investigate whether the windfalls of resources are unambiguously beneficial to society, both with theory and empirical evidence. This paper revisits the framework with a new dataset. Specifically, we implemented a regression discontinuity design and difference-in-difference specification</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimization Algorithms for Instrumental Variable Regression with Streaming Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyze algorithms for instrumental variable regression by viewing the problem as a conditional stochastic optimization problem. In the context of least-squares instrumental variable regression, our algorithms neither require matrix inversions nor mini-batches and provides a fully online approach for performing instrumental variable regression with streaming data. When the true model is linear, we derive rates of convergence in expectation, that are of order $\mathcal{O}(\log T/T)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/T^{1-\iota})$ for any $\iota&gt;0$, respectively under the availability of two-sample and one-sample oracles, respectively, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Importantly, under the availability of the two-sample oracle, our procedure avoids explicitly modeling and estimating the relationship between confounder and the instrumental variables, demonstrating the benefit of the proposed approach over recent works based on reformulating the problem as minimax optimization problems. Numerical experiments are provided to corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>The ARR2 prior: flexible predictive prior definition for Bayesian auto-regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the ARR2 prior, a joint prior over the auto-regressive components in Bayesian time-series models and their induced $R^2$. Compared to other priors designed for times-series models, the ARR2 prior allows for flexible and intuitive shrinkage. We derive the prior for pure auto-regressive models, and extend it to auto-regressive models with exogenous inputs, and state-space models. Through both simulations and real-world modelling exercises, we demonstrate the efficacy of the ARR2 prior in improving sparse and reliable inference, while showing greater inference quality and predictive performance than other shrinkage priors. An open-source implementation of the prior is provided.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional spatiotemporal clustering -- An application to environmental sustainability scores in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assessment of corporate sustainability performance is extremely relevant in facilitating the transition to a green and low-carbon intensity economy. However, companies located in different areas may be subject to different sustainability and environmental risks and policies. Henceforth, the main objective of this paper is to investigate the spatial and temporal pattern of the sustainability evaluations of European firms. We leverage on a large dataset containing information about companies' sustainability performances, measured by MSCI ESG ratings, and geographical coordinates of firms in Western Europe between 2013 and 2023. By means of a modified version of the Chavent et al. (2018) hierarchical algorithm, we conduct a spatial clustering analysis, combining sustainability and spatial information, and a spatiotemporal clustering analysis, which combines the time dynamics of multiple sustainability features and spatial dissimilarities, to detect groups of firms with homogeneous sustainability performance. We are able to build cross-national and cross-industry clusters with remarkable differences in terms of sustainability scores. Among other results, in the spatio-temporal analysis, we observe a high degree of geographical overlap among clusters, indicating that the temporal dynamics in sustainability assessment are relevant within a multidimensional approach. Our findings help to capture the diversity of ESG ratings across Western Europe and may assist practitioners and policymakers in evaluating companies facing different sustainability-linked risks in different areas.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences with Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12003v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many scenarios, such as the evaluation of place-based policies, potential outcomes are not only dependent upon the unit's own treatment but also its neighbors' treatment. Despite this, "difference-in-differences" (DID) type estimators typically ignore such interference among neighbors. I show in this paper that the canonical DID estimators generally fail to identify interesting causal effects in the presence of neighborhood interference. To incorporate interference structure into DID estimation, I propose doubly robust estimators for the direct average treatment effect on the treated as well as the average spillover effects under a modified parallel trends assumption. The approach in this paper relaxes common restrictions in the literature, such as partial interference and correctly specified spillover functions. Moreover, robust inference is discussed based on the asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimators.</description>

      <title>Latent Factor Analysis in Short Panels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop inferential tools for latent factor analysis in short panels. The pseudo maximum likelihood setting under a large cross-sectional dimension n and a fixed time series dimension T relies on a diagonal TxT covariance matrix of the errors without imposing sphericity nor Gaussianity. We outline the asymptotic distributions of the latent factor and error covariance estimates as well as of an asymptotically uniformly most powerful invariant (AUMPI) test for the number of factors based on the likelihood ratio statistic. We derive the AUMPI characterization from inequalities ensuring the monotone likelihood ratio property for positive definite quadratic forms in normal variables. An empirical application to a large panel of monthly U.S. stock returns separates month after month systematic and idiosyncratic risks in short subperiods of bear vs. bull market based on the selected number of factors. We observe an uptrend in the paths of total and idiosyncratic volatilities while the systematic risk explains a large part of the cross-sectional total variance in bear markets but is not driven by a single factor. Rank tests show that observed factors struggle spanning latent factors with a discrepancy between the dimensions of the two factor spaces decreasing over time.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Equilibrium the Lucas Critique and Keynesian Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a mathematically rigorous solution overturns existing wisdom regarding New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium. I develop a formal concept of stochastic equilibrium. I prove uniqueness and necessity, when agents are patient, with general application. Existence depends on appropriately specified eigenvalue conditions. Otherwise, no solution of any kind exists. I construct the equilibrium with Calvo pricing. I provide novel comparative statics with the non-stochastic model of mathematical significance. I uncover a bifurcation between neighbouring stochastic systems and approximations taken from the Zero Inflation Non-Stochastic Steady State (ZINSS). The correct Phillips curve agrees with the zero limit from the trend inflation framework. It contains a large lagged inflation coefficient and a small response to expected inflation. Price dispersion can be first or second order depending how shocks are scaled. The response to the output gap is always muted and is zero at standard parameters. A neutrality result is presented to explain why and align Calvo with Taylor pricing. Present and lagged demand shocks enter the Phillips curve so there is no Divine Coincidence and the system is identified from structural shocks alone. The lagged inflation slope is increasing in the inflation response, embodying substantive policy trade-offs. The Taylor principle is reversed, inactive settings are necessary, pointing towards inertial policy. The observational equivalence idea of the Lucas critique is disproven. The bifurcation results from the breakdown of the constraints implied by lagged nominal rigidity, associated with cross-equation cancellation possible only at ZINSS. There is a dual relationship between restrictions on the econometrician and constraints on repricing firms. Thus, if the model is correct, goodness of fit will jump.</description>
