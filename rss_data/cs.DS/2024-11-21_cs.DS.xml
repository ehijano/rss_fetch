      <title>Oblivious Algorithms for Maximum Directed Cut: New Upper and Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the maximum directed cut problem, the input is a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, and the goal is to pick a partition $V = S \cup (V \setminus S)$ of the vertices such that as many edges as possible go from $S$ to $V\setminus S$. Oblivious algorithms, introduced by Feige and Jozeph (Algorithmica'17), are a simple class of algorithms for this problem. These algorithms independently and randomly assign each vertex $v$ to either $S$ or $V \setminus S$, and the distribution of $v$'s assignment is determined using only extremely local information about $v$: its bias, i.e., the relative difference between its out- and in-degrees. These algorithms have natural implementations in certain graph streaming models, where they have important implications (Saxena, Singer, Sudan, and Velusamy, SODA'23, FOCS'23, Kallaugher, Parekh, and Voronova, STOC'24).
  In this work, we narrow the gap between upper and lower bounds on the best approximation ratio achievable by oblivious algorithms for Max-Directed-Cut. We show that there exists an oblivious algorithm achieving an approximation ratio of at least $0.4853$, while every oblivious algorithm obeying a natural symmetry property achieves an approximation ratio of at most $0.4889$. The previous known bounds were $0.4844$ and $0.4899$, due to Singer (APPROX'23) and Feige and Jozeph, respectively. Our techniques involve designing principled parameterizations of the spaces of algorithms and lower bounds and then executing computer searches through these spaces.</description>

      <title>On the structure of normalized models of circular-arc graphs -- Hsu's approach revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular-arc graphs are the intersection graphs of arcs of a circle. The main result of this work describes the structure of all \emph{normalized intersection models} of circular-arc graphs. Normalized models of a circular-arc graph reflect the neighborhood relation between its vertices and can be seen as its canonical representations; in particular, any intersection model can be made normalized by possibly extending some of its arcs. We~devise a data-structure, called \emph{PQM-tree}, that maintains the set of all normalized models of a circular-arc graph. We show that the PQM-tree of a circular-arc graph can be computed in linear time. Finally, basing on PQM-trees, we provide a linear-time algorithm for the canonization and the isomorphism problem for circular-arc graphs.
  We describe the structure of the normalized models of circular-arc graphs using an approach proposed by Hsu~[\emph{SIAM J. Comput. 24(3), 411--439, (1995)}]. In the aforementioned work, Hsu claimed the construction of decomposition trees representing the set of all normalized intersection models of circular-arc graphs and an $\mathcal{O}(nm)$ time isomorphism algorithm for this class of graphs. However, the counterexample given in~[\emph{Discrete Math. Theor. Comput. Sci., 15(1), 157--182, 2013}] shows that Hsu's isomorphism algorithm is not incorrect. Also, in a companion paper we show that the decomposition trees proposed by Hsu are not constructed correctly; in particular, we showed that there are circular-arc graphs whose all normalized models do not follow the description given by Hsu.</description>

      <title>Sampling and Integration of Logconcave Functions by Algorithmic Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of sampling, rounding, and integrating arbitrary logconcave functions. Our new approach provides the first complexity improvements in nearly two decades for general logconcave functions for all three problems, and matches the best-known complexities for the special case of uniform distributions on convex bodies. For the sampling problem, our output guarantees are significantly stronger than previously known, and lead to a streamlined analysis of statistical estimation based on dependent random samples.</description>

      <title>Omnipredicting Single-Index Models with Multi-Index Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on supervised learning [GKR+22] defined the notion of omnipredictors, i.e., predictor functions $p$ over features that are simultaneously competitive for minimizing a family of loss functions $\mathcal{L}$ against a comparator class $\mathcal{C}$. Omniprediction requires approximating the Bayes-optimal predictor beyond the loss minimization paradigm, and has generated significant interest in the learning theory community. However, even for basic settings such as agnostically learning single-index models (SIMs), existing omnipredictor constructions require impractically-large sample complexities and runtimes, and output complex, highly-improper hypotheses.
  Our main contribution is a new, simple construction of omnipredictors for SIMs. We give a learner outputting an omnipredictor that is $\varepsilon$-competitive on any matching loss induced by a monotone, Lipschitz link function, when the comparator class is bounded linear predictors. Our algorithm requires $\approx \varepsilon^{-4}$ samples and runs in nearly-linear time, and its sample complexity improves to $\approx \varepsilon^{-2}$ if link functions are bi-Lipschitz. This significantly improves upon the only prior known construction, due to [HJKRR18, GHK+23], which used $\gtrsim \varepsilon^{-10}$ samples.
  We achieve our construction via a new, sharp analysis of the classical Isotron algorithm [KS09, KKKS11] in the challenging agnostic learning setting, of potential independent interest. Previously, Isotron was known to properly learn SIMs in the realizable setting, as well as constant-factor competitive hypotheses under the squared loss [ZWDD24]. As they are based on Isotron, our omnipredictors are multi-index models with $\approx \varepsilon^{-2}$ prediction heads, bringing us closer to the tantalizing goal of proper omniprediction for general loss families and comparators.</description>

      <title>(Independent) Roman Domination Parameterized by Distance to Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a function $f:V\to \{0,1,2\}$ is said to be a \emph{Roman Dominating function} (RDF) if for every $v\in V$ with $f(v)=0$, there exists a vertex $u\in N(v)$ such that $f(u)=2$. A Roman Dominating function $f$ is said to be an \emph{Independent Roman Dominating function} (IRDF), if $V_1\cup V_2$ forms an independent set, where $V_i=\{v\in V~\vert~f(v)=i\}$, for $i\in \{0,1,2\}$. The total weight of $f$ is equal to $\sum_{v\in V} f(v)$, and is denoted as $w(f)$. The \emph{Roman Domination Number} (resp. \emph{Independent Roman Domination Number}) of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_R(G)$ (resp. $i_R(G)$), is defined as min$\{w(f)~\vert~f$ is an RDF (resp. IRDF) of $G\}$. For a given graph $G$, the problem of computing $\gamma_R(G)$ (resp. $i_R(G)$) is defined as the \emph{Roman Domination problem} (resp. \emph{Independent Roman Domination problem}).
  In this paper, we examine structural parameterizations of the (Independent) Roman Domination problem. We propose fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for the (Independent) Roman Domination problem in graphs that are $k$ vertices away from a cluster graph. These graphs have a set of $k$ vertices whose removal results in a cluster graph. We refer to $k$ as the distance to the cluster graph. Specifically, we prove the following results when parameterized by the deletion distance $k$ to cluster graphs: we can find the Roman Domination Number (and Independent Roman Domination Number) in time $4^kn^{O(1)}$. In terms of lower bounds, we show that the Roman Domination number can not be computed in time $2^{\epsilon k}n^{O(1)}$, for any $0&lt;\epsilon &lt;1$ unless a well-known conjecture, SETH fails. In addition, we also show that the Roman Domination problem parameterized by distance to cluster, does not admit a polynomial kernel unless NP $\subseteq$ coNP$/$poly.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Geometric Graph Modification with Disk Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parameterized analysis of graph modification problems represents the most extensively studied area within Parameterized Complexity. Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k\in\mathbb{N}$ as input, the goal is to determine whether we can perform at most $k$ operations on $G$ to transform it into a graph belonging to a specified graph class $\mathcal{F}$. Typical operations are combinatorial and include vertex deletions and edge deletions, insertions, and contractions. However, in many real-world scenarios, when the input graph is constrained to be a geometric intersection graph, the modification of the graph is influenced by changes in the geometric properties of the underlying objects themselves, rather than by combinatorial modifications. It raises the question of whether vertex deletions or adjacency modifications are necessarily the most appropriate modification operations for studying modifications of geometric graphs.
  We propose the study of the disk intersection graph modification through the scaling of disks. This operation is typical in the realm of topology control but has not yet been explored in the context of Parameterized Complexity. We design parameterized algorithms and kernels for modifying to the most basic graph classes: edgeless, connected, and acyclic. Our technical contributions encompass a novel combination of linear programming, branching, and kernelization techniques, along with a fresh application of bidimensionality theory to analyze the area covered by disks, which may have broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Procurement Auctions via Approximately Optimal Submodular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study procurement auctions, where an auctioneer seeks to acquire services from strategic sellers with private costs. The quality of services is measured by a submodular function known to the auctioneer. Our goal is to design computationally efficient procurement auctions that (approximately) maximize the difference between the quality of the acquired services and the total cost of the sellers, while ensuring incentive compatibility (IC), individual rationality (IR) for sellers, and non-negative surplus (NAS) for the auctioneer.
  Our contributions are twofold: (i) we provide an improved analysis of existing algorithms for non-positive submodular function maximization, and (ii) we design efficient frameworks that transform submodular optimization algorithms into mechanisms that are IC, IR, NAS, and approximation-preserving. These frameworks apply to both the offline setting, where all sellers' bids and services are available simultaneously, and the online setting, where sellers arrive in an adversarial order, requiring the auctioneer to make irrevocable decisions.
  We also explore whether state-of-the-art submodular optimization algorithms can be converted into descending auctions in adversarial settings, where the schedule of descending prices is determined by an adversary. We show that a submodular optimization algorithm satisfying bi-criteria $(1/2, 1)$-approximation in welfare can be effectively adapted to a descending auction. Additionally, we establish a connection between descending auctions and online submodular optimization.
  Finally, we demonstrate the practical applications of our frameworks by instantiating them with state-of-the-art submodular optimization algorithms and empirically comparing their welfare performance on publicly available datasets with thousands of sellers.</description>

      <title>Randomized Rounding Approaches to Online Allocation, Sequencing, and Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized rounding is a technique that was originally used to approximate hard offline discrete optimization problems from a mathematical programming relaxation. Since then it has also been used to approximately solve sequential stochastic optimization problems, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. To elaborate, one first writes a tractable linear programming relaxation that prescribes probabilities with which actions should be taken. Rounding then designs a (randomized) online policy that approximately preserves all of these probabilities, with the challenge being that the online policy faces hard constraints, whereas the prescribed probabilities only have to satisfy these constraints in expectation. Moreover, unlike classical randomized rounding for offline problems, the online policy's actions unfold sequentially over time, interspersed by uncontrollable stochastic realizations that affect the feasibility of future actions. This tutorial provides an introduction for using randomized rounding to design online policies, through four self-contained examples representing fundamental problems in the area: online contention resolution, stochastic probing, stochastic knapsack, and stochastic matching.</description>

      <title>A Bicriterion Concentration Inequality and Prophet Inequalities for $k$-Fold Matroid Unions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate prophet inequalities with competitive ratios approaching $1$, seeking to generalize $k$-uniform matroids. We first show that large girth does not suffice: for all $k$, there exists a matroid of girth $\geq k$ and a prophet inequality instance on that matroid whose optimal competitive ratio is $\frac{1}{2}$. Next, we show $k$-fold matroid unions do suffice: we provide a prophet inequality with competitive ratio $1-O(\sqrt{\frac{\log k}{k}})$ for any $k$-fold matroid union. Our prophet inequality follows from an online contention resolution scheme.
  The key technical ingredient in our online contention resolution scheme is a novel bicriterion concentration inequality for arbitrary monotone $1$-Lipschitz functions over independent items which may be of independent interest. Applied to our particular setting, our bicriterion concentration inequality yields "Chernoff-strength" concentration for a $1$-Lipschitz function that is not (approximately) self-bounding.</description>

      <title>Sorted Consecutive Occurrence Queries in Substrings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The string indexing problem is a fundamental computational problem with numerous applications, including information retrieval and bioinformatics. It aims to efficiently solve the pattern matching problem: given a text $T$ of length $n$ for preprocessing and a pattern $P$ of length $m$ as a query, the goal is to report all occurrences of $P$ as substrings of $T$. Navarro and Thankachan [CPM 2015, Theor. Comput. Sci. 2016] introduced a variant of this problem called the gap-bounded consecutive occurrence query, which reports pairs of consecutive occurrences of $P$ in $T$ such that their gaps (i.e., the distances between them) lie within a query-specified range $[g_1, g_2]$. Recently, Bille et al. [FSTTCS 2020, Theor. Comput. Sci. 2022] proposed the top-$k$ close consecutive occurrence query, which reports the $k$ closest consecutive occurrences of $P$ in $T$, sorted in non-descending order of distance. Both problems are optimally solved in query time with $O(n \log n)$-space data structures.
  In this paper, we generalize these problems to the range query model, which focuses only on occurrences of $P$ in a specified substring $T[a.. b]$ of $T$. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We propose an $O(n \log^2 n)$-space data structure that answers the range top-$k$ consecutive occurrence query in $O(|P| + \log\log n + k)$ time. (2) We propose an $O(n \log^{2+\epsilon} n)$-space data structure that answers the range gap-bounded consecutive occurrence query in $O(|P| + \log\log n + \mathit{output})$ time, where $\epsilon$ is a positive constant and $\mathit{output}$ denotes the number of outputs. Additionally, as by-products, we present algorithms for geometric problems involving weighted horizontal segments in a 2D plane, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Local Density and its Distributed Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The densest subgraph problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimisation. Danisch, Chan, and Sozio propose a definition for \emph{local density} that assigns to each vertex $v$ a value $\rho^*(v)$. This local density is a generalisation of the maximum subgraph density of a graph. I.e., if $\rho(G)$ is the subgraph density of a finite graph $G$, then $\rho(G)$ equals the maximum local density $\rho^*(v)$ over vertices $v$ in $G$. They approximate the local density of each vertex with no theoretical (asymptotic) guarantees.
  We provide an extensive study of this local density measure. Just as with (global) maximum subgraph density, we show that there is a dual relation between the local out-degrees and the minimum out-degree orientations of the graph. We introduce the definition of the local out-degree $g^*(v)$ of a vertex $v$, and show it to be equal to the local density $\rho^*(v)$. We consider the local out-degree to be conceptually simpler, shorter to define, and easier to compute.
  Using the local out-degree we show a previously unknown fact: that existing algorithms already dynamically approximate the local density. Next, we provide the first distributed algorithms that compute the local density with provable guarantees: given any $\varepsilon$ such that $\varepsilon^{-1} \in O(poly \, n)$, we show a deterministic distributed algorithm in the LOCAL model where, after $O(\varepsilon^{-2} \log^2 n)$ rounds, every vertex $v$ outputs a $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximation of their local density $\rho^*(v)$. In CONGEST, we show a deterministic distributed algorithm that requires $\text{poly}(\log n,\varepsilon^{-1}) \cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}$ rounds, which is sublinear in $n$.
  As a corollary, we obtain the first deterministic algorithm running in a sublinear number of rounds for $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate densest subgraph detection in the CONGEST model.</description>

      <title>Enumeration Algorithms for Conjunctive Queries with Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.03712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the enumeration of query results for an important subset of CQs with projections, namely star and path queries. The task is to design data structures and algorithms that allow for efficient enumeration with delay guarantees after a preprocessing phase. Our main contribution is a series of results based on the idea of interleaving precomputed output with further join processing to maintain delay guarantees, which maybe of independent interest. In particular, for star queries, we design combinatorial algorithms that provide instance-specific delay guarantees in linear preprocessing time. These algorithms improve upon the currently best known results. Further, we show how existing results can be improved upon by using fast matrix multiplication. We also present new results involving tradeoff between preprocessing time and delay guarantees for enumeration of path queries that contain projections. Boolean matrix multiplication is an important query that can be expressed as a CQ with projection where the join attribute is projected away. Our results can therefore also be interpreted as sparse, output-sensitive matrix multiplication with delay guarantees.</description>

However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the strategic behavior of individual agents -- a fact that is captured by a high Price of Stability (PoS) in recent literature [Blum et al., 2021]. Implicit in the traditional PoS analysis is the assumption that agents have full knowledge of how their tasks relate to one another. We offer a new perspective on bringing about efficient collaboration among strategic agents using information design. Inspired by the growing importance of collaboration in machine learning (such as platforms for collaborative federated learning and data cooperatives), we propose a framework where the platform has more information about how the agents' tasks relate to each other than the agents themselves. We characterize how and to what degree such platforms can leverage their information advantage to steer strategic agents toward efficient collaboration.
  Concretely, we consider collaboration networks where each node is a task type held by one agent, and each task benefits from contributions made in their inclusive neighborhood of tasks. This network structure is known to the agents and the platform, but only the platform knows each agent's real location -- from the agents' perspective, their location is determined by a random permutation. We employ private Bayesian persuasion and design two families of persuasive signaling schemes that the platform can use to ensure a small total workload when agents follow the signal. The first family aims to achieve the minmax optimal approximation ratio compared to the optimal collaboration, which is shown to be $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ for unit-weight graphs, $\Theta(n^{2/3})$ for graphs with constant minimum edge weights, and $O(n^{3/4})$ for general weighted graphs. The second family ensures per-instance strict improvement compared to full information disclosure.</description>

      <title>Robust Fair Clustering with Group Membership Uncertainty Sets</title>

Abstract: We study the canonical fair clustering problem where each cluster is constrained to have close to population-level representation of each group. Despite significant attention, the salient issue of having incomplete knowledge about the group membership of each point has been superficially addressed. In this paper, we consider a setting where the assigned group memberships are noisy. We introduce a simple noise model that requires a small number of parameters to be given by the decision maker. We then present an algorithm for fair clustering with provable \emph{robustness} guarantees. Our framework enables the decision maker to trade off between the robustness and the clustering quality. Unlike previous work, our algorithms are backed by worst-case theoretical guarantees. Finally, we empirically verify the performance of our algorithm on real world datasets and show its superior performance over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Retrieval with Learned Similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval plays a fundamental role in recommendation systems, search, and natural language processing (NLP) by efficiently finding relevant items from a large corpus given a query. Dot products have been widely used as the similarity function in such tasks, enabled by Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) algorithms for efficient retrieval. However, state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms have migrated to learned similarities. These advanced approaches encompass multiple query embeddings, complex neural networks, direct item ID decoding via beam search, and hybrid solutions. Unfortunately, we lack efficient solutions for retrieval in these state-of-the-art setups. Our work addresses this gap by investigating efficient retrieval techniques with expressive learned similarity functions. We establish Mixture-of-Logits (MoL) as a universal approximator of similarity functions, demonstrate that MoL's expressiveness can be realized empirically to achieve superior performance on diverse retrieval scenarios, and propose techniques to retrieve the approximate top-k results using MoL with tight error bounds. Through extensive experimentation, we show that MoL, enhanced by our proposed mutual information-based load balancing loss, sets new state-of-the-art results across heterogeneous scenarios, including sequential retrieval models in recommendation systems and finetuning language models for question answering; and our approximate top-$k$ algorithms outperform baselines by up to 66x in latency while achieving &gt;.99 recall rate compared to exact algorithms.</description>
