      <title>The Growth and Decay of Individual Sunspots and Pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis of the photometric growth and decay rates of sunspots and pores was carried out. According to the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} (SDO/HMI) data for the period 05.2010-03-2025, $\approx 3.5\cdot 10^{\rm 5}$ sunspots and pores were detected and their evolution tracked. The growth and decay rates of sunspots depend non-monotonically on the area. For small-area sunspots $S \lesssim 50$ $\mu$sh, a rapid increase in velocity is observed with increasing the area for the growth stage $dS^{\rm gr}_{\rm sp}\approx 0.2 \cdot S^{\rm 1.35}$ and for the decay stage $dS^{\rm dc}_{\rm sp}\approx 0.28 \cdot S^{\rm 1.26} $ $\mu$sh/day. For sunspots $S\gtrsim 50$ $\mu$sh, the growth rate depends weakly on the area: $dS^{\rm gr}_{\rm sp}\approx 11.9 \cdot S^{\rm 0.32}$ $\mu$sh/day. For the decay stage of sunspots with an area of $S\approx 50\,-\,150$ $\mu$sh, the decay rate also depends weakly on the area and can be approximated as $dS^{\rm dc}_{\rm sp}\approx 11 \cdot S^{\rm 0.15} $. For sunspot areas $S\gtrsim 150$ $\mu$sh, the decay rate accelerates with increasing area: $dS^{\rm dc}_{\rm sp}\approx 0.14 \cdot S^{\rm 0.96} $ $\mu$sh/day. For solar pores, the growth and decay rates of solar pores are linearly related to the area. The growth and decay rates for the spots of the leading and trailing polarities are determined. In the range of spot areas $S\approx 100\,-\,200$ $\mu$sh, the growth and decay rates of sunspots of trailing polarity are higher than those of sunspots of leading polarity.</description>

      <title>Apache Point Observatory follow-up of ACcelerating Candidate ExopLanet host Stars (APO ACCELS): Ages for 166 Accelerating Stars in the Northern Hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directly imaged substellar companions with well-constrained ages and masses serve as vital empirical benchmarks for planet formation and evolution models. Potential benchmark companions can be identified from astrometric accelerations of their host stars. We use Gaia DR3 and Hipparcos astrometry to identify 166 northern hemisphere stars with astrometric accelerations consistent with a substellar companion between 0.5'' and 1''. For this accelerating sample we identify young stars using APO/ARCES spectra and TESS light curves. From spectroscopic screening of the sample, we measure ages for 24 stars with detectable amounts of lithium, place lower age limits on 135 stars with lithium non-detections, and measure ages from R'HK for 34 stars. 129 stars have TESS light curves from which we measure ages for 20 stars with rotation rates &lt; 15 days, and we identify 3 eclipsing binaries. We present median ages and confidence intervals of age posteriors for the entire sample and discuss how the overall age distribution of our sample compares to a uniform star formation rate in the solar neighborhood. We identify 47 stars with median ages &lt; 2 Gyr, 31 stars with median ages &lt; 1 Gyr, and 14 stars with median ages &lt; 0.5 Gyr, making them high-priority targets for direct imaging follow-up.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Analysis of Magnetic Parameters in Solar Source Regions of Halo-CMEs with and without SEP events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large SEPs can cause adverse space weather hazard to humans technology and such events are especially associated with halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). But in turn, a significant portion of halo-CMEs are not associated with large SEPs. The objective of this study is to gain an understanding of the source region distinctions between halo-CMEs in SEP and No-SEP events. Among the 176 halo-CMEs observed from 2010-2024, we screen out 45 large SEP events and 131 No-SEP events from this dataset. It is revealed that CME speed is a good discriminator between SEP and No-SEP events. Through classifying the source regions of all the halo-CMEs, we find that 53\% of SEP events originate from ``Single AR'', and 47\% from ``Multiple ARs'' or ``Outside of ARs''. The corresponding proportion for No-SEP events is 70\% and 30\%. This suggests that SEP source regions are more likely to originate from large-scale sources. We have also calculated the relevant magnetic parameters of the source regions and found that SEP source regions have higher magnetic free energy and reconnection flux compared to No-SEP source regions. However, SEP source regions are smaller in terms of the intensive magnetic parameters such as mean characteristic magnetic twist $\alpha$ and mean shear angles. Our statistical results can provide new potential variables for forecasting SEPs.</description>

      <title>A search of periodic variable stars in the LMC by JWST photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on high-resolution near-infrared photometric data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) targeting the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), this study attempts to evaluate the feasibility and sensitivity limits of variable star detection in crowded stellar fields. Through light curve analysis, we identified a total of 304 periodic variable stars, including 71 EW-type eclipsing binaries, 7 EA-type eclipsing binaries, 177 rotational variables, 38 $\delta$ Scuti (DSCT) stars, and 12 RR Lyrae stars. Period--luminosity relations (PLRs) were derived for EW-type eclipsing binaries, DSCT stars, and RR Lyrae stars. The PLRs for EW-type and RR Lyrae stars are in good agreement with previous studies, while the PLR zero point for DSCT stars appears systematically fainter by approximately 0.15--0.30 mag. Our PLRs exhibit low dispersion and are minimally affected by crowding. We analyzed the capability of JWST archival data to detect low-amplitude variables and found that only stars with amplitudes greater than approximately 0.05 mag can be reliably detected. Through simulations, we quantified how increasing the number of photometric epochs improves the detectability of low-amplitude, low signal-to-noise ratio variables. Despite current limitations in observational cadence, JWST demonstrates unique advantages in detecting short-period eclipsing binaries, rotational variables, and high-amplitude pulsators. Its exceptional spatial resolution enables high-precision PLR calibrations, offering new opportunities for future studies in variable star astrophysics and extragalactic distance measurements.</description>

      <title>Infrared Variability of Carbon Stars in the LMC Observed with NEOWISE-R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the infrared variability of carbon stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our sample consists of 11,134 carbon stars identified in both visual and infrared bands. Among these, 1,184 objects are known Mira variables based on the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment III (OGLE-III) observations. We study the infrared variability of the entire sample using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) photometric data spanning the past 16 years, including the AllWISE multiepoch data and the Near-Earth Object WISE Reactivation (NEOWISE-R) 2024 final data release. We generate light curves using WISE observations in the W1 and W2 bands and compute Lomb-Scargle periodograms for all sample stars. From the WISE light curves, we derive reliable variability parameters for 1,615 objects. Among these, we identify 672 objects exhibiting clear Mira-like variations: 445 of these are previously known Miras from OGLE-III, while 227 are candidates for new Mira variables identified from the WISE data. We establish period-magnitude and period-color relations in both visual and infrared bands for the known Miras and the newly identified candidates from WISE data. We anticipate that these relations will serve as valuable references for studying carbon stars in other galaxies, including the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Stationary quasi-periodic pulsations in 20-second cadence TESS flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are an inherent feature of solar and stellar flares. However, the mechanism behind them is debated hence it is necessary to further study them to obtain a complete picture of flares and their contribution to coronal heating. Aims. We analyze 20-second cadence TESS light curves from sectors 27 to 80 to detect stellar flares and QPPs. Methods. Stellar flare detection was carried out using an automated detection routine based on autoregressive integrated moving average models. QPPs were detected using a Fourier model comparison test (AFINO). Results. We detected 3878 flares across 1285 flaring stars. Notably, 61.2% of flares had a duration of less than 10 min. 61 QPPs were detected across 57 stars significantly expanding the current stellar QPP catalog. The detected periods of the QPPs were in the range of 42 to 193 seconds. In the diagram showing QPP periods against the flare duration a branch emerges. It shows a positive correlation with the flare duration, meaning longer duration flares host longer period QPPs. Conclusion. Our study detected short-period and sub-minute QPPs in stellar flares that have rarely been explored in other works. We find similar scaling laws between solar and stellar QPPs which indicates that QPPs in stellar flares might be analogous to the ones in solar flares as both show evidence of scaling with flare duration.</description>

      <title>Resupplying planetary debris to old white dwarfs with supernova blast waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One challenge with explaining how high levels of planetary debris can enrich, or "pollute", old ($\sim$3 Gyr) and very old ($\sim$10 Gyr) white dwarfs is that debris reservoirs deplete on shorter timescales, akin to the solar system's already eviscerated Main Belt and Kuiper Belt. Here, I explore how these extrasolar reservoirs can be resupplied through supernovae that propel distant ($\gtrsim 10^4$ au) dust, sand and pebbles, and potentially boulders and comets, into the inner ($\lesssim 10^2$ au) planetary system. I analytically constrain the geometry of these blast waves, and derive expressions for the probability of apt blast configurations occurring. I then derive the minimum kick magnitudes needed to generate stable, leaky and broken post-blast orbits, and prove that within this formalism, at most 23 per cent of true anomalies along an eccentric orbit could allow for resupplied planetary debris to experience repeated pericentre passages. By linking these kick magnitudes with debris sizes and relating these quantities to the local neighbourhood supernova rate, I conclude that the probabilities for ejection or resupply per supernova blast are $\approx$100 per cent for micron-sized dust and millimetre-sized pebbles and sand, and $\approx$0 per cent for asteroids larger than $\sim$10 km. In between these extremes, I expect metre-sized boulders to be resupplied at least once to very old white dwarfs over their cooling ages. The efficacy of this debris delivery mechanism is dependent on the time-varying sources and sinks in an exo-Oort cloud and how its parent white dwarf has, throughout its cooling age, traversed the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Accelerations of Provisional Targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be the first space telescope capable of directly imaging Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars to probe their atmospheres for signs of life. Now in its early stages of design, a list of the 164 most promising targets for HWO has been released to the community to carry out precursor science. Massive companions in these systems--stars, brown dwarfs, or giant planets--could preclude the existence of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone by impacting their long-term dynamical stability. Here, we use astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3 to identify stars in the HWO preliminary target list that exhibit astrometric accelerations and determine joint constraints on the expected mass and separation of these companions. We find that 54 HWO targets have significant astrometric accelerations, 37 of which are accounted for by known giant planets and stellar companions. Follow-up efforts are required to clarify the specific nature of the suspected companions around the remaining 17 accelerating stars. Stars without significant accelerations are used to rule out large regions of companion mass and separation down to planetary masses. We find that with Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3 we are $\sim$85$\%$ sensitive to 2 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ planets between 4 and 10 AU. Future Gaia releases will provide sensitivity to sub-Jovian mass planets on Solar System scales for provisional HWO targets. Finally, using analytical estimates of dynamical stability, we find that 13 HWO targets have known stellar or planetary companions that are likely to disrupt habitable-zone planets.</description>

      <title>Energetic ($&lt; 2$ MeV) Ion Environment of the Magnetosphere as measured by ASPEX-STEPS on board Aditya-L1 during its earth-bound phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During its earth-bound phase of the Aditya-L1 spacecraft of India, the Supra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of the Aditya Solar wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) was operated whenever the orbit was above 52000 km during 11-19 September 2023. This phase of operation provided measurements of energetic ions (with energies 0.1-2 MeV) in the magnetosphere, magnetosheath, and interplanetary medium. Three interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME) hit the magnetosphere during this period. This provided opportunity to examine the relative roles of external (ICME) and internal (substorm) drivers in controlling the energetic ion environment in the terrestrial magnetosphere by detailed spectral analysis of energetic ion fluxes measured by two units of ASPEX-STEPS. We identify three distinctly different conditions of the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF $B_z = 0$, $&gt; 0$, and $&lt; 0$) and use the derived spectral indices to understand the role of external and internal drivers. By combining these with the simultaneous eneregtic ion flux variations from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) around the Sun-Earth first Lagrangian (L1) point and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) in the Earth's magnetosphere, we show that the polarity of IMF $B_z$ influences the energetic ion spectra in the magnetosphere by modulating the interplay of the external and internal drivers. Further, we observe directional anisotropy of energetic ions and much harder spectra associated with one ICME compared to another one, although both led to geomagnetic storms having nearly equal intensities.</description>

      <title>A high stellar multiplicity rate amongst TESS planet candidates in the Neptunian desert using Gaia DR3 astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to discover whether the stellar multiplicity rate may provide information on the origin of recently discovered planets in the Neptunian Desert. Using Gaia DR3 astrometry, we search for common proper motion companions to 1779 known exoplanet hosts and 2927 exoplanet candidate hosts from the TESS mission, both within 650 pc. We find overall stellar multiplicity rates of $16.6\pm0.9\%$ and $19.8\pm0.6\%$ for confirmed and candidate exoplanets, respectively. We find stellar multiplicity rates of $16.7\pm5.8\%$ and $27.5\pm2.6\%$ for confirmed and candidate exoplanets in the Neptunian Desert, respectively. Hot Jupiter host stars were found to have rates of $25.8\pm2.1\%$ and $22.9\pm1.3\%$. For the sample of candidate exoplanets, we find higher stellar multiplicity rates for stars hosting both Hot Jupiters and Neptunian Desert planets compared to control samples of similar stars not known to host planets. For the sample of confirmed exoplanets an increased multiplicity rate is seen for Hot Jupiter hosts, but cannot be significantly determined for Neptunian Desert planet hosts due to small sample sizes. If the candidates from TESS are indeed planets, the increased multiplicity rate observed could indicate that the Neptunian Desert and Hot Jupiter populations share similar formation mechanisms and environmental conditions. Alternatively, the TESS candidate high multiplicity rate could imply a prevalence of false positives related to binary and triple stars in this parameter space.</description>

      <title>Rapid follow-up observations of infant supernovae with the Gran Telescopio Canarias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first few hours of a supernova (SN) contain significant information about the progenitor system. The most modern wide-field surveys that scan the sky repeatedly every few days can discover all kinds of transients in those early epochs. At such times, some progenitor footprints may be visible, elucidating critical explosion parameters and helping to distinguish between leading explosion models. A dedicated spectroscopic classification programme using the optical spectrograph OSIRIS mounted on the Gran Telescopio Canarias was set up to try to obtain observations of supernovae (SNe) at those early epochs. With the time awarded, we obtained spectra of 10 SN candidates, which we present here. Half of them were thermonuclear SNe, while the other half were core-collapse SNe. Most (70\%) were observed within the first six days of the estimated explosion, with two being captured within the first 48\,hr. We present a characterization of the spectra, together with other public ancillary photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). This project shows the need for an accompanying rapid-response spectroscopic programme for existing and future deep photometric wide-field surveys located at the right longitude to be able to trigger observations in a few hours after the discovery of the SN candidate.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Drag Torque in Common Envelope Evolution</title>

Abstract: Common envelope (CE) evolution is largely governed by the drag torque applied on the inspiralling stellar components by the envelope. Previous work has shown that idealized models of the torque based on a single body moving in rectilinear motion through an unperturbed atmosphere can be highly inaccurate. Progress requires new models for the torque that account for binarity. Toward this end we perform a new 3D global hydrodynamic CE simulation with the mass of the companion point particle set equal to the mass of the asymptotic giant branch star core particle to maximize symmetry and facilitate interpretation. First, we find that a region around the particles of a scale comparable to their separation contributes essentially all of the torque. Second, the density pattern of the torque-dominating gas and, to an extent, this gas itself, is roughly in corotation with the binary. Third, approximating the spatial distribution of the torquing gas as a uniform-density prolate spheroid whose major axis resides in the orbital plane and lags the line joining the binary components by a constant phase angle reproduces the torque evolution remarkably well, analogous to studies of binary supermassive black holes. Fourth, we compare the torque measured in the simulation with the predictions of a model that assumes two weak point-mass perturbers undergoing circular motion in a uniform background without gas self-gravity, and find remarkable agreement with our results if the background density is taken to be equal to a fixed fraction ($\approx 0.44$) of the density at the spheroid surface. Overall, this work makes progress toward developing simple time-dependent models of the CE phase.</description>

      <title>Triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates below $T_9=3$ by a non-adiabatic three-body model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03600v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The triple-$\alpha$ reaction from the ternary continuum states at off-resonant energies, $\alpha+\alpha+\alpha\rightarrow^{12}$C, remains an open question. This direct process is scrutinized using a non-adiabatic Faddeev hyperspherical harmonics $R$-matrix expansion method, and the derived reaction rates are discussed. After reviewing the model, the resultant photo-disintegration of $^{12}$C($2^+_1\rightarrow 0^+$) is shown to be much smaller than the values predicted by the adiabatic models for $0.15 \le E \le 0.35$ MeV. Despite the large difference, the derived reaction rates are illustrated to be concordant with the current evaluated rates for $0.08 \le T_9 \le 3$. The difference below $E=0.20$ MeV can be seen in the rates for $T_9 \le 0.07$. In comparison with the calculations, the rates are found to be reduced by a factor of 10$^{-4}$ at $T_9=0.05$, because of an accurate description for $^8$Be break-up. Uncertainties of the rates are also estimated by examining the sensitivity to the 3$\alpha$ potentials. By introducing three-body $S$-factors and a resonant term, the present rates are expressed in an analytic form, and they are provided in a tabular form for astrophysical applications. To update the evaluated rates, non-resonant sequential process between $\alpha+^8$Be could be removed. The astrophysical impact is not expected to be large, although the rates are reduced around $T_9=0.05$.</description>

      <title>The Orbit of WASP-4 b is in Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: WASP-4 b is a hot Jupiter exhibiting a decreasing orbital period, prompting investigations into potential mechanisms driving its evolution. We analyzed 173 transit light curves, including 37 new observations, and derived mid-transit timings with EXOFAST, forming the most extensive TTV dataset for this system. Adding 58 literature timings and removing unreliable data, we constructed a TTV diagram with 216 points. Our analysis considered linear, quadratic, and apsidal motion models, with the quadratic model proving to be significantly superior in all model comparison statistics. We found no significant periodic signals in the data. The quadratic model allows us to infer a tidal quality factor of Q' ~ 80,000 from the orbital decay rate if this is due to stellar tides. Theoretical considerations indicate that such efficient dissipation is possible due to internal gravity waves in the radiative core of WASP-4, but only in our models with a more evolved host star, possibly near the end of its main-sequence lifetime, and with a larger radius than the observed one. Our main-sequence models produce only about a third of the required dissipation (Q' ~ 200,000 - 500,000). Therefore, the observed orbital decay can only be explained by a slightly larger or more evolved host, resembling the case for WASP-12. Our findings highlight the need for further stellar modeling and improvement in our current understanding of tidal dissipation mechanisms driving orbital decay in close-in exoplanetary systems.</description>
