      <title>Wave Turbulence and Cortical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cortical activity recorded through EEG and MEG reflects complex dynamics that span multiple temporal and spatial scales. Spectral analyses of these signals consistently reveal power-law behaviour, a hallmark of turbulent systems. In this paper, we derive a kinetic equation for neural field activity based on wave turbulence theory, highlighting how quantities such as energy and pseudo-particle density flow through wave-space (k-space) via direct and inverse cascades. We explore how different forms of nonlinearity, particularly 3-wave and 4-wave interactions, shape spectral features, including harmonic generation, spectral dispersion, and transient dynamics. While the observed power-law decays in empirical data are broadly consistent with turbulent cascades, variations across studies, such as the presence of dual decay rates or harmonic structures, point to a diversity of underlying mechanisms. We argue that although no single model fully explains all spectral observations, key constraints emerge: namely, that cortical dynamics exhibit features consistent with turbulent wave systems involving both single and dual cascades and a mixture of 3- and 4-wave interactions. This turbulence-based framework offers a principled and unifying approach to interpreting large-scale brain activity, including state transitions and seizure dynamics.</description>

      <title>Could Living Cells Use Phase Transitions to Process Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To maintain homeostasis, living cells process information with networks of interacting molecules. Traditional models for cellular information processing have focused on networks of chemical reactions between molecules. Here, we describe how networks of physical interactions could contribute to the processing of information inside cells. In particular, we focus on the impact of biomolecular condensation, a structural phase transition found in cells. Biomolecular condensation has recently been implicated in diverse cellular processes. Some of these are essentially computational, including classification and control tasks. We place these findings in the broader context of physical computing, an emerging framework for describing how the native dynamics of nonlinear physical systems can be leveraged to perform complex computations. The synthesis of these ideas raises questions about expressivity (the range of problems that cellular phase transitions might be able to solve) and learning (how these systems could adapt and evolve to solve different problems). This emerging area of research presents diverse opportunities across molecular biophysics, soft matter, and physical computing.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear synchronization through vector subharmonic entrainment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is ubiquitous across a wide range of fields. Subharmonic entrainment (SHE) is a nonlinear synchronization phenomenon that results in a locking oscillator at a frequency of an external periodic forcing signal with a fraction of the oscillator frequency. Beyond the fundamentals of nonlinear dynamics, SHE has a range of practical applications from stabilizing ultrafast laser pulses to optimizing control in various engineering and natural systems. However, the vectorial nature of SHE remains elusive. Here, we present the results of a theoretical and experimental study of a vector type of subharmonic entrainment (VSHE) using a passively mode-locked fiber laser as a testbed. We unveil the mechanism of vectorial SHE, in which weak external signals can entrain internal laser dynamics through vectorial coupling. Vectorial SHE presents in the form of synchronization between the subharmonic of mode-locking-driven oscillations and continuous wave (CW) signal through an evolving state of polarization. This CW signal, driven by the internal dynamics of the injected signal, causes VSHE with the frequencies ratios of multiples of ten, resulting in a partially mode-locking regime operation. Our findings offer new control techniques over mode-locking and additional dimension such as polarization states.</description>

      <title>How to Incorporate Higher-order Interactions in Analog Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines (IMs) are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems. Among such problems, Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) is particularly relevant in industrial applications. To solve SAT problems using IMs, it is crucial to incorporate higher-order interactions. However, in analog IMs, interactions of different orders scale unevenly with the continuous spin amplitudes, introducing imbalances that can significantly degrade performance. We present a numerical comparison of methods to mitigate these imbalances, evaluating time-to-solution and success rate on Uniform Random 3-SAT instances from the SATLIB benchmark set. Our results show that the most effective approach employs spin interactions that are proportional to the signs of spins, rather than their continuous amplitudes. This generalizes our previous work, which showed that such interactions best mitigate imbalances induced by external fields in quadratic analog IMs. In this work, its advantage becomes substantially more pronounced, as it naturally mitigates imbalances across all interaction orders. We further demonstrate that smooth approximations of this method make it compatible with analog hardware. Our findings underscore the central role of spin-sign-based interactions in enabling robust and scalable analog IM dynamics.</description>

      <title>Long-Time and Short-Time Dynamics in a Weighted-Median Opinion Model on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social interactions influence people's opinions. In some situations, these interactions eventually yield a consensus opinion; in others, they can lead to opinion fragmentation and the formation of different opinion groups in the form of ``echo chambers''. Consider a social network of individuals with continuous-valued scalar opinions, and suppose that they can change their opinions when they interact with each other. In many models of the opinion dynamics of individuals in a network, it is common for opinion updates to depend on the mean opinion of interacting individuals. As an alternative, which may be more realistic in some situations, we study an opinion model with an opinion-update rule that depends on the weighted median of the opinions of interacting individuals. Through numerical simulations of our median-update opinion model, we investigate how the final opinion distribution depends on network structure. For configuration-model networks, we also derive a mean-field approximation for the asymptotic dynamics of the opinion distribution when there are infinitely many individuals. We numerically investigate its accuracy for short-time opinion dynamics on various networks.</description>
