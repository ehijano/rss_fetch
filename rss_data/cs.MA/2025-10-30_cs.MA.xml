      <title>From Narrative to Action: A Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework for Human Mobility Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and replicating human mobility requires not only spatial-temporal accuracy but also an awareness of the cognitive hierarchy underlying real-world travel decisions. Traditional agent-based or deep learning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to capture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior. Large language models (LLMs) show potential, but struggle to balance creative reasoning with strict structural compliance. This study proposes a Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level narrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral execution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent is employed as a "creative writer" to produce diary-style narratives rich in motivation and context, then uses another agent as a "structural parser" to convert narratives into machine-readable plans. A dynamic execution module further grounds agents in geographic environments and enables adaptive behavioral adjustments guided by a novel occupation-aware metric, Mobility Entropy by Occupation (MEO), which captures heterogeneous schedule flexibility across different occupational personalities. At the micro level, the agent executes concrete actions-selecting locations, transportation modes, and time intervals-through interaction with an environmental simulation. By embedding this multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic trajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable representations of human decision logic. This research advances synthetic mobility generation from a data-driven paradigm to a cognition-driven simulation, providing a scalable pathway for understanding, predicting, and synthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical LLM agents.</description>

      <title>MASPRM: Multi-Agent System Process Reward Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical deployment of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) demands strong test-time performance, motivating methods that guide inference-time search and selectively spend compute to improve quality. We present the Multi-Agent System Process Reward Model (MASPRM). It assigns per-action, per-agent values to partial inter-agent transcripts and acts as an inference-time controller. MASPRM is trained from multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts without requiring step-level human annotations, by propagating returns to local targets. At inference, MASPRM guides step-level beam search and MCTS, focusing computation on promising branches and pruning early. On GSM8K and MATH, MASPRM-guided decoding with an outcome reward model (ORM) applied to the final answer, improves exact match (EM) over a single straight-through MAS pass by $+30.7$ and $+22.9$ points, respectively. A MASPRM trained on GSM8K transfers zero-shot to MATH without retraining, adding $8.4$ EM points at the same budget. MASPRM is a plug-in value model that estimates per-agent progress and complements verifier-style decoders, enabling more reliable, compute-aware multi-agent reasoning.

      <title>Trust Dynamics in Strategic Coopetition: Computational Foundations for Requirements Engineering in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Requirements engineering increasingly occurs in multi-stakeholder environments where organizations simultaneously cooperate and compete, creating coopetitive relationships in which trust evolves dynamically based on observed behavior over repeated interactions. While conceptual modeling languages like i* represent trust relationships qualitatively, they lack computational mechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence. Conversely, computational trust models from multi-agent systems provide algorithmic updating but lack grounding in requirements engineering contexts and conceptual models. This technical report bridges this gap by developing a computational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic coopetition with dynamic trust evolution. We introduce trust as a two-layer system with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation tracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where cooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating hysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery. We develop a structured translation framework enabling requirements engineers to instantiate computational trust models from i* dependency networks and organizational contexts. Comprehensive experimental validation across 78,125 parameter configurations establishes robust emergence of negativity bias, hysteresis effects, and cumulative damage amplification. Empirical validation using the Renault-Nissan Alliance case study (1999-2025) achieves 49 out of 60 validation points (81.7%), successfully reproducing documented trust evolution across five distinct relationship phases including crisis and recovery periods. This technical report builds upon its foundational companion work in arXiv:2510.18802.</description>

      <title>Emergent Coordinated Behaviors in Networked LLM Agents: Modeling the Strategic Dynamics of Information Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative agents are rapidly advancing in sophistication, raising urgent questions about how they might coordinate when deployed in online ecosystems. This is particularly consequential in information operations (IOs), influence campaigns that aim to manipulate public opinion on social media. While traditional IOs have been orchestrated by human operators and relied on manually crafted tactics, agentic AI promises to make campaigns more automated, adaptive, and difficult to detect. This work presents the first systematic study of emergent coordination among generative agents in simulated IO campaigns. Using generative agent-based modeling, we instantiate IO and organic agents in a simulated environment and evaluate coordination across operational regimes, from simple goal alignment to team knowledge and collective decision-making. As operational regimes become more structured, IO networks become denser and more clustered, interactions more reciprocal and positive, narratives more homogeneous, amplification more synchronized, and hashtag adoption faster and more sustained. Remarkably, simply revealing to agents which other agents share their goals can produce coordination levels nearly equivalent to those achieved through explicit deliberation and collective voting. Overall, we show that generative agents, even without human guidance, can reproduce coordination strategies characteristic of real-world IOs, underscoring the societal risks posed by increasingly automated, self-organizing IOs.</description>

      <title>SeeingEye: Agentic Information Flow Unlocks Multimodal Reasoning In Text-only LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-only large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate remarkable reasoning ability. However, these models remain fragile or entirely incapable when extended to multi-modal tasks. Existing approaches largely rely on single-form captions, which lack diversity and often fail to adapt across different types of Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. As a result, they provide no principled or efficient channel for transmitting fine-grained visual information. We introduce Seeing Eye, a modular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through an agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception agent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively distill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs) tailored to the question. These SIRs are then passed to the text-only LLM, which serves as a reasoning agent. Crucially, the translator and reasoner engage in multi-round feedback and interaction, enabling the extraction of targeted visual details and yielding more confident answers. Experiments on knowledge-intensive VQA benchmarks, including MMMU and MIA-Bench, demonstrate that Seeing Eye not only reduces inference cost but also surpasses much larger end-to-end VLMs. For example, an instantiation combining a 3B-parameter vision translator with an 8B-parameter language reasoner outperforms a monolithic 32B VLM on challenging knowledge-based questions. Our results highlight that decoupling perception from reasoning via agent information flow offers a scalable and plug-and-play pathway to multimodal reasoning, allowing strong text-only LLMs to fully leverage their reasoning capabilities.

      <title>Collaborative Scheduling of Time-dependent UAVs,Vehicles and Workers for Crowdsensing in Disaster Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequent natural disasters cause significant losses to human society, and timely, efficient collection of post-disaster environmental information is the foundation for effective rescue operations. Due to the extreme complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies such as mobile crowdsensing suffer from weak environmental adaptability, insufficient professional sensing capabilities, and poor practicality of sensing solutions. Therefore, this paper explores a heterogeneous multi-agent online collaborative scheduling algorithm, HoCs-MPQ, to achieve efficient collection of post-disaster environmental information. HoCs-MPQ models collaboration and conflict relationships among multiple elements through weighted undirected graph construction, and iteratively solves the maximum weight independent set based on multi-priority queues, ultimately achieving collaborative sensing scheduling of time-dependent UA Vs, vehicles, and workers. Specifically, (1) HoCs-MPQ constructs weighted undirected graph nodes based on collaborative relationships among multiple elements and quantifies their weights, then models the weighted undirected graph based on conflict relationships between nodes; (2) HoCs-MPQ solves the maximum weight independent set based on iterated local search, and accelerates the solution process using multi-priority queues. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive real-world and simulated data. The experiments show that, compared to baseline methods (e.g., HoCs-GREEDY, HoCs-K-WTA, HoCs-MADL, and HoCs-MARL), HoCs-MPQ improves task completion rates by an average of 54.13%, 23.82%, 14.12%, and 12.89% respectively, with computation time for single online autonomous scheduling decisions not exceeding 3 seconds.</description>

      <title>Multi-party Agent Relation Sampling for Multi-party Ad Hoc Teamwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARl) has achieved strong results in cooperative tasks but typically assumes fixed, fully controlled teams. Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) relaxes this by allowing collaboration with unknown partners, yet existing variants still presume shared conventions. We introduce Multil-party Ad Hoc Teamwork (MAHT), where controlled agents must coordinate with multiple mutually unfamiliar groups of uncontrolled teammates. To address this, we propose MARs, which builds a sparse skeleton graph and applies relational modeling to capture cross-group dvnamics. Experiments on MPE and starCralt ll show that MARs outperforms MARL and AHT baselines while converging faster.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Framework for Decision-Support and Optimization of EV Charging Infrastructure in Localized Urban Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption accelerates in urban environments, optimizing charging infrastructure is vital for balancing user satisfaction, energy efficiency, and financial viability. This study advances beyond static models by proposing a digital twin framework that integrates agent-based decision support with embedded optimization to dynamically simulate EV charging behaviors, infrastructure layouts, and policy responses across scenarios. Applied to a localized urban site (a university campus) in Hanoi, Vietnam, the model evaluates operational policies, EV station configurations, and renewable energy sources. The interactive dashboard enables seasonal analysis, revealing a 20% drop in solar efficiency from October to March, with wind power contributing under 5% of demand, highlighting the need for adaptive energy management. Simulations show that real-time notifications of newly available charging slots improve user satisfaction, while gasoline bans and idle fees enhance slot turnover with minimal added complexity. Embedded metaheuristic optimization identifies near-optimal mixes of fast (30kW) and standard (11kW) solar-powered chargers, balancing energy performance, profitability, and demand with high computational efficiency. This digital twin provides a flexible, computation-driven platform for EV infrastructure planning, with a transferable, modular design that enables seamless scaling from localized to city-wide urban contexts.</description>

      <title>Fortytwo: Swarm Inference with Peer-Ranked Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of +17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness. Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or security.</description>

      <title>The Iceberg Index: Measuring Workforce Exposure Across the AI Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is reshaping America's \$9.4 trillion labor market, with cascading effects that extend far beyond visible technology sectors. When AI transforms quality control tasks in automotive plants, consequences spread through logistics networks, supply chains, and local service economies. Yet traditional workforce metrics cannot capture these ripple effects: they measure employment outcomes after disruption occurs, not where AI capabilities overlap with human skills before adoption crystallizes. Project Iceberg addresses this gap using Large Population Models to simulate the human-AI labor market, representing 151 million workers as autonomous agents executing over 32,000 skills and interacting with thousands of AI tools. It introduces the Iceberg Index, a skills-centered metric that measures the wage value of skills AI systems can perform within each occupation. The Index captures technical exposure, where AI can perform occupational tasks, not displacement outcomes or adoption timelines. Analysis shows that visible AI adoption concentrated in computing and technology (2.2% of wage value, approx \$211 billion) represents only the tip of the iceberg. Technical capability extends far below the surface through cognitive automation spanning administrative, financial, and professional services (11.7%, approx \$1.2 trillion). This exposure is fivefold larger and geographically distributed across all states rather than confined to coastal hubs. Traditional indicators such as GDP, income, and unemployment explain less than 5% of this skills-based variation, underscoring why new indices are needed to capture exposure in the AI economy. By simulating how these capabilities may spread under scenarios, Iceberg enables policymakers and business leaders to identify exposure hotspots, prioritize investments, and test interventions before committing billions to implementation</description>

      <title>Machine Learning and CPU (Central Processing Unit) Scheduling Co-Optimization over a Network of Computing Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and (ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications, distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.</description>

      <title>On Robust Popular Matchings with Tie-Bounded Preferences and Stable Matchings with Two-Sided Ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are given a bipartite graph $G = \left( A \cup B, E \right)$. In the one-sided model, every $a \in A$ (often called agents) ranks its neighbours $z \in N_{a}$ strictly, and no $b \in B$ has any preference order over its neighbours $y \in N_{b}$, and vertices in $B$ abstain from casting their votes to matchings. In the two-sided model with one-sided ties, every $a \in A$ ranks its neighbours $z \in N_{a}$ strictly, and every $b \in B$ puts all of its neighbours into a single large tie, i.e., $b \in B$ prefers every $y \in N_{b}$ equally. In this two-sided model with one-sided ties, when two matchings compete in a majority election, $b \in B$ abstains from casting its vote for a matching when both the matchings saturate $b$ or both leave $b$ unsaturated; else $b$ prefers the matching where it is saturated. A popular matching $M$ is \emph{robust} if it remains popular among multiple instances.
  We have analysed the cases when a robust popular matching exists in the one-sided model where only one agent alters her preference order among the instances, and we have proposed a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if there exists a robust popular matching when instances differ only with respect to the preference orders of a single agent.
  We give a simple characterisation of popular matchings in the two-sided model with one-sided ties. We show that in the two-sided model with one-sided ties, if the input instances differ only with respect to the preference orders of a single agent, there is a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether there exists a robust popular matching. We have been able to decide the stable matching problem in bipartite graphs $G = (A \cup B, E)$ where \textit{both} sides have weak preferences (ties allowed), with the restriction that every tie has length at most $k$.</description>

      <title>Solving the Right Problem with Multi-Robot Formations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by encoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing complex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining the shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or Box formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation. When more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a static shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose a formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost function while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation planner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative robot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear and non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions. We theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do not need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized using relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are realized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's direct approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for military-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations, we show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When minimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation planner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning provides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that closely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape abstraction.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker for Agentic AI Workflows</title>

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system, is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption, and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Redistributing Rewards Across Time and Agents for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Credit assignmen, disentangling each agent's contribution to a shared reward, is a critical challenge in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). To be effective, credit assignment methods must preserve the environment's optimal policy. Some recent approaches attempt this by enforcing return equivalence, where the sum of distributed rewards must equal the team reward. However, their guarantees are conditional on a learned model's regression accuracy, making them unreliable in practice. We introduce Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution (TAR$^2$), an approach that decouples credit modeling from this constraint. A neural network learns unnormalized contribution scores, while a separate, deterministic normalization step enforces return equivalence by construction. We demonstrate that this method is equivalent to a valid Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS), which guarantees the optimal policy is preserved regardless of model accuracy. Empirically, on challenging SMACLite and Google Research Football (GRF) benchmarks, TAR$^2$ accelerates learning and achieves higher final performance than strong baselines. These results establish our method as an effective solution for the agent-temporal credit assignment problem.</description>

      <title>Partially Observable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Information Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08705v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study provable multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) in the general framework of partially observable stochastic games (POSGs). To circumvent the known hardness results and the use of computationally intractable oracles, we advocate leveraging the potential \emph{information-sharing} among agents, a common practice in empirical multi-agent RL, and a standard model for multi-agent control systems with communication. We first establish several computational complexity results to justify the necessity of information-sharing, as well as the observability assumption that has enabled quasi-polynomial time and sample single-agent RL with partial observations, for tractably solving POSGs. Inspired by the inefficiency of planning in the ground-truth model, we then propose to further \emph{approximate} the shared common information to construct an approximate model of the POSG, in which an approximate \emph{equilibrium} (of the original POSG) can be found in quasi-polynomial-time, under the aforementioned assumptions. Furthermore, we develop a partially observable multi-agent RL algorithm whose time and sample complexities are \emph{both} quasi-polynomial. Finally, beyond equilibrium learning, we extend our algorithmic framework to finding the \emph{team-optimal solution} in cooperative POSGs, i.e., decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes, a more challenging goal. We establish concrete computational and sample complexities under several structural assumptions of the model. We hope our study could open up the possibilities of leveraging and even designing different \emph{information structures}, a well-studied notion in control theory, for developing both sample- and computation-efficient partially observable multi-agent RL.</description>

      <title>HyperMARL: Adaptive Hypernetworks for Multi-Agent RL</title>

Abstract: Adaptive cooperation in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires policies to express homogeneous, specialised, or mixed behaviours, yet achieving this adaptivity remains a critical challenge. While parameter sharing (PS) is standard for efficient learning, it notoriously suppresses the behavioural diversity required for specialisation. This failure is largely due to cross-agent gradient interference, a problem we find is surprisingly exacerbated by the common practice of coupling agent IDs with observations. Existing remedies typically add complexity through altered objectives, manual preset diversity levels, or sequential updates -- raising a fundamental question: can shared policies adapt without these intricacies? We propose a solution built on a key insight: an agent-conditioned hypernetwork can generate agent-specific parameters and decouple observation- and agent-conditioned gradients, directly countering the interference from coupling agent IDs with observations. Our resulting method, HyperMARL, avoids the complexities of prior work and empirically reduces policy gradient variance. Across diverse MARL benchmarks (22 scenarios, up to 30 agents), HyperMARL achieves performance competitive with six key baselines while preserving behavioural diversity comparable to non-parameter sharing methods, establishing it as a versatile and principled approach for adaptive MARL. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/KaleabTessera/HyperMARL.</description>

      <title>HAMLET: Hyperadaptive Agent-based Modeling for Live Embodied Theatrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating an immersive and interactive theatrical experience is a long-term goal in the field of interactive narrative. The emergence of large language model (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing LLM-based drama generation methods often result in agents that lack initiative and cannot interact with the physical scene. Furthermore, these methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These limitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time performance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent framework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple topic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent improvisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given an autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based on their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to conversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of scene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon. The change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know and care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the quality of drama performance generated by HAMLET, we designed an evaluation method to assess three primary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and interaction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can create expressive and coherent theatrical experiences.</description>

      <title>Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarms. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines the classic opinion dynamics (the French-DeGroot model) with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuee agents in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to the Vicsek flocking model, and it is meaningful to explore complex social behavior during phase transition of a non-equilibrium process.</description>
