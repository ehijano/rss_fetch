      <title>The Necessity of AI Audit Standards Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditing of AI systems is a promising way to understand and manage ethical problems and societal risks associated with contemporary AI systems, as well as some anticipated future risks. Efforts to develop standards for auditing Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have therefore understandably gained momentum. However, we argue that creating auditing standards is not just insufficient, but actively harmful by proliferating unheeded and inconsistent standards, especially in light of the rapid evolution and ethical and safety challenges of AI. Instead, the paper proposes the establishment of an AI Audit Standards Board, responsible for developing and updating auditing methods and standards in line with the evolving nature of AI technologies. Such a body would ensure that auditing practices remain relevant, robust, and responsive to the rapid advancements in AI. The paper argues that such a governance structure would also be helpful for maintaining public trust in AI and for promoting a culture of safety and ethical responsibility within the AI industry.
  Throughout the paper, we draw parallels with other industries, including safety-critical industries like aviation and nuclear energy, as well as more prosaic ones such as financial accounting and pharmaceuticals. AI auditing should emulate those fields, and extend beyond technical assessments to include ethical considerations and stakeholder engagement, but we explain that this is not enough; emulating other fields' governance mechanisms for these processes, and for audit standards creation, is a necessity. We also emphasize the importance of auditing the entire development process of AI systems, not just the final products...</description>

      <title>SmartPathfinder: Pushing the Limits of Heuristic Solutions for Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones (VRPD) seeks to optimize the routing paths for both trucks and drones, where the trucks are responsible for delivering parcels to customer locations, and the drones are dispatched from these trucks for parcel delivery, subsequently being retrieved by the trucks. Given the NP-Hard complexity of VRPD, numerous heuristic approaches have been introduced. However, improving solution quality and reducing computation time remain significant challenges. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive examination of heuristic methods designed for solving VRPD, distilling and standardizing them into core elements. We then develop a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that is seamlessly integrated with the heuristic solution components, establishing a set of universal principles for incorporating the RL framework with heuristic strategies in an aim to improve both the solution quality and computation speed. This integration has been applied to a state-of-the-art heuristic solution for VRPD, showcasing the substantial benefits of incorporating the RL framework. Our evaluation results demonstrated that the heuristic solution incorporated with our RL framework not only elevated the quality of solutions but also achieved rapid computation speeds, especially when dealing with extensive customer locations.</description>

      <title>From Model Performance to Claim: How a Change of Focus in Machine Learning Replicability Can Help Bridge the Responsibility Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two goals - improving replicability and accountability of Machine Learning research respectively, have accrued much attention from the AI ethics and the Machine Learning community. Despite sharing the measures of improving transparency, the two goals are discussed in different registers - replicability registers with scientific reasoning whereas accountability registers with ethical reasoning. Given the existing challenge of the Responsibility Gap - holding Machine Learning scientists accountable for Machine Learning harms due to them being far from sites of application, this paper posits that reconceptualizing replicability can help bridge the gap. Through a shift from model performance replicability to claim replicability, Machine Learning scientists can be held accountable for producing non-replicable claims that are prone to eliciting harm due to misuse and misinterpretation. In this paper, I make the following contributions. First, I define and distinguish two forms of replicability for ML research that can aid constructive conversations around replicability. Second, I formulate an argument for claim-replicability's advantage over model performance replicability in justifying assigning accountability to Machine Learning scientists for producing non-replicable claims and show how it enacts a sense of responsibility that is actionable. In addition, I characterize the implementation of claim replicability as more of a social project than a technical one by discussing its competing epistemological principles, practical implications on Circulating Reference, Interpretative Labor, and research communication.</description>

      <title>Insights from an experiment crowdsourcing data from thousands of US Amazon users: The importance of transparency, money, and data use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data generated by users on digital platforms are a crucial resource for advocates and researchers interested in uncovering digital inequities, auditing algorithms, and understanding human behavior. Yet data access is often restricted. How can researchers both effectively and ethically collect user data? This paper shares an innovative approach to crowdsourcing user data to collect otherwise inaccessible Amazon purchase histories, spanning 5 years, from more than 5000 US users. We developed a data collection tool that prioritizes participant consent and includes an experimental study design. The design allows us to study multiple aspects of privacy perception and data sharing behavior. Experiment results (N=6325) reveal both monetary incentives and transparency can significantly increase data sharing. Age, race, education, and gender also played a role, where female and less-educated participants were more likely to share. Our study design enables a unique empirical evaluation of the "privacy paradox", where users claim to value their privacy more than they do in practice. We set up both real and hypothetical data sharing scenarios and find measurable similarities and differences in share rates across these contexts. For example, increasing monetary incentives had a 6 times higher impact on share rates in real scenarios. In addition, we study participants' opinions on how data should be used by various third parties, again finding demographics have a significant impact. Notably, the majority of participants disapproved of government agencies using purchase data yet the majority approved of use by researchers. Overall, our findings highlight the critical role that transparency, incentive design, and user demographics play in ethical data collection practices, and provide guidance for future researchers seeking to crowdsource user generated data.</description>

      <title>Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) -- Version 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV), developed by the W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies and Controls Community Group (DPVCG), enables the creation of machine-readable, interoperable, and standards-based representations for describing the processing of personal data. The group has also published extensions to the DPV to describe specific applications to support legislative requirements such as the EU's GDPR. The DPV fills a crucial niche in the state of the art by providing a vocabulary that can be embedded and used alongside other existing standards such as W3C ODRL, and which can be customised and extended for adapting to specifics of use-cases or domains. This article describes the version 2 iteration of the DPV in terms of its contents, methodology, current adoptions and uses, and future potential. It also describes the relevance and role of DPV in acting as a common vocabulary to support various regulatory (e.g. EU's DGA and AI Act) and community initiatives (e.g. Solid) emerging across the globe.</description>

      <title>A Practical Multilevel Governance Framework for Autonomous and Intelligent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous and intelligent systems (AIS) facilitate a wide range of beneficial applications across a variety of different domains. However, technical characteristics such as unpredictability and lack of transparency, as well as potential unintended consequences, pose considerable challenges to the current governance infrastructure. Furthermore, the speed of development and deployment of applications outpaces the ability of existing governance institutions to put in place effective ethical-legal oversight. New approaches for agile, distributed and multilevel governance are needed. This work presents a practical framework for multilevel governance of AIS. The framework enables mapping actors onto six levels of decision-making including the international, national and organizational levels. Furthermore, it offers the ability to identify and evolve existing tools or create new tools for guiding the behavior of actors within the levels. Governance mechanisms enable actors to shape and enforce regulations and other tools, which when complemented with good practices contribute to effective and comprehensive governance.</description>

      <title>Beyond Personhood: Agency, Accountability, and the Limits of Anthropomorphic Ethical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is agency, and why does it matter? In this work, we draw from the political science and philosophy literature and give two competing visions of what it means to be an (ethical) agent. The first view, which we term mechanistic, is commonly--and implicitly--assumed in AI research, yet it is a fundamentally limited means to understand the ethical characteristics of AI. Under the second view, which we term volitional, AI can no longer be considered an ethical agent. We discuss the implications of each of these views for two critical questions: first, what the ideal system ought to look like, and second, how accountability may be achieved. In light of this discussion, we ultimately argue that, in the context of ethically-significant behavior, AI should be viewed not as an agent but as the outcome of political processes.</description>

      <title>Surveying Attitudinal Alignment Between Large Language Models Vs. Humans Towards 17 Sustainable Development Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potent tools for advancing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the attitudinal disparities between LLMs and humans towards these goals can pose significant challenges. This study conducts a comprehensive review and analysis of the existing literature on the attitudes of LLMs towards the 17 SDGs, emphasizing the comparison between their attitudes and support for each goal and those of humans. We examine the potential disparities, primarily focusing on aspects such as understanding and emotions, cultural and regional differences, task objective variations, and factors considered in the decision-making process. These disparities arise from the underrepresentation and imbalance in LLM training data, historical biases, quality issues, lack of contextual understanding, and skewed ethical values reflected. The study also investigates the risks and harms that may arise from neglecting the attitudes of LLMs towards the SDGs, including the exacerbation of social inequalities, racial discrimination, environmental destruction, and resource wastage. To address these challenges, we propose strategies and recommendations to guide and regulate the application of LLMs, ensuring their alignment with the principles and goals of the SDGs, and therefore creating a more just, inclusive, and sustainable future.</description>

      <title>Normalisation de terminologies multilingues pour les TICE : techniques et enjeux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terminology and lexicography standardization is a fundamental issue that is becoming increasingly important in the era of multilingual globalization and particularly, from our standpoint, the era of terminotics and translation. The challenges of multilingual globalization and e-semantics directly impact standardization methods: Development and perspectives of standards for ''Terminology and other language and content resources'' (the title of ISO-TC37); Development and future of all standardization fields that develop terminology (or vocabulary) most often multilingual, serving as the basis for their development and acting as a reference totheir use. In the first part of our presentation, we will first point out the normative aspects of standardization in terminology and especially terminotics. In the second part, we will present a brief overview of terminology standardization projects and their rationale, In the third part, we will develop the specific issue of ICTE. We will focus on our involvement in this field, on our assumptions and values of methods. We will set out our theoretical and technical developments underway and will conclude with our needs for collaboration with your academic community.</description>

Abstract: The semantics of content is one of the essential constituents of models of innovative educational systems. It is gradually built based on normative efforts carried out by different actors in the fields of the technological industry, telecommunications, IT, linguistic engineering, information sciences documentation, etc. Semantics in networks and digital information systems represent, in fact, an advanced link in a long process of processing digital information in which terminological work occupies an important part. This process is also very consolidated by a wide range of norms and standards which ensure very high levels of technical, organizational, and semantic interoperability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the utilization of blockchain token voting technology in student course selection systems. The current course selection systems face various issues, which can be mitigated through the implementation of blockchain technology. The advantages of blockchain technology, including consensus mechanisms and smart contracts, are discussed in detail. The token voting mechanism, encompassing concepts, token issuance and distribution, and voting rules and procedures, is also explained. The system design takes into account the system architecture, user roles and permissions, course information on the blockchain, student course selection voting process, and course selection result statistics and public display. The technology offers advantages such as transparency, fairness, data security and privacy protection, and system efficiency improvement. However, it also poses several challenges, such as technological and regulatory hurdles. The prospects for the application of blockchain token voting technology in student course selection systems and its potential impact on other fields are summarized. Overall, the utilization of blockchain token voting technology in student course selection systems holds promising future implications, which could revolutionize the education sector.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned in Performing a Trustworthy AI and Fundamental Rights Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report shares the experiences, results and lessons learned in conducting a pilot project ``Responsible use of AI'' in cooperation with the Province of Friesland, Rijks ICT Gilde-part of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (BZK) (both in The Netherlands) and a group of members of the Z-Inspection$^{\small{\circledR}}$ Initiative. The pilot project took place from May 2022 through January 2023. During the pilot, the practical application of a deep learning algorithm from the province of Fr\^yslan was assessed. The AI maps heathland grassland by means of satellite images for monitoring nature reserves. Environmental monitoring is one of the crucial activities carried on by society for several purposes ranging from maintaining standards on drinkable water to quantifying the CO2 emissions of a particular state or region. Using satellite imagery and machine learning to support decisions is becoming an important part of environmental monitoring. The main focus of this report is to share the experiences, results and lessons learned from performing both a Trustworthy AI assessment using the Z-Inspection$^{\small{\circledR}}$ process and the EU framework for Trustworthy AI, and combining it with a Fundamental Rights assessment using the Fundamental Rights and Algorithms Impact Assessment (FRAIA) as recommended by the Dutch government for the use of AI algorithms by the Dutch public authorities.</description>

      <title>Bubble reachers and uncivil discourse in polarized online public sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early optimism saw possibilities for social media to renew democratic discourse, marked by hopes for individuals from diverse backgrounds to find opportunities to learn from and interact with others different from themselves. This optimism quickly waned as social media seemed to breed ideological homophily marked by "filter bubble" or "echo chambers." A typical response to the sense of fragmentation has been to encourage exposure to more cross-partisan sources of information. But do outlets that reach across partisan lines in fact generate more civil discourse? And does the civility of discourse hosted by such outlets vary depending on the political context in which they operate? To answer these questions, we identified bubble reachers, users who distribute content that reaches other users with diverse political opinions in recent presidential elections in Brazil, where populism has deep roots in the political culture, and Canada, where the political culture is comparatively moderate. Given that background, this research studies unexplored properties of content shared by bubble reachers, specifically the quality of conversations and comments it generates. We examine how ideologically neutral bubble reachers differ from ideologically partisan accounts in the level of uncivil discourse they provoke, and explore how this varies in the context of the two countries considered. Our results suggest that while ideologically neutral bubble reachers support less uncivil discourse in Canada, the opposite relationship holds in Brazil. Even non-political content by ideologically neutral bubble reachers elicits a considerable amount of uncivil discourse in Brazil. This indicates that bubble reaching and incivility are moderated by the national political context. Our results complicate the simple hypothesis of a universal impact of neutral bubble reachers across contexts.</description>

      <title>Paths to Testing: Why Women Enter and Remain in Software Testing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background. Women bring unique problem-solving skills to software development, often favoring a holistic approach and attention to detail. In software testing, precision and attention to detail are essential as professionals explore system functionalities to identify defects. Recognizing the alignment between these skills and women's strengths can derive strategies for enhancing diversity in software engineering. Goal. This study investigates the motivations behind women choosing careers in software testing, aiming to provide insights into their reasons for entering and remaining in the field. Method. This study used a cross-sectional survey methodology following established software engineering guidelines, collecting data from women in software testing to explore their motivations, experiences, and perspectives. Findings. The findings reveal that women enter software testing due to increased entry-level job opportunities, work-life balance, and even fewer gender stereotypes. Their motivations to stay include the impact of delivering high-quality software, continuous learning opportunities, and the challenges the activities bring to them. However, inclusiveness and career development in the field need improvement for sustained diversity. Conclusion. Preliminary yet significant, these findings offer interesting insights for researchers and practitioners towards the understanding of women's diverse motivations in software testing and how this understanding is important for fostering professional growth and creating a more inclusive and equitable industry landscape.</description>

Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>

      <title>Unlawful Proxy Discrimination: A Framework for Challenging Inherently Discriminatory Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging scholarship suggests that the EU legal concept of direct discrimination - where a person is given different treatment on grounds of a protected characteristic - may apply to various algorithmic decision-making contexts. This has important implications: unlike indirect discrimination, there is generally no 'objective justification' stage in the direct discrimination framework, which means that the deployment of directly discriminatory algorithms will usually be unlawful per se. In this paper, we focus on the most likely candidate for direct discrimination in the algorithmic context, termed inherent direct discrimination, where a proxy is inextricably linked to a protected characteristic. We draw on computer science literature to suggest that, in the algorithmic context, 'treatment on the grounds of' needs to be understood in terms of two steps: proxy capacity and proxy use. Only where both elements can be made out can direct discrimination be said to be `on grounds of' a protected characteristic. We analyse the legal conditions of our proposed proxy capacity and proxy use tests. Based on this analysis, we discuss technical approaches and metrics that could be developed or applied to identify inherent direct discrimination in algorithmic decision-making.</description>

      <title>No General Code of Ethics for All: Ethical Considerations in Human-bot Psycho-counseling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pervasive use of AI applications is increasingly influencing our everyday decisions. However, the ethical challenges associated with AI transcend conventional ethics and single-discipline approaches. In this paper, we propose aspirational ethical principles specifically tailored for human-bot psycho-counseling during an era when AI-powered mental health services are continually emerging. We examined the responses generated by EVA2.0, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.0 in the context of psycho-counseling and mental health inquiries. Our analysis focused on standard psycho-counseling ethical codes (respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, justice, and responsibility) as well as crisis intervention strategies (risk assessment, involvement of emergency services, and referral to human professionals). The results indicate that although there has been progress in adhering to regular ethical codes as large language models (LLMs) evolve, the models' capabilities in handling crisis situations need further improvement. Additionally, we assessed the linguistic quality of the generated responses and found that misleading responses are still produced by the models. Furthermore, the ability of LLMs to encourage individuals to introspect in the psycho-counseling setting remains underdeveloped.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Faces in the Real World: A Large-Scale Case Study of Twitter Profile Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052% were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.</description>

      <title>RTP-LX: Can LLMs Evaluate Toxicity in Multilingual Scenarios?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) are being adopted at remarkable speed, although their safety still remains a serious concern. With the advent of multilingual S/LLMs, the question now becomes a matter of scale: can we expand multilingual safety evaluations of these models with the same velocity at which they are deployed? To this end we introduce RTP-LX, a human-transcreated and human-annotated corpus of toxic prompts and outputs in 28 languages. RTP-LX follows participatory design practices, and a portion of the corpus is especially designed to detect culturally-specific toxic language. We evaluate seven S/LLMs on their ability to detect toxic content in a culturally-sensitive, multilingual scenario. We find that, although they typically score acceptably in terms of accuracy, they have low agreement with human judges when judging holistically the toxicity of a prompt, and have difficulty discerning harm in context-dependent scenarios, particularly with subtle-yet-harmful content (e.g. microagressions, bias). We release of this dataset to contribute to further reduce harmful uses of these models and improve their safe deployment.</description>

      <title>Curious Rhythms: Temporal Regularities of Wikipedia Consumption</title>

Abstract: Wikipedia, in its role as the world's largest encyclopedia, serves a broad range of information needs. Although previous studies have noted that Wikipedia users' information needs vary throughout the day, there is to date no large-scale, quantitative study of the underlying dynamics. The present paper fills this gap by investigating temporal regularities in daily consumption patterns in a large-scale analysis of billions of timezone-corrected page requests mined from English Wikipedia's server logs, with the goal of investigating how context and time relate to the kind of information consumed. First, we show that even after removing the global pattern of day-night alternation, the consumption habits of individual articles maintain strong diurnal regularities. Then, we characterize the prototypical shapes of consumption patterns, finding a particularly strong distinction between articles preferred during the evening/night and articles preferred during working hours. Finally, we investigate topical and contextual correlates of Wikipedia articles' access rhythms, finding that article topic, reader country, and access device (mobile vs. desktop) are all important predictors of daily attention patterns. These findings shed new light on how humans seek information on the Web by focusing on Wikipedia as one of the largest open platforms for knowledge and learning, emphasizing Wikipedia's role as a rich knowledge base that fulfills information needs spread throughout the day, with implications for understanding information seeking across the globe and for designing appropriate information systems.</description>

      <title>Human participants in AI research: Ethics and transparency in practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, research involving human participants has been critical to advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), particularly in the areas of conversational, human-compatible, and cooperative AI. For example, around 12% and 6% of publications at recent AAAI and NeurIPS conferences indicate the collection of original human data, respectively. Yet AI and ML researchers lack guidelines for ethical, transparent research practices with human participants. Fewer than one out of every four of these AAAI and NeurIPS papers provide details of ethical review, the collection of informed consent, or participant compensation. This paper aims to bridge this gap by exploring normative similarities and differences between AI research and related fields that involve human participants. Though psychology, human-computer interaction, and other adjacent fields offer historic lessons and helpful insights, AI research raises several specific concerns$\unicode{x2014}$namely, participatory design, crowdsourced dataset development, and an expansive role of corporations$\unicode{x2014}$that necessitate a contextual ethics framework. To address these concerns, this paper outlines a set of guidelines for ethical and transparent practice with human participants in AI and ML research. These guidelines can be found in Section 4 on pp. 4$\unicode{x2013}$7.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effectiveness of applying ChatGPT in Dialogic Teaching Using Electroencephalography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has presented significant prospects for application in the field of education. LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students. Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic. This research recruited 34 undergraduate students as participants, who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group engaged in dialogic teaching using ChatGPT, while the control group interacted with human teachers. Both groups learned the histogram equalization unit in the information-related course "Digital Image Processing". The research findings show comparable scores between the two groups on the retention test. However, students who engaged in dialogue with ChatGPT exhibited lower performance on the transfer test. Electroencephalography data revealed that students who interacted with ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of cognitive activity, suggesting that ChatGPT could help students establish a knowledge foundation and stimulate cognitive activity. However, its strengths on promoting students. knowledge application and creativity were insignificant. Based upon the research findings, it is evident that ChatGPT cannot fully excel in fulfilling teaching tasks in the dialogue teaching in information related courses. Combining ChatGPT with traditional human teachers might be a more ideal approach. The synergistic use of both can provide students with more comprehensive learning support, thus contributing to enhancing the quality of teaching.</description>

      <title>Now, Later, and Lasting: Ten Priorities for AI Research, Policy, and Practice</title>

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will transform many aspects of our lives and society, bringing immense opportunities but also posing significant risks and challenges. The next several decades may well be a turning point for humanity, comparable to the industrial revolution. We write to share a set of recommendations for moving forward from the perspective of the founder and leaders of the One Hundred Year Study on AI. Launched a decade ago, the project is committed to a perpetual series of studies by multidisciplinary experts to evaluate the immediate, longer-term, and far-reaching effects of AI on people and society, and to make recommendations about AI research, policy, and practice. As we witness new capabilities emerging from neural models, it is crucial that we engage in efforts to advance our scientific understanding of these models and their behaviors. We must address the impact of AI on people and society through technical, social, and sociotechnical lenses, incorporating insights from a diverse range of experts including voices from engineering, social, behavioral, and economic disciplines. By fostering dialogue, collaboration, and action among various stakeholders, we can strategically guide the development and deployment of AI in ways that maximize its potential for contributing to human flourishing. Despite the growing divide in the field between focusing on short-term versus long-term implications, we think both are of critical importance. As Alan Turing, one of the pioneers of AI, wrote in 1950, "We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done." We offer ten recommendations for action that collectively address both the short- and long-term potential impacts of AI technologies.</description>

      <title>A Non-Expert's Introduction to Data Ethics for Mathematicians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I give a short introduction to data ethics. I begin with some background information and societal context for data ethics. I then discuss data ethics in mathematical-science education and indicate some available course material. I briefly highlight a few efforts -- at my home institution and elsewhere -- on data ethics, society, and social good. I then discuss open data in research, research replicability and some other ethical issues in research, and the tension between privacy and open data and code, and a few controversial studies and reactions to studies. I then discuss ethical principles, institutional review boards, and a few other considerations in the scientific use of human data. Finally, I briefly survey a variety of research and lay articles that are relevant to data ethics and data privacy. I conclude with a brief summary.
  My focal audience is mathematicians, but I hope that this chapter will also be useful to others. I am not an expert about data ethics, and this chapter provides only a starting point on this wide-ranging topic. I encourage you to examine the resources that I discuss and to reflect carefully on data ethics, its role in mathematics education, and the societal implications of data and data analysis. As data and technology continue to evolve, I hope that such careful reflection will continue throughout your life.</description>

      <title>CAFIN: Centrality Aware Fairness inducing IN-processing for Unsupervised Representation Learning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Representation Learning on graphs is gaining traction due to the increasing abundance of unlabelled network data and the compactness, richness, and usefulness of the representations generated. In this context, the need to consider fairness and bias constraints while generating the representations has been well-motivated and studied to some extent in prior works. One major limitation of most of the prior works in this setting is that they do not aim to address the bias generated due to connectivity patterns in the graphs, such as varied node centrality, which leads to a disproportionate performance across nodes. In our work, we aim to address this issue of mitigating bias due to inherent graph structure in an unsupervised setting. To this end, we propose CAFIN, a centrality-aware fairness-inducing framework that leverages the structural information of graphs to tune the representations generated by existing frameworks. We deploy it on GraphSAGE (a popular framework in this domain) and showcase its efficacy on two downstream tasks - Node Classification and Link Prediction. Empirically, CAFIN consistently reduces the performance disparity across popular datasets (varying from 18 to 80% reduction in performance disparity) from various domains while incurring only a minimal cost of fairness.</description>

      <title>Moral Sparks in Social Media Narratives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in building computational models of moral reasoning by people to enable effective interaction by Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. We examine interactions on social media to understand human moral judgments in real-life ethical scenarios. Specifically, we examine posts from a popular Reddit subreddit (i.e., a subcommunity) called r/AmITheAsshole, where authors and commenters share their moral judgments on who (i.e., which participant of the described scenario) is blameworthy. To investigate the underlying reasoning influencing moral judgments, we focus on excerpts-which we term moral sparks-from original posts that some commenters include to indicate what motivates their judgments. To this end, we examine how (1) events activating social commonsense and (2) linguistic signals affect the identified moral sparks and their subsequent judgments. By examining over 24672 posts and 175988 comments, we find that event-related negative character traits (e.g., immature and rude) attract attention and stimulate blame, implying a dependent relationship between character traits and moral values. Specifically, we focus on causal graphs involving events (c-events) that activate social commonsense. We observe that c-events are perceived with varying levels of informativeness, influencing moral spark and judgment assignment in distinct ways. This observation is reinforced by examining linguistic features describing semantically similar c-events. Moreover, language influencing commenters' cognitive processes enhances the probability of an excerpt becoming a moral spark, while factual and concrete descriptions tend to inhibit this effect.</description>

      <title>The Great Ban: Efficacy and Unintended Consequences of a Massive Deplatforming Operation on Reddit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11254v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the current landscape of online abuses and harms, effective content moderation is necessary to cultivate safe and inclusive online spaces. Yet, the effectiveness of many moderation interventions is still unclear. Here, we assess the effectiveness of The Great Ban, a massive deplatforming operation that affected nearly 2,000 communities on Reddit. By analyzing 16M comments posted by 17K users during 14 months, we provide nuanced results on the effects, both desired and otherwise, of the ban. Among our main findings is that 15.6% of the affected users left Reddit and that those who remained reduced their toxicity by 6.6% on average. The ban also caused 5% users to increase their toxicity by more than 70% of their pre-ban level. Overall, our multifaceted results provide new insights into the efficacy of deplatforming. As such, our findings can inform the development of future moderation interventions and the policing of online platforms.</description>

      <title>Using Graph Neural Networks to Predict Local Culture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban research has long recognized that neighbourhoods are dynamic and relational. However, lack of data, methodologies, and computer processing power have hampered a formal quantitative examination of neighbourhood relational dynamics. To make progress on this issue, this study proposes a graph neural network (GNN) approach that permits combining and evaluating multiple sources of information about internal characteristics of neighbourhoods, their past characteristics, and flows of groups among them, potentially providing greater expressive power in predictive models. By exploring a public large-scale dataset from Yelp, we show the potential of our approach for considering structural connectedness in predicting neighbourhood attributes, specifically to predict local culture. Results are promising from a substantive and methodologically point of view. Substantively, we find that either local area information (e.g. area demographics) or group profiles (tastes of Yelp reviewers) give the best results in predicting local culture, and they are nearly equivalent in all studied cases. Methodologically, exploring group profiles could be a helpful alternative where finding local information for specific areas is challenging, since they can be extracted automatically from many forms of online data. Thus, our approach could empower researchers and policy-makers to use a range of data sources when other local area information is lacking.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for the Problem of Security for Cognition in Neurotechnology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in neurotechnology in recent years has created an emerging critical intersection between neurotechnology and security. Implantable devices, non-invasive monitoring, and non-invasive therapies all carry with them the prospect of violating the privacy and autonomy of individuals' cognition. A growing number of scientists and physicians have made calls to address this issue, but applied efforts have been relatively limited. A major barrier hampering scientific and engineering efforts to address Cognitive Security is the lack of a clear means of describing and analyzing relevant problems. In this paper we develop Cognitive Security, a mathematical framework which enables such description and analysis by drawing on methods and results from multiple fields. We demonstrate certain statistical properties which have significant implications for Cognitive Security, and then present descriptions of the algorithmic problems faced by attackers attempting to violate privacy and autonomy, and defenders attempting to obstruct such attempts.</description>

      <title>Recourse for reclamation: Chatting with generative language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers and developers increasingly rely on toxicity scoring to moderate generative language model outputs, in settings such as customer service, information retrieval, and content generation. However, toxicity scoring may render pertinent information inaccessible, rigidify or "value-lock" cultural norms, and prevent language reclamation processes, particularly for marginalized people. In this work, we extend the concept of algorithmic recourse to generative language models: we provide users a novel mechanism to achieve their desired prediction by dynamically setting thresholds for toxicity filtering. Users thereby exercise increased agency relative to interactions with the baseline system. A pilot study ($n = 30$) supports the potential of our proposed recourse mechanism, indicating improvements in usability compared to fixed-threshold toxicity-filtering of model outputs. Future work should explore the intersection of toxicity scoring, model controllability, user agency, and language reclamation processes -- particularly with regard to the bias that many communities encounter when interacting with generative language models.</description>

      <title>Negotiating the Shared Agency between Humans &amp; AI in the Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smart recommendation algorithms have revolutionized information dissemination, enhancing efficiency and reshaping content delivery across various domains. However, concerns about user agency have arisen due to the inherent opacity (information asymmetry) and the nature of one-way output (power asymmetry) on algorithms. While both issues have been criticized by scholars via advocating explainable AI (XAI) and human-AI collaborative decision-making (HACD), few research evaluates their integrated effects on users, and few HACD discussions in recommender systems beyond improving and filtering the results. This study proposes an incubating idea as a missing step in HACD that allows users to control the degrees of AI-recommended content. Then, we integrate it with existing XAI to a flow prototype aimed at assessing the enhancement of user agency. We seek to understand how types of agency impact user perception and experience, and bring empirical evidence to refine the guidelines and designs for human-AI interactive systems.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Writing Assistants: Exploring Perspectives on Sense of Ownership and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sense of ownership in writing confines our investment of thoughts, time, and contribution, leading to attachment to the output. However, using writing assistants introduces a mental dilemma, as some content isn't directly our creation. For instance, we tend to credit Large Language Models (LLMs) more in creative tasks, even though all tasks are equal for them. Additionally, while we may not claim complete ownership of LLM-generated content, we freely claim authorship. We conduct a short survey to examine these issues and understand underlying cognitive processes in order to gain a better knowledge of human-computer interaction in writing and improve writing aid systems.</description>

      <title>AI and the Problem of Knowledge Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While artificial intelligence has the potential to process vast amounts of data, generate new insights, and unlock greater productivity, its widespread adoption may entail unforeseen consequences. We identify conditions under which AI, by reducing the cost of access to certain modes of knowledge, can paradoxically harm public understanding. While large language models are trained on vast amounts of diverse data, they naturally generate output towards the 'center' of the distribution. This is generally useful, but widespread reliance on recursive AI systems could lead to a process we define as "knowledge collapse", and argue this could harm innovation and the richness of human understanding and culture. However, unlike AI models that cannot choose what data they are trained on, humans may strategically seek out diverse forms of knowledge if they perceive them to be worthwhile. To investigate this, we provide a simple model in which a community of learners or innovators choose to use traditional methods or to rely on a discounted AI-assisted process and identify conditions under which knowledge collapse occurs. In our default model, a 20% discount on AI-generated content generates public beliefs 2.3 times further from the truth than when there is no discount. An empirical approach to measuring the distribution of LLM outputs is provided in theoretical terms and illustrated through a specific example comparing the diversity of outputs across different models and prompting styles. Finally, based on the results, we consider further research directions to counteract such outcomes.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and modeling harms from interactions with design patterns in AI interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of applications using artificial intelligence (AI) systems has led to a growing number of users interacting with these systems through sophisticated interfaces. Human-computer interaction research has long shown that interfaces shape both user behavior and user perception of technical capabilities and risks. Yet, practitioners and researchers evaluating the social and ethical risks of AI systems tend to overlook the impact of anthropomorphic, deceptive, and immersive interfaces on human-AI interactions. Here, we argue that design features of interfaces with adaptive AI systems can have cascading impacts, driven by feedback loops, which extend beyond those previously considered. We first conduct a scoping review of AI interface designs and their negative impact to extract salient themes of potentially harmful design patterns in AI interfaces. Then, we propose Design-Enhanced Control of AI systems (DECAI), a conceptual model to structure and facilitate impact assessments of AI interface designs. DECAI draws on principles from control systems theory -- a theory for the analysis and design of dynamic physical systems -- to dissect the role of the interface in human-AI systems. Through two case studies on recommendation systems and conversational language model systems, we show how DECAI can be used to evaluate AI interface designs.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Synthetic Participatory Planning of Shared Automated Electric Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unleashing the synergies of rapidly evolving mobility technologies in a multi-stakeholder landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities for addressing urban transportation problems. This paper introduces a novel synthetic participatory method, critically leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create digital avatars representing diverse stakeholders to plan shared automated electric mobility systems (SAEMS). These calibratable agents collaboratively identify objectives, envision and evaluate SAEMS alternatives, and strategize implementation under risks and constraints. The results of a Montreal case study indicate that a structured and parameterized workflow provides outputs with high controllability and comprehensiveness on an SAEMS plan than generated using a single LLM-enabled expert agent. Consequently, the approach provides a promising avenue for cost-efficiently improving the inclusivity and interpretability of multi-objective transportation planning, suggesting a paradigm shift in how we envision and strategize for sustainable and equitable transportation systems.</description>
