      <title>On the path ideals of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give combinatorial formulas for the regularity and the projective dimension of $3$-path ideals of chordal graphs, extending the well-known formulas for the edge ideals of chordal graphs given in terms of the induced matching number and the big height, respectively. As a consequence, we get that the $3$-path ideal of a chordal graph is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if it is unmixed. Additionally, we show that the Alexander dual of the $3$-path ideal of a tree is vertex splittable, thereby resolving the $t=3$ case of a recent conjecture in [Internat. J. Algebra Comput., 33(3):481--498, 2023]. Also, we give examples of chordal graphs where the duals of their $t$-path ideals are not vertex splittable for $t\ge 3$. Furthermore, we extend the formula of the regularity of $3$-path ideals of chordal graphs to all $t$-path ideals of caterpillar graphs. We then provide some families of graphs to show that these formulas for the regularity and the projective dimension cannot be extended to higher $t$-path ideals of chordal graphs (even in the case of trees).</description>

      <title>Generalized Ramsey numbers of cycles, paths, and hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a $k$-uniform hypergraph $G$ and a set of $k$-uniform hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}$, the generalized Ramsey number $f(G,\mathcal{H},q)$ is the minimum number of colors needed to edge-color $G$ so that every copy of every hypergraph $H\in \mathcal{H}$ in $G$ receives at least $q$ different colors. In this note we obtain bounds, some asymptotically sharp, on several generalized Ramsey numbers, when $G=K_n$ or $G=K_{n,n}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ is a set of cycles or paths, and when $G=K_n^k$ and $\mathcal{H}$ contains a clique on $k+2$ vertices or a tight cycle.</description>

      <title>A dissimilarity measure for semidirected networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semidirected networks have received interest in evolutionary biology as the appropriate generalization of unrooted trees to networks, in which some but not all edges are directed. Yet these networks lack proper theoretical study. We define here a general class of semidirected phylogenetic networks, with a stable set of leaves, tree nodes and hybrid nodes. We prove that for these networks, if we locally choose the direction of one edge, then globally the set of paths starting by this edge is stable across all choices to root the network. We define an edge-based representation of semidirected phylogenetic networks and use it to define a dissimilarity between networks, which can be efficiently computed in near-quadratic time. Our dissimilarity extends the widely-used Robinson-Foulds distance on both rooted trees and unrooted trees. After generalizing the notion of tree-child networks to semidirected networks, we prove that our edge-based dissimilarity is in fact a distance on the space of tree-child semidirected phylogenetic networks.</description>

      <title>Chutes and Ladders: on some sequences inspired by 2017 Putnam A1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first problem of the 2017 Putnam competition was to characterize a set of natural numbers closed under both the square-root map $n^2 \mapsto n$ and the "add 5 and square" map $ n \mapsto (n+5)^2$. We reframe this as a problem on an infinite directed graph, using this framing both to generalize the problem and its solution, as well as to determine the first appearance of each number in this set under a row-wise algorithm that outputs all its elements.</description>

      <title>How to get the random graph with non-uniform probabilities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rado Graph, sometimes also known as the (countable) Random Graph, can be generated almost surely by putting an edge between any pair of vertices with some fixed probability $p \in (0, 1)$, independently of other pairs. In this article, we study the influence of allowing different probabilities for each pair of vertices. More specifically, we characterize for which sequences $(p_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of values in $[0, 1]$ there exists a bijection f from pairs of vertices in $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$ such that if we put an edge between $v$ and $w$ with probability $p_{f(\{v,w\})}$, independently of other pairs, then the Random Graph arises almost surely.</description>

      <title>Partitioning the set of natural numbers into Mersenne trees and into arithmetic progressions; Natural Matrix and Linnik's constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We partition a series of natural numbers into infinite number sequences. We consider two choices of partitioning: (a) a forest of unary trees with recurrence formula of Mersenne numbers, and (b) a set of arithmetic progressions with difference $2^k$. Every tree starts with an even number, and any even number starts a certain tree. In the partitioning into arithmetic progressions, each progression starts with a Mersenne number, and each Mersenne number is the beginning of a particular arithmetic progression. Unary trees starting from some term are contained in OEIS A036991 (compact Dyck path codes), so we consider A036991 as a backbone of the partitions. In particular, we prove the existence of an arithmetic progression of any length in A036991. As a result of the partitions, we obtain a Natural Matrix with a packing function that captures the bijection between the set of natural numbers and the set of ordered pairs of natural numbers. In Natural Matrix, the even natural numbers are located on the $x$-axis, so the selection of primes in the considered arithmetic progressions is greatly simplified. A method for proving the infinity of primes in A036991 is proposed. In this regard, an attempt is made to reduce the Linnik's constant to $2$.</description>

      <title>Almost covers of finite sets of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mbox{$\cal V$} \subseteq {\mathbb F}^n$ be a finite set of points in an affine space. A finite set of affine hyperplanes $\{H_1, \ldots ,H_m\}$ is said to be an almost cover of $\mbox{$\cal V$}$ and $\mathbf{v}$, if their union $\cup_{j=1}^m H_j$ contains $\mbox{$\cal V$}\setminus \{\mathbf{v}\}$ but does not contain $\mathbf{v}$. We give here a lower bound for the size of a minimal almost cover of $\mbox{$\cal V$}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ in terms of the size of $\mbox{$\cal V$}$ and the dimension $n$. We prove a generalization of Sziklai and Weiner's Theorem. Our simple proof is based on Gr\"obner basis theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are four non-isomorphic configurations of triples that can form a triangle in a $3$-uniform hypergraph. Forbidding different combinations of these four configurations, fifteen extremal problems can be defined, several of which already appeared in the literature in some different context. Here we systematically study all of these problems solving the new cases exactly or asymptotically. In many cases we also characterize the extremal constructions.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an number of complete multipartite graphs in multipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a multi-partite version of the Erd\H{o}s--Stone theorem. Given integers $r&lt;k$ and $t\ge 1$, let $ex_k(n, K_{r+1}(t))$ be the maximum number of edges of $K_{r+1}(t)$-free $k$-partite graphs with $n$ vertices in each part, where $K_{r+1}(t)$ is the $t$-blowup of $K_{r+1}$. An easy consequence of the supersaturaion result gives that $ex_k(n, K_{r+1}(t)) = ex_k(n, K_{r+1})+o(n^2)$. Similar to a result of Erd\H os and Simonovits for the non-partite case, we find that the error term is closely related to the (multi-partite) Zarankiewicz problem. Using such Zarankiewicz numbers, for $t=2,3$, we determine the error term up to an additive linear term; using some natural assumptions on such Zarankiewicz numbers, we determine the error term up to an additive constant depending on $k$, $r$ and $t$. We actually obtain exact results in many cases, for example, when $k\equiv 0, 1 \pmod{r}$. Our proof uses the stability method and starts by proving a stability result for $K_{r+1}$-free multi-partite graphs.</description>

      <title>Three-edge-coloring projective planar cubic graphs: A generalization of the Four Color Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graph that can be embedded in the projective plane, with the single exception of the Petersen graph, is 3-edge-colorable. In other words, the only (non-trivial) snark that can be embedded in the projective plane is the Petersen graph.
  This implies that a 2-connected cubic (multi)graph that can be embedded in the projective plane is not 3-edge-colorable if and only if it can be obtained from the Petersen graph by replacing each vertex by a 2-edge-connected planar cubic (multi)graph.
  This result is a nontrivial generalization of the Four Color Theorem, and its proof requires a combination of extensive computer verification and computer-free extension of existing proofs on colorability.
  An unexpected consequence of this result is a coloring-flow duality statement for the projective plane: A cubic graph embedded in the projective plane is 3-edge-colorable if and only if its dual multigraph is 5-vertex-colorable. Moreover, we show that a 2-edge connected graph embedded in the projective plane admits a nowhere-zero 4-flow unless it is Peteren-like (in which case it does not admit nowhere-zero 4-flows). This proves a strengthening of the Tutte 4-flow conjecture for graphs on the projective plane.
  Some of our proofs require extensive computer verification. The necessary source codes, together with the input and output files and the complete set of more than 6000 reducible configurations are available on Github (https://github.com/edge-coloring) which can be considered as an Addendum to this paper. Moreover, we provide pseudocodes for all our computer verifications.</description>

      <title>Knot theory and cluster algebras II: The knot cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To every knot (or link) diagram K, we associate a cluster algebra A that contains a cluster x with the property that every cluster variable in x specializes to the Alexander polynomial of K. We call x the knot cluster of A. Furthermore, there exists a cluster automorphism of A of order two that maps the initial cluster to the cluster x.
  We realize this connection between knot theory and cluster algebras in two ways. In our previous work, we constructed indecomposable representations T(i) of the initial quiver Q of the cluster algebra A. Modulo the removal of 2-cycles, the quiver Q is the incidence quiver of the segments in K, and the representation T(i) of Q is built by taking successive boundaries of K cut open at the i-th segment. The relation to the Alexander polynomial stems from an isomorphism between the submodule lattice of T(i) and the lattice of Kauffman states of K relative to segment i.
  In the current article, we identify the knot cluster x in A via a sequence of mutations that we construct from a sequence of bigon reductions and generalized Reidemeister III moves on the diagram K. On the level of diagrams, this sequence first reduces K to the Hopf link, then reflects the Hopf link to its mirror image, and finally rebuilds (the mirror image of) K by reversing the reduction. We show that every diagram of a prime link admits such a sequence.
  We further prove that the cluster variables in x have the same F-polynomials as the representations T(i). This establishes the important fact that our representations T(i) do indeed correspond to cluster variables in A. But it even establishes the much stronger result that these cluster variables are all compatible, in the sense that they form a cluster.
  We also prove that the representations T(i) have the following symmetry property. For all vertices i,j of Q, the dimension of T(i) at j is equal to the dimension of T(j) at i.</description>

      <title>Totally Greedy Sequences Defined by Second-Order Linear Recurrences With Constant Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The change-making problem consists of representing a certain amount of money with the least possible number of coins, from a given, pre-established set of denominations. The greedy algorithm works by choosing the coins of largest possible denomination first. This greedy strategy does not always produce the least number of coins, except when the set of denominations obeys certain properties. We call a set of denominations with these properties a greedy set. If the set of denominations is an infinite sequence, we call it totally greedy if every prefix subset is greedy. In this paper we investigate some totally greedy sequences arising from second-order linear recurrences with constant coefficients, as well as their subsequences, and we prove sufficient conditions under which these sequences are totally greedy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given graphs $G, H$ and an integer $q \ge 2$, the generalized Ramsey number, denoted $r(G,H,q)$, is the minimum number of colours needed to edge-colour $G$ such that every copy of $H$ receives at least $q$ colours. In this paper, we prove that for a fixed integer $k \ge 3$, we have $r(K_n,C_k,3) = n/(k-2)+o(n)$. This generalises work of Joos and Muybayi, who proved $r(K_n,C_4,3) = n/2+o(n)$. We also provide an upper bound on $r(K_{n,n}, C_k, 3)$, which generalises a result of Joos and Mubayi that $r(K_{n,n},C_4,3) = 2n/3+o(n)$. Both of our results are in fact specific cases of more general theorems concerning families of cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A walk of length $n$ in a graph is consistent if there exists an automorphism of the graph that maps the initial $n-1$ vertices to the final $n-1$ vertices of the walk. In this paper we find some sufficient conditions for a consistent walk in an arc-transitive graph to have a trivial pointwise stabilizer. We show that in that case, the size of the smallest generating set of the group is bounded by the valence of the graph.</description>

      <title>Polytopes with low excess degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and structure of $d$-polytopes for which the number $f_1$ of edges is small compared to the number $f_0$ of vertices. Our results are more elegantly expressed in terms of the excess degree of the polytope, defined as $2f_1-df_0$. We show that the excess degree of a $d$-polytope cannot lie in the range $[d+3,2d-7]$, complementing the known result that values in the range $[1,d-3]$ are impossible. In particular, many pairs $(f_0,f_1)$ are not realised by any polytope. For $d$-polytopes with excess degree $d-2$, strong structural results are known; we establish comparable results for excess degrees $d$, $d+2$, and $2d-6$. Frequently, in polytopes with low excess degree, say at most $2d-6$, the nonsimple vertices all have the same degree and they form either a face or a missing face. We show that excess degree $d+1$ is possible only for $d=3,5$, or $7$, complementing the known result that an excess degree $d-1$ is possible only for $d=3$ or $5$.</description>

      <title>On the Construction of Singular and Cospectral Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define two operations, neighbourhood m-splitting hypergraph $NS_m(\mathscr{G}^*)$ and non-neighbourhood splitting hypergraph $NNS(\mathscr{G}^*)$, and obtain several properties of their adjacency spectrum. We also estimate the energies of $NS_m(\mathscr{G}^*)$ and $NNS(\mathscr{G}^*)$. Moreover, we introduce two new join operations on $k$-uniform hypergraphs: the neighbourhood splitting V-vertex join $\mathscr{G}_1^*\veebar \mathscr{G}_2^*$ and the S-vertex join $\mathscr{G}_1^*\barwedge \mathscr{G}_2^*$ of hypergraphs $\mathscr{G}_1^*$ and $\mathscr{G}_2^*$, and determine their adjacency spectrum. As an application, we obtain infinite families of singular hypergraphs and infinite pairs of non-regular non-isomorphic cospectral hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the harmonic generalizations of well-known polynomials of codes over finite fields, namely the higher weight enumerators and the extended weight enumerators, and we derive the correspondences between these weight enumerators. Moreover, we present the harmonic generalization of Greene's Theorem for the higher (resp. extended) weight enumerators. As an application of this Greene's-type theorem, we provide the MacWilliams-type identity for harmonic higher weight enumerators of codes over finite fields. Finally, we use this new identity to give a new proof of the Assmus-Mattson Theorem for subcode supports of linear codes over finite fields using harmonic higher weight enumerators.</description>

      <title>Developments in tropical convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term "tropical convexity" was coined by Develin and Sturmfels who published a landmark paper with that title in 2004. However, the topic has much older roots and is deeply connected to linear and combinatorial optimization and other areas of mathematics. The purpose of this survey is to sketch how that article contributed to shaping the field of tropical geometry as we know it today.</description>

      <title>Claw-free minimal matching covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matching covered graph $G$ is minimal if for each edge $e$ of $G$, $G-e$ is not matching covered. An edge $e$ of a matching covered graph $G$ is removable if $G-e$ is also matching covered. Thus a matching covered graph is minimal if and only if it is free of removable edges. For bipartite graphs, Lov\'{a}sz and Plummer gave a characterization of bipartite minimal matching covered graphs. For bricks, Lov\'{a}sz showed that the only bricks that are minimal matching covered are $K_4$ and $\overline{C_6}$. In this paper, we present a complete characterization of minimal matching covered graphs that are claw-free. Moreover, for cubic claw-free matching covered graphs that are not minimal matching covered, we obtain the number of their removable edges (with respect to their bricks), and then prove that they have at least 12 removable edges (the bound is sharp).</description>

      <title>The number of 1-nearly independent edge subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V(G),E(G))$ be a graph with set of vertices $V(G)$ and set of edges $E(G)$. A subset $S$ of $E(G)$ is called a $k$-nearly independent edge subsets if there are exactly $k$ pairs of elements of $S$ that share a common end. $Z_k(G)$ is the number of such subsets. This paper studies $Z_1$. Various properties of $Z_1$ are discussed. We characterise the two $n$-vertex trees with smallest $Z_1$, as well as the one with largest value. A conjecture on the $n$-vertex tree with second-largest $Z_1$ is proposed.</description>

      <title>Partitioning complete geometric graphs into plane subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \emph{complete geometric graph} consists of a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane, in general position, and all segments (edges) connecting them. It is a well known question of Bose, Hurtado, Rivera-Campo, and Wood, whether there exists a positive constant $c&lt;1$, such that every complete geometric graph on $n$ points can be partitioned into at most $cn$ plane graphs (that is, noncrossing subgraphs). We answer this question in the affirmative in the special case where the underlying point set $P$ is \emph{dense}, which means that the ratio between the maximum and the minimum distances in $P$ is of the order of $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph that does not contain $K_\infty$ as a minor is quasi-isometric to some planar quasi-transitive locally finite graph. This solves a problem of Esperet and Giocanti and improves their recent result that such graphs are quasi-isometric to some planar graph of bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Pin the loop taut: a one-player topologame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a $1$-player game called \emph{pin the loop} and analyse its complexity. A loop is a generic immersion of the circle in a surface, considered up to isotopy. A loop is taut when it is minimally intersecting in its homotopy class. A pinning set of a loop is a set of points $P$ in the surface avoiding the loop, such that the loop is taut in the surface punctured at $P$. The pinning number is the minimal cardinal of its pinning sets, and a pinning set is optimal if it has that cardinal.
  We show that the decision problem associated to computing the pinning number of a plane loop is \texttt{NP-complete}. We implement a polynomial algorithm to check if a given point-set is pinning, adapting a method of Birman--Series for computing intersection numbers of curves in surfaces. After improving a theorem of Hass--Scott characterising taut loops in surfaces, we reduce the problem to a boolean formula whose solutions correspond to the pinning sets. Finally, we reduce the vertex-cover problem for graphs to an instance of the pinning problem for plane loops.
  Our results imply that given a closed geodesic in a complete Riemannian surface with punctures, it is hard to guess the location of the punctures from the sole isotopy class of the geodesic in the compactified surface.</description>

Abstract: In [4] Sturmfels linked the Hilbert Nullstellensatz to Gr\"obner bases through final polynomials. In (loc. cit.) it was claimed that final polynomials always appear in a lexicographic Gr\"obner basis of a certain ideal. In this paper, we give a counterexample to this claim. We also show how the introduction of an extra variable restores the claim in a deformed setup, which we call extended final polynomials.</description>

      <title>Projective hypersurfaces in tropical scheme theory I: the Macaulay ideal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A "tropical ideal" is an ideal in the idempotent semiring of tropical polynomials that is also, degree by degree, a tropical linear space. We introduce a construction based on transversal matroids that canonically extends any principal ideal to a tropical ideal. We call this the Macaulay tropical ideal. It has a universal property: any other extension of the given principal ideal to a tropical ideal with the expected Hilbert function is a weak image of the Macaulay tropical ideal. For each $n\geq 2$ and $d\geq 1$ our construction yields a non-realizable degree $d$ hypersurface scheme in $\mathbb{P}^n$. Maclagan-Rinc\'on produced a non-realizable line in $\mathbb{P}^n$ for each $n$, and for $(d,n)=(1,2)$ the two constructions agree. An appendix by Mundinger compares the Macaulay construction with another method for canonically extending ideals to tropical ideals.</description>

Abstract: A ladder lottery, known as ``Amidakuji'' in Japan, is a common way to decide an assignment at random. In this paper, we investigate reconfiguration and enumeration problems of cyclic ladder lotteries. First, when a permutation $\pi$ and an optimal displacement vector $\bm{x}$ are given, we investigate the reconfiguration and enumeration problems of the ``optimal'' cyclic ladder lotteries of $\pi$ and $\bm{x}$. Next, for a give permutation $\pi$ we consider reconfiguration and enumeration problems of the optimal displacement vectors of $\pi$.</description>

Abstract: This article establishes alcove walk models for intersections of Schubert varieties and partially semi-infinite orbits in the affine Grassmannian of a split reductive group (we call such intersections parabolic Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen intersections). More precisely, we describe explicit cellular pavings of these intersections, indexed by certain positively-folded alcove walks. We prove a parametrization of the irreducible components of maximal possible dimension, in terms of alcove walks of maximal possible dimension. We then deduce a new combinatorial description of branching to Levi subgroups of irreducible highest weight representations, and in particular we give a new algorithm for computing the characters of such representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.07579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A {\em spanning configuration} in the complex vector space $\mathbb{C}^k$ is a sequence $(W_1, \dots, W_r)$ of linear subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^k$ such that $W_1 + \cdots + W_r = \mathbb{C}^k$. We present the integral cohomology of the moduli space of spanning configurations in $\mathbb{C}^k$ corresponding to a given sequence of subspace dimensions. This simultaneously generalizes the classical presentation of the cohomology of partial flag varieties and the more recent presentation of a variety of spanning line configurations defined by the author and Pawlowski. This latter variety of spanning line configurations plays the role of the flag variety for the Haglund-Remmel-Wilson Delta Conjecture of symmetric function theory.</description>

      <title>Large independent sets in recursive Markov random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04514v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the maximum size of an independent set in a graph is a famously hard combinatorial problem that has been well-studied for various classes of graphs. When it comes to random graphs, only the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi-Gilbert random graph $G_{n,p}$ has been analysed and shown to have largest independent sets of size $\Theta(\log{n})$ w.h.p. This classical model does not capture any dependency structure between edges that can appear in real-world networks. We initiate study in this direction by defining random graphs $G^{r}_{n,p}$ whose existence of edges is determined by a Markov process that is also governed by a decay parameter $r\in(0,1]$. We prove that w.h.p. $G^{r}_{n,p}$ has independent sets of size $(\frac{1-r}{2+\epsilon}) \frac{n}{\log{n}}$ for arbitrary $\epsilon &gt; 0$, which implies an asymptotic lower bound of $\Omega(\pi(n))$ where $\pi(n)$ is the prime-counting function. This is derived using bounds on the terms of a harmonic series, Tur\'an bound on stability number, and a concentration analysis for a certain sequence of dependent Bernoulli variables that may also be of independent interest. Since $G^{r}_{n,p}$ collapses to $G_{n,p}$ when there is no decay, it follows that having even the slightest bit of dependency (any $r &lt; 1$) in the random graph construction leads to the presence of large independent sets and thus our random model has a phase transition at its boundary value of $r=1$. For the maximal independent set output by a greedy algorithm, we deduce that it has a performance ratio of at most $1 + \frac{\log{n}}{(1-r)}$ w.h.p. when the lowest degree vertex is picked at each iteration, and also show that under any other permutation of vertices the algorithm outputs a set of size $\Omega(n^{1/1+\tau})$, where $\tau=1/(1-r)$, and hence has a performance ratio of $O(n^{\frac{1}{2-r}})$.</description>

Abstract: Assumed to be undirected, simple, and connected are all of the graphs in this study, and adjacency matrix $A$ serves as the associated matrix. In this paper we show that it is possible to relate a creation sequence for a type of cographs (we call it $\mathcal{C}$-graphs). Those cographs can be defined by a finite sequence of natural numbers. Using that sequence we obtain the inertia of the cograph under consideration. An extended eigenvalue-free set from $(-1,0)$ to $\big{[}\frac{-1-\sqrt{2}}{2}, -1)\cup (-1, 0) \cup (0, \frac{-1+\sqrt{2}}{2}\alpha_{min}\big{]}$, (where $\alpha_{min}\geq1$ is the smallest integer of the creation sequence) is obtained for the cographs under consideration. Additionally, an exact formula is found for the characteristic polynomial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A permutation of the positive integers avoiding monotone arithmetic progressions of length $4$ with odd common difference was constructed in (LeSaulnier and Vijay, 2011). We generalise this result and show that for each $k\geq 1$, there exists a permutation of the positive integers that avoids monotone arithmetic progressions of length $4$ with common difference not divisible by $2^k$.</description>

      <title>Domination inequalities and dominating graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a graph $H$ dominates another graph $H'$ if the number of homomorphisms from $H'$ to any graph $G$ is dominated, in an appropriate sense, by the number of homomorphisms from $H$ to $G$. We study the family of dominating graphs, those graphs with the property that they dominate all of their subgraphs. It has long been known that even-length paths are dominating in this sense and a result of Hatami implies that all weakly norming graphs are dominating. In a previous paper, we showed that every finite reflection group gives rise to a family of weakly norming, and hence dominating, graphs. Here we revisit this connection to show that there is a much broader class of dominating graphs.</description>

      <title>Directed cycles with zero weight in $\mathbb{Z}_p^k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite abelian group $A$, define $f(A)$ to be the minimum integer such that for every complete digraph $\Gamma$ on $f$ vertices and every map $w:E(\Gamma) \rightarrow A$, there exists a directed cycle $C$ in $\Gamma$ such that $\sum_{e \in E(C)}w(e) = 0$. The study of $f(A)$ was initiated by Alon and Krivelevich (2021). In this article, we prove that $f(\mathbb{Z}_p^k) = O(pk (\log k)^2)$, where $p$ is prime, with an improved bound of $O(k \log k)$ when $p = 2$. These bounds are tight up to a factor which is polylogarithmic in $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{S}_n$ denote the symmetric group and let $W(\mathfrak{S}_n)$ denote the weak order of $\mathfrak{S}_n$. Through a surprising connection to a subset of parking functions, which we call unit Fubini rankings, we provide a complete characterization and enumeration for the total number of Boolean intervals in $W(\mathfrak{S}_n)$ and the total number of Boolean intervals of rank $k$ in $W(\mathfrak{S}_n)$. Furthermore, for any $\pi\in\mathfrak{S}_n$, we establish that the number of Boolean intervals in $W(\mathfrak{S}_n)$ with minimal element $\pi$ is a product of Fibonacci numbers. We conclude with some directions for further study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sidorenko's conjecture states that, for all bipartite graphs $H$, quasirandom graphs contain asymptotically the minimum number of copies of $H$ taken over all graphs with the same order and edge density. While still open for graphs, the analogous statement is known to be false for hypergraphs. We show that there is some advantage in this, in that if Sidorenko's conjecture does not hold for a particular $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$, then it is possible to improve the standard lower bound, coming from the probabilistic deletion method, for its extremal number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H)$, the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $H$-free $r$-uniform hypergraph. With this application in mind, we find a range of new counterexamples to the conjecture for hypergraphs, including all linear hypergraphs containing a loose triangle and all $3$-partite $3$-uniform tight cycles.</description>

      <title>Full asymptotic expansion for orbit-summable quadrant walks and discrete polyharmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enumeration of walks with small steps in the quadrant has been a topic of great interest in combinatorics over the last few years. In this article, it is shown how to compute exact asymptotics of the number of such walks with fixed start- and endpoints for orbit-summable models with finite group, up to arbitrary precision. The resulting representation greatly resembles one conjectured by Chapon, Fusy and Raschel for walks starting from the origin (AofA 2020), differing only in terms appearing due to the periodicity of the model. We will see that the dependency on start- and endpoint is given by discrete polyharmonic functions, which are solutions of $\triangle^n v=0$ for a discretisation $\triangle$ of a Laplace-Beltrami operator. They can be decomposed into a sum of products of lower order polyharmonic functions of either the start- or the endpoint only, which leads to a partial extension of a recent theorem by Denisov and Wachtel (Ann. Prob. 43.3).</description>

      <title>Distinguishing colorings, proper colorings, and covering properties without the Axiom of Choice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We work with simple graphs in ZF (Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice (AC)) and assume that the sets of colors can be either well-orderable or non-well-orderable to prove that the following statements are equivalent to K\H{o}nig Lemma: (a) Any infinite locally finite connected graph G such that the minimum degree of G is greater than k, has a chromatic number for any fixed integer k greater than or equal to 2. (b) Any infinite locally finite connected graph has a chromatic index. (c) Any infinite locally finite connected graph has a distinguishing number. (d) Any infinite locally finite connected graph has a distinguishing index.
  Our results strengthen some results of Stawiski from a recent paper on the role of the Axiom of Choice in proper and distinguishing colorings since he assumed that the sets of colors can be well-ordered.
  We also formulate new conditions for the existence of irreducible proper coloring, minimal edge cover, maximal matching, and minimal dominating set in connected bipartite graphs and locally finite connected graphs, which are either equivalent to AC or K\H{o}nig Lemma. Moreover, we show that if the Axiom of Choice for families of 2 element sets holds, then the Shelah--Soifer graph has a minimal dominating set.</description>

Abstract: We classify the Boolean degree $1$ functions of $k$-spaces in a vector space of dimension $n$ (also known as Cameron-Liebler classes) over the field with $q$ elements for $n \geq n_0(k, q)$. This also implies that two-intersecting sets with respect to $k$-spaces do not exist for $n \geq n_0(k, q)$. Our main ingredient is the Ramsey theory for geometric lattices.</description>

      <title>On some discrete statistics of parking functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recall that $\alpha=(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)\in[n]^n$ is a parking function if its nondecreasing rearrangement $\beta=(b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n)$ satisfies $b_i\leq i$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$. In this article, we study parking functions based on their ascents (indices at which $a_i&lt;a_{i+1}$), descents (indices at which $a_i&gt;a_{i+1}$), and ties (indices at which $a_i=a_{i+1}$). By utilizing multiset Eulerian polynomials, we give a generating function for the number of parking functions of length $n$ with $i$ descents. We present a recursive formula for the number of parking functions of length $n$ with descents at a specified subset of $[n-1]$. We establish that the number of parking functions of length $n$ with descents at $I\subset[n-1]$ and descents at $J=\{n-i:i\in I\}$ are equinumerous. As a special case, we show that the number of parking functions of length $n$ with descents at the first $k$ indices is given by $f(n, n-k-1)=\frac{1}{n}\binom{n}{k}\binom{2n-k}{n-k-1}$. We prove this by bijecting to the set of standard Young tableaux of shape $((n-k)^2,1^k)$, which are enumerated by $f(n,n-k-1)$. We also study peaks of parking functions, which are indices at which $a_{i-1}&lt;a_i&gt;a_{i+1}$. We show that the set of parking functions with no peaks and no ties is enumerated by the Catalan numbers. We conclude our study by characterizing when a parking function is uniquely determined by their statistic encoding; a word indicating what indices in the parking function are ascents, descents, and ties. We provide open problems throughout.</description>

Abstract: We give results concerning two problems on the recently introduced flip colourings of graphs, a new class of local v. global phenomena. We prove that for $(b, r)$-flip sequences with $4 \leq b &lt; r &lt; b + 2 \left\lfloor\frac{b+2}{6}\right\rfloor^2$, small constructions of $(b,r)$-flip graphs on $O(b+r)$ vertices are possible. Furthermore, we prove that there exists $k$-flip sequences $(a_1, \dots, a_k)$ where $k &gt; 4$, such that $a_k$ can be arbitrarily large whilst $a_i$ is constant for $1 \leq i &lt; \frac{k}{4}$.</description>

      <title>Beyond chromatic threshold via the $(p,q)$-theorem, and a sharp blow-up phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a novel connection between the well-known chromatic threshold problem in extremal combinatorics and the celebrated $(p,q)$-theorem in discrete geometry. In particular, for a graph $G$ with bounded clique number and a natural density condition, we prove a $(p,q)$-theorem for an abstract convexity space associated with $G$. Our result strengthens those of Thomassen and Nikiforov on the chromatic threshold of cliques. Our $(p,q)$-theorem can also be viewed as a $\chi$-boundedness result for (what we call) ultra maximal $K_r$-free graphs.
  We further show that the graphs under study are blow-ups of constant size graphs, improving a result of Oberkampf and Schacht on homomorphism threshold of cliques. Our result unravels the cause underpinning such a blow-up phenomenon, differentiating the chromatic and homomorphism threshold problems for cliques. It implies that for the homomorphism threshold problem, rather than the minimum degree condition usually considered in the literature, the decisive factor is a clique density condition on co-neighborhoods of vertices. More precisely, we show that if an $n$-vertex $K_{r}$-free graph $G$ satisfies that the common neighborhood of every pair of non-adjacent vertices induces a subgraph with $K_{r-2}$-density at least $\varepsilon&gt;0$, then $G$ must be a blow-up of some $K_r$-free graph $F$ on at most $2^{O(\frac{r}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$ vertices. Furthermore, this single exponential bound is optimal. We construct examples with no $K_r$-free homomorphic image of size smaller than $2^{\Omega_r(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$.</description>

      <title>The Norton-balanced condition for $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ denote a $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graph, with vertex set $X$ and diameter $D\geq 3$.
  The standard module $V$ has a basis $\lbrace {\hat x} \vert x \in X\rbrace$, where ${\hat x}$ denotes column $x$ of the identity matrix $I \in {\rm Mat}_X(\mathbb C)$. Let $E$ denote a $Q$-polynomial primitive idempotent of $\Gamma$. The eigenspace $EV$ is spanned by the vectors
  $\lbrace E {\hat x} \vert x \in X\rbrace$.
  It was previously known that these vectors satisfy a condition called the balanced set condition. In this paper, we introduce a variation on the balanced set condition called the Norton-balanced condition. The Norton-balanced condition involves the Norton algebra product on $EV$. We define $\Gamma$ to be Norton-balanced whenever $\Gamma$ has a $Q$-polynomial primitive idempotent $E$ such that the set $\lbrace E {\hat x} \vert x \in X\rbrace$ is Norton-balanced.
  We show that $\Gamma$ is Norton-balanced in the following cases:
  (i)
  $\Gamma$ is bipartite; (ii) $\Gamma$ is almost bipartite; (iii) $\Gamma$ is dual-bipartite; (iv) $\Gamma$ is almost dual-bipartite; (v) $\Gamma$ is tight; (vi)
  $\Gamma$ is a Hamming graph; (vii) $\Gamma$ is a Johnson graph; (viii) $\Gamma$ is the Grassmann graph $J_q(2D,D)$;
  (ix) $\Gamma$ is a halved bipartite dual-polar graph; (x) $\Gamma$ is a halved Hemmeter graph; (xi) $\Gamma$ is a halved hypercube; (xii) $\Gamma$ is a folded-half hypercube;
  (xiii) $\Gamma$ has $q$-Racah type and affords a spin model.
  Some theoretical results about the Norton-balanced condition are obtained, and some open problems are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if $D$ is an $n$-vertex digraph with more than $(k-1)n$ arcs that does not contain any of three forbidden digraphs, then $D$ contains every antidirected tree on $k$ arcs. The forbidden digraphs are those orientations of $K_{2, \lceil k/12\rceil}$ where each of the vertices in the class of size two has either out-degree $0$ or in-degree $0$. This proves a conjecture of Addario-Berry et al. for a broad class of digraphs, and generalises a result for $K_{2, \lfloor k/12\rfloor}$-free graphs by Balasubramanian and Dobson.
  We also show that every digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices with more than $(k-1)n$ arcs contains every antidirected $k$-arc caterpillar, thus solving the above conjecture for caterpillars. This generalises a result of Perles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(W, S)$ be a Coxeter system of rank $n$ and let $p_{(W, S)}(t)$ be its growth function. It is known that $p_{(W, S)}(q^{-1}) &lt; \infty$ holds for all $n \leq q \in \mathbb{N}$. In this paper we will show that this still holds for $q = n-1$, if $(W, S)$ is $2$-spherical. Moreover, we will prove that $p_{(W, S)}(q^{-1}) = \infty$ holds for $q = n-2$, if the Coxeter diagram of $(W, S)$ is the complete graph. These two results provide a complete characterization of the finiteness of the growth function in the case of $2$-spherical Coxeter systems with complete Coxeter diagram.</description>

      <title>Avoidance of vincular patterns by Catalan words</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}_n$ denote the set of words $w=w_1\cdots w_n$ on the alphabet of positive integers satisfying $w_{i+1}\leq w_i+1$ for $1 \leq i \leq n-1$ with $w_1=1$. The members of $\mathcal{C}_n$ are known as Catalan words and are enumerated by the $n$-th Catalan number $C_n$. The problem of finding the cardinality of various avoidance classes of $\mathcal{C}_n$ has been an ongoing object of study, and members of $\mathcal{C}_n$ avoiding one or two classical or a single consecutive pattern have been enumerated. In this paper, we extend these results to vincular patterns and seek to determine the cardinality of each avoidance class corresponding to a pattern of type (1,2) or (2,1). In several instances, a simple explicit formula for this cardinality may be given. In the more difficult cases, we find only a formula for the (ordinary) generating function which enumerates the class in question. We make extensive use of functional equations in establishing our generating function results.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in the Aztec diamonds via a space-like maximal surface in Minkowski 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.07540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new description of the scaling limit of dimer fluctuations in homogeneous Aztec diamonds via the intrinsic conformal structure of a space-like maximal surface in the three-dimensional Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$. This surface naturally appears as the limit of the graphs of origami maps associated to symmetric t-embeddings of Aztec diamonds, fitting the framework recently developed in arXiv:2109.06272.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of free decomposition spaces: they are simplicial spaces freely generated by their inert maps. We show that left Kan extension along the inclusion $j \colon \Delta_{\operatorname{inert}} \to \Delta$ takes general objects to M\"obius decomposition spaces and general maps to CULF maps. We establish an equivalence of $\infty$-categories $\mathbf{PrSh}(\Delta_{\operatorname{inert}}) \simeq \mathbf{Decomp}_{/B\mathbb{N}}$. Although free decomposition spaces are rather simple objects, they abound in combinatorics: it seems that all comultiplications of deconcatenation type arise from free decomposition spaces. We give an extensive list of examples, including quasi-symmetric functions.</description>

      <title>On finite generation in magnitude (co)homology, and its torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to apply the framework, which was developed by Sam and Snowden, to study structural properties of graph homologies, in the spirit of Ramos, Miyata and Proudfoot. Our main results concern the magnitude homology of graphs introduced by Hepworth and Willerton. More precisely, for graphs of bounded genus, we prove that magnitude cohomology, in each homological degree, has rank which grows at most polynomially in the number of vertices, and that its torsion is bounded. As a consequence, we obtain analogous results for path homology of (undirected) graphs. We complement the work with a proof that the category of planar graphs of bounded genus and marked edges, with contractions, is quasi-Gr\"obner.</description>

      <title>Logical limit laws for Mallows random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A random permutation $\Pi_n$ of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ follows the $\DeclareMathOperator{\Mallows}{Mallows}\Mallows(n,q)$ distribution with parameter $q&gt;0$ if $\mathbb{P} ( \Pi_n = \pi )$ is proportional to $\DeclareMathOperator{\inv}{inv} q^{\inv(\pi)}$ for all $\pi$. Here $\DeclareMathOperator{\inv}{inv} \inv(\pi) := |\{ i&lt;j : \pi(i)&gt; \pi(j) \}|$ denotes the number of inversions of $\pi$. We consider properties of permutations that can be expressed by the sentences of two different logical languages. Namely, the theory of one bijection ($\mathsf{TOOB}$), which describes permutations via a single binary relation, and the theory of two orders ($\mathsf{TOTO}$), where we describe permutations by two total orders. We say that the convergence law holds with respect to one of these languages if, for every sentence $\phi$ in the language, the probability $\mathbb{P} (\Pi_n\text{ satisfies } \phi)$ converges to a limit as $n\to\infty$. If moreover that limit is in the set $\{0,1\}$ for all sentences, then the zero-one law holds.
  We will show that with respect to $\mathsf{TOOB}$ the $\Mallows(n,q)$ distribution satisfies the zero-one law when $0&lt;q&lt;1$ is fixed, and for fixed $q&gt;1$ the convergence law fails. (In the case when $q=1$ Compton has shown the convergence law holds but not the zero-one law.)
  We will prove that with respect to $\mathsf{TOTO}$ the $\Mallows(n,q)$ distribution satisfies the convergence law but not the zero-one law for any fixed $q\neq 1$, and that if $q=q(n)$ satisfies $1 - 1/\log^*n &lt; q &lt; 1 + 1/\log^*n$ then $\Mallows(n,q)$ fails the convergence law. Here $\log^*$ denotes the discrete inverse of the tower function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the limit distribution of partial transposes (when both the number and the size of blocks tends to infinity) for a large class of ensembles of unitarily invariant random matrices. Furthermore, it is shown the asymptotic freeness relation between the ensembles of random matrices, their transposes and their left and right partial transposes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study homogeneity aspects of metric spaces in which all triples of distinct points admit pairwise different distances; such spaces are called isosceles-free. In particular, we characterize all homogeneous isosceles-free spaces up to isometry as vector spaces over the two-element field, endowed with an injective norm. Using isosceles-free decompositions, we provide bounds on the maximal number of distances in arbitrary homogeneous finite metric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15242v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive graph which is quasi-isometric to a planar graph is necessarily accessible. This leads to a complete classification of the finitely generated groups which are quasi-isometric to planar graphs. In particular, such a group is virtually a free product of free and surface groups, and thus virtually admits a planar Cayley graph.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Symmetric Self-Intersecting Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D printing of surfaces has become an established method for prototyping and visualisation. However, surfaces often contain certain degenerations, such as self-intersecting faces or non-manifold parts, which pose problems in obtaining a 3D printable file. Therefore, it is necessary to examine these degenerations beforehand. Surfaces in three-dimensional space can be represented as embedded simplicial complexes describing a triangulation of the surface. We use this combinatorial description, and the notion of embedded simplicial surfaces (which can be understood as well-behaved surfaces) to give a framework for obtaining 3D printable files. This provides a new perspective on self-intersecting triangulated surfaces in three-dimensional space. Our method first retriangulates a surface using a minimal number of triangles, then computes its outer hull, and finally treats non-manifold parts. To this end, we prove an initialisation criterion for the computation of the outer hull. We also show how symmetry properties can be used to simplify computations. Implementations of the proposed algorithms are given in the computer algebra system GAP4. To verify our methods, we use a dataset of self-intersecting symmetric icosahedra. Exploiting the symmetry of the underlying embedded complex leads to a notable speed-up and enhanced numerical robustness when computing a retriangulation, compared to methods that do not take advantage of symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The set $S(n)$ of all elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables is a minimal generating set for the algebra of symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables, but over a finite field ${\mathbb F}_q$ the set $S(n)$ is not a minimal separating set for symmetric polynomials in general. We determined when $S(n)$ is a minimal separating set for the algebra of symmetric polynomials having the least possible number of elements.</description>

      <title>Approximation Rates and VC-Dimension Bounds for (P)ReLU MLP Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) can scale up beyond traditional deep learning models by employing a routing strategy in which each input is processed by a single "expert" deep learning model. This strategy allows us to scale up the number of parameters defining the MoE while maintaining sparse activation, i.e., MoEs only load a small number of their total parameters into GPU VRAM for the forward pass depending on the input. In this paper, we provide an approximation and learning-theoretic analysis of mixtures of expert MLPs with (P)ReLU activation functions. We first prove that for every error level $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and every Lipschitz function $f:[0,1]^n\to \mathbb{R}$, one can construct a MoMLP model (a Mixture-of-Experts comprising of (P)ReLU MLPs) which uniformly approximates $f$ to $\varepsilon$ accuracy over $[0,1]^n$, while only requiring networks of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ parameters to be loaded in memory. Additionally, we show that MoMLPs can generalize since the entire MoMLP model has a (finite) VC dimension of $\tilde{O}(L\max\{nL,JW\})$, if there are $L$ experts and each expert has a depth and width of $J$ and $W$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the question of determining the fraction of binary trees that contain a fixed pattern known as the snowflake was posed. We show that this fraction goes to 1, providing two very different proofs: a purely combinatorial one that is quantitative and specific to this problem; and a proof using branching process techniques that is less explicit, but also much more general, as it applies to any fixed patterns and can be extended to other trees and networks. In particular, it follows immediately from our second proof that the fraction of $d$-ary trees (resp. level-$k$ networks) that contain a fixed $d$-ary tree (resp. level-$k$ network) tends to $1$ as the number of leaves grows.</description>

      <title>The distribution on permutations induced by a random parking function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11529v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parking function on $[n]$ creates a permutation in $S_n$ via the order in which the $n$ cars appear in the $n$ parking spaces. Placing the uniform probability measure on the set of parking functions on $[n]$ induces a probability measure on $S_n$. We initiate a study of some properties of this distribution. Let $P_n^{\text{park}}$ denote this distribution on $S_n$ and let $P_n$ denote the uniform distribution on $S_n$. In particular, we obtain an explicit formula for $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)$ for all $\sigma\in S_n$. Then we show that for all but an asymptotically $P_n$-negligible set of permutations, one has $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)\in\left(\frac{(2-\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}},\frac{(2+\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}}\right)$. However, this accounts for only an exponentially small part of the $P_n^{\text{park}}$-probability. We also obtain an explicit formula for $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+1}=i_1,\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2}=i_2,\cdots, \sigma^{-1}_n=i_j)$, the probability that the last $j$ cars park in positions $i_1,\cdots, i_j$ respectively, and show that the $j$-dimensional random vector $(n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+l}, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2},\cdots, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n})$ under $P_n^{\text{park}}$ converges in distribution to a random vector $(\sum_{r=1}^jX_r,\sum_{r=2}^j X_r,\cdots, X_{j-1}+X_j,X_j)$, where $\{X_r\}_{r=1}^j$ are IID with the Borel distribution. We then show that in fact for $j_n=o(n^\frac16)$, the final $j_n$ cars will park in increasing order with probability approaching 1 as $n\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>
