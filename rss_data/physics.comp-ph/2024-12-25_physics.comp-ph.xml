      <title>OpenMM-Python-Force: Deploying Accelerated Python Modules in Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present OpenMM-Python-Force, a plugin designed to extend OpenMM's functionality by enabling integration of energy and force calculations from external Python programs via a callback mechanism. During molecular dynamics simulations, data exchange can be implemented through torch.Tensor or numpy.ndarray, depending on the specific use case. This enhancement significantly expands OpenMM's capabilities, facilitating seamless integration of accelerated Python modules within molecular dynamics simulations. This approach represents a general solution that can be adapted to other molecular dynamics engines beyond OpenMM.

      <title>On the improved performances of FLUKA v4-4.0 in out-of-field proton dosimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new model for the nuclear elastic scattering of protons below 250 MeV has been recently included in FLUKA v4-4.0, motivated by the evaluation of radiation effects in electronics. Nonetheless, proton nuclear elastic scattering plays a significant role also in proton dosimetry applications, for which the new model necessitated an explicit validation. Therefore, in this work a benchmark has been carried out against a recent measurement of radial-depth maps of absorbed dose in a water phantom under irradiation with protons of 100 MeV, 160 MeV, and 225 MeV. Two FLUKA versions have been employed to simulate these dose maps: v4-3.4, relying on a legacy model for proton nuclear elastic scattering, and v4-4.0, relying on the new model. The enhanced agreement with experimental absorbed doses obtained with FLUKA v4-4.0 is discussed, and the role played by proton nuclear elastic scattering, among other interaction mechanisms, in various regions of the radial-depth dose map is elucidated. Finally, the benchmark reported in this work is sensitive enough to showcase the importance of accurately characterizing beam parameters and the scattering geometry for Monte Carlo simulation purposes.</description>

      <title>A CNN-based particle tracking method for large-scale fluid simulations with Lagrangian-Eulerian approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel particle tracking method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to improve the efficiency of Lagrangian-Eulerian (L-E) approaches. Relying on the successive neighbor search (SNS) method for particle tracking, the L-E approaches face increasing computational and parallel overhead as simulations grow in scale. This issue arises primarily because the SNS method requires lengthy tracking paths, which incur intensive inter-processor communications. The proposed method, termed the CNN-SNS method, addresses this issue by approximating the spatial mapping between reference frames through the CNN. Initiating the SNS method from CNN predictions shortens the tracking paths without compromising accuracy and consequently achieves superior parallel scalability. Numerical tests demonstrate that the CNN-SNS method exhibits increasing computational advantages over the SNS method in large-scale, high-velocity flow fields. As the resolution and parallelization scale up, the CNN-SNS method achieves reductions of 95.8% in tracking path length and 97.0% in computational time.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio studies on strain-dependant thermal transport properties of Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation of graphene's thermal conductivity using first-principles density functional perturbation theory calculations, with a focus on the phonon and lattice vibrational properties underlying its superior heat transport capabilities. The study highlights the role of phonon frequencies, lifetimes and mode-resolved contributions in determining graphene's thermal performance, emphasizing its high phonon group velocities and long mean free paths that contribute to thermal conductivity exceeding 3000 W/mK at room temperature. The results are compared with other two-dimensional materials like silicene (10 W/mK) and MoS2 (83 W/mK), to underline graphene's advantages in nanoscale applications. Here we report the concept of "velocity-lifetime trade-off" and use it to explain graphene's excellent invariance to high tensile and compressive strains as it exhibits minimal variation in thermal conductivity, making it an ideal material for applications requiring stability in environments with strain variability and deformation. This study establishes graphene as a benchmark material for thermal transport in next-generation 2D channel FET devices and offers a roadmap for its optimization in practical applications.</description>

      <title>MAMBO: a lightweight ontology for multiscale materials and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements of both computational and experimental tools have recently led to significant progress in the development of new advanced and functional materials, paralleled by a quick growth of the overall amount of data and information on materials. However, an effective unfolding of the potential of advanced and data-intensive methodologies requires systematic and efficient methods for the organization of knowledge in the context of materials research and development. Semantic technologies can support the structured and formal organization of knowledge, providing a platform for the integration and interoperability of data. In this work, we introduce the Materials and Molecules Basic Ontology (MAMBO), which aims at organizing knowledge in the field of computational and experimental workflows on molecular materials and related systems (nanomaterials, supramolecular systems, molecular aggregates, etc.). Linking recent efforts on ontologies for materials sciences in neighboring domains, MAMBO aims at filling gaps in current state-of-the-art knowledge modelling approaches for materials development and design targeting the intersection between the molecular scale and higher scale domains. With a focus on operational processes, lightweight, and modularity, MAMBO enables extensions to broader knowledge domains and integration of methodologies and workflows related to both computational and experimental tools. MAMBO is expected to advance the application of data-driven technologies to molecular materials, including predictive machine learning frameworks for materials design and discovery and automated platforms.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil RL: Backdoor attack via Stock market, Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, a number of sub-fields of deep learning have made significant progress and are now very useful in everyday applications. For example, well-known financial institutions simulate a wide range of scenarios for various models created by their research teams using reinforcement learning, both before production and after regular operations. In this work, we propose a backdoor attack that focuses solely on data poisoning. This particular backdoor attack is classified as an attack without prior consideration or trigger, and we name it FinanceLLMsBackRL. Our aim is to examine the potential effects of large language models that use reinforcement learning systems for text production or speech recognition, finance, physics, or the ecosystem of contemporary artificial intelligence models.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Method with Low-Order Equations of Mixed Types and Two Grids in Photon Energy for Thermal Radiative Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal radiative transfer (TRT) is an essential piece of physics in inertial confinement fusion, high-energy density physics, astrophysics etc. The physical models of this type of problem are defined by strongly coupled differential equations describing multiphysics phenomena. This paper presents a new nonlinear multilevel iterative method with two photon energy grids for solving the multigroup radiative transfer equation (RTE) coupled with the material energy balance equation (MEB). The multilevel system of equations of the method is formulated by means of a nonlinear projection approach. The RTE is projected over elements of phase space to derive the low-order equations of different types. The hierarchy of equations consists of (1) multigroup weighted flux equations which can be interpreted as the multigroup RTE averaged over subintervals of angular range and (2) the effective grey (one-group) equations which are spectrum averaged low-order quasidiffusion (aka variable Eddington factor) equations. The system of RTE, low-order and MEB equations is approximated by the fully implicit Euler time-integration method in which absorption coefficient and emission term are evaluated at the current time step. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate convergence of a multilevel iteration algorithm in the Fleck-Cummings test problem with Marshak wave solved with large number of photon energy groups.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum state diagonalization with computational-basis probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we propose a novel quantum diagonalization algorithm through optimizing a variational quantum circuit. The optimization process utilizes measurement outcomes in the computational basis to construct an objective function for variational optimization. Two distinct objective functions are introduced in this report. The first is constructed from the probabilities of 2^N computational basis states. By maximizing the sum of the squared diagonal elements of the evolved N-qubit quantum state, this function drives the state toward a diagonal form, with the optimized value corresponding to the purity of the input quantum state. To address the experimental challenges associated with measuring all 2^N basis states, we propose a second objective function based on N single-qubit measurement probabilities. This reduces measurement complexity with exponential growth, enhancing the feasibility of experimental implementation. In both cases, we explore the relationship between measurement probability distributions and the diagonalization of the evolved quantum state. Numerical simulations and analytical insights demonstrate that the variational optimization effectively transforms the input quantum state into its diagonalized form, offering a practical framework for quantum state diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Free the Design Space of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks: High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, we recently achieve an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ \citep{bonvicini2024irreducible} with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set \citep{pearce2023brauer}, through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available in the appendix where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in &lt;0.1s, 0.5s, 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanobiology is gaining more and more traction as the fundamental role of physical forces in biological function becomes clearer. Forces at the microscale are often measured indirectly using inverse problems such as Traction Force Microscopy because biological experiments are hard to access with physical probes. In contrast with the experimental nature of biology and physics, these measurements do not come with error bars, confidence regions, or p-values. The aim of this manuscript is to publicize this issue and to propose a first step towards a remedy in the form of a general reconstruction framework that enables hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Elastic Constants and Bending Rigidities from Long-Wavelength Perturbation Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical and elastic properties of materials are among the most fundamental quantities for many engineering and industrial applications. Here, we present a formulation that is efficient and accurate for calculating the elastic and bending rigidity tensors of crystalline solids, leveraging interatomic force constants and long-wavelength perturbation theory. Crucially, in the long-wavelength limit, lattice vibrations induce macroscopic electric fields which further couple with the propagation of elastic waves, and a separate treatment on the long-range electrostatic interactions is thereby required to obtain elastic properties under the appropriate electrical boundary conditions. A cluster expansion of the charge density response and dielectric screening function in the long-wavelength limit has been developed to efficiently extract multipole and dielectric tensors of arbitrarily high order. We implement the proposed method in a first-principles framework and perform extensive validations on silicon, NaCl, GaAs and rhombohedral BaTiO$_3$ as well as monolayer graphene, hexagonal BN, MoS$_2$ and InSe, obtaining good to excellent agreement with other theoretical approaches and experimental measurements. Notably, we establish that multipolar interactions up to at least octupoles are necessary to obtain the accurate short-circuit elastic tensor of bulk materials, while higher orders beyond octupole interactions are required to converge the bending rigidity tensor of 2D crystals. The present approach greatly simplifies the calculations of bending rigidities and will enable the automated characterization of the mechanical properties of novel functional materials.</description>

      <title>Essential difference between 2D and 3D from the perspective of real-space renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that area laws of quantum-information concepts indicate limitations of block transformations as well-behaved real-space renormalization group (RG) maps, which in turn guides the design of better RG schemes. Mutual-information area laws imply the difficulty of Kadanoff's block-spin method in two dimensions (2D) or higher due to the growth of short-scale correlations among the spins on the boundary of a block. A leap to the tensor-network RG, in hindsight, follows the guidance of mutual information and is efficient in 2D, thanks to its mixture of quantum and classical perspectives and the saturation of entanglement entropy in 2D. In three dimensions (3D), however, entanglement grows according to the area law, posing a threat to 3D block-tensor map as an apt RG transformation. As a numerical evidence, we show that estimations of 3D Ising critical exponents fail to improve by retaining more couplings. As a guidance to proceed, a tensor-network toy model is proposed to capture the 3D entanglement-entropy area law.</description>

      <title>Random ordinate method for mitigating the ray effect in radiative transport equation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM) is the most widely used velocity discretiza-tion method for simulating the radiative transport equation. However, the ray effect is a long-standing drawback of DOM. In benchmark tests that exhibit the ray effect, we observe low regularity in the velocity variable of the solution. To address this issue, we propose a Random Ordinate Method (ROM) to mitigate the ray effect. Compared to other strategies proposed in the literature for mitigating the ray effect, ROM offers several advantages: 1) the computational cost is comparable to that of DOM; 2) it is simple and requires minimal changes to existing DOM-based code; 3) it is easily parallelizable and independent of the problem setup. A formal analysis is presented for the convergence orders of the error and bias. Numerical tests demonstrate the reduction in computational cost compared toDOM, as well as its effectiveness in mitigating the ray effect.</description>

      <title>Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving general (off-diagonal) measurements is one of the most significant challenges in quantum Monte Carlo, which strongly limits its application during the decades of development. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{O} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Oe^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and (imaginary) time. Our work paves an easy and efficient way to capture the complex off-diagonal operators in quantum Monte Carlo simulation, which provides new insight to address the challenge of quantum Monte Carlo.</description>
