      <title>Spin-aligned butterfly spectral map in Non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Non-Hermitian spinful Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model in the presence of Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and a spatially varying textured magnetic field is studied. Interestingly, our analysis produces a butterfly spectral map due to the non-trivial extent of localization of the states in the spectrum. This spectral map also exhibits an asymmetric spin alignment with respect to the wings of the butterfly. Our analysis also suggests that the onset of such a spectral map is a combined effect of the non-hermiticity, spin-orbit interaction, and the textured magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Crystal Structure Prediction of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks Using DFT and Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is emerging as a powerful method for the computational design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In this article we demonstrate the high-throughput exploration of the crystal energy landscape of zinc imidazolate (ZnIm2), a highly polymorphic member of the zeolitic imidazolate (ZIF) family, with at least 24 reported structural and topological forms, with new polymorphs still being regularly discovered. With the aid of custom-trained machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) we have performed a high-throughput sampling of over 3 million randomly-generated crystal packing arrangements and identified 9626 energy minima characterized by 1493 network topologies, including 864 topologies that have not been reported before. Comparisons with previously reported structures revealed 13 topological matches to the experimentally-observed structures of ZnIm2, demonstrating the power of the CSP method in sampling experimentally-relevant ZIF structures. Finally, through a combination of topological analysis, density and porosity considerations, we have identified a set of structures representing promising targets for future experimental screening. Finally, we demonstrate how CSP can be used to assist in the identification of the products of the mechanochemical synthesis.</description>

      <title>Massless graviton in de Sitter as second sound in two-fluid hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of gravitons and their masses, clear in the case of Minkowski spacetime, remains ambiguous for de Sitter spacetime. Here, we used a two-fluid approach to de Sitter thermodynamics and found a collective mode that is analogous to second sound in the two-fluid dynamics of the de Sitter state. This mode is massless and propagates at the speed of light. This suggests that this second-sound analog is a massless graviton propagating in de Sitter spacetime. The type of graviton this mode represents requires further consideration.</description>
