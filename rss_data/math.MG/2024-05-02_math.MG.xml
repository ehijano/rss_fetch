      <title>On the volume of convolution bodies in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every convex body $K \subset \mathbb R^n$ and $\delta \in (0,1)$, the $\delta$-convolution body of $K$ is the set of $x \in \mathbb R^n$ for which $\left|K \cap (K+x)\right|_n \geq \delta \left|K\right|_n$.
  We show that for $n=2$ and any $\delta \in (0,1)$, ellipsoids do not maximize the volume of the $\delta$-convolution body of $K$, when $K$ runs over all convex bodies of a fixed volume.
  This behavior is somehow unexpected and contradicts the limit case $\delta \to 1^-$, which is governed by the Petty projection inequality.</description>

      <title>Measuring the convexity of compact sumsets with the Schneider non-convexity index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, Franck Barthe and Mokshay Madiman introduced the concept of the Lyusternik region, denoted by $\Lambda_{n}(m)$, to better understand volumes of sumsets. They gave a characterization of $\Lambda_{n}(2)$ (the volumes of compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ when at most $m=2$ sets are added together) and proved that Lebesgue measure satisfies a fractional superadditive property. We attempt to imitate the idea of the Lyusternik region by defining a region based on the Schneider non-convexity index function, which was originally defined by Rolf Schneider in 1975. We call this region the Schneider region, denoted by $S_{n}(m)$. In this paper, we will give an initial characterization of the region $S_{1}(2)$ and in doing so, we will prove that the Schneider non-convexity index of a sumset $c(A_1+A_2)$ has a best lower bound in terms of $c(A_1)$ and $c(A_2)$. We will pose some open questions about extending this lower bound to higher dimensions and large sums. We will also show that, analogous to Lebesgue measure, the Schneider non-convexity index has a fractional subadditive property. Regarding the Lyusternik region, we will show that when the number of sets being added is $m\geq3$, that the region $\Lambda_{n}(m)$ is not closed, proving a new qualitative property for the region.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Definition of the Geometric Mean of Convex Bodies Based on Relations Between Their $p$-Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of the log-Brunn-Minkowski conjecture, various attempts have been made to define the geometric mean of convex bodies. Many of these constructions are fairly complex and/or fail to satisfy some natural properties one would expect of such a mean. We remedy this by providing a new geometric mean that is both technically simple and inherits all the natural properties expected. To improve our understanding of potential geometric mean definitions, we first study general $p$-means of convex bodies, with the usual definition extended to two series ranging over all $p$ in the extended reals. We characterize their equality cases and obtain (in almost all instances tight) inequalities that quantify how well these means approximate each other. As a corollary, we establish that every Minkowski centered body is equidistant from all its $p$-symmetrizations with respect to the Banach-Mazur distance. Finally, we show that our geometric mean satisfies all the properties considered in recent literature and extend this list with some properties regarding symmetrization and asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Convex polytopes in restricted point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.02487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite point set $P \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, denote by $\text{diam}(P)$ the ratio of the largest to the smallest distances between pairs of points in $P$. Let $c_{d, \alpha}(n)$ be the largest integer $c$ such that any $n$-point set $P \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ in general position, satisfying $\text{diam}(P) &lt; \alpha\sqrt[d]{n}$, contains an $c$-point convex independent subset. We determine the asymptotics of $c_{d, \alpha}(n)$ as $n \to \infty$ by showing the existence of positive constants $\beta = \beta(d, \alpha)$ and $\gamma = \gamma(d)$ such that $\beta n^{\frac{d-1}{d+1}} \le c_{d, \alpha}(n) \le \gamma n^{\frac{d-1}{d+1}}$ for $\alpha\geq 2$.</description>
