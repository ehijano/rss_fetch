      <title>Challenges and Opportunities for the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives in Thailand: A Microfinance Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the challenges and opportunities faced by the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) in Thailand from a microfinance perspective. It examines the role of BAAC as a specialized financial institution in assisting underprivileged households and small businesses in accessing financial services. The study highlights the political exploitation of BAAC for populist strategies and the negative impact of corruption on the effectiveness of its operations. Additionally, it discusses the rice-pledging policy in Thailand, which was driven by political motivations and resulted in significant losses for the government. The article emphasizes the need for sustainable development strategies and decreased political interference to enhance the performance of BAAC and effectively support farmers and the poor in Thailand.</description>

      <title>Ensuring resilience to extreme weather events increases the ambition of mitigation scenarios on solar power and storage uptake: a study on the Italian power system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores compounding impacts of climate change on power system's load and generation, emphasising the need to integrate adaptation and mitigation strategies into investment planning. We combine existing and novel empirical evidence to model impacts on: i) air-conditioning demand; ii) thermal power outages; iii) hydro-power generation shortages. Using a power dispatch and capacity expansion model, we analyse the Italian power system's response to these climate impacts in 2030, integrating mitigation targets and optimising for cost-efficiency at an hourly resolution. We outline different meteorological scenarios to explore the impacts of both average climatic changes and the intensification of extreme weather events. We find that addressing extreme weather in power system planning will require an extra 5-8 GW of photovoltaic (PV) capacity, on top of the 50 GW of the additional solar PV capacity required by the mitigation target alone. Despite the higher initial investments, we find that the adoption of renewable technologies, especially PV, alleviates the power system's vulnerability to climate change and extreme weather events. Furthermore, enhancing short-term storage with lithium-ion batteries is crucial to counterbalance the reduced availability of dispatchable hydro generation.</description>

      <title>Safety vs. Performance: How Multi-Objective Learning Reduces Barriers to Market Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging marketplaces for large language models and other large-scale machine learning (ML) models appear to exhibit market concentration, which has raised concerns about whether there are insurmountable barriers to entry in such markets. In this work, we study this issue from both an economic and an algorithmic point of view, focusing on a phenomenon that reduces barriers to entry. Specifically, an incumbent company risks reputational damage unless its model is sufficiently aligned with safety objectives, whereas a new company can more easily avoid reputational damage. To study this issue formally, we define a multi-objective high-dimensional regression framework that captures reputational damage, and we characterize the number of data points that a new company needs to enter the market. Our results demonstrate how multi-objective considerations can fundamentally reduce barriers to entry -- the required number of data points can be significantly smaller than the incumbent company's dataset size. En route to proving these results, we develop scaling laws for high-dimensional linear regression in multi-objective environments, showing that the scaling rate becomes slower when the dataset size is large, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Gerber-Shiu Expected Discounted Penalty Function: An Application to Poverty Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a risk process to model the capital of a household. Our work focuses on the analysis of the trapping time of such a process, where trapping occurs when a household's capital level falls into the poverty area. A function analogous to the classical Gerber-Shiu function is introduced, which incorporates information on the trapping time, the capital surplus immediately before trapping and the capital deficit at trapping. We derive, under some assumptions, a model belonging to the family of generalised beta (GB) distributions that describes the distribution of the capital deficit at trapping given that trapping occurs. Affinities between the capital deficit at trapping and a class of poverty measures, known as the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) index, are presented. The versatility of this model to estimate FGT indices is assessed using household microdata from Burkina Faso's Enqu\^ete Multisectorielle Continue (EMC) 2014.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Limits of Empirical Finance: Causal Reductionism and Self-Reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16570v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The clarion call for causal reduction in the study of capital markets is intensifying. However, in self-referencing and open systems such as capital markets, the idea of unidirectional causation (if applicable) may be limiting at best, and unstable or fallacious at worst. In this work, we critically assess the use of scientific deduction and causal inference within the study of empirical finance and financial econometrics. We then demonstrate the idea of competing causal chains using a toy model adapted from ecological predator/prey relationships. From this, we develop the alternative view that the study of empirical finance, and the risks contained therein, may be better appreciated once we admit that our current arsenal of quantitative finance tools may be limited to ex post causal inference under popular assumptions. Where these assumptions are challenged, for example in a recognizable reflexive context, the prescription of unidirectional causation proves deeply problematic.</description>
