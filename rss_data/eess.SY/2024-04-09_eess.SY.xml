      <title>Optimal Policy Synthesis from A Sequence of Goal Sets with An Application to Electric Distribution System Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the post-disaster distribution system restoration problem, in this paper, we study the problem of synthesizing the optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process (MDP) from a sequence of goal sets. For each goal set, our aim is to both maximize the probability to reach and minimize the expected time to reach the goal set. The order of the goal sets represents their priority. In particular, our aim is to generate a policy that is optimal with respect to the first goal set, and it is optimal with respect to the second goal set among the policies that are optimal with respect to the first goal set and so on. To synthesize such a policy, we iteratively filter the applicable actions according to the goal sets. We illustrate the developed method over sample distribution systems and disaster scenarios.</description>

      <title>Integrated Optimal Control for Fast Charging and Active Thermal Management of Lithium-Ion Batteries in Extreme Ambient Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated control strategy for fast charging and active thermal management of Lithium-ion batteries in extreme ambient temperatures. A control-oriented thermal-NDC (nonlinear double-capacitor) battery model is proposed to describe the electrical and thermal dynamics, accounting for the impact from both an active thermal source and ambient temperature. A state-feedback model predictive control algorithm is then developed for integrated fast charging and active thermal management. Numerical experiments validate the algorithm under extreme temperatures, showing that the proposed algorithm can energy-efficiently adjust the battery temperature to enhance fast charging. Additionally, an output-feedback model predictive control algorithm with an extended Kalman filter is proposed for battery charging when states are partially measurable. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness under extreme temperatures.</description>

      <title>Recovery from Adversarial Attacks in Cyber-physical Systems: Shallow, Deep and Exploratory Works</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) have experienced rapid growth in recent decades. However, like any other computer-based systems, malicious attacks evolve mutually, driving CPS to undesirable physical states and potentially causing catastrophes. Although the current state-of-the-art is well aware of this issue, the majority of researchers have not focused on CPS recovery, the procedure we defined as restoring a CPS's physical state back to a target condition under adversarial attacks. To call for attention on CPS recovery and identify existing efforts, we have surveyed a total of 30 relevant papers. We identify a major partition of the proposed recovery strategies: shallow recovery vs. deep recovery, where the former does not use a dedicated recovery controller while the latter does. Additionally, we surveyed exploratory research on topics that facilitate recovery. From these publications, we discuss the current state-of-the-art of CPS recovery, with respect to applications, attack type, attack surfaces and system dynamics. Then, we identify untouched sub-domains in this field and suggest possible future directions for researchers.</description>

      <title>Self-organizing Multiagent Target Enclosing under Limited Information and Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to address the target enclosing problem using non-holonomic multiagent systems, where agents autonomously self-organize themselves in the desired formation around a fixed target. Our approach combines global enclosing behavior and local collision avoidance mechanisms by devising a novel potential function and sliding manifold. In our approach, agents independently move toward the desired enclosing geometry when apart and activate the collision avoidance mechanism when a collision is imminent, thereby guaranteeing inter-agent safety. We rigorously show that an agent does not need to ensure safety with every other agent and put forth a concept of the nearest colliding agent (for any arbitrary agent) with whom ensuring safety is sufficient to avoid collisions in the entire swarm. The proposed control eliminates the need for a fixed or pre-established agent arrangement around the target and requires only relative information between an agent and the target. This makes our design particularly appealing for scenarios with limited global information, hence significantly reducing communication requirements. We finally present simulation results to vindicate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Evaluation and Optimization of Positional Accuracy for Maritime Positioning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation and trajectorial estimation of maritime vessels are contingent upon the context of positional accuracy. Even the smallest deviations in the estimation of a given vessel may result in detrimental consequences in terms of economic and ecologic quotients. To ensure an agile and precise environment for maritime vessel positional estimation, preexisting marine radar technologies can be utilized in a way that ensures a higher level of precision compared to GNSS-based identification and positioning. In this paper, we present a positional optimization for radarbased vessel navigation systems that utilize the installment of vessel detection sensors. The main objective of this research is to employ as fewer sensors as possible while preserving the attainable error threshold for positioning that is defined by International Maritime Organization (IMO). Our approach leads most of the time to a positioning error of up to 5 m along shorelines and rivers and up to 50 m along open coastal regions.</description>

      <title>A Two Time-Scale Joint Optimization Approach for UAV-assisted MEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is emerging as a promising paradigm to provide aerial-terrestrial computing services close to mobile devices (MDs). However, meeting the demands of computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks for MDs poses several challenges, including the demand-supply contradiction between MDs and MEC servers, the demand-supply heterogeneity between MDs and MEC servers, the trajectory control requirements on energy efficiency and timeliness, and the different time-scale dynamics of the network. To address these issues, we first present a hierarchical architecture by incorporating terrestrial-aerial computing capabilities and leveraging UAV flexibility. Furthermore, we formulate a joint computing resource allocation, computation offloading, and trajectory control problem to maximize the system utility. Since the problem is a non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), we propose a two time-scale joint computing resource allocation, computation offloading, and trajectory control (TJCCT) approach. In the short time scale, we propose a price-incentive method for on-demand computing resource allocation and a matching mechanism-based method for computation offloading. In the long time scale, we propose a convex optimization-based method for UAV trajectory control. Besides, we prove the stability, optimality, and polynomial complexity of TJCCT. Simulation results demonstrate that TJCCT outperforms the comparative algorithms in terms of the utility of the system, the QoE of MDs, and the revenue of MEC servers.</description>

      <title>Emerging Challenges of Integrating Solar PV in the Ireland and Northern Ireland Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses emerging operational challenges associated with the integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) in the All-Island power system (AIPS) of Ireland and Northern Ireland. These include the impact of solar PV on: (i) dispatch down levels; (ii) long-term frequency deviations; (iii) voltage magnitude variations; and (iv) operational demand variations. A case study based on actual data from the AIPS is used to analyze the above challenges. It is shown that despite its (still) relatively low penetration compared to wind power penetration, solar PV is challenging the real-time operation of the AIPS, e.g., maintaining frequency within operational limits. EirGrid and SONI, the transmission system operators (TSOs) of the AIPS, are working toward addressing all the above challenges.</description>

      <title>Stability Assessment of Low-Inertia Power Systems: A System Operator Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the stability assessment of low-inertia power systems through a real-world large-scale low-inertia system, namely, the All-Island power system (AIPS) of Ireland and Northern Ireland. This system currently accommodates world-record levels of system non-synchronous penetration namely 75% (planning to increase to 80% next year). The paper discusses one-month results obtained with the state-of-the-art stability tool called look-ahead security assessment (LSAT). This tool carries out rotor-angle, frequency and voltage stability analyses and is implemented in the control centres of the transmission system operators (TSOs). The paper shows that, at the time of writing, the main binding stability constraint of the AIPS is related to the limits on the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF).</description>

      <title>Securing the Skies: An IRS-Assisted AoI-Aware Secure Multi-UAV System with Efficient Task Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are integral in various sectors like agriculture, surveillance, and logistics, driven by advancements in 5G. However, existing research lacks a comprehensive approach addressing both data freshness and security concerns. In this paper, we address the intricate challenges of data freshness, and security, especially in the context of eavesdropping and jamming in modern UAV networks. Our framework incorporates exponential AoI metrics and emphasizes secrecy rate to tackle eavesdropping and jamming threats. We introduce a transformer-enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to optimize task offloading processes. Comparative analysis with existing algorithms showcases the superiority of our scheme, indicating its promising advancements in UAV network management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes a technique for active rejection of multiple independent and time-correlated stochastic disturbances for a nonlinear flexible inverted pendulum with cart system with uncertain model parameters. The control law is determined through deep reinforcement learning, specifically with a continuous actor-critic variant of deep Q-learning known as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, while the disturbance magnitudes evolve via independent stochastic processes. Simulation results are then compared with those from a classical control system.</description>

      <title>A code-driven tutorial on encrypted control: From pioneering realizations to modern implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interconnectivity in control systems due to robust wireless communication and cloud usage paves the way for exciting new opportunities such as data-driven control and service-based decision-making. At the same time, connected systems are susceptible to cyberattacks and data leakages. Against this background, encrypted control aims to increase the security and safety of cyber-physical systems. A central goal is to ensure confidentiality of process data during networked controller evaluations, which is enabled by, e.g., homomorphic encryption. However, the integration of advanced cryptographic systems renders the design of encrypted controllers an interdisciplinary challenge.
  This code-driven tutorial paper aims to facilitate the access to encrypted control by providing exemplary realizations based on popular homomorphic cryptosystems. In particular, we discuss the encrypted implementation of state feedback and PI controllers using the Paillier, GSW, and CKKS cryptosystem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a SIMO DC-DC converter capable of generating all the required voltages (buck and boost) utilizing n-type transistors for the output switches. The design incorporates only one shared bootstrap capacitor and a single pad to connect the top plate of the off-chip bootstrap capacitor to the on-chip drivers. By utilizing one off-chip bootstrap capacitor and sharing it between the multiple outputs, this work presents a low cost and low area solution for implementing a SIMO DC-DC converter using n-type transistor switches. A prototype of the proposed SIMO DC-DC converter is fabricated in 180nm SILTERRA BCD Technology.</description>

      <title>SoPhAr: Solar Phased-Arrays to boost the range of electric, hydrogen and SAF airliners in a solar world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In late 2022, ICAO member states adopted a long-term global aspirational goal (LTAG) to achieve net zero carbon emissions from international aviation by 2050. To date however, no economically scalable solution to the aviation decarbonization problem has been proposed. Despite considerable research on potential alternative fuels including e-fuels, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Hydrogen or Ammonia, and extensive research on purely electric propulsion, low-carbon propulsion methods are unable to replace fossil-fuels with identical or better economics. A possible alternative to current propulsion technologies is to directly beam the required propulsive power to aircraft. Several techniques have been considered to date, in particular laser energy beaming and microwave energy beaming. This paper proposes a possible concept where future airliners are mostly powered with ground-generated power. With expected improvements and scaling in solar panel manufacturing, the proposed concept would be economically competitive even with current jet fuel prices, while considerably reducing CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics for Utility Maximizing Agents: Exploring the Impact of Resource Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a continuous-time nonlinear model of opinion dynamics with utility-maximizing agents connected via a social influence network. A distinguishing feature of the proposed model is the inclusion of an opinion-dependent resource-penalty term in the utilities, which limits the agents from holding opinions of large magnitude. The proposed utility functions also account for how the relative resources within the social group affect both an agent's stubbornness and social influence. Each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility by revising its opinion in the gradient ascent direction of its utility function, thus leading to the proposed opinion dynamics. We show that, for any arbitrary social influence network, opinions are ultimately bounded. For networks with weak antagonistic relations, we show that there exists a globally exponentially stable equilibrium using contraction theory. We establish conditions for the existence of consensus equilibrium and analyze the relative dominance of the agents at consensus. We also conduct a game-theoretic analysis of the underlying opinion formation game, including on Nash equilibria and on prices of anarchy in terms of satisfaction ratios. Additionally, we also investigate the oscillatory behavior of opinions in a two-agent scenario. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the task of tracking Lissajous trajectories in the presence of quantized positioning sensors. To do so, theoretical results on tracking of continuous time periodic signals in the presence of output quantization are provided. With these results in hand, the application to Lissajous tracking is explored. The method proposed relies on the internal model principle and dispenses perfect knowledge of the system equations. Numerical results show that an arbitrary small scanning resolution is achievable despite large sensor quantization intervals.</description>

      <title>Minimax Least-Square Policy Iteration for Cost-Aware Defense of Traffic Routing against Unknown Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic routing is one of the representative control scheme in transportation, production lines, and data transmission. In the modern context of connectivity and autonomy, routing decisions are potentially vulnerable to malicious attacks. In this paper, we consider the dynamic routing problem over parallel traffic links in the face of such threats. An attacker is capable of increasing or destabilizing traffic queues by strategic manipulating the nominally optimal routing decisions. A defender is capable of securing the correct routing decision. Attacking and defensive actions induce technological costs. The defender has no prior information about the attacker's strategy. We develop an least-square policy iteration algorithm for the defender to compute a cost-aware and threat-adaptive defensive strategy. The policy evaluation step computes a weight vector that minimizes the sampled temporal-difference error. We derive a concrete theoretical upper bound on the evaluation error based on the theory of value function approximation. The policy improvement step solves a minimax problem and thus iteratively computes the Markov perfect equilibrium of the security game. We also discuss the training error of the entire policy iteration process.</description>

      <title>Optimized LinDistFlow for High-Fidelity Power Flow Modeling of Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DistFlow model accurately represents power flows in distribution systems, but the model's nonlinearities result in computational challenges for many optimization applications. Accordingly, a linear approximation known as LinDistFlow is commonly employed. This paper introduces an algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of the LinDistFlow approximation, with the goal of aligning the outputs more closely with those from the nonlinear DistFlow model. Using sensitivity information, our algorithm optimizes the LinDistFlow approximation's coefficient and bias parameters to minimize discrepancies in predictions of voltage magnitudes relative to the nonlinear DistFlow model. The algorithm employs the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) optimization method to fine-tune coefficients and bias parameters during an offline training phase in order to improve the LinDistFlow approximation's accuracy in optimization applications. This improves the model's effectiveness across various system scenarios, leading to a marked improvement in predictive accuracy. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy, showcasing accuracy improvements in $L_{1}$-norm and $L_{\infty}$-norm losses of up to $92\%$ and $88\%$, respectively, relative to the traditional LinDistFlow model. We assess how the optimized parameters perform under changes in the network topology and also validate the optimized LinDistFlow approximation's efficacy in a hosting capacity optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Network-Constrained Unit Commitment with Flexible Temporal Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) bears a heavy computational burden due to the ever-growing model scale. This situation becomes more challenging when detailed operational characteristics, complicated constraints, and multiple objectives are considered. We propose a novel simplification method to determine the flexible temporal resolution for acceleration and near-optimal solutions. The flexible temporal resolution is determined by analyzing the impact on generators in each adaptive time period with awareness of congestion effects. Additionally, multiple improvements are employed on the existing NCUC model compatible with flexible temporal resolution to reduce the number of integer variables while preserving the original features. A case study using the IEEE 118-bus and the Polish 2736-bus systems verifies that the proposed method achieves substantial acceleration with low cost variation and high accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Power Management and Control System for Portable Ecosystem Monitoring Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies help ecosystem monitoring to shift towards automated monitoring with low power sensors and embedded vision on powerful processing units. Vision-based monitoring devices need an effective power management and control system (PMCS) with system-adapted power input and output capabilities to achieve power-efficient and self-sustainable operation. Here, we present a universal power management solution for automated ecosystem monitoring devices, compatible with commonly used off-the-shelf edge processing units (EPUs). The proposed design is specifically adapted for battery-powered EPU systems by incorporating power-matched energy harvesting (EH), a power switch with low-power sleep mode, and simple system integration in an MCU-less architecture with automated operation. We use a 4-month environmental case study to monitor plant growth under 4mg microplastic (MP) exposure, demonstrating that the setup achieved continuous and sustainable operation. In this plant phenology case study, our power management module is deployed in an embedded vision camera equipped with a 5W solar panel and five various environmental sensors. This work shows the usability of the power management board in environmentally relevant use cases and for tasks in agricultural applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate the potential of neuromorphic control on the simple mechanical model of a pendulum, with both event-based actuation and sensing. The controller and the pendulum are regarded as event-based systems that occasionally interact to coordinate their respective rhythms. Control occurs through a proper timing of the interacting events. We illustrate the mixed nature of the control design: the design of an automaton, able to generate the right sequence of events, and the design of a regulator, able to tune the timing of events.</description>

      <title>Optimal Controller Realizations against False Data Injections in Cooperative Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the robustness of cooperative driving to cyberattacks, we study a controller-oriented approach to mitigate the effect of a class of False-Data Injection (FDI) attacks. By reformulating a given dynamic Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) scheme (the base controller), we recognize that the base controller can be represented by a class of new but equivalent controllers (base controller realizations) that exhibits the same platooning behavior with varying robustness in the presence of attacks. We propose a prescriptive synthesis framework where the base controller and the system dynamics are written in new coordinates via an invertible coordinate transformation on the controller state. Because the input-output behavior is invariant under coordinate transformations, the input-output behavior is unaffected (so controller realizations do not change the system's closed-loop performance). However, each base controller realization may require a different combination of sensors. To this end, we obtain the optimal combination of sensors that minimizes the effect of FDI attacks by solving a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI), while quantifying the FDI's attack impact through reachability analysis. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that this approach enhances the robustness of cooperative driving, without relying on a detection scheme and maintaining all system properties.</description>

      <title>Contouring Error Bounded Control for Biaxial Switched Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biaxial motion control systems are used extensively in manufacturing and printing industries. To improve throughput and reduce machine cost, lightweight materials are being proposed in structural components but may result in higher flexibility in the machine links. This flexibility is often position dependent and compromises precision of the end effector of the machine. To address the need for improved contouring accuracy in industrial machines with position-dependent structural flexibility, this paper introduces a novel contouring error-bounded control algorithm for biaxial switched linear systems. The proposed algorithm utilizes model predictive control to guarantee the satisfaction of state, input, and contouring error constraints for any admissible mode switching. In this paper, the switching signal remains unknown to the controller, although information about the minimum time the system is expected to stay in a specific mode is considered to be available. The proposed algorithm has the property of recursive feasibility and ensures the stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to a high-fidelity simulation of a dual-drive industrial laser machine. The results show that the contouring error is successfully bounded within the given tolerance.</description>

      <title>Joint Active and Passive Beamforming for IRS-Aided Wireless Energy Transfer Network Exploiting One-Bit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reap the active and passive beamforming gain in an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless network, a typical way is to first acquire the channel state information (CSI) relying on the pilot signal, and then perform the joint beamforming design. However, it is a great challenge when the receiver can neither send pilot signals nor have complex signal processing capabilities due to its hardware limitation. To tackle this problem, we study in this paper an IRS-aided wireless energy transfer (WET) network and propose two joint beamforming design methods, namely, the channel-estimationbased method and the distributed-beamforming-based method, that require only one-bit feedback from the energy receiver (ER) to the energy transmitter (ET). Specifically, for the channelestimation-based method, according to the feedback information, the ET is able to infer the cascaded ET-IRS-ER channel by continually adjusting its transmit beamformer while applying the analytic center cutting plane method (ACCPM). Then, based on the estimated cascaded CSI, the joint beamforming design can be performed by using the existing optimization techniques. While for the distributed-beamforming-based method, we first apply the distributed beamforming algorithm to optimize the IRS reflection coefficients, which is theoretically proven to converge to a local optimum almost surely. Then, the optimal ET's transmit covariance matrix is obtained based on the effective ET-ER channel learned by applying the ACCPM only once. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed one-bitfeedback-based joint beamforming design schemes while greatly reducing the requirement on the hardware complexity of the ER. In particular, the high accuracy of our IRS-involved cascaded channel estimation method exploiting one-bit feedback is also validated.</description>

      <title>Stability Mechanisms for Predictive Safety Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive safety filters enable the integration of potentially unsafe learning-based control approaches and humans into safety-critical systems. In addition to simple constraint satisfaction, many control problems involve additional stability requirements that may vary depending on the specific use case or environmental context. In this work, we address this problem by augmenting predictive safety filters with stability guarantees, ranging from bounded convergence to uniform asymptotic stability. The proposed framework extends well-known stability results from model predictive control (MPC) theory while supporting commonly used design techniques. As a result, straightforward extensions to dynamic trajectory tracking problems can be easily adapted, as outlined in this article. The practicality of the framework is demonstrated using an automotive advanced driver assistance scenario, involving a reference trajectory stabilization problem.</description>

      <title>Variable-Pitch-Propeller Mechanism Design, and Development of Heliquad for Mid-flight Flipping and Fault-Tolerant-Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design of Variable-Pitch-Propeller mechanism and its application on a quadcopter called Heliquad to demonstrate its unique capabilities. The input-output relationship is estimated for a generic mechanism. Various singularities and actuator sizing requirements are also analyzed. The mechanism is manufactured, and the validated input-output relationship is implemented in the controller of Heliquad. Heliquad is controlled by a unified non-switching cascaded attitude-rate controller, followed by a unique Neural-Network-based reconfigurable control allocation to approximate nonlinear relationship between the control input and actuator command. The Heliquad prototype's mid-flight flip experiment validates the controller's tracking performance in upright as well as inverted conditions. The prototype is then flown in upright condition with only three of its working actuators. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the cambered airfoil propeller-equipped Heliquad prototype demonstrates full-attitude control, including yaw-rate, on three working actuators for the first time in the literature. Finally, the utility of this novel capability is demonstrated by safe recovery and precise landing post-mid-flight actuator failure crisis. Overall, the controller tracks the references well for all the experiments, and the output of the NN-based control allocation remains bounded throughout.</description>

      <title>Stability Enhancement of LCL-Type Grid-Following Inverters Using Capacitor Voltage Active Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An LCL filter offers superior attenuation for high-frequency harmonics for three-phase grid-following inverters compared to LC and L filters. However, it also introduces an inherent resonance peak, which can lead to power quality issues or even instability of the inverter control system. Active damping (AD) is widely employed to effectively mitigate this resonance. Capacitor voltage feedback (CVF) and capacitor current feedback (CCF) are effective AD methods for LCL resonance damping. CVF is preferred due to its lower sensor requirement compared to CCF. However, a derivative term appears in the active damping loop, which introduces high-frequency noise into the system. This paper proposes a noise-immune approach by replacing the derivative term with a discrete function suitable for digital implementation. The LCL resonance can be damped effectively, resulting in enhanced stability of the inverter control system. Simulation results verify the proposed effectiveness of the method with grid inductance variation and weak grid conditions</description>

      <title>Enhance Low-Carbon Power System Operation via Carbon-Aware Demand Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the electrification process advances, enormous power flexibility is becoming available on the demand side, which can be harnessed to facilitate power system decarbonization. Hence, this paper studies the carbon-aware demand response (C-DR) paradigm, where individual users aim to minimize their carbon footprints through the optimal scheduling of flexible load devices. The specific operational dynamics and constraints of deferrable loads and thermostatically controlled loads are considered, and the carbon emission flow method is employed to determine users' carbon footprints using nodal carbon intensities. Then, an optimal power dispatch model that integrates the C-DR mechanism is proposed for low-carbon power system operation, based on the carbon-aware optimal power flow (C-OPF) method. Two solution algorithms, including a centralized Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) reformulation algorithm and an iterative solution algorithm, are developed to solve the bi-level power dispatch optimization model. Numerical simulations on the IEEE New England 39-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Anti-swing Trajectory Planning of Double-pendulum Tower Crane Operations using Opposition-based Evolutionary Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underactuated tower crane lifting requires time-energy optimal trajectories for the trolley/slew operations and reduction of the unactuated swings resulting from the trolley/jib motion. In scenarios involving non-negligible hook mass or long rig-cable, the hook-payload unit exhibits double-pendulum behaviour, making the problem highly challenging. This article introduces an offline multi-objective anti-swing trajectory planning module for a Computer-Aided Lift Planning (CALP) system of autonomous double-pendulum tower cranes, addressing all the transient state constraints. A set of auxiliary outputs are selected by methodically analyzing the payload swing dynamics and are used to prove the differential flatness property of the crane operations. The flat outputs are parameterized via suitable B\'{e}zier curves to formulate the multi-objective trajectory optimization problems in the flat output space. A novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called Collective Oppositional Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (CO-GDE3) is employed as the optimizer. To obtain faster convergence and better consistency in getting a wide range of good solutions, a new population initialization strategy is integrated into the conventional GDE3. The computationally efficient initialization method incorporates various concepts of computational opposition. Statistical comparisons based on trolley and slew operations verify the superiority of convergence and reliability of CO-GDE3 over the standard GDE3. Trolley and slew operations of a collision-free lifting path computed via the path planner of the CALP system are selected for a simulation study. The simulated trajectories demonstrate that the proposed planner can produce time-energy optimal solutions, keeping all the state variables within their respective limits and restricting the hook and payload swings.</description>

Abstract: Modulation instability is a phenomenon of spontaneous pattern formation in nonlinear media, oftentimes leading to an unpredictable behaviour and a degradation of a signal of interest. We propose an approach based on reinforcement learning to suppress the unstable modes by optimizing the parameters for the time modulation of the potential in the nonlinear system. We test our approach in 1D and 2D cases and propose a new class of physically-meaningful reward functions to guarantee tamed instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback optimization enables autonomous optimality seeking of a dynamical system through its closed-loop interconnection with iterative optimization algorithms. Among various iteration structures, model-based approaches require the input-output sensitivity of the system to construct gradients, whereas model-free approaches bypass this need by estimating gradients from real-time evaluations of the objective. These approaches own complementary benefits in sample efficiency and accuracy against model mismatch, i.e., errors of sensitivities. To achieve the best of both worlds, we propose gray-box feedback optimization controllers, featuring systematic incorporation of approximate sensitivities into model-free updates via adaptive convex combination. We quantify conditions on the accuracy of the sensitivities that render the gray-box approach preferable. We elucidate how the closed-loop performance is determined by the number of iterations, the problem dimension, and the cumulative effect of inaccurate sensitivities. The proposed controller contributes to a balanced closed-loop behavior, which retains provable sample efficiency and optimality guarantees for nonconvex problems. We further develop a running gray-box controller to handle constrained time-varying problems with changing objectives and steady-state maps.</description>

      <title>Compositional Estimation of Lipschitz Constants for Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lipschitz constant plays a crucial role in certifying the robustness of neural networks to input perturbations and adversarial attacks, as well as the stability and safety of systems with neural network controllers. Therefore, estimation of tight bounds on the Lipschitz constant of neural networks is a well-studied topic. However, typical approaches involve solving a large matrix verification problem, the computational cost of which grows significantly for deeper networks. In this letter, we provide a compositional approach to estimate Lipschitz constants for deep feedforward neural networks by obtaining an exact decomposition of the large matrix verification problem into smaller sub-problems. We further obtain a closed-form solution that applies to most common neural network activation functions, which will enable rapid robustness and stability certificates for neural networks deployed in online control settings. Finally, we demonstrate through numerical experiments that our approach provides a steep reduction in computation time while yielding Lipschitz bounds that are very close to those achieved by state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Power Flow Approximations with Second-Order Sensitivity Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power flow equations are fundamental to power system planning, analysis, and control. However, the inherent non-linearity and non-convexity of these equations present formidable obstacles in problem-solving processes. To mitigate these challenges, recent research has proposed adaptive power flow linearizations that aim to achieve accuracy over wide operating ranges. The accuracy of these approximations inherently depends on the curvature of the power flow equations within these ranges, which necessitates looking at second-order sensitivities. In this paper, we leverage second-order sensitivities to both analyze and improve power flow approximations. We evaluate the curvature across broad operational ranges and subsequently utilize this information to inform the computation of various sampling-based power flow approximation techniques. Additionally, we leverage second-order sensitivities to guide the development of rational approximations that yield linear constraints in optimization problems. This approach is extended to enhance accuracy beyond the limitations of linear functions across varied operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Convex Reformulation of LMI-Based Distributed Controller Design with a Class of Non-Block-Diagonal Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses a distributed state feedback controller design problem for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). As the exact convexification is still open, the block-diagonal relaxation of Lyapunov functions has been prevalent despite its conservatism. In this work, we target a class of non-block-diagonal Lyapunov functions that has the same sparsity as distributed controllers. By leveraging a block-diagonal factorization of sparse matrices and Finsler's lemma, we first present a (nonlinear) matrix inequality for stabilizing distributed controllers with such Lyapunov functions, which boils down to a necessary and sufficient condition for such controllers if the sparsity pattern is chordal. As a relaxation of the inequality, we derive an LMI that completely covers the conventional relaxation and then provide analogous results for $H_\infty$ control. Lastly, numerical examples underscore the efficacy of our results.</description>

      <title>The Identification and Categorization of Anemia Through Artificial Neural Networks: A Comparative Analysis of Three Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents different neural network-based classifier algorithms for diagnosing and classifying Anemia. The study compares these classifiers with established models such as Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN), Elman network, and Non-linear Auto-Regressive Exogenous model (NARX). Experimental evaluations were conducted using data from clinical laboratory test results for 230 patients. The proposed neural network features nine inputs (age, gender, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, WBCs) and one output. The simulation outcomes for diverse patients demonstrate that the suggested artificial neural network rapidly and accurately detects the presence of the disease. Consequently, the network could be seamlessly integrated into clinical laboratories for automatic generation of Anemia patients' reports Additionally, the suggested method is affordable and can be deployed on hardware at low costs.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of the Three-Dimensional CAC Considering Connection and Communication Quality</title>

Abstract: In emergencies such as disasters, the number of voice calls (VoIP sessions) increases rapidly for a variety of purposes. Thus, a control server near a disaster area may not be able to connect to VoIP sessions due to congestion. To solve this problem, a Call Admission Control (CAC) is needed to determine whether a VoIP session requesting a connection can be accepted or rejected. A CAC has the purpose of guaranteeing the connection quality and communication quality of VoIP sessions. One conventional method classifies VoIP sessions into three classes (emergency VoIP sessions, VoIP sessions from the disaster area, and VoIP sessions from outside the disaster area) by focusing on the outgoing location and offers a CAC with a priority level for each. However, a conventional CAC method cannot be applied to VoIP networks because reception control is designed for Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTN). When conventional methods are applied to VoIP networks, the connection quality is guaranteed, however the communication quality cannot be guaranteed because the packet dropping probability is not considered. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional CAC that controls three classes of VoIP sessions and guarantees both communication and connection quality in VoIP networks during emergencies. A conventional CAC method and our proposed CAC method are evaluated in terms of the call blocking probability, which guarantees the connection quality, and packet dropping probability, which guarantees the communication quality, to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>SAFE-GIL: SAFEty Guided Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavior Cloning is a popular approach to Imitation Learning, in which a robot observes an expert supervisor and learns a control policy. However, behavior cloning suffers from the "compounding error" problem - the policy errors compound as it deviates from the expert demonstrations and might lead to catastrophic system failures, limiting its use in safety-critical applications. On-policy data aggregation methods are able to address this issue at the cost of rolling out and repeated training of the imitation policy, which can be tedious and computationally prohibitive. We propose SAFE-GIL, an off-policy behavior cloning method that guides the expert via adversarial disturbance during data collection. The algorithm abstracts the imitation error as an adversarial disturbance in the system dynamics, injects it during data collection to expose the expert to safety critical states, and collects corrective actions. Our method biases training to more closely replicate expert behavior in safety-critical states and allows more variance in less critical states. We compare our method with several behavior cloning techniques and DAgger on autonomous navigation and autonomous taxiing tasks and show higher task success and safety, especially in low data regimes where the likelihood of error is higher, at a slight drop in the performance.</description>

      <title>What Are the Odds? Improving the foundations of Statistical Model Checking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a fundamental model for decision making under uncertainty. They exhibit non-deterministic choice as well as probabilistic uncertainty. Traditionally, verification algorithms assume exact knowledge of the probabilities that govern the behaviour of an MDP. As this assumption is often unrealistic in practice, statistical model checking (SMC) was developed in the past two decades. It allows to analyse MDPs with unknown transition probabilities and provide probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees on the result. Model-based SMC algorithms sample the MDP and build a model of it by estimating all transition probabilities, essentially for every transition answering the question: ``What are the odds?'' However, so far the statistical methods employed by the state of the art SMC algorithms are quite naive. Our contribution are several fundamental improvements to those methods: On the one hand, we survey statistics literature for better concentration inequalities; on the other hand, we propose specialised approaches that exploit our knowledge of the MDP. Our improvements are generally applicable to many kinds of problem statements because they are largely independent of the setting. Moreover, our experimental evaluation shows that they lead to significant gains, reducing the number of samples that the SMC algorithm has to collect by up to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>The Open Autonomy Safety Case Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A system safety case is a compelling, comprehensible, and valid argument about the satisfaction of the safety goals of a given system operating in a given environment supported by convincing evidence. Since the publication of UL 4600 in 2020, safety cases have become a best practice for measuring, managing, and communicating the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Although UL 4600 provides guidance on how to build the safety case for an AV, the complexity of AVs and their operating environments, the novelty of the used technology, the need for complying with various regulations and technical standards, and for addressing cybersecurity concerns and ethical considerations make the development of safety cases for AVs challenging. To this end, safety case frameworks have been proposed that bring strategies, argument templates, and other guidance together to support the development of a safety case. This paper introduces the Open Autonomy Safety Case Framework, developed over years of work with the autonomous vehicle industry, as a roadmap for how AVs can be deployed safely and responsibly.</description>

      <title>A High-Performant Multi-Parametric Quadratic Programming Solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a combinatorial method for computing explicit solutions to multi-parametric quadratic programs, which can be used to compute explicit control laws for linear model predictive control. In contrast to classical methods, which are based on geometrical adjacency, the proposed method is based on combinatorial adjacency. After introducing the notion of combinatorial adjacency, we show that the explicit solution forms a connected graph in terms of it. We then leverage this connectedness to propose an algorithm that computes the explicit solution. The purely combinatorial nature of the algorithm leads to computational advantages since it enables demanding geometrical operations (such as computing facets of polytopes) to be avoided. Compared with classical combinatorial methods, the proposed method requires fewer combinations to be considered by exploiting combinatorial connectedness. We show that an implementation of the proposed method can yield a speedup of about two orders of magnitude compared with state-of-the-art software packages such as MPT and POP.</description>

      <title>Design and Simulation of Time-energy Optimal Anti-swing Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Tower Cranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For autonomous crane lifting, optimal trajectories of the crane are required as reference inputs to the crane controller to facilitate feedforward control. Reducing the unactuated payload motion is a crucial issue for under-actuated tower cranes with spherical pendulum dynamics. The planned trajectory should be optimal in terms of both operating time and energy consumption, to facilitate optimum output spending optimum effort. This article proposes an anti-swing tower crane trajectory planner that can provide time-energy optimal solutions for the Computer-Aided Lift Planning (CALP) system developed at Nanyang Technological University, which facilitates collision-free lifting path planning of robotized tower cranes in autonomous construction sites. The current work introduces a trajectory planning module to the system that utilizes the geometric outputs from the path planning module and optimally scales them with time information. Firstly, analyzing the non-linear dynamics of the crane operations, the tower crane is established as differentially flat. Subsequently, the multi-objective trajectory optimization problems for all the crane operations are formulated in the flat output space through consideration of the mechanical and safety constraints. Two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (GDE3), are extensively compared via statistical measures based on the closeness of solutions to the Pareto front, distribution of solutions in the solution space and the runtime, to select the optimization engine of the planner. Finally, the crane operation trajectories are obtained via the corresponding planned flat output trajectories. Studies simulating real-world lifting scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed module of the lift planning system.</description>

      <title>Feedback Stability Under Mixed Gain and Phase Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the robust feedback stability problem for multiple-input-multiple-output linear time-invariant systems involving sectored-disk uncertainty, namely, dynamic uncertainty subject to simultaneous gain and phase constraints. This problem is thereby called a sectored-disk problem. Employing a frequency-wise analysis approach, we derive a fundamental static matrix problem that serves as a key component in addressing the feedback stability. The study of this matrix problem heavily relies on the Davis-Wielandt (DW) shells of matrices, providing a profound insight into matrices subjected to simultaneous gain and phase constraints. This understanding is pivotal for establishing a less conservative sufficient condition for the matrix sectored-disk problem, from which we formulate several robust feedback stability conditions against sectored-disk uncertainty. Finally, several conditions based on linear matrix inequalities are developed for efficient computation and verification of feedback robust stability against sectored-disk uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: There exist a wide range of options for field robotics research using ground and aerial mobile robots, but there are comparatively few robust and research-ready uncrewed surface vessels (USVs). This workshop paper starts with a snapshot of USVs currently available to the research community and then describes "OtterROS", an open source ROS 2 solution for the Otter USV. Field experiments using OtterROS are described, which highlight the utility of the Otter USV and the benefits of using ROS 2 in aquatic robotics research. For those interested in USV research, the paper details recommended hardware to run OtterROS and includes an example ROS 2 package using OtterROS, removing unnecessary non-recurring engineering from field robotics research activities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete-time robust optimal control problems generally take a min-max structure over continuous variable spaces, which can be difficult to solve in practice. In this paper, we extend the class of such problems that can be solved through a previously proposed local reduction method to consider those with existence constraints on the uncountable variables. We also consider the possibility of non-unique trajectories that satisfy equality and inequality constraints. Crucially, we show that the problems of interest can be cast into a standard semi-infinite program and demonstrate how to generate optimal uncertainty scenario sets in order to obtain numerical solutions. We also include examples on model predictive control for obstacle avoidance with logical conditions, control with input saturation affected by uncertainty, and optimal parameter estimation to highlight the need for the proposed extension. Our method solves each of the examples considered, producing violation-free and locally optimal solutions.</description>

Abstract: Humanoid-Gym is an easy-to-use reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on Nvidia Isaac Gym, designed to train locomotion skills for humanoid robots, emphasizing zero-shot transfer from simulation to the real-world environment. Humanoid-Gym also integrates a sim-to-sim framework from Isaac Gym to Mujoco that allows users to verify the trained policies in different physical simulations to ensure the robustness and generalization of the policies. This framework is verified by RobotEra's XBot-S (1.2-meter tall humanoid robot) and XBot-L (1.65-meter tall humanoid robot) in a real-world environment with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

      <description>arXiv:2210.09372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upon the arrival of emerging devices, including Extended Reality (XR) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the traditional communication framework is approaching Shannon's physical capacity limit and fails to guarantee the massive amount of transmission within latency requirements. By jointly exploiting the context of data and its importance to the task, an emerging communication paradigm shift to semantic level and effectiveness level is envisioned to be a key revolution in Sixth Generation (6G) networks. However, an explicit and systematic communication framework incorporating both semantic level and effectiveness level has not been proposed yet. In this article, we propose a generic goal-oriented semantic communication framework for various tasks with diverse data types, which incorporates both semantic level information and effectiveness-aware performance metrics. We first analyze the unique characteristics of all data types, and summarise the semantic information, along with corresponding extraction methods. We then propose a detailed goal-oriented semantic communication framework for different time-critical and non-critical tasks. In the goal-oriented semantic communication framework, we present the goal-oriented semantic information, extraction methods, recovery methods, and effectiveness-aware performance metrics. Last but not least, we present a goal-oriented semantic communication framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control task to validate the effectiveness of the proposed goal-oriented semantic communication framework.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Sensor Placement Approach for Detecting Voltage Violations in Distribution Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09414v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic fluctuations in power injections from distributed energy resources (DERs) combined with load variability can cause constraint violations (e.g., exceeded voltage limits) in electric distribution systems. To monitor grid operations, sensors are placed to measure important quantities such as the voltage magnitudes. In this paper, we consider a sensor placement problem which seeks to identify locations for installing sensors that can capture all possible violations of voltage magnitude limits. We formulate a bilevel optimization problem that minimizes the number of sensors and avoids false sensor alarms in the upper level while ensuring detection of any voltage violations in the lower level. This problem is challenging due to the nonlinearity of the power flow equations and the presence of binary variables. Accordingly, we employ recently developed conservative linear approximations of the power flow equations that overestimate or underestimate the voltage magnitudes. By replacing the nonlinear power flow equations with conservative linear approximations, we can ensure that the resulting sensor locations and thresholds are sufficient to identify any constraint violations. Additionally, we apply various problem reformulations to significantly improve computational tractability while simultaneously ensuring an appropriate placement of sensors. Lastly, we improve the quality of the results via an approximate gradient descent method that adjusts the sensor thresholds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for several test cases, including a system with multiple switching configurations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate discrete-time decision-making problems in uncertain systems with partially observed states. We consider a non-stochastic model, where uncontrolled disturbances acting on the system take values in bounded sets with unknown distributions. We present a general framework for decision-making in such problems by using the notion of the information state and approximate information state, and introduce conditions to identify an uncertain variable that can be used to compute an optimal strategy through a dynamic program (DP). Next, we relax these conditions and define approximate information states that can be learned from output data without knowledge of system dynamics. We use approximate information states to formulate a DP that yields a strategy with a bounded performance loss. Finally, we illustrate the application of our results in control and reinforcement learning using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Enlarging Stability Region of Urban Networks with Imminent Supply Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stability region is a key index to characterize a dynamic processing system's ability to handle incoming demands. It is a multidimensional space when the system has multiple OD pairs where their service rates interact. Urban traffic network is such a system. Traffic congestion appears when its demand approaches or exceeds the upper frontier of its stability region. In this decade, with the rapid development of traffic sense technology, real-time traffic operations, e.g., BackPressure (BP) control, have gained lots of research attention. Urban network's mobility could be further improved with these timely demand-responding strategies. However, most studies on real-time controls continue with traditional supply assumptions and ignore an important fact -- imminent saturation flow rate (I-SFR), i.e., the system's real-time service rate under green, is neither fixed nor given, but hard to be precisely known. It is unknown how the knowledge level of I-SFR would influence the stability region. This paper proves that knowing more accurate I-SFR can enlarge the upper frontier of the network's stability region. Furthermore, BP policy with predicted I-SFR can stabilize the network within the enlarged stability region and relieve the congestion level of the traffic network. Therefore, improving the I-SFR's prediction accuracy is meaningful for traffic operations.</description>

      <title>Who should pay for frequency-containment ancillary services? Making responsible units bear the cost to shape investment in generation and loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the operating cost of electricity grids based on thermal generation was largely driven by the cost of fuel, as renewable penetration increases, ancillary services represent an increasingly large proportion of the running costs. Electric frequency is an important magnitude in highly renewable grids, as it becomes more volatile and therefore the cost related to maintaining it within safe bounds has significantly increased. So far, costs for frequency-containment ancillary services have been socialised in most countries, but it has become relevant to rethink this regulatory arrangement. In this paper, we discuss the issue of cost allocation for these services, highlighting the need to evolve towards a causation-based regulatory framework. We argue that parties responsible for creating the need for ancillary services should bear these costs. However, this would imply an important change in electricity market policy, therefore it is necessary to understand the impact on current and future investments on generation, as well as on electricity tariffs. Here we provide a mostly qualitative analysis of this issue, defining guidelines for practical implementation and further study.</description>

      <title>Scalable {\delta}-Level Coherent State Synchronization of Multi-Agent Systems in the Presence of Bounded Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study scalable {\delta}-Level coherent state synchronization for multi-agent systems (MAS) where the agents are subject to bounded disturbances/noises. We propose a scale-free framework designed solely based on the knowledge of agent models and agnostic to the communication graphs and size of the network. We define the level of coherency for each agent as the norm of the weighted sum of the disagreement dynamics with its neighbors. The objective is to restrict the level of coherency of the network to {\delta} without a-priori information about the disturbances.</description>

      <title>Fast WDM provisioning with minimal probing: the first field experiments for DC exchanges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07359v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach to estimate the end-to-end GSNR accurately in a short time when a data center interconnect (DCI) network operator receives a service request from users, not by measuring the GSNR at the operational route and wavelength for the End-End optical path but by simply applying a QoT probe channel link by link, at a convenient wavelength/modulation-format for measurement. Assuming connections between coherent transceivers of various frequency ranges, modulators, and modulation formats, we propose a new device software architecture in which the DCI network operator optimizes the transmission mode between user transceivers with high accuracy using only standard parameters such as Bit Error Rate. In this paper, we first experimentally built three different routes of 32 km/72 km/122 km in the C-band to confirm the accuracy of this approach. For the operational end-to-end GSNR measurements, the accuracy estimated from the sum of the measurements for each link was 0.6 dB, and the wavelength-dependent error was about 0.2 dB. Then, using field fibers deployed in the NSF COSMOS testbed (deployed in an urban area), a Linux-based transmission device software architecture, and coherent transceivers with different optical frequency ranges, modulators, and modulation formats, the fast WDM provisioning of an optical path was completed within 6 minutes (with a Q-factor error of about 0.7 dB).</description>

      <title>The role of local bounds on neighborhoods in the network for scale-free state synchronization of multi-agent systems</title>

Abstract: This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to the state synchronization problem of homogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS) via scale-free linear dynamic non-collaborative protocol for both continuous- and discrete-time. These conditions guarantee for which class of MAS, one can achieve scale-free state synchronization. We investigate protocol design with and without utilizing local bounds on neighborhood. The results show that the availability of local bounds on neighborhoods plays a key role.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Load Altering Attacks on Distribution Systems with ZIP Loads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06429v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Load-altering attacks (LAAs) pose a significant threat to power systems with Internet of Things (IoT)-controllable load devices. This research examines the detrimental impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution systems, taking into account the realistic load model with constant impedance Z, constant current I, and constant power P (ZIP). We derive closed-form expressions for computing the voltages of buses following LAA by making approximations to the power flow as well as the load model. We also characterize the minimum number of devices to be manipulated in order to cause voltage safety violations in the system. We conduct extensive simulations using the IEEE-33 bus system to verify the accuracy of the proposed approximations and highlight the difference between the attack impacts while considering constant power and the ZIP load model (which is more representative of real-world loads).</description>

      <title>Robustness-Guaranteed Observer-Based Control Strategy with Modularity for Cleantech EMLA-Driven Heavy-Duty Robotic Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative observer-based modular control strategy in a class of $n_a$-degree-of-freedom (DoF) fully-electrified heavy-duty robotic manipulators (HDRMs) to (1) guarantee robustness in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances, (2) address the complexities arising from several interacting mechanisms, (3) ensure uniformly exponential stability, and (4) enhance overall control performance. To begin with, the dynamic model of the HDRM actuation system that exploits the synergy between cleantech electromechanical linear actuators (EMLAs) and permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) is investigated. In addition, the reference trajectories of each joint are computed based on direct collocation with B-Spline curves, and simulations on the 3-DoF HDRM are conducted to extract its key kinematic and dynamic quantities. To guarantee the robust tracking of the computed trajectories by the actual motion states, a novel control methodology called robust subsystem-based adaptive (RSBA) control is enhanced through an adaptive state observer. The RSBA control addresses inaccuracies inherent in motion sensors, modeling errors, non-triangular uncertainties, and both torque and voltage disturbances, to which the EMLA-driven HDRM is susceptible. Furthermore, this approach is presented in a unified generic equation format for all subsystems to mitigate the complexities of the entire control system. By applying the RSBA architecture, the uniformly exponential stability of the EMLA-driven HDRM is proved based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed control algorithm is simulated for the scrutinized mechanism, whereby its efficacy in precisely and quickly tracking reference trajectories, alongside the reduction of torque effort, is validated.</description>

      <title>GreenScan: Towards large-scale terrestrial monitoring the health of urban trees using mobile sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Healthy urban greenery is a fundamental asset to mitigate climate change phenomena such as extreme heat and air pollution. However, urban trees are often affected by abiotic and biotic stressors that hamper their functionality, and whenever not timely managed, even their survival. While the current greenery inspection techniques can help in taking effective measures, they often require a high amount of human labor, making frequent assessments infeasible at city-wide scales. In this paper, we present GreenScan, a ground-based sensing system designed to provide health assessments of urban trees at high spatio-temporal resolutions, with low costs. The system utilises thermal and multi-spectral imaging sensors fused using a custom computer vision model in order to estimate two tree health indexes. The evaluation of the system was performed through data collection experiments in Cambridge, USA. Overall, this work illustrates a novel approach for autonomous mobile ground-based tree health monitoring on city-wide scales at high temporal resolutions with low-costs.</description>

      <title>Decision-Oriented Learning for Future Power System Decision-Making under Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Better forecasts may not lead to better decision-making. To address this challenge, decision-oriented learning (DOL) has been proposed as a new branch of machine learning that replaces traditional statistical loss with a decision loss to form an end-to-end model. Applications of DOL in power systems have been developed in recent years. For renewable-rich power systems, uncertainties propagate through sequential tasks, where traditional statistical-based approaches focus on minimizing statistical errors at intermediate stages but may fail to provide optimal decisions at the final stage. This paper first elaborates on the mismatch between more accurate forecasts and more optimal decisions in the power system caused by statistical-based learning (SBL) and explains how DOL resolves this problem. Secondly, this paper extensively reviews DOL techniques and their applications in power systems while highlighting their pros and cons in relation to SBL. Finally, this paper identifies the challenges to adopt DOL in the energy sector and presents future research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes multi-step TD-learning algorithms within the `deadly triad' scenario, characterized by linear function approximation, off-policy learning, and bootstrapping. In particular, we prove that n-step TD-learning algorithms converge to a solution as the sampling horizon n increases sufficiently. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first part, we comprehensively examine the fundamental properties of their model-based deterministic counterparts, including projected value iteration, gradient descent algorithms, and the control theoretic approach, which can be viewed as prototype deterministic algorithms whose analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding and developing their model-free reinforcement learning counterparts. In particular, we prove that these algorithms converge to meaningful solutions when n is sufficiently large. Based on these findings, two n-step TD-learning algorithms are proposed and analyzed, which can be seen as the model-free reinforcement learning counterparts of the gradient and control theoretic algorithms.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Deep Learning Classification from Raw Signal Data in Radiology, Ultrasonography and Electrophysiology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical imaging is a very useful tool in healthcare, various technologies being employed to non-invasively peek inside the human body. Deep learning with neural networks in radiology was welcome - albeit cautiously - by the radiologist community. Most of the currently deployed or researched deep learning solutions are applied on already generated images of medical scans, use the neural networks to aid in the generation of such images, or use them for identifying specific substance markers in spectrographs. This paper's author posits that if the neural networks were trained directly on the raw signals from the scanning machines, they would gain access to more nuanced information than from the already processed images, hence the training - and later, the inferences - would become more accurate. The paper presents the main current applications of deep learning in radiography, ultrasonography, and electrophysiology, and discusses whether the proposed neural network training directly on raw signals is feasible.</description>

      <title>Federated reinforcement learning for robot motion planning with zero-shot generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of learning a control policy for robot motion planning with zero-shot generalization, i.e., no data collection and policy adaptation is needed when the learned policy is deployed in new environments. We develop a federated reinforcement learning framework that enables collaborative learning of multiple learners and a central server, i.e., the Cloud, without sharing their raw data. In each iteration, each learner uploads its local control policy and the corresponding estimated normalized arrival time to the Cloud, which then computes the global optimum among the learners and broadcasts the optimal policy to the learners. Each learner then selects between its local control policy and that from the Cloud for next iteration. The proposed framework leverages on the derived zero-shot generalization guarantees on arrival time and safety. Theoretical guarantees on almost-sure convergence, almost consensus, Pareto improvement and optimality gap are also provided. Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to evaluate the proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of linear temporal logic (LTL) path planning for multi-agent systems, introducing the new concept of \emph{ordering constraints}. Specifically, we consider a generic objective function that is defined for the path of each individual agent. The primary objective is to find a global plan for the team of agents, ensuring they collectively meet the specified LTL requirements. Simultaneously, we aim to maintain a pre-determined order in the values of the objective function for each agent, which we refer to as the ordering constraints. This new requirement stems from scenarios like security-aware planning, where relative orders outweigh absolute values in importance. We present an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, supported by proofs of correctness that demonstrate the optimality of our solution. Additionally, we provide a case study in security-aware path planning to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>An Execution-time-certified QP Algorithm for $\ell_1$ penalty-based Soft-constrained MPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providing an execution time certificate and handling possible infeasibility in closed-loop are two pressing requirements of Model Predictive Control (MPC). To simultaneously meet these two requirements, this paper uses an $\ell_1$ penalty-based soft-constrained MPC formulation and innovatively transforms the resulting non-smooth QP into a box-constrained QP, which is solved by our previously proposed direct and execution-time certified algorithm with only dimension-dependent (data-independent), simple-calculated and exact number of iterations (Wu and Braatz (2023)). This approach not only overcomes the limitation of our previously proposed algorithm (Wu and Braatz (2023)), only applicable to input-constrained MPC, but also enjoys exact recovery feature (exactly recover the same solution when the original problem is feasible) of $\ell_1$ penalty-based soft-constrained MPC formulation without suffering numerical difficulty of the resulting non-smoothness. Other various real-time QP applications, not limited to MPC, would also benefit from our QP algorithm with execution-time certificate and global feasibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.13273v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting and decision-making are generally modeled as two sequential steps with no feedback, following an open-loop approach. In this paper, we present application-driven learning, a new closed-loop framework in which the processes of forecasting and decision-making are merged and co-optimized through a bilevel optimization problem. We present our methodology in a general format and prove that the solution converges to the best estimator in terms of the expected cost of the selected application. Then, we propose two solution methods: an exact method based on the KKT conditions of the second-level problem and a scalable heuristic approach suitable for decomposition methods. The proposed methodology is applied to the relevant problem of defining dynamic reserve requirements and conditional load forecasts, offering an alternative approach to current ad hoc procedures implemented in industry practices. We benchmark our methodology with the standard sequential least-squares forecast and dispatch planning process. We apply the proposed methodology to an illustrative system and to a wide range of instances, from dozens of buses to large-scale realistic systems with thousands of buses. Our results show that the proposed methodology is scalable and yields consistently better performance than the standard open-loop approach.</description>

      <title>Optimum Noise Mechanism for Differentially Private Queries in Discrete Finite Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.11661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Differential Privacy (DP) literature often centers on meeting privacy constraints by introducing noise to the query, typically using a pre-specified parametric distribution model with one or two degrees of freedom. However, this emphasis tends to neglect the crucial considerations of response accuracy and utility, especially in the context of categorical or discrete numerical database queries, where the parameters defining the noise distribution are finite and could be chosen optimally. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel framework for designing an optimal noise Probability Mass Function (PMF) tailored to discrete and finite query sets. Our approach considers the modulo summation of random noise as the DP mechanism, aiming to present a tractable solution that not only satisfies privacy constraints but also minimizes query distortion. Unlike existing approaches focused solely on meeting privacy constraints, our framework seeks to optimize the noise distribution under an arbitrary $(\epsilon, \delta)$ constraint, thereby enhancing the accuracy and utility of the response. We demonstrate that the optimal PMF can be obtained through solving a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP). Additionally, closed-form solutions for the optimal PMF are provided, minimizing the probability of error for two specific cases. Numerical experiments highlight the superior performance of our proposed optimal mechanisms compared to state-of-the-art methods. This paper contributes to the DP literature by presenting a clear and systematic approach to designing noise mechanisms that not only satisfy privacy requirements but also optimize query distortion. The framework introduced here opens avenues for improved privacy-preserving database queries, offering significant enhancements in response accuracy and utility.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Programming in Probability Spaces via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study discrete-time finite-horizon optimal control problems in probability spaces, whereby the state of the system is a probability measure. We show that, in many instances, the solution of dynamic programming in probability spaces results from two ingredients: (i) the solution of dynamic programming in the "ground space" (i.e., the space on which the probability measures live) and (ii) the solution of an optimal transport problem. From a multi-agent control perspective, a separation principle holds: The "low-level control of the agents of the fleet" (how does one reach the destination?) and "fleet-level control" (who goes where?) are decoupled.</description>

      <title>Fully Automated Verification of Linear Time-Invariant Systems against Signal Temporal Logic Specifications via Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While reachability analysis is one of the most promising approaches for formal verification of dynamic systems, a major disadvantage preventing a more widespread application is the requirement to manually tune algorithm parameters such as the time step size. Manual tuning is especially problematic if one aims to verify that the system satisfies complicated specifications described by signal temporal logic formulas since the effect the tightness of the reachable set has on the satisfaction of the specification is often non-trivial to see for humans. We address this problem with a fully-automated verifier for linear systems, which automatically refines all parameters for reachability analysis until it can either prove or disprove that the system satisfies a signal temporal logic formula for all initial states and all uncertain inputs. Our verifier combines reachset temporal logic with dependency preservation to obtain a model checking approach whose over-approximation error converges to zero for adequately tuned parameters. While we in this work focus on linear systems for simplicity, the general concept we present can equivalently be applied for nonlinear and hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems through RNNs: Power of Randomness in Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are known to be universal approximators of dynamic systems under fairly mild and general assumptions. However, RNNs usually suffer from the issues of vanishing and exploding gradients in standard RNN training. Reservoir computing (RC), a special RNN where the recurrent weights are randomized and left untrained, has been introduced to overcome these issues and has demonstrated superior empirical performance especially in scenarios where training samples are extremely limited. On the other hand, the theoretical grounding to support this observed performance has yet been fully developed. In this work, we show that RC can universally approximate a general linear time-invariant (LTI) system. Specifically, we present a clear signal processing interpretation of RC and utilize this understanding in the problem of approximating a generic LTI system. Under this setup, we analytically characterize the optimum probability density function for configuring (instead of training and/or randomly generating) the recurrent weights of the underlying RNN of the RC. Extensive numerical evaluations are provided to validate the optimality of the derived distribution for configuring the recurrent weights of the RC to approximate a general LTI system. Our work results in clear signal processing-based model interpretability of RC and provides theoretical explanation/justification for the power of randomness in randomly generating instead of training RC's recurrent weights. Furthermore, it provides a complete optimum analytical characterization for configuring the untrained recurrent weights, marking an important step towards explainable machine learning (XML) to incorporate domain knowledge for efficient learning.</description>

      <title>Learning Dissipative Neural Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an unknown nonlinear dynamical system that is known to be dissipative. The objective of this paper is to learn a neural dynamical model that approximates this system, while preserving the dissipativity property in the model. In general, imposing dissipativity constraints during neural network training is a hard problem for which no known techniques exist. In this work, we address the problem of learning a dissipative neural dynamical system model in two stages. First, we learn an unconstrained neural dynamical model that closely approximates the system dynamics. Next, we derive sufficient conditions to perturb the weights of the neural dynamical model to ensure dissipativity, followed by perturbation of the biases to retain the fit of the model to the trajectories of the nonlinear system. We show that these two perturbation problems can be solved independently to obtain a neural dynamical model that is guaranteed to be dissipative while closely approximating the nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>Integrating Graceful Degradation and Recovery through Requirement-driven Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to environmental uncertainties such as adverse operating conditions, malicious attacks, and hardware degradation. These uncertainties may lead to failures that put the system in a sub-optimal or unsafe state. Systems that are resilient to such uncertainties rely on two types of operations: (1) graceful degradation, to ensure that the system maintains an acceptable level of safety during unexpected environmental conditions and (2) recovery, to facilitate the resumption of normal system functions. Typically, mechanisms for degradation and recovery are developed independently from each other, and later integrated into a system, requiring the designer to develop an additional, ad-hoc logic for activating and coordinating between the two operations. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptation approach for improving system resiliency through automated triggering and coordination of graceful degradation and recovery. The key idea behind our approach is to treat degradation and recovery as requirement-driven adaptation tasks: Degradation can be thought of as temporarily weakening original (i.e., ideal) system requirements to be achieved by the system, and recovery as strengthening the weakened requirements when the environment returns within an expected operating boundary. Furthermore, by treating weakening and strengthening as dual operations, we argue that a single requirement-based adaptation method is sufficient to enable coordination between degradation and recovery. Given system requirements specified in signal temporal logic (STL), we propose a run-time adaptation framework that performs degradation and recovery in response to environmental changes. We describe a prototype implementation of our framework and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach using a case study in unmanned underwater vehicles.</description>

      <title>Spatial Assisted Human-Drone Collaborative Navigation and Interaction through Immersive Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aerial robots have the potential to play a crucial role in assisting humans with complex and dangerous tasks. Nevertheless, the future industry demands innovative solutions to streamline the interaction process between humans and drones to enable seamless collaboration and efficient co-working. In this paper, we present a novel tele-immersive framework that promotes cognitive and physical collaboration between humans and robots through Mixed Reality (MR). This framework incorporates a novel bi-directional spatial awareness and a multi-modal virtual-physical interaction approaches. The former seamlessly integrates the physical and virtual worlds, offering bidirectional egocentric and exocentric environmental representations. The latter, leveraging the proposed spatial representation, further enhances the collaboration combining a robot planning algorithm for obstacle avoidance with a variable admittance control. This allows users to issue commands based on virtual forces while maintaining compatibility with the environment map. We validate the proposed approach by performing several collaborative planning and exploration tasks involving a drone and an user equipped with a MR headset.</description>

      <title>Metarobotics for Industry and Society: Vision, Technologies, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metarobotics aims to combine next generation wireless communication, multi-sense immersion, and collective intelligence to provide a pervasive, itinerant, and non-invasive access and interaction with distant robotized applications. Industry and society are expected to benefit from these functionalities. For instance, robot programmers will no longer travel worldwide to plan and test robot motions, even collaboratively. Instead, they will have a personalized access to robots and their environments from anywhere, thus spending more time with family and friends. Students enrolled in robotics courses will be taught under authentic industrial conditions in real-time. This paper describes objectives of Metarobotics in society, industry, and in-between. It identifies and surveys technologies likely to enable their completion and provides an architecture to put forward the interplay of key components of Metarobotics. Potentials for self-determination, self-efficacy, and work-life-flexibility in robotics-related applications in Society 5.0, Industry 4.0, and Industry 5.0 are outlined.</description>

      <title>SEPE-SQED: Symbolic Quick Error Detection by Semantically Equivalent Program Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic quick error detection (SQED) has greatly improved efficiency in formal chip verification. However, it has a limitation in detecting single-instruction bugs due to its reliance on the self-consistency property. To address this, we propose a new variant called symbolic quick error detection by semantically equivalent program execution (SEPE-SQED), which utilizes program synthesis techniques to find sequences with equivalent meanings to original instructions. SEPE-SQED effectively detects single-instruction bugs by differentiating their impact on the original instruction and its semantically equivalent program (instruction sequence). To manage the search space associated with program synthesis, we introduce the CEGIS based on the highest priority first algorithm. The experimental results show that our proposed CEGIS approach improves the speed of generating the desired set of equivalent programs by 50% in time compared to previous methods. Compared to SQED, SEPE-SQED offers a wider variety of instruction combinations and can provide a shorter trace for triggering bugs in certain scenarios.</description>
