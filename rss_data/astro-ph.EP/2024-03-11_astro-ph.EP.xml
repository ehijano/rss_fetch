      <title>Helium in the Extended Atmosphere of the Warm Super-Puff TOI-1420b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-puffs are planets with exceptionally low densities ($\rho \lesssim 0.1$~g~cm$^{-3}$) and core masses ($M_c \lesssim 5 M_\oplus$). Many lower-mass ($M_p\lesssim10M_\oplus$) super-puffs are expected to be unstable to catastrophic mass loss via photoevaporation and/or boil-off, whereas the larger gravitational potentials of higher-mass ($M_p\gtrsim10M_\oplus$) super-puffs should make them more stable to these processes. We test this expectation by studying atmospheric loss in the warm, higher-mass super-puff TOI-1420b ($M = 25.1M_\oplus$, $R = 11.9R_\oplus$, $\rho = 0.08$~g~cm$^{-3}$, $T_\mathrm{eq} = 960$~K). We observed one full transit and one partial transit of this planet using the metastable helium filter on Palomar/WIRC and found that the helium transits were $0.671\pm0.079\%$ (8.5$\sigma$) deeper than the TESS transits, indicating an outflowing atmosphere. We modeled the excess helium absorption using a self-consistent 1D hydrodynamics code to constrain the thermal structure of the outflow given different assumptions for the stellar XUV spectrum. These calculations then informed a 3D simulation which provided a good match to the observations with a modest planetary mass-loss rate of $10^{10.82}$~g~s$^{-1}$ ($M_p/\dot{M}\approx70$~Gyr). Super-puffs with $M_p\gtrsim10M_\oplus$, like TOI-1420b and WASP-107b, appear perfectly capable of retaining atmospheres over long timescales; therefore, these planets may have formed with the unusually large envelope mass fractions they appear to possess today. Alternatively, tidal circularization could have plausibly heated and inflated these planets, which would bring their envelope mass fractions into better agreement with expectations from core-nucleated accretion.</description>

      <title>Damping Obliquities of Hot Jupiter Hosts by Resonance Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When orbiting hotter stars, hot Jupiters are often highly inclined relative to their host star equator planes. By contrast, hot Jupiters orbiting cooler stars are more aligned. Prior attempts to explain this correlation between stellar obliquity and effective temperature have proven problematic. We show how resonance locking -- the coupling of the planet's orbit to a stellar gravity mode (g mode) -- can solve this mystery. Cooler stars with their radiative cores are more likely to be found with g-mode frequencies increased substantially by core hydrogen burning. Strong frequency evolution in resonance lock drives strong tidal evolution; locking to an axisymmetric g mode damps semi-major axes, eccentricities, and as we show for the first time, obliquities. Around cooler stars, hot Jupiters evolve into spin-orbit alignment and avoid engulfment. Hotter stars lack radiative cores, and therefore preserve congenital spin-orbit misalignments. We focus on resonance locks with axisymmetric modes, supplementing our technical results with simple physical interpretations, and show that non-axisymmetric modes also damp obliquity.</description>

      <title>Formation and Structure of Circumplanetary Disks and Envelopes during the Late Stages of Giant Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant planets are expected to form within circumplanetary disks, which shape their formation history and the local environment. Here, we consider the formation and structure of circumplanetary disks that arise during the late stages of giant planet formation. During this phase, when most of the final mass is accumulated, incoming material enters the Hill sphere and falls toward the planet. In the absence of torques, the falling parcels of gas conserve their specific angular momentum and collect into a circumplanetary disk. Generalizing previous work, we consider a range of possible geometries for the flow entering the sphere of influence of the planet. Specifically, we consider five geometric patterns for the inward flow, ranging from concentration toward the rotational poles of the system to isotropic flow to concentration along the equatorial plane. For each case, we derive analytic descriptions for the density field of the infall region, the disk surface density in the absence of viscosity, and steady-state solutions for viscous disks. These results, in turn, specify the luminosity contributions of the planet, the circumplanetary disk, and the envelope. These power sources, in conjunction with the surrounding material, collectively determine the observational appearance of the forming planet. We conclude with an approximate determination of these radiative signatures.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Observations of Meteor Radio Afterglows with the OVRO-LWA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted an all-sky imaging transient search with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) data collected during the Perseid meteor shower in 2018. The data collection during the meteor shower was motivated to conduct a search for intrinsic radio emission from meteors below 60 MHz known as the meteor radio afterglows (MRAs). The data collected were calibrated and imaged using the core array to obtain lower angular resolution images of the sky. These images were input to a pre-existing LWA transient search pipeline to search for MRAs as well as cosmic radio transients. This search detected 5 MRAs and did not find any cosmic transients. We further conducted peeling of bright sources, near-field correction, visibility differencing and higher angular resolution imaging using the full array for these 5 MRAs. These higher angular resolution images were used to study their plasma emission structures and monitor their evolution as a function of frequency and time. With higher angular resolution imaging, we resolved the radio emission size scales to less than 1 km physical size at 100 km heights. The spectral index mapping of one of the long duration event showed signs of diffusion of plasma within the meteor trails. The unpolarized emission from the resolved radio components suggest resonant transition radiation as the possible radiation mechanism of MRAs.</description>

      <title>Interaction between a Coronal Mass Ejection and Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) and a comet has been observed several times by in-situ observations from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC), which is designed to investigate the cometary magnetosphere of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG). Goetz et al. (2019) reported a magnetic field of up to 300 nT measured in the inner coma, which is among the largest interplanetary magnetic fields observed in the solar system. They suggested the large magnetic field observations in the inner coma come from magnetic field pile-up regions, which are generated by the interaction between a CME and/or corotating interaction region and the cometary magnetosphere. However, the detailed interaction between a CME and the cometary magnetosphere of comet CG in the inner coma has not been investigated by numerical simulations yet. In this manuscript, we will use a numerical model to simulate the interaction between comet CG and a Halloween class CME and investigate its magnetospheric response to the CME. We find that the plasma structures change significantly during the CME event, and the maximum value of the magnetic field strength is more than 500nT close to the nucleus. Virtual satellites at similar distances as Rosetta show that the magnetic field strength can be as large as 250nT, which is slightly less than what Goetz et al. (2019) reported.</description>

      <title>TOI-1173 A $b$: The First Inflated Super-Neptune in a Wide Binary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among Neptunian mass planets exoplanets ($20-50$ M$_\oplus$), puffy hot Neptunes are extremely rare, and their unique combination of low mass and extended radii implies very low density ($\rho &lt; 0.3$ g cm$^{-3}$). Over the last decade, only a few puffy planets have been detected and precisely characterized with both transit and radial velocity observations, most notably including WASP-107 $b$, TOI-1420 $b$, and WASP-193 $b$. In this paper, we report the discovery of TOI-1173 A $b$, a low-density ($\rho = 0.269_{-0.024}^{+0.028}$ g cm$^{-3}$) super-Neptune with $P = 7.06$ days in a nearly circular orbit around the primary G-dwarf star in the wide binary system TOI-1173 A/B. Using radial velocity observations with the MAROON-X spectrograph and transit photometry from TESS, we determined a planet mass of $M_{\rm{p}} = 26.1\pm1.9\ M_{\oplus}$ and radius of $R_{\rm{p}} = 8.10\pm0.17\ R_{\oplus}$. TOI-1173 A $b$ is the first puffy Super-Neptune planet detected in a wide binary system (separation $\sim 11,400$ AU). We explored several mechanisms to understand the puffy nature of TOI-1173 A $b$, and showed that tidal heating is the most promising explanation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TOI-1173 A $b$ likely has maintained its orbital stability over time and may have undergone von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai migration followed by tidal circularization given its present-day architecture, with important implications for planet migration theory and induced engulfment into the host star. Further investigation of the atmosphere of TOI-1173 A $b$ will shed light on the origin of close-in low-density Neptunian planets in field and binary systems, while spin-orbit analyses may elucidate the dynamical evolution of the system.</description>

      <title>Coupled geophysical and thermal constraints link between Mars basal molten layer and the planet viscosity profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the tidal deformations of Mars, we explored various Mars internal structures by examining profiles that include or exclude a basal molten layer within the mantle and a solid inner core. By assessing their compatibility with a diverse set of geophysical observations we show that despite the very short periods of excitation, tidal deformation is very efficient to constraint the Mars interior. We calculated densities and thicknesses for Martian lithosphere, mantle, {core-mantle boundary} layer and core and {found them} coherent with preexisting results from other methods. We also estimated new viscosities for these layers. We demonstrated that the geodetic record associated with thermal constraint is very sensitive to the {presence} of a basal molten layer in deep Martian mantle, and less sensitive to the solid core. Our results also indicate that the existence of the basal molten layer necessarily comes together with an inversion of viscosity between the lithosphere and the mantle. In this case, we could attribute this reverse viscosity contrast to the poor hydration state of Martian mantle and we underlined that this result prevents a strict Earth-like plate tectonics on Mars. The existence of the basal molten layer is also associated with a non-inversion of viscosity between the core-mantle boundary layer and the liquid core. Finally, in our results, a basal molten layer is incompatible with the existence of a solid inner core. Efforts to detect basal molten layer are then of prime importance to decipher the Martian interior. {Inversely, viscosity profiles appear to be very good tools for probing the existence of such molten layer at the base of the Mars mantle.</description>

      <title>ExoCubed: A Riemann-Solver based Cubed-Sphere Dynamic Core for Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational fluid dynamics on a sphere is relevant to global simulations of geophysical fluid dynamics. Using the conventional spherical-polar (or lat-lon) grid results in a singularity at the poles, with orders of magnitude smaller cell sizes at the poles in comparison to the equator. To address this problem, we developed a general circulation model (dynamic core) with a gnomonic equiangular cubed-sphere configuration. This model is developed based on the Simulating Nonhydrostatic Atmospheres on Planets (SNAP) model, using a finite volume numerical scheme with a Riemann-solver-based dynamic core and the vertical implicit correction (VIC) scheme. This change of the horizontal configuration gives a 20-time acceleration of global simulations compared to the lat-lon grid with a similar number of cells at medium resolution. We presented standard tests ranging from 2D shallow-water models to 3D general circulation tests, including earth-like planets and shallow hot Jupiters, to validate the accuracy of the model. The method described in this article is generic to transform any existing finite-volume hydrodynamic model in the Cartesian geometry to the spherical geometry.</description>

      <title>3D simulations of TRAPPIST-1e with varying CO2, CH4 and haze profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a 3D General Circulation Model, the Unified Model, we present results from simulations of a tidally-locked TRAPPIST-1e with varying carbon dioxide CO2 and methane CH4 gas concentrations, and their corresponding prescribed spherical haze profiles. Our results show that the presence of CO2 leads to a warmer atmosphere globally due to its greenhouse effect, with the increase of surface temperature on the dayside surface reaching up to ~14.1 K, and on the nightside up to ~21.2 K. Increasing presence of CH4 first elevates the surface temperature on the dayside, followed by a decrease due to the balance of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling. A thin layer of haze, formed when the partial pressures of CH4 to CO2 (pCH4/pCO2) = 0.1, leads to a dayside warming of ~4.9K due to a change in the water vapour H2O distribution. The presence of a haze layer that formed beyond the ratio of 0.1 leads to dayside cooling. The haze reaches an optical threshold thickness when pCH4/pCO2 ~0.4 beyond which the dayside mean surface temperature does not vary much. The planet is more favourable to maintaining liquid water on the surface (mean surface temperature above 273.15 K) when pCO2 is high, pCH4 is low and the haze layer is thin. The effect of CO2, CH4 and haze on the dayside is similar to that for a rapidly-rotating planet. On the contrary, their effect on the nightside depends on the wind structure and the wind speed in the simulation.</description>

      <title>Effects of a dark matter caustic passing through the Oort Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a dark matter caustic passing through the Solar System. We find, confirming a previous result, that the Sun tracks the caustic surface for some time. We integrate numerically the equations of motion of the Sun and a comet for a large number of initial conditions and of caustic passage properties. We calculate the probability for the comet to escape the Solar System and the probability for it to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun, given the initial semi-major axis and eccentricity of its orbit. We find that the average probability for a comet to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun is of order $3 \cdot 10^{-4}$ and that comets which are initially at a distance larger than about $10^5$ A.U. have a probability of order one to be ejected from the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Tidal synchronization trapping in stars and planets with convective envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal torques can alter the spins of tidally interacting stars and planets, usually over shorter timescales than the tidal damping of orbital separations or eccentricities. Simple tidal models predict that in eccentric binary or planetary systems, rotation periods will evolve toward a "pseudosynchronous" ratio with the orbital period. However, this prediction does not account for "inertial" waves that are present in stars or gaseous planets with (i) convective envelopes, and (ii) even very slow rotation. We demonstrate that tidal driving of inertial oscillations in eccentric systems generically produces a network of stable "synchronization traps" at ratios of orbital to rotation period that are simple to predict, but can deviate significantly from pseudosynchronization. The mechanism underlying spin synchronization trapping is similar to tidal resonance locking, involving a balance between torques that is maintained automatically by the scaling of inertial mode frequencies with the rotation rate. In contrast with many resonance locking scenarios, however, the torque balance required for synchronization trapping need not drive mode amplitudes to nonlinearity. Synchronization traps may provide an explanation for low-mass stars and hot Jupiters with observed rotation rates that deviate from pseudosynchronous or synchronous expectations.</description>

      <title>Photodissociation and induced chemical asymmetries on ultra-hot gas giants. A case study of HCN on WASP-76 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations have resulted in the detection of chemical gradients on ultra-hot gas giants. Notwithstanding their high temperature, chemical reactions in ultra-hot atmospheres may occur in disequilibrium, due to vigorous day-night circulation and intense UV radiation from their stellar hosts. The goal of this work is to explore whether photochemistry is affecting the composition of ultra-hot giant planets, and if it can introduce horizontal chemical gradients. In particular, we focus on hydrogen cyanide (HCN) on WASP-76 b, as it is a photochemically active molecule with a reported detection on only one side of this planet. We use a pseudo-2D chemical kinetics code to model the chemical composition of WASP-76 b along its equator. Our approach improves on chemical equilibrium models by computing vertical mixing, horizontal advection, and photochemistry. We find that production of HCN is initiated through thermal and photochemical dissociation of CO and N$_2$ on the day side of WASP-76 b. The resulting radicals are subsequently transported to the night side via the equatorial jet stream, where they recombine into different molecules. This process results in an HCN gradient with a maximal abundance on the planet's morning limb. We verified that photochemical dissociation is a necessary condition for this mechanism, as thermal dissociation alone proves insufficient. Other species produced via night-side disequilibrium chemistry are SO$_2$ and S$_2$. Our model acts as a proof of concept for chemical gradients on ultra-hot exoplanets. We demonstrate that even ultra-hot planets can exhibit disequilibrium chemistry and recommend that future studies do not neglect photochemistry in their analyses of ultra-hot planets.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field of gas giant exoplanets and its influence on the retention of their exomoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07387v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the magnetic and tidal interactions of a gas-giant exoplanet with its host star and with its exomoons, and focus on their retention. We briefly revisit the scaling law for planetary dynamo in terms of its mass, radius and luminosity. Based on the virial theorem, we construct an evolution law for planetary magnetic field and find that its initial entropy is important for the field evolution of a high-mass planet. We estimate the magnetic torques on orbit arising from the star-planet and planet-moon magnetic interactions, and find that it can compensate tidal torques and bypass frequency valleys where dynamical-tide response is ineffective. For exomoon's retention we consider two situations. In the presence of a circumplanetary disk (CPD), by comparison between CPD's inner and outer radii, we find that planets with too strong magnetic fields or too small distance from its host star tend not to host exomoons. During the subsequent CPD-free evolution, we find, by comparison between planet's spindown and moon's migration timescales, that hot Jupiters with periods of several days are unlikely to retain large exomoons, albeit they could be surrounded by rings from the debris of tidally disrupted moons. In contrast, moons, if formed around warm or cold Jupiters, can be preserved. Finally, we estimate the radio power and flux density due to the star-planet and planet-moon magnetic interactions and give the upper limit of detection distance by FAST.</description>

      <title>Rotation curves in protoplanetary disks with thermal stratification</title>

Abstract: In recent years the gas kinematics probed by molecular lines detected with ALMA has opened a new window to study protoplanetary disks. High spatial and spectral resolution observations have revealed the complexity of protoplanetary disk structure and correctly interpreting these data allow us to gain a better comprehension of the planet formation process. We investigate the impact of thermal stratification on the azimuthal velocity of protoplanetary disks. High resolution gas observations are showing velocity differences between CO isotopologues, which cannot be adequately explained with vertically isothermal models. The aim of this work is to determine whether a stratified model can explain this discrepancy. We analytically solve the hydrostatic equilibrium for a stratified disk and we derive the azimuthal velocity. We test the model with SPH numerical simulations and then we use it to fit for star mass, disk mass and scale radius of the sources in the MAPS sample. In particular, we use 12CO and 13CO datacubes.</description>

      <title>The effect of cloudy atmospheres on the thermal evolution of warm giant planets from an interior modelling perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the influence of cloudy atmospheres on the thermal radius evolution of warm exoplanets from an interior modelling perspective. By applying a physically motivated but simple parameterized cloud model, we obtain the atmospheric $P$-$T$ structure that is connected to the adiabatic interior at the self-consistently calculated radiative-convective boundary. We investigate the impact of cloud gradients, with the possibility of inhibiting superadiabatic clouds. Furthermore, we explore the impact on the radius evolution for a cloud base fixed at a certain pressure versus a subsiding cloud base during the planets' thermal evolution. We find that deep clouds clearly alter the evolution tracks of warm giants, leading to either slower/faster cooling than in the cloudless case (depending on the cloud model used). When comparing the fixed versus dynamic cloud base during evolution, we see an enhanced behaviour resulting in a faster or slower cooling in the case of the dynamic cloud base. We show that atmospheric models including deep clouds can lead to degeneracy in predicting the bulk metallicity of planets, $Z_\mathrm{P}$. For WASP-10b, we find a possible span of $\approx {Z_\mathrm{P}}_{-0.06}^{+0.10}$. For TOI-1268b, it is $\approx {Z_\mathrm{P}}_{-0.05}^{+0.10}$. Further work on cloud properties during the long-term evolution of gas giants is needed to better estimate the influence on the radius evolution.</description>

      <title>A Search for Temporal Atmospheric Variability of Kepler Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a systematic search for atmospheric variability in short-period gas-giant planets (hot Jupiters) observed by the Kepler mission, by looking for temporal variability of their secondary eclipse depths. This is motivated by a recent detection of a decrease in the dayside brightness of KELT-1 b between TESS Sectors 17 and 57, separated by about 3 years. We fit the Kepler light curves of 53 hot Jupiters and measure their secondary eclipse depths during individual Kepler quarters and 4-quarter windows. We detect the secondary eclipses in individual quarters or four-quarter windows for 17 out of the 53 systems. In those 17 systems we do not detect statistically significant astrophysical variation in the secondary eclipse depths. We show that the data is sensitive to the variability seen for KELT-1 b in TESS data. Therefore, the absence of detected secondary eclipse variability in Kepler data suggests that the atmospheric variability in KELT-1 b is not common. In addition, several of the 53 targets we investigated display variability in their transit depths with a period of 4 quarters (1 year). This instrumental signal is likely present in the light curves of other transiting planets we did not analyze and other variable stars observed by Kepler. Finally, we find that Kepler-488 b has a secondary eclipse depth that is unphysically large for a planet, and thus is likely a misclassified red dwarf.</description>

      <title>Zonostrophic turbulence in the subsurface oceans of the Jovian and Saturnian moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to characterize the global circulation of the subsurface ocean of Jovian and Saturnian moons, we analyze the properties of 21 three-dimensional simulations of Boussinesq thermal convection in a rapidly rotating spherical shell. Flow is driven by an adverse temperature contrast imposed across the domain, and is subjected to no-slip boundary conditions. We cover a region of parameter space previously unexplored by global simulations, both in terms of rapid rotation and vigor of convective forcing, closer to, yet still admittedly far from, the conditions appropriate for the subsurface ocean of Ganymede, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. Our most extreme simulations exhibit a dynamic global circulation that combines powerful east-west zonal jets, planetary waves, and vortices. A spectral analysis of the kinetic energy distribution performed in cylindrical geometry reveals a high degree of anisotropy of the simulated flows. Specifically, the axisymmetric zonal energy spectra follow a steep $-5$ slope in wavenumber space, with the energy amplitude exclusively controlled by the rotation rate. In contrast, the non-axisymmetric residual spectra display a gentle $-5/3$ slope, with the energy amplitude controlled by the thermal buoyancy input power. This spectral behavior conforms with the theory of zonostrophic turbulence and allows us to propose tentative extrapolations of these findings to the more extreme conditions of icy satellites. By assuming that kinetic energy dissipates via Ekman friction we predict an upper bound for the zonal velocity ranging from a few centimeters per second for Enceladus to about one meter per second for Ganymede, with residual velocities smaller than the zonal velocity by an order of magnitude on each moon. These predictions yield typical jets size approaching the ocean depth of Titan, Ganymede and Europa and $10$ to $40\%$ of the ocean depth on Enceladus.</description>

      <title>89 New Ultracool Dwarf Co-Moving Companions Identified With The Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 Citizen Science Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the identification of 89 new systems containing ultracool dwarf companions to main sequence stars and white dwarfs, using the citizen science project Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 and cross-reference between Gaia and CatWISE2020. Thirty-two of these companions and thirty-three host stars were followed up with spectroscopic observations, with companion spectral types ranging from M7-T9 and host spectral types ranging from G2-M9. These systems exhibit diverse characteristics, from young to old ages, blue to very red spectral morphologies, potential membership to known young moving groups, and evidence of spectral binarity in 9 companions. Twenty of the host stars in our sample show evidence for higher order multiplicity, with an additional 11 host stars being resolved binaries themselves. We compare this sample's characteristics with those of the known stellar binary and exoplanet populations, and find our sample begins to fill in the gap between directly imaged exoplanets and stellary binaries on mass ratio-binding energy plots. With this study, we increase the population of ultracool dwarf companions to FGK stars by $\sim$42\%, and more than triple the known population of ultracool dwarf companions with separations larger than 1,000 au, providing excellent targets for future atmospheric retrievals.</description>
