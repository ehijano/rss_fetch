      <title>A Hodge-FAST Framework for High-Resolution Dynamic Functional Connectivity Analysis of Higher Order Interactions in EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Hodge decomposition with Filtered Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity to analyze dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) in EEG signals. This method leverages graph-based topology and simplicial analysis to explore transient connectivity patterns at multiple scales, addressing noise, sparsity, and computational efficiency. The temporal EEG data are first sparsified by keeping only the most globally important connections, instantaneous connectivity at these connections is then filtered by global long-term stable correlations. This tensor is then decomposed into three orthogonal components to study signal flows over higher-order structures such as triangle and loop structures. Our analysis of Alzheimer-related MCI patients show significant temporal differences related to higher-order interactions that a pairwise analysis on its own does not implicate. This allows us for the first time to capture higher-dimensional interactions at high temporal resolution in noisy EEG signal recordings.</description>

      <title>Exploring Radial Symmetry on Phased Arrays Using Particle Swarm Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phased antenna arrays enable dynamic beam shaping, which is essential for Non-Geostationary (NGSO) satellite communications where efficient beam distribution is important. This study focuses on thinning phased antenna arrays with circular apertures made up of eight replicated sectors. Circular apertures reduce the number of active elements, lowering system costs and improving radiation performance by evenly distributing energy, which helps to reduce Side Lobe Levels (SLL). Particle Swarm Optimization was used to approach the thinning problem, addressing the challenge of selecting which elements should be activated. The resulting design achieves an SLL of (-25.67 dB), outperforming previous designs with SLL reductions of (-22.53 dB). Achieved results underscore the potential of circular aperture phased arrays to improve beam quality, minimize interference, and deliver cost-effective solutions for NGSO satellites.</description>

      <title>Deep learning model for ECG reconstruction reveals the information content of ECG leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a deep learning model based on the U-net architecture to reconstruct missing leads in electrocardiograms (ECGs). Using publicly available datasets, the model was trained to regenerate 12-lead ECG data from reduced lead configurations, demonstrating high accuracy in lead reconstruction. The results highlight the ability of the model to quantify the information content of each ECG lead and their inter-lead correlations. This has significant implications for optimizing lead selection in diagnostic scenarios, particularly in settings where full 12-lead ECGs are impractical. Additionally, the study provides insights into the physiological underpinnings of ECG signals and their propagation. The findings pave the way for advancements in telemedicine, portable ECG devices, and personalized cardiac diagnostics by reducing redundancy and enhancing signal interpretation.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Analysis of Scattering From Building Surfaces at Millimeter-Wave Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In future air-to-ground integrated networks, the scattering effects from ground-based scatterers, such as buildings, cannot be neglected in millimeter-wave and higher frequency bands, and have a significant impact on channel characteristics. However, current scattering measurement studies primarily focus on single incident angles within the incident plane, leading to insufficient characterization of scattering properties. In this paper, we present scattering measurements conducted at 28 GHz on various real-world building surfaces with multiple incident angles and three-dimensional (3D) receiving angles. The measured data are analyzed in conjunction with parameterized scattering models in ray tracing and numerical simulations. Results indicate that for millimeter-wave channel modeling near building surfaces, it is crucial to account not only for surface materials but also for the scattering properties of the building surfaces with respect to the incident angle and receiving positions in 3D space.</description>

      <title>Learned Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound for Unknown Measurement Models Using Score Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB) is a crucial tool in signal processing for assessing the fundamental limitations of any estimation problem as well as benchmarking within a Bayesian frameworks. However, the BCRB cannot be computed without full knowledge of the prior and the measurement distributions. In this work, we propose a fully learned Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (LBCRB) that learns both the prior and the measurement distributions. Specifically, we suggest two approaches to obtain the LBCRB: the Posterior Approach and the Measurement-Prior Approach. The Posterior Approach provides a simple method to obtain the LBCRB, whereas the Measurement-Prior Approach enables us to incorporate domain knowledge to improve the sample complexity and {interpretability}. To achieve this, we introduce a Physics-encoded score neural network which enables us to easily incorporate such domain knowledge into a neural network. We {study the learning} errors of the two suggested approaches theoretically, and validate them numerically. We demonstrate the two approaches on several signal processing examples, including a linear measurement problem with unknown mixing and Gaussian noise covariance matrices, frequency estimation, and quantized measurement. In addition, we test our approach on a nonlinear signal processing problem of frequency estimation with real-world underwater ambient noise.</description>

      <title>On Overlap Ratio in Defocused Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D STEM) with data acquired using a defocused electron probe is a promising tool for characterising complex biological specimens and materials through a phase retrieval process known as Electron Ptychography (EP). The efficacy of 4D STEM acquisition and the resulting quality of EP reconstruction depends on the overlap ratio of adjacent illuminated areas. This paper demonstrates how the overlap ratio impacts the data redundancy and the quality of the EP reconstruction. We define two quantities as a function of the overlap ratio that are independent of both the object and the EP algorithm. Subsequently, we evaluate an EP algorithm for varying overlap ratios using simulated 4D STEM datasets. Notably, a 40% or greater overlap ratio yields stable, high-quality reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Subspace Variational Bayesian Inference for Joint Scattering Environment Sensing and Data Recovery in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a joint scattering environment sensing and data recovery problem in an uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. To facilitate joint scatterers localization and multi-user (MU) channel estimation, we introduce a three-dimensional (3D) location-domain sparse channel model to capture the joint sparsity of the MU channel (i.e., different user channels share partially overlapped scatterers). Then the joint problem is formulated as a bilinear structured sparse recovery problem with a dynamic position grid and imperfect parameters (such as time offset and user position errors). We propose an expectation maximization based turbo bilinear subspace variational Bayesian inference (EM-Turbo-BiSVBI) algorithm to solve the problem effectively, where the E-step performs Bayesian estimation of the the location-domain sparse MU channel by exploiting the joint sparsity, and the M-step refines the dynamic position grid and learns the imperfect factors via gradient update. Two methods are introduced to greatly reduce the complexity with almost no sacrifice on the performance and convergence speed: 1) a subspace constrained bilinear variational Bayesian inference (VBI) method is proposed to avoid any high-dimensional matrix inverse; 2) the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and subspace constrained VBI methods are combined to obtain a coarse estimation result to reduce the search range. Simulations verify the advantages of the proposed scheme over baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Direct Uplink Connectivity in Space MIMO Systems with THz and FSO Inter-Satellite Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates uplink transmission from a single-antenna mobile phone to a cluster of satellites, emphasizing the role of inter-satellite links (ISLs) in facilitating cooperative signal detection. The study focuses on non-ideal ISLs, examining both terahertz (THz) and free-space optical (FSO) ISLs concerning their ergodic capacity. We present a practical scenario derived from the recent 3GPP standard, specifying the frequency band, bandwidth, user and satellite antenna gains, power levels, and channel characteristics in alignment with the latest 3GPP for non-terrestrial networks (NTN). Additionally, we propose a satellite selection method to identify the optimal satellite as the master node (MN), responsible for signal processing. This method takes into account both the user-satellite link and ISL channels. For the THz ISL analysis, we derive a closed-form approximation for ergodic capacity under two scenarios: one with instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and another with only statistical CSI shared between satellites. For the FSO ISL analysis, we present a closed-form approximate upper bound for ergodic capacity, accounting for the impact of pointing error loss. Furthermore, we evaluate the effects of different ISL frequencies and pointing errors on spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that multi-satellite multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) satellite communication (SatCom) significantly outperforms single-satellite SatCom in terms of spectral efficiency. Additionally, our approximated upper bound for ergodic capacity closely aligns with results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communications for Secure UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel near-field integrated sensing and communications framework for secure unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with high time efficiency is proposed. A ground base station (GBS) with large aperture size communicates with one communication UAV (C-UAV) under the existence of one eavesdropping UAV (E-UAV), where the artificial noise (AN) is employed for both jamming and sensing purpose. Given that the E-UAV's motion model is unknown at the GBS, we first propose a near-field localization and trajectory tracking scheme. Specifically, exploiting the variant Doppler shift observations over the spatial domain in the near field, the E-UAV's three-dimensional (3D) velocities are estimated from echo signals. To provide the timely correction of location prediction errors, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is adopted to fuse the predicted states and the measured ones. Subsequently, based on the real-time predicated location of the E-UAV, we further propose a joint GBS beamforming and C-UAV trajectory design scheme for maximizing the instantaneous secrecy rate, while guaranteeing the sensing accuracy constraint. To solve the resultant non-convex problem, an alternating optimization approach is developed, where the near-field GBS beamforming and the C-UAV trajectory design subproblems are iteratively solved by exploiting the successive convex approximation method. Finally, our numerical results unveil that: 1) the E-UAV's 3D velocities and location can be accurately estimated in real time with our proposed framework by exploiting the near-field spherical wave propagation; and 2) the proposed framework achieves superior secrecy rate compared to benchmark schemes and closely approaches the performance when the E-UAV trajectory is perfectly known.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Fractional Matrix Programming Problems with Applications in FBL MU-MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient framework is conceived for fractional matrix programming (FMP) optimization problems (OPs) namely for minimization and maximization. In each generic OP, either the objective or the constraints are functions of multiple arbitrary continuous-domain fractional functions (FFs). This ensures the framework's versatility, enabling it to solve a broader range of OPs than classical FMP solvers, like Dinkelbach-based algorithms. Specifically, the generalized Dinkelbach algorithm can only solve multiple-ratio FMP problems. By contrast, our framework solves OPs associated with a sum or product of multiple FFs as the objective or constraint functions. Additionally, our framework provides a single-loop solution, while most FMP solvers require twin-loop algorithms.
  Many popular performance metrics of wireless communications are FFs. For instance, latency has a fractional structure, and minimizing the sum delay leads to an FMP problem. Moreover, the mean square error (MSE) and energy efficiency (EE) metrics have fractional structures. Thus, optimizing EE-related metrics such as the sum or geometric mean of EEs and enhancing the metrics related to spectral-versus-energy-efficiency tradeoff yield FMP problems. Furthermore, both the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the channel dispersion are FFs. In this paper, we also develop resource allocation schemes for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, using finite block length (FBL) coding, demonstrating attractive practical applications of FMP by optimizing the aforementioned metrics.</description>

      <title>Multi-target Range, Doppler and Angle estimation in MIMO-FMCW Radar with Limited Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar offers several performance and flexibility advantages over traditional radar arrays. However, high angular and Doppler resolutions necessitate a large number of antenna elements and the transmission of numerous chirps, leading to increased hardware and computational complexity. While compressive sensing (CS) has recently been applied to pulsed-waveform radars with sparse measurements, its application to frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar for target detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel CS-based multi-target localization algorithm in the range, Doppler, and angular domains for MIMO-FMCW radar, where we jointly estimate targets' velocities and angles of arrival. To this end, we present a signal model for sparse-random and uniform linear arrays based on three-dimensional spectral estimation. For range estimation, we propose a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based focusing and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based techniques, each with distinct advantages, while two-dimensional CS is used for joint Doppler-angle estimation. Leveraging the properties of structured random matrices, we establish theoretical uniform and non-uniform recovery guarantees with high probability for the proposed framework. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve similar detection performance and higher resolution compared to conventional DFT and MUSIC with fewer transmitted chirps and antenna elements.</description>

      <title>General Feature Extraction In SAR Target Classification: A Contrastive Learning Approach Across Sensor Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increased availability of SAR data has raised a growing interest in applying deep learning algorithms. However, the limited availability of labeled data poses a significant challenge for supervised training. This article introduces a new method for classifying SAR data with minimal labeled images. The method is based on a feature extractor Vit trained with contrastive learning. It is trained on a dataset completely different from the one on which classification is made. The effectiveness of the method is assessed through 2D visualization using t-SNE for qualitative evaluation and k-NN classification with a small number of labeled data for quantitative evaluation. Notably, our results outperform a k-NN on data processed with PCA and a ResNet-34 specifically trained for the task, achieving a 95.9% accuracy on the MSTAR dataset with just ten labeled images per class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing technological advancements towards miniaturized physiological measuring devices have enabled continuous monitoring of epileptic patients outside of specialized environments. The large amounts of data that can be recorded with such devices holds significant potential for developing automated seizure detection frameworks. In this work, we present SeizeIT2, the first open dataset of wearable data recorded in patients with focal epilepsy. The dataset comprises more than 11,000 hours of multimodal data, including behind-the-ear electroencephalography, electrocardiography, electromyography and movement (accelerometer and gyroscope) data. The dataset contains 886 focal seizures recorded from 125 patients across five different European Epileptic Monitoring Centers. We present a suggestive training/validation split to propel the development of AI methodologies for seizure detection, as well as two benchmark approaches and evaluation metrics. The dataset can be accessed on OpenNeuro and is stored in Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format.</description>

      <title>DRL-based Dolph-Tschebyscheff Beamforming in Downlink Transmission for Mobile Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of AI technologies in next-generation communication systems, machine learning plays a pivotal role due to its ability to address high-dimensional, non-stationary optimization problems within dynamic environments while maintaining computational efficiency. One such application is directional beamforming, achieved through learning-based blind beamforming techniques that utilize already existing radio frequency (RF) fingerprints of the user equipment obtained from the base stations and eliminate the need for additional hardware or channel and angle estimations. However, as the number of users and antenna dimensions increase, thereby expanding the problem's complexity, the learning process becomes increasingly challenging, and the performance of the learning-based method cannot match that of the optimal solution. In such a scenario, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based blind beamforming technique using a learnable Dolph-Tschebyscheff antenna array that can change its beam pattern to accommodate mobile users. Our simulation results show that the proposed method can support data rates very close to the best possible values.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel GPASS architecture is proposed for jointly learning pinching beamforming and transmit beamforming in pinching antenna systems (PASS). The GPASS is with a staged architecture, where the positions of pinching antennas are first learned by a sub-GNN. Then, the transmit beamforming is learned by another sub-GNN based on the antenna positions. The sub-GNNs are incorporated with the permutation property of the beamforming policy, which helps improve the learning performance. The optimal solution structure of transmit beamforming is also leveraged to simplify the mappings to be learned. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed architecture can achieve a higher SE than a heuristic baseline method with low inference complexity.</description>

      <title>Beamforming with Joint Phase and Time Array: System Design, Prototyping and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint phase-time arrays (JPTA) is a new mmWave radio frequency front-end architecture constructed with appending time-delay elements to phase shifters for analog beamforming. JPTA allows the mmWave base station (BS) to form multiple frequency-dependent beams with a single RF chain, exploiting the extra degrees of freedom the time-delay elements offer. Without requiring extra power-hungry RF chains, a BS with JPTA can schedule multiple users in different directions in a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) manner. A BS with JPTA achieves various advantages over the traditional analog beamforming system. Simulation results show that JPTA can bring significant system-level benefits, e.g., extending uplink throughput coverage by 100%. To realize these system benefits of JPTA, high-resolution delay elements with a wide delay dynamic range are essential. With newly developed delay elements, we demonstrate that a single TRX RF chain can serve four users in four different directions in the mmWave band.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Clustering based on String Compression to Extract P300 Structure in EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: P300 is an Event-Related Potential widely used in Brain-Computer Interfaces, but its detection is challenging due to inter-subject and temporal variability. This work introduces a clustering methodology based on Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) to extract the P300 structure, ensuring robustness against variability. We propose a novel signal-to-ASCII transformation to generate compression-friendly objects, which are then clustered using a hierarchical tree-based method and a multidimensional projection approach. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the method's ability to reveal relevant P300 structures, showing clustering performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, analysis at the electrode level suggests that the method could assist in electrode selection for P300 detection. This compression-driven clustering methodology offers a complementary tool for EEG analysis and P300 identification.</description>

      <title>Physics-Inspired Distributed Radio Map Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To gain panoramic awareness of spectrum coverage in complex wireless environments, data-driven learning approaches have recently been introduced for radio map estimation (RME). While existing deep learning based methods conduct RME given spectrum measurements gathered from dispersed sensors in the region of interest, they rely on centralized data at a fusion center, which however raises critical concerns on data privacy leakages and high communication overloads. Federated learning (FL) enhance data security and communication efficiency in RME by allowing multiple clients to collaborate in model training without directly sharing local data. However, the performance of the FL-based RME can be hindered by the problem of task heterogeneity across clients due to their unavailable or inaccurate landscaping information. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a physics-inspired distributed RME solution in the absence of landscaping information. The main idea is to develop a novel distributed RME framework empowered by leveraging the domain knowledge of radio propagation models, and by designing a new distributed learning approach that splits the entire RME model into two modules. A global autoencoder module is shared among clients to capture the common pathloss influence on radio propagation pattern, while a client-specific autoencoder module focuses on learning the individual features produced by local shadowing effects from the unique building distributions in local environment. Simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms the benchmarks in achieving higher performance.</description>

      <title>SSRepL-ADHD: Adaptive Complex Representation Learning Framework for ADHD Detection from Visual Attention Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self Supervised Representation Learning (SSRepL) can capture meaningful and robust representations of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) data and have the potential to improve the model's performance on also downstream different types of Neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) detection. In this paper, a novel SSRepL and Transfer Learning (TL)-based framework that incorporates a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) model is proposed to detect children with potential symptoms of ADHD. This model uses Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals extracted during visual attention tasks to accurately detect ADHD by preprocessing EEG signal quality through normalization, filtering, and data balancing. For the experimental analysis, we use three different models: 1) SSRepL and TL-based LSTM-GRU model named as SSRepL-ADHD, which integrates LSTM and GRU layers to capture temporal dependencies in the data, 2) lightweight SSRepL-based DNN model (LSSRepL-DNN), and 3) Random Forest (RF). In the study, these models are thoroughly evaluated using well-known performance metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score). The results show that the proposed SSRepL-ADHD model achieves the maximum accuracy of 81.11% while admitting the difficulties associated with dataset imbalance and feature selection.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Fourier Analysis Network (CFAN): A Unified Time-Frequency Approach for ECG Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has transformed the classification of biomedical signals such as electrocardiograms (ECGs). Advances in deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enable automatic feature extraction, raising the question: Can combining time- and frequency-domain attributes enhance classification accuracy? To explore this, we evaluated three ECG classification tasks: (1) arrhythmia detection, (2) identity recognition, and (3) apnea detection. We initially tested three methods: (i) 2-D spectrogram-based frequency-time classification (SPECT), (ii) time-domain classification using a 1-D CNN (CNN1D), and (iii) frequency-domain classification using a Fourier transform-based CNN (FFT1D). Performance was validated using K-fold cross-validation. Among these, CNN1D (time only) performed best, followed by SPECT (time-frequency) and FFT1D (frequency only). Surprisingly, SPECT, which integrates time- and frequency-domain features, performed worse than CNN1D, suggesting a need for a more effective time and frequency fusion approach. To address this, we tested the recently proposed Fourier Analysis Network (FAN), which combines time- and frequency-domain features. However, FAN performed comparably to CNN1D, excelling in some tasks while underperforming in others. To enhance this approach, we developed the Convolutional Fourier Analysis Network (CFAN), which integrates FAN with CNN. CFAN outperformed all previous methods across all classification tasks. These findings underscore the advantages of combining time- and frequency-domain features, demonstrating CFAN's potential as a powerful and versatile solution for ECG classification and broader biomedical signal analysis</description>

      <title>The Query/Hit Model for Sequential Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the Query/Hit (Q/H) learning model. The setup consists of two agents. One agent, Alice, has access to a streaming source, while the other, Bob, does not have direct access to the source. Communication occurs through sequential Q/H pairs: Bob sends a sequence of source symbols (queries), and Alice responds with the waiting time until each query appears in the source stream (hits). This model is motivated by scenarios with communication, computation, and privacy constraints that limit real-time access to the source. The error exponent for sequential hypothesis testing under the Q/H model is characterized, and a querying strategy, the Dynamic Scout-Sentinel Algorithm (DSSA), is proposed. The strategy employs a mutual information neural estimator to compute the error exponent associated with each query and to select the query with the highest efficiency. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets -- including mouse movement trajectories, typesetting patterns, and touch-based user interactions -- are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy in comparison with baselines, in terms of probability of error, query choice, and time-to-detection.</description>

      <title>Role of Mixup in Topological Persistence Based Knowledge Distillation for Wearable Sensor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of wearable sensor data has enabled many successes in several applications. To represent the high-sampling rate time-series with sufficient detail, the use of topological data analysis (TDA) has been considered, and it is found that TDA can complement other time-series features. Nonetheless, due to the large time consumption and high computational resource requirements of extracting topological features through TDA, it is difficult to deploy topological knowledge in various applications. To tackle this problem, knowledge distillation (KD) can be adopted, which is a technique facilitating model compression and transfer learning to generate a smaller model by transferring knowledge from a larger network. By leveraging multiple teachers in KD, both time-series and topological features can be transferred, and finally, a superior student using only time-series data is distilled. On the other hand, mixup has been popularly used as a robust data augmentation technique to enhance model performance during training. Mixup and KD employ similar learning strategies. In KD, the student model learns from the smoothed distribution generated by the teacher model, while mixup creates smoothed labels by blending two labels. Hence, this common smoothness serves as the connecting link that establishes a connection between these two methods. In this paper, we analyze the role of mixup in KD with time-series as well as topological persistence, employing multiple teachers. We present a comprehensive analysis of various methods in KD and mixup on wearable sensor data.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Cell Deployment Optimization for Capacity and Coverage of Ground and UAV Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general mathematical framework for optimizing cell deployment and antenna configuration in wireless networks, inspired by quantization theory. Unlike traditional methods, our framework supports networks with deterministically located nodes, enabling modeling and optimization under controlled deployment scenarios. We demonstrate our framework through two applications: joint fine-tuning of antenna parameters across base stations (BSs) to optimize network coverage, capacity, and load balancing, and the strategic deployment of new BSs, including the optimization of their locations and antenna settings. These optimizations are conducted for a heterogeneous 3D user population, comprising ground users (GUEs) and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) along aerial corridors. Our case studies highlight the framework's versatility in optimizing performance metrics such as the coverage-capacity trade-off and capacity per region. Our results confirm that optimizing the placement and orientation of additional BSs consistently outperforms approaches focused solely on antenna adjustments, regardless of GUE distribution. Furthermore, joint optimization for both GUEs and UAVs significantly enhances UAV service without severely affecting GUE performance.</description>

      <title>A Wearable Device Dataset for Mental Health Assessment Using Laser Doppler Flowmetry and Fluorescence Spectroscopy Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method to predict mental health by building machine learning models for a non-invasive wearable device equipped with Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) and Fluorescence Spectroscopy (FS) sensors. Besides, we present the corresponding dataset to predict mental health, e.g. depression, anxiety, and stress levels via the DAS-21 questionnaire. To our best knowledge, this is the world's largest and the most generalized dataset ever collected for both LDF and FS studies. The device captures cutaneous blood microcirculation parameters, and wavelet analysis of the LDF signal extracts key rhythmic oscillations. The dataset, collected from 132 volunteers aged 18-94 from 19 countries, explores relationships between physiological features, demographics, lifestyle habits, and health conditions. We employed a variety of machine learning methods to classify stress detection, in which LightGBM is identified as the most effective model for stress detection, achieving a ROC AUC of 0.7168 and a PR AUC of 0.8852. In addition, we also incorporated Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques into our analysis to investigate deeper insights into the model's predictions. Our results suggest that females, younger individuals and those with a higher Body Mass Index (BMI) or heart rate have a greater likelihood of experiencing mental health conditions like stress and anxiety.

      <title>Parallel Coding for Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel parallel coding transmission strategy and an iterative detection and decoding receiver signal processing technique for orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation. Specifically, the proposed approach employs a parallel channel encoding (PCE) scheme that consists of multiple short-length codewords for each delay-Doppler multicarrier (DDMC) symbol. Building upon such a PCE transmission framework, we then introduce an iterative detection and decoding algorithm incorporating a successive decoding feedback (SDF) technique, which enables instant information exchange between the detector and decoder for each DDMC symbol. To characterize the error performance of the proposed scheme, we perform density evolution analysis considering the finite blocklength effects. Our analysis results, coupled with extensive simulations, demonstrate that the proposed PCE scheme with the SDF algorithm not only showcases a better overall performance but also requires much less decoding complexity to implement, compared to the conventional benchmark scheme that relies on a single long channel code for coding the entire ODDM frame.</description>

      <title>Pulse-PPG: An Open-Source Field-Trained PPG Foundation Model for Wearable Applications Across Lab and Field Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based foundation models are gaining traction due to the widespread use of PPG in biosignal monitoring and their potential to generalize across diverse health applications. In this paper, we introduce Pulse-PPG, the first open-source PPG foundation model trained exclusively on raw PPG data collected over a 100-day field study with 120 participants. Existing PPG foundation models are either open-source but trained on clinical data or closed-source, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We evaluate Pulse-PPG across multiple datasets and downstream tasks, comparing its performance against a state-of-the-art foundation model trained on clinical data. Our results demonstrate that Pulse-PPG, trained on uncurated field data, exhibits superior generalization across clinical and mobile health applications in both lab and field settings. This suggests that exposure to real-world variability enables the model to learn fine-grained representations, making it more adaptable across tasks. Furthermore, pre-training on field data surprisingly outperforms its pre-training on clinical data in many tasks, reinforcing the importance of training on real-world, diverse datasets. To encourage further advancements in robust foundation models leveraging field data, we plan to release Pulse-PPG, providing researchers with a powerful resource for developing more generalizable PPG-based models.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel deep learning network for Active Speech Cancellation (ASC), advancing beyond Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) methods by effectively canceling both noise and speech signals. The proposed Multi-Band Mamba architecture segments input audio into distinct frequency bands, enabling precise anti-signal generation and improved phase alignment across frequencies. Additionally, we introduce an optimization-driven loss function that provides near-optimal supervisory signals for anti-signal generation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance gains, achieving up to 7.2dB improvement in ANC scenarios and 6.2dB in ASC, significantly outperforming existing methods.

      <title>Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>

      <title>Downlink Beamforming with Pinching-Antenna Assisted MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01590</link>

Abstract: Pinching antennas have been recently proposed as a promising flexible-antenna technology, which can be implemented by attaching low-cost pinching elements to dielectric waveguides. This work explores the potential of employing pinching antenna systems (PASs) for downlink transmission in a multiuser MIMO setting. We consider the problem of hybrid beamforming, where the digital precoder at the access point and the activated locations of the pinching elements are jointly optimized to maximize the achievable weighted sum-rate. Invoking fractional programming, a novel low-complexity algorithm is developed to iteratively update the precoding matrix and the locations of the pinching antennas. We validate the proposed scheme through extensive numerical experiments. Our investigations demonstrate that using PAS the system throughput can be significantly boosted as compared with the conventional fixed-location antenna systems, enlightening the potential of PAS as an enabling candidate for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Channel Ratio-of-Ratios Method for Noncontact Hand Video Based SpO$_2$ Monitoring Using Smartphone Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.08528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blood oxygen saturation (SpO$_2$) is an important indicator for pulmonary and respiratory functionalities. Clinical findings on COVID-19 show that many patients had dangerously low blood oxygen levels not long before conditions worsened. It is therefore recommended, especially for the vulnerable population, to regularly monitor the blood oxygen level for precaution. Recent works have investigated how ubiquitous smartphone cameras can be used to infer SpO$_2$. Most of these works are contact-based, requiring users to cover a phone's camera and its nearby light source with a finger to capture reemitted light from the illuminated tissue. Contact-based methods may lead to skin irritation and sanitary concerns, especially during a pandemic. In this paper, we propose a noncontact method for SpO$_2$ monitoring using hand videos acquired by smartphones. Considering the optical broadband nature of the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color channels of the smartphone cameras, we exploit all three channels of RGB sensing to distill the SpO$_2$ information beyond the traditional ratio-of-ratios (RoR) method that uses only two wavelengths. To further facilitate an accurate SpO$_2$ prediction, we design adaptive narrow bandpass filters based on accurately estimated heart rate to obtain the most cardiac-related AC component for each color channel. Experimental results show that our proposed blood oxygen estimation method can reach a mean absolute error of 1.26% when a pulse oximeter is used as a reference, outperforming the traditional RoR method by 25%.</description>

      <title>Universal Joint Source-Channel Coding for Modulation-Agnostic Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the perspective of joint source-channel coding (JSCC), there has been significant research on utilizing semantic communication, which inherently possesses analog characteristics, within digital device environments. However, a single-model approach that operates modulation-agnostically across various digital modulation orders has not yet been established. This article presents the first attempt at such an approach by proposing a universal joint source-channel coding (uJSCC) system that utilizes a single-model encoder-decoder pair and trained vector quantization (VQ) codebooks. To support various modulation orders within a single model, the operation of every neural network (NN)-based module in the uJSCC system requires the selection of modulation orders according to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) boundaries. To address the challenge of unequal output statistics from shared parameters across NN layers, we integrate multiple batch normalization (BN) layers, selected based on modulation order, after each NN layer. This integration occurs with minimal impact on the overall model size. Through a comprehensive series of experiments, we validate that the modulation-agnostic semantic communication framework demonstrates superiority over existing digital semantic communication approaches in terms of model complexity, communication efficiency, and task effectiveness.</description>

      <title>VBIM-Net: Variational Born Iterative Network for Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18731v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved structural rationality and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the analytical calculation of the contrast variation into each subnetwork, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, imposing soft physical constraints on the variables in the subnetworks, which benefits the model's performance. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new method to track extended targets of different shapes such as ellipses, rectangles and rhombi. We provide an analytical framework to express these shapes as superelliptical contours and propose a Bayesian filtering scheme that can handle measurements from the contour of the object. The method utilizes the Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering algorithm with novel sensor-object geometry constraints. The success of the algorithm is demonstrated using both simulations and real-data experiments, and the algorithm has been demonstrated to be of high performance in various challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Over-the-Air Federated Learning Using AI-based Fluid Antenna System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates an over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) system that employs fluid antennas (FAs) at an access point. The system enhances learning performance by leveraging the additional degrees of freedom provided by antenna mobility. We analyze the convergence of the OTA-FL system and derive the optimality gap to illustrate the influence of FAs on learning performance. With these results, we formulate a nonconvex optimization problem to minimize the optimality gap by jointly optimizing the positions of the FAs, the beamforming vector, and the transmit power allocation at each user. To address the dynamic environment, we cast this optimization problem as a Markov decision process and propose the recurrent deterministic policy gradient (RDPG) algorithm. Finally, extensive simulations show that the FA-assisted OTA-FL system outperforms systems with fixed-position antennas and that the RDPG algorithm surpasses the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity-Constrained Spectral Efficiency Analysis for 6G Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a tutorial on how to account for the computational time complexity overhead of signal processing in the spectral efficiency (SE) analysis of wireless waveforms. Our methodology is particularly relevant in scenarios where achieving higher SE entails a penalty in complexity, a common trade-off present in 6G candidate waveforms. We consider that SE derives from the data rate, which is impacted by time-dependent overheads. Thus, neglecting the computational complexity overhead in the SE analysis grants an unfair advantage to more computationally complex waveforms, as they require larger computational resources to meet a signal processing runtime below the symbol period. We demonstrate our points with two case studies. In the first, we refer to IEEE 802.11a-compliant baseband processors from the literature to show that their runtime significantly impacts the SE perceived by upper layers. In the second case study, we show that waveforms considered less efficient in terms of SE can outperform their more computationally expensive counterparts if provided with equivalent high-performance computational resources. Based on these cases, we believe our tutorial can address the comparative SE analysis of waveforms that operate under different computational resource constraints.</description>

      <title>NeuroLM: A Universal Multi-task Foundation Model for Bridging the Gap between Language and EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements for large-scale pre-training with neural signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promising results, significantly boosting the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare. However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.</description>

Abstract: In this document, we revise the results of [1] based on more reasonable assumptions regarding data shuffling and parameter setup of deep neural networks (DNNs). Thus, the simulation results can now more reasonably demonstrate the performance of both the proposed and compared beam alignment methods. We revise the simulation steps and make moderate modifications to the design of the vehicle distribution feature (VDF) for the proposed vision based beam alignment when the MS location is available (VBALA). Specifically, we replace the 2D grids of the VDF with 3D grids and utilize the vehicle locations to expand the dimensions of the VDF. Then, we revise the simulation results of Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13, Fig. 14, and Fig. 15 in [1] to reaffirm the validity of the conclusions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Advantages of Sparse Arrays in XL-MIMO Systems: Do Half-Wavelength Arrays Still Offer an Edge in the Near Field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) has attracted extensive research attention due to its potential to meet the increasingly demanding requirements of future communication systems. Meanwhile, recent researches have indicated that sparse arrays may offer promising advantages for XL-MIMO systems in the near-field. Motivated by these, this paper investigates a downlink near-field XL-MIMO communication system with sparse uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Based on the Green's function-based channel model, the paper focuses on the power distribution of the arrived signal near the focused point of the transmit sparse UPA. In the vicinity of the focused point, along the x-axis and z-axis directions, closed-form expressions for the power distributions are derived. Based on that, expressions for the width and length of the main lobe are obtained in closed form, both of which decrease as the antenna spacing increases. Furthermore, the paper introduces a crucial constraint on system parameters, under which effective degrees-of-freedom (EDoF) of XL-MIMO systems with sparse UPAs can be precisely estimated. Then, the paper proposes an algorithm to obtain a closed-form expression, which can estimate EDoF with high accuracy and low computational complexity. The numerical results verifies the correctness of the main results of this paper. Furthermore, the numerical results reveals the improvement in the performance of XL-MIMO systems with the use of sparse UPAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event-driven sensors, which produce data only when there is a change in the input signal, are increasingly used in applications that require low-latency and low-power real-time sensing, such as robotics and edge devices. To fully achieve the latency and power advantages on offer however, similarly event-driven data processing methods are required. A promising solution is the TDE: an event-based processing element which encodes the time difference between events on different channels into an output event stream. In this work we introduce a novel TDE implementation on CMOS. The circuit is robust to device mismatch and allows the linear integration of input events. This is crucial for enabling a high-density implementation of many TDEs on the same die, and for realising real-time parallel processing of the high-event-rate data produced by event-driven sensors.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Wireless AI via Meta-Learned Context-Dependent Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern software-defined networks, such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) systems, rely on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered applications running on controllers interfaced with the radio access network. To ensure that these AI applications operate reliably at runtime, they must be properly calibrated before deployment. A promising and theoretically grounded approach to calibration is conformal prediction (CP), which enhances any AI model by transforming it into a provably reliable set predictor that provides error bars for estimates and decisions. CP requires calibration data that matches the distribution of the environment encountered during runtime. However, in practical scenarios, network controllers often have access only to data collected under different contexts -- such as varying traffic patterns and network conditions -- leading to a mismatch between the calibration and runtime distributions. This paper introduces a novel methodology to address this calibration-test distribution shift. The approach leverages meta-learning to develop a zero-shot estimator of distribution shifts, relying solely on contextual information. The proposed method, called meta-learned context-dependent weighted conformal prediction (ML-WCP), enables effective calibration of AI applications without requiring data from the current context. Additionally, it can incorporate data from multiple contexts to further enhance calibration reliability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To ensure the authenticity of navigation data, Galileo Open Service navigation message authentication (OSNMA) requires loose synchronization between the receiver clock and the system time. This means that during the period between clock calibrations, the receiver clock error needs to be smaller than a pre-defined threshold, currently up to 165s for OSNMA. On the other hand, relying on the PVT solution to steer the receiver clock or correct its bias may not be possible since this would depend on the very same signals we intend to authenticate. This work aims to investigate the causes of the frequency accuracy loss leading to clock errors and to build a model that, from the datasheet of a real-time clock (RTC) device, allows to bound the error clock during a certain period. The model's main contributors are temperature changes, long-term aging, and offset at calibration, but it includes other factors. We then apply the model to several RTCs from different manufacturers and bound the maximum error for certain periods, with a focus on the two-year between-calibration period expected for the smart tachograph, an automotive application that will integrate OSNMA.</description>

      <title>SCDM: Score-Based Channel Denoising Model for Digital Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models represent a significant variant within the diffusion model family and have seen extensive application in the increasingly popular domain of generative tasks. Recent investigations have explored the denoising potential of diffusion models in semantic communications. However, in previous paradigms, noise distortion in the diffusion process does not match precisely with digital channel noise characteristics. In this work, we introduce the Score-Based Channel Denoising Model (SCDM) for Digital Semantic Communications (DSC). SCDM views the distortion of constellation symbol sequences in digital transmission as a score-based forward diffusion process. We design a tailored forward noise corruption to align digital channel noise properties in the training phase. During the inference stage, the well-trained SCDM can effectively denoise received semantic symbols under various SNR conditions, reducing the difficulty for the semantic decoder in extracting semantic information from the received noisy symbols and thereby enhancing the robustness of the reconstructed semantic information. Experimental results show that SCDM outperforms the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE metrics, particularly at low SNR levels. Moreover, SCDM reduces storage requirements by a factor of 7.8. This efficiency in storage, combined with its robust denoising capability, makes SCDM a practical solution for DSC across diverse channel conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel design for the Pinching Antenna SyStems (PASS) and advocates simple yet efficient wireless communications over the ``last meter''. First, the potential benefits of PASS are discussed in the paper by reviewing an existing prototype. Then, the fundamentals of PASS are introduced, including their physical principles, signal models, and communication designs. In contrast to existing multi-antenna systems, PASS brings a novel concept, termed \emph{Pinching Beamforming}, which is achieved by dynamically adjusting the positions of pinching antennas (PAs). Based on this concept, a couple of practical transmission architectures are proposed for realizing the full potentia of PASS, namely non-multiplexing and multiplexing architectures. More particularly, 1) the non-multiplexing architecture is featured by simple baseband signal processing and relies on the pinching beamforming only; while 2) the multiplexing architecture provides enhanced signal processing capabilities with joint baseband and pinching beamforming, which can be further divided into sub-connected, fully-connected, and phase-shifter-based fully-connected schemes. Furthermore, several emerging scenarios are put forward for integrating PASS into future wireless networks. As a further advance, by demonstrating a few numerical case studies, the significant performance gain of PASS is revealed compared to conventional multi-antenna systems. Finally, several research opportunities and open problems of PASS are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Blind Channel Estimation and Joint Symbol Detection with Data-Driven Factor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of the factor graph framework for blind joint channel estimation and symbol detection on time-variant linear inter-symbol interference channels. In particular, we consider the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation, which typically suffers from high complexity as it requires the computation of the symbol-wise posterior distributions in every iteration. We address this issue by efficiently approximating the posteriors using the belief propagation (BP) algorithm on a suitable factor graph. By interweaving the iterations of BP and EM, the detection complexity can be further reduced to a single BP iteration per EM step. In addition, we propose a data-driven version of our algorithm that introduces momentum in the BP updates and learns a suitable EM parameter update schedule, thereby significantly improving the performance-complexity tradeoff with a few offline training samples. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed blind detector and show that it even outperforms coherent BP detection in high signal-to-noise scenarios.</description>

      <title>Performance of Double-Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Assisted Multiuser Massive MIMO Communications in the Wave Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for shaping the propagation environment, it consists of a single-layer structure within inherent limitations regarding the number of beam steering patterns. Based on the recently revolutionary technology, denoted as stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), we propose its implementation not only on the base station (BS) side in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) setup but also in the intermediate space between the base station and the users to adjust the environment further as needed. For the sake of convenience, we call the former BS SIM (BSIM), and the latter channel SIM (CSIM). Hence, we achieve wave-based combining at the BS and wave-based configuration at the intermediate space. Specifically, we propose a channel estimation method with reduced overhead, being crucial for SIMassisted communications. Next, we derive the uplink sum spectral efficiency (SE) in closed form in terms of statistical channel state information (CSI). Notably, we optimize the phase shifts of both BSIM and CSIM simultaneously by using the projected gradient ascent method (PGAM). Compared to previous works on SIMs, we study the uplink transmission, a mMIMO setup, channel estimation in a single phase, a second SIM at the intermediate space, and simultaneous optimization of the two SIMs. Simulation results show the impact of various parameters on the sum SE, and demonstrate the superiority of our optimization approach compared to the alternating optimization (AO) method.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Joint Antenna Selection and Precoding Design for Cell-Free MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a downlink cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network in which multiple multi-antenna access points (APs) serve multiple users via coherent joint transmission. In order to reduce the energy consumption by radio frequency components, each AP selects a subset of antennas for downlink data transmission after estimating the channel state information (CSI). We aim to maximize the sum spectral efficiency by jointly optimizing the antenna selection and precoding design. To alleviate the fronthaul overhead and enable real-time network operation, we propose a distributed scalable machine learning algorithm. In particular, at each AP, we deploy a convolutional neural network (CNN) for antenna selection and a graph neural network (GNN) for precoding design. Different from conventional centralized solutions that require a large amount of CSI and signaling exchange among the APs, the proposed distributed machine learning algorithm takes only locally estimated CSI as input. With well-trained learning models, it is shown that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the distributed baseline schemes and achieves a sum spectral efficiency comparable to its centralized counterpart.</description>

      <title>Discovering robust biomarkers of psychiatric disorders from resting-state functional MRI via graph neural networks: A systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a popular tool for modelling functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. Many recent studies have reported significant improvements in disorder classification performance via more sophisticated GNN designs and highlighted salient features that could be potential biomarkers of the disorder. However, existing methods of evaluating their robustness are often limited to cross-referencing with existing literature, which is a subjective and inconsistent process. In this review, we provide an overview of how GNN and model explainability techniques (specifically, feature attributors) have been applied to fMRI datasets for disorder prediction tasks, with an emphasis on evaluating the robustness of potential biomarkers produced for psychiatric disorders. Then, 65 studies using GNNs that reported potential fMRI biomarkers for psychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia) published before 9 October 2024 were identified from 2 online databases (Scopus, PubMed). We found that while most studies have performant models, salient features highlighted in these studies (as determined by feature attribution scores) vary greatly across studies on the same disorder. Reproducibility of biomarkers is only limited to a small subset at the level of regions and few transdiagnostic biomarkers were identified. To address these issues, we suggest establishing new standards that are based on objective evaluation metrics to determine the robustness of these potential biomarkers. We further highlight gaps in the existing literature and put together a prediction-attribution-evaluation framework that could set the foundations for future research on discovering robust biomarkers of psychiatric disorders via GNNs.</description>

      <title>Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Source-Free Time-Series Adaptation via Parameter Subspace Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) in the context of time-series, focusing on enhancing both parameter efficiency and data-sample utilization. Our approach introduces an improved paradigm for source-model preparation and target-side adaptation, aiming to enhance training efficiency during target adaptation. Specifically, we reparameterize the source model's weights in a Tucker-style decomposed manner, factorizing the model into a compact form during the source model preparation phase. During target-side adaptation, only a subset of these decomposed factors is fine-tuned, leading to significant improvements in training efficiency. We demonstrate using PAC Bayesian analysis that this selective fine-tuning strategy implicitly regularizes the adaptation process by constraining the model's learning capacity. Furthermore, this re-parameterization reduces the overall model size and enhances inference efficiency, making the approach particularly well suited for resource-constrained devices. Additionally, we demonstrate that our framework is compatible with various SFDA methods and achieves significant computational efficiency, reducing the number of fine-tuned parameters and inference overhead in terms of MACs by over 90% while maintaining model performance.</description>

      <title>Multiple testing in multi-stream sequential change detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04130v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-stream sequential change detection involves simultaneously monitoring many streams of data and trying to detect when their distributions change, if at all. Here, we theoretically study multiple testing issues that arise from detecting changes in many streams. We point out that any algorithm with finite average run length (ARL) must have a trivial worst-case false detection rate (FDR), family-wise error rate (FWER), per-family error rate (PFER), and global error rate (GER); thus, any attempt to control these Type I error metrics is fundamentally in conflict with the desire for a finite ARL (which is typically necessary in order to have a small detection delay). One of our contributions is to define a new class of metrics which can be controlled, called error over patience (EOP). We propose algorithms that combine the recent e-detector framework (which generalizes the Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM methods) with the recent e-Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and e-Bonferroni procedures. We prove that these algorithms control the EOP at any desired level under very general dependence structures on the data within and across the streams. In fact, we prove a more general error control that holds uniformly over all stopping times and provides a smooth trade-off between the conflicting metrics. Additionally, if finiteness of the ARL is forfeited, we show that our algorithms control the worst-case Type I error.</description>

      <title>On Creating A Brain-To-Text Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain decoding has emerged as a rapidly advancing and extensively utilized technique within neuroscience. This paper centers on the application of raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for decoding human brain activity, offering a more expedited and efficient methodology for enhancing our understanding of the human brain. The investigation specifically scrutinizes the efficacy of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in deciphering neural signals associated with speech production, with particular emphasis on the impact of vocabulary size, electrode density, and training data on the framework's performance. The study reveals the competitive word error rates (WERs) achievable on the Librispeech benchmark through pre-training on unlabelled data for speech processing. Furthermore, the study evaluates the efficacy of voice recognition under configurations with limited labeled data, surpassing previous state-of-the-art techniques while utilizing significantly fewer labels. Additionally, the research provides a comprehensive analysis of error patterns in voice recognition and the influence of model size and unlabelled training data. It underscores the significance of factors such as vocabulary size and electrode density in enhancing BCI performance, advocating for an increase in microelectrodes and refinement of language models.</description>
