      <title>Dualities for characteristic polynomial averages of complex symmetric and self dual non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensembles of complex symmetric, and complex self dual random matrices are known to exhibit local statistical properties distinct from those of the non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. On the other hand, in distinction to the latter, the joint eigenvalue probability density function of these two ensembles are not known. Nonetheless, as carried out in the recent works of Liu and Zhang, Akemann et al.~and Kulkarni et al., by considering averages of products of characteristic polynomials, analytic progress can be made. Here we show that an approach based on the theory of zonal polynomials provides an alternative to the diffusion operator or supersymmetric Grassmann integrations methods of these works. It has the advantage of not being restricted to a Gaussian unitary invariant measure on the matrix spaces. To illustrate this, as an extension, we consider averages of products and powers of characteristic polynomials for complex symmetric, and complex self dual random matrices subject to a spherical measure. In the case of powers, when comparing against the corresponding real Ginibre, respectively quaternion Ginibre averages with a spherical measure, one finds the qualitative feature of a decreasing (increasing) profile as the magnitude of the argument of the characteristic polynomial increases. This is analogous to the findings of the second two of the cited works in the Gaussian case.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Review of Area Production Rates as Test Statistics for Detecting Nonequilibrium Dynamics in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic process is at thermodynamic equilibrium if it obeys time-reversal symmetry; forward and reverse time are statistically indistinguishable at steady state. Non-equilibrium processes break time-reversal symmetry by maintaining circulating probability currents. In physical processes, these currents require a continual use and exchange of energy. Accordingly, signatures of non-equilibrium behavior are important markers of energy use in biophysical systems. In this article we consider a particular signature of nonequilibrium behavior: area production rates. These are, the average rate at which a stochastic process traces out signed area in its projections onto coordinate planes. Area production is an example of a linear observable: a path integral over an observed trajectory against a linear vector field. We provide a summary review of area production rates in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes. Then, we show that, given an OU process, a weighted Frobenius norm of the area production rate matrix is the optimal test statistic for detecting nonequilibrium behavior in the sense that its coefficient of variation decays faster in the length of time observed than the coefficient of variation of any other linear observable. We conclude by showing that this test statistic estimates the entropy production rate of the process.</description>

      <title>A study on the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz scenario through quadrics of kinetic energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed description of the asymptotic behaviour in the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) scenario is presented through a simple geometric picture. The Lagrangian version of the dynamics governed by the BKL equations is described in terms of trajectories inside a conical subset of the corresponding space of the generalised velocities. The calculations confirm that the initial conditions of decreasing volume inevitably result in total collapse, while oscillations along paths reflecting from a hyperboloid, similar to Kasner's solutions, occur on the way. The exact solution, found in our previous work, proves to be the only one that shrinks to a point along a differentiable path. Therefore, its instability means that the collapse is always chaotic. The collapse of the universe along asymptotics of exact Kasner's solutions is proved to be impossible for solutions of the BKL equations.</description>

      <title>A non-rational Verlinde formula from Virasoro TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Virasoro TQFT to derive an integral identity that we view as a non-rational generalization of the Verlinde formula for the Virasoro algebra with central charge $c\geq 25$. The identity expresses the Virasoro fusion kernel as an integral over a ratio of modular S-kernels on the (punctured) torus. In particular, it shows that the one-point S-kernel diagonalizes the Virasoro $6j$ symbol. After carefully studying the analytic properties of this `Virasoro-Verlinde formula', we present three applications. In boundary Liouville CFT, the formula ensures the open-closed duality of the boundary one-point function on the annulus. In pure 3d gravity, it provides an essential step in computing the partition function on hyperbolic 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle. Lastly, in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, the formula computes a three-boundary torus wormhole, which leads to a prediction for the statistical correlation between the density of states and two OPE coefficients in the dual large-$c$ CFT ensemble. We conclude by discussing the implications of our result for the fusion rules in generic non-rational 2d CFTs.</description>

      <title>Emergent Geometry from Quantum Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carrying the insights of conditional probability to the quantum realm is notoriously difficult due to the non-commutative nature of quantum observables. Nevertheless, conditional expectations on von Neumann algebras have played a significant role in the development of quantum information theory, and especially the study of quantum error correction. In quantum gravity, it has been suggested that conditional expectations may be used to implement the holographic map algebraically, with quantum error correction underlying the emergence of spacetime through the generalized entropy formula. However, the requirements for exact error correction are almost certainly too strong for realistic theories of quantum gravity. In this note, we present a relaxed notion of quantum conditional expectation which implements approximate error correction. We introduce a generalization of Connes' spatial theory adapted to completely positive maps, and derive a chain rule allowing for the non-commutative factorization of relative modular operators into a marginal and conditional part, constituting a quantum Bayes' law. This allows for an exact quantification of the information gap occurring in the data processing inequality for arbitrary quantum channels. When applied to algebraic inclusions, this also provides an approach to factorizing the entropy of states into a sum of terms which, in the gravitational context, may be interpreted as a generalized entropy. We illustrate that the emergent area operator is fully non-commutative rather than central, except under the conditions of exact error correction. We provide some comments on how this result may be used to construct a fully algebraic quantum extremal surface prescription and to probe the quantum nature of black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We look at a new string$^h$ tangential structure first introduced by Devalapurkar and relate it to the $W_7=0$ condition of Diaconescu-Moore-Witten for type IIA string theory and M-theory. We show that a string$^h$ structure on the target space automatically satisfies the $W_7=0$ condition and we also explain when the $W_7=0$ condition gives rise to a string$^h$ structure. Devalapurkar initially constructed $MString^h$ in such a way that it orients $tmf_1(3)$, we extend Devalapurkar's orientation and show that $MString^h$ orients $tmf_1(n)$. We compute the homotopy groups of $MString^h$ in the dimensions relevant for physical applications, and apply them to anomaly cancellation applications for compactifications of type IIA string theory.</description>

      <title>Wetting, Algebraic Curves and Conformal Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of wetting in a two-component square-gradient model of interfaces in a fluid mixture, showing three-phase bulk coexistence, have revealed some highly surprising features. Numerical results show that the density profile paths, which form a tricuspid shape in the density plane, have curious geometric properties, while conjectures for the analytical form of the surface tensions imply that nonwetting may persist up to the critical end points, contrary to the usual expectation of critical point wetting. Here, we solve the model exactly and show that the profile paths are conformally invariant quartic algebraic curves that change genus at the wetting transition. Being harmonic, the profile paths can be represented by an analytic function in the complex plane which then conformally maps the paths onto straight lines. Using this, we derive the conjectured form of the surface tensions and explain the geometrical properties of the tricuspid and its relation to the Neumann triangle for the contact angles. The exact solution confirms that critical point wetting is absent in this square-gradient model.</description>

Abstract: This article reflects on the life and mathematical contributions of Pierre Cartier, a distinguished figure in 20th- and 21st-century mathematics. As a key member of the Bourbaki collective, Cartier played a pivotal role in the formalization and modernization of mathematics. His work spanned fields such as algebraic geometry, representation theory, mathematical physics, and category theory, leaving an indelible mark on the discipline. Beyond his technical achievements, Cartier was celebrated for his intellectual generosity and humanistic approach to science, shaping not only mathematical thought but also the broader cultural understanding of the field.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the global structure of the recently discovered family of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-invariant potentials describing inflationary $\alpha$-attractors. These potentials have an inflationary plateau consisting of the fundamental domain and its images fully covering the upper part of the Poincar\'e half-plane. Meanwhile, the lower part of the half-plane is covered by an infinitely large number of ridges, which, at first glance, are too sharp to support inflation. However, we show that this apparent sharpness is just an illusion created by hyperbolic geometry, and each of these ridges is physically equivalent to the inflationary plateau in the upper part of the Poincar\'e half-plane.</description>

      <title>Activated Random Walks on $\mathbb{Z}$ with Critical Particle Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Activated Random Walk (ARW) model is a promising candidate for demonstrating self-organized criticality due to its potential for universality. Recent studies have shown that the ARW model exhibits a well-defined critical density in one dimension, supporting its universality. In this paper, we extend these results by demonstrating that the ARW model on $\mathbb{Z}$, with a single initially active particle and all other particles sleeping, maintains the same critical density. Our findings relax the previous assumption that required all particles to be initially active. This provides further evidence of the ARW model's robustness and universality in depicting self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras II: Convergence of Sewing and Higher Genus Pseudo-$q$-traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra. We prove the convergence of Segal's sewing of conformal blocks associated to analytic families of pointed compact Riemann surfaces and grading-restricted generalized $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$-modules (where $N=1,2,\dots$) that are not necessarily tensor products of $\mathbb V$-modules, generalizing significantly the results on convergence in [Gui23].
  We show that ``higher genus pseudo-$q$-traces" (called pseudo-sewing in this article) can be recovered from Segal's sewing. Therefore, our result on the convergence of Segal's sewing implies the convergence of pseudo-sewing, and hence covers both the convergence of genus-$0$ sewing in [HLZ12] and the convergence of pseudo-$q$-traces in [Miy04] and [Fio16].
  Using a similar method, we also prove the convergence of Virasoro uniformization, i.e., the convergence of conformal blocks deformed by non-automomous meromorphic vector fields near the marked points. The local freeness of the analytic sheaves of conformal blocks is a consequence of this convergence. It will be used in the third paper of this series to prove the sewing-factorization theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a sharp, weighted Hardy-type inequality for the Dirac operator. A key feature of our result is that the inequality is not only sharp but also attained, and we construct explicit minimizers that satisfy the equality case.

      <description>arXiv:2411.07809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pirogov--Sinai theory is a well-developed method for understanding the low-temperature phase diagram of statistical mechanics models on lattices. Motivated by physical and algorithmic questions beyond the setting of lattices, we develop a combinatorially flexible version of Pirogov--Sinai theory for the hard-core model of independent sets. Our results illustrate that the main conclusions of Pirogov--Sinai theory can be obtained in significantly greater generality than that of $\mathbb Z^{d}$. The main ingredients in our generalization are combinatorial and involve developing appropriate definitions of contours based on the notion of cycle basis connectivity. This is inspired by works of Tim\'{a}r and Georgakopoulos--Panagiotis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure on the one-dimensional torus, in the infinite volume limit. This measure is the invariant Gibbs measure for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. It had previously been shown by Rider that the measure is strongly concentrated around a family of minimizers of the Hamiltonian associated with the measure, known as the soliton manifold. These exhibit increasingly sharp spatial concentration, resulting in a trivial limit to first order. We study the fluctuations around this soliton manifold. Our results show that the scaled field under the Gibbs measure converges to white noise in the limit, identifying the next order fluctuations predicted by Rider.</description>

Abstract: The prospect of realizating highly entangled states on quantum processors with fundamentally different hardware geometries raises the question: to what extent does a state of a quantum spin system have an intrinic geometry? In this paper, we propose that both states and dynamics of a spin system have a canonically associated coarse geometry in the sense of Roe on the set of sites in the thermodynamic limit. For a state $\phi$ on an (abstract) spin system with an infinite collection of sites $X$, we define a universal coarse structure $\mathcal{E}_{\phi}$ on the set $X$ with the property that a state has decay of correlations with respect to a coarse structure $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ if and only if $\mathcal{E}_{\phi}\subseteq \mathcal{E}$. We show that under mild assumptions, the coarsely connected completion $(\mathcal{E}_{\phi})_{con}$ is stable under quasi-local perturbations of the state $\phi$. We also develop in parallel a dynamical coarse structure for arbitrary quantum channels, and prove a similar stability result. We show that several order parameters of the state only depend on the coarse structure of the metric, and we establish a basic compatibility between the dynamical coarse structure associated to a quantum circuit $\alpha$ and the coarse structure of the state $\psi\circ \alpha$ where $\psi$ is any product state.</description>

      <title>Last passage percolation in hierarchical environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Last passage percolation (LPP) is a model of a directed metric and a zero-temperature polymer where the main observable is a directed path evolving in a random environment accruing as energy the sum of the random weights along itself. When the environment has light tails and a fast decay of correlation, the fluctuations of LPP are predicted to be explained by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality theory. However, the KPZ theory is not expected to apply for many natural environments, particularly "critical" ones exhibiting a hierarchical structure often leading to logarithmic correlations.
  In this article, we initiate a novel study of LPP in such hierarchical environments by investigating two particularly interesting examples. The first is an i.i.d. environment but with a power-law distribution with an inverse quadratic tail decay which is conjectured to be the critical point for the validity of the KPZ scaling relation. The second is the Branching Random Walk which is a hierarchical approximation of the two-dimensional Gaussian Free Field. The second example may be viewed as a high-temperature directed version of Liouville Quantum Gravity, which is a model of random geometry driven by the exponential of a logarithmically-correlated field. Due to the underlying fractal structure, LPP in such environments is expected to exhibit logarithmic correction terms with novel critical exponents. While discussions about such critical models appear in the physics literature, precise predictions about exponents seem to be missing. Developing a framework based on multi-scale analysis, we obtain bounds on such exponents and prove almost optimal concentration results in all dimensions for both models. As a byproduct of our analysis we answer a long-standing question of Martin concerning necessary and sufficient conditions for the linear growth of the LPP energy in i.i.d. environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>On the relativistic quantum mechanics of a photon between two electrons in 1+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Lorentz-covariant system of wave equations is formulated for a quantum-mechanical three-body system in one space dimension, comprised of one photon and two identical massive spin one-half Dirac particles, which can be thought of as two electrons (or alternatively, two positrons). Manifest covariance is achieved using Dirac's formalism of multi-time wave functions, i.e, wave functions $\Psi(\textbf{x}_{\text{ph}},\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_1},\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_2})$ where $\textbf{x}_{\text{ph}},\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_1},\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_2}$ are generic spacetime events of the photon and two electrons respectively. Their interaction is implemented via a Lorentz-invariant no-crossing-of-paths boundary condition at the coincidence submanifolds $\{\textbf{x}_{\text{ph}}=\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_1}\}$ and $\{\textbf{x}_{\text{ph}}=\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_2}\}$ compatible with conservation of probability current. The corresponding initial-boundary value problem is shown to be well-posed, and it is shown that the unique solution can be represented by a convergent infinite sum of Feynman-like diagrams, each one corresponding to the photon bouncing between the two electrons a fixed number of times.</description>

Abstract: We prove the orbital stability of soliton solutions for 2D Maxwell--Lorentz system with extended charged particle. The solitons corresponds to the uniform motion and rotation of the particle.
  We reduce the corresponding Hamilton system by the canonical transformation via transition to a comoving frame. The solitons are the critical points of the reduced Hamiltonian. The key point of the proof is a lower bound for the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates interface modes in a square lattice of photonic crystal composed of gyromagnetic particles with $C_{4v}$ point group symmetry. The study shows that Dirac or linear degenerate points cannot occur at the three high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone where two Bloch bands touch. Instead, a touch point at the M-point has a quadratic degeneracy in the generic case. It is further proved that when a magnetic field is applied to the two sides of an interface in opposite directions, two interface modes supported along that interface can bifurcate from the quadratic degenerate point. These results provide a mathematical foundation for the first experimental realization of the integer quantum Hall effect in the context of photonics.</description>

      <title>Duality of the Navier-Stokes dynamics and lack of finite-time explosion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the duality of incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics in three dimensions, leading to its reformulation in terms of a one-dimensional momentum loop equation. \textbf{The momentum loop equation does not have finite-time blow-up solutions.} The decaying turbulence is a solution of this equation equivalent to a string theory with discrete target space made of regular star polygons and Ising degrees of freedom on the sides. This string theory is solvable in the turbulent limit, equivalent to the quasiclassical approximation in a nontrivial calculable background. \textbf{As a result, the spectrum of decay indexes is analytically computed, and it agrees very well with real and numerical experiments. } Among the decay indexes, there are complex conjugate pairs related to zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The Kolmogorov scaling laws are replaced by certain number theory functions, which are nonlinear in the log-log scale.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Approach to Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ramsey theory enables re-shaping of the basic ideas of quantum mechanics. Quantum observables represented by linear Hermitian operators are seen as the vertices of a graph. Relations of commutation define the coloring of edges linking the vertices: if the operators commute, they are connected with a red link; if they do not commute, they are connected with a green link. Thus, a bi-colored complete Ramsey graph emerges. According to Ramsey's theorem, a complete bi-colored graph built of six vertices will inevitably contain at least one monochromatic triangle; in other words, the Ramsey number \( R(3,3) = 6 \). In our interpretation, this triangle represents the triad of observables that could or could not be established simultaneously in a given quantum system. The Ramsey approach to quantum mechanics is illustrated.</description>

      <title>On asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions for Navier-Stokes equations on non-compact Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14137v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies some bounded conditions on curvature tensors. First, we use the $L^p-L^q$-dipsersive and smoothing estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. Our results extend the previous ones \cite{Xuan2022,Xuan2023} to the generalized non-compact Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>The Crystallographic Spin Point Groups and their Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12784v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin point groups are finite groups whose elements act on both real space and spin space. Among these groups are the magnetic point groups in the case where the real and spin space operations are locked to one another. The magnetic point groups are central to magnetic crystallography for strong spin-orbit coupled systems and the spin point groups generalize these to the intermediate and weak spin-orbit coupled cases. The spin point groups were introduced in the 1960's in the context of condensed matter physics and enumerated shortly thereafter. In this paper, we complete the theory ofcrystallographic spin point groups by presenting an account of these groups and their representation theory. Our main findings are that the so-called nontrivial spin point groups (numbering $598$ groups) have co-irreps corresponding exactly to the (co-)-irreps of regular or black and white groups and we tabulate this correspondence for each nontrivial group. However a total spin group, comprising the product of a nontrivial group and a spin-only group, has new co-irreps in cases where there is continuous rotational freedom. We provide explicit co-irrep tables for all these instances. We also discuss new forms of spin-only group extending the Litvin-Opechowski classes. To exhibit the usefulness of these groups to physically relevant problems we discuss a number of examples from electronic band structures of altermagnets to magnons.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the elliptic characteristic classes known as ''stable envelopes'', which were introduced by M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove that for a rich class of holomorphic symplectic varieties$\unicode{x2013}$called Cherkis bow varieties$\unicode{x2013}$their elliptic stable envelopes exhibit a duality property inspired by mirror symmetry in $d=3$, $\mathcal N=4$ quantum field theories. A crucial step of our proof involves the process of ''resolving'' large charge branes into multiple smaller charge branes. This phenomenon turns out to be the geometric counterpart of the algebraic fusion procedure. Along the way we discover various new features in the geometry of bow varieties.</description>

      <title>Construction of perfect tensors using biunimodular vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual unitary gates are highly non-local two-qudit unitary gates that have been studied extensively in quantum many-body physics and quantum information in the recent past. A special class of dual unitary gates consists of rank-four perfect tensors that are equivalent to highly entangled multipartite pure states called absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states. In this work, numerical and analytical constructions of dual unitary gates and perfect tensors that are diagonal in a special maximally entangled basis are presented. The main ingredient in our construction is a phase-valued (unimodular) two-dimensional array whose discrete Fourier transform is also unimodular. We obtain perfect tensors for several local Hilbert space dimensions, particularly, in dimension six. A perfect tensor in local dimension six is equivalent to an AME state of four qudits, denoted as AME(4,6). Such a state cannot be constructed from existing constructions of AME states based on error-correcting codes and graph states. An explicit construction of AME(4,6) states is provided in this work using two-qudit controlled and single-qudit gates making it feasible to generate such states experimentally.</description>

Abstract: We perform a quantitative assessment of different strategies to compute the contribution due to surface tension in incompressible two-phase flows using a conservative level set (CLS) method. More specifically, we compare classical approaches, such as the direct computation of the curvature from the level set or the Laplace-Beltrami operator, with an evolution equation for the mean curvature recently proposed in literature. We consider the test case of a static bubble, for which an exact solution for the pressure jump across the interface is available, and the test case of an oscillating bubble, showing pros and cons of the different approaches.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted classical capacities of some channels acting as radial multipliers on fermion algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15440v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of unital quantum channels on $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$, acting as radial multipliers when we identify the matrix algebra $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$ with a finite-dimensional fermion algebra. Our primary contribution lies in the precise computation of the (optimal) rate at which classical information can be transmitted through these channels from a sender to a receiver when they share an unlimited amount of entanglement. Our approach relies on new connections between fermion algebras with the $n$-dimensional discrete hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$. Significantly, our calculations yield exact values applicable to the operators of the fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This advancement not only provides deeper insights into the structure and behaviour of these channels but also enhances our understanding of Quantum Information Theory in a dimension-independent context.</description>

      <title>Perturbative approach to time-dependent quantum systems and applications to one-crossing multistate Landau-Zener models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a perturbative approach for studying a class of multi-level time-dependent quantum systems with constant off-diagonal couplings and diabatic energies being odd functions of time. Applying this approach to a general multistate Landau-Zener (MLZ) model with all diabatic levels crossing at one point (named the one-crossing MLZ model), we derive analytical formulas of all its transition probabilities up to $4$th order in the couplings. For one-crossing MLZ models it is difficult to obtain such analytical results by other kinds of approximation methods; thus, these perturbative results can serve as reliable benchmarks for future studies of any one-crossing MLZ models that have not been exactly solved.</description>

      <title>Memory-Augmented Hybrid Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is an effective method for predicting chaotic systems by using a high-dimensional dynamic reservoir with fixed internal weights, while keeping the learning phase linear, which simplifies training and reduces computational complexity compared to fully trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) uses the exponential growth of Hilbert spaces in quantum systems, allowing for greater information processing, memory capacity, and computational power. However, the original QRC proposal requires coherent injection of inputs multiple times, complicating practical implementation. We present a hybrid quantum-classical approach that implements memory through classical post-processing of quantum measurements. This approach avoids the need for multiple coherent input injections and is evaluated on benchmark tasks, including the chaotic Mackey-Glass time series prediction. We tested our model on two physical platforms: a fully connected Ising model and a Rydberg atom array. The optimized model demonstrates promising predictive capabilities, achieving a higher number of steps compared to previously reported approaches.</description>

      <title>Reflected entropy in random tensor networks III: triway cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For general random tensor network states at large bond dimension, we prove that the integer R\'enyi reflected entropies (away from phase transitions) are determined by minimal triway cuts through the network. This generalizes the minimal cut description of bipartite entanglement for these states. A natural extrapolation away from integer R\'enyi parameters, suggested by the triway cut problem, implies the holographic conjecture $S_R=2EW$, where $S_R$ is the reflected entropy and $EW$ is the entanglement wedge cross-section. Minimal triway cuts can be formulated as integer programs which cannot be relaxed to find a dual maximal flow/bit-thread description. This sheds light on the gap between the existence of tripartite entanglement in holographic states and the bipartite entanglement structure motivated by bit-threads. In particular, we prove that the Markov gap that measures tripartite entanglement is lower bounded by the integrality gap of the integer program that computes the triway cut.</description>

      <title>T-duality on Almost Hermitian Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate T-duality transformation on an almost bi-hermitian space with torsion. By virtue of the Buscher rule, we completely describe not only the covariant derivative of geometrical objects but also the Nijenhuis tensor. We apply this description to string sigma model whose target space is a T-dualized system from an integrable bi-hermitian space with isometry. We find that hermiticity is not a sufficient condition to preserve integrability under T-duality transformations. However, in the presence of the K\"{a}hler condition, the T-dualized almost complex structures keep integrable even though they become no longer covariantly constant. We also observe that the form of $H$-flux is suitable for string compactification scenarios.</description>

      <title>Crystallography, Group Cohomology, and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the mod-2 cohomology ring for three-dimensional (3D) space groups and establish a connection between them and the lattice structure of crystals with space group symmetry. This connection allows us to obtain a complete set of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints, specifying the conditions under which a unique, symmetric, gapped ground state cannot exist in 3D lattice magnets. We associate each of these constraints with an element in the third mod-2 cohomology of the space group, when the internal symmetry acts on-site and its projective representations are classified by powers of $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We demonstrate the relevance of our results to the study of $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids on the 3D pyrochlore lattice. We determine, through anomaly matching, the symmetry fractionalization patterns of both electric and magnetic charges, extending previous results from projective symmetry group classifications.</description>

      <title>A universal inequality on the unitary 2D CFT partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture proposed by Hartman, Keller and Stoica [HKS14]: the grand-canonical free energy of a unitary 2D CFT with a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12}+\epsilon$ and below the twist $\frac{c}{12}$ is universal in the large $c$ limit for all $\beta_L\beta_R \neq 4\pi^2$.
  The technique of the proof allows us to derive a one-parameter (with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1]$) family of universal inequalities on the unitary 2D CFT partition function with general central charge $c\geqslant 0$, using analytical modular bootstrap. We derive an iterative equation for the domain of validity of the inequality on the $(\beta_L,\beta_R)$ plane. The infinite iteration of this equation gives the boundary of maximal-validity domain, which depends on the parameter $\alpha$ in the inequality.
  In the $c \to \infty$ limit, with the additional assumption of a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12} + \epsilon$ and the twist $\frac{\alpha c}{12}$ (with $\alpha \in (0,1]$ fixed), our inequality shows that the grand-canonical free energy exhibits a universal large $c$ behavior in the maximal-validity domain. This domain, however, does not cover the entire $(\beta_L, \beta_R)$ plane, except in the case of $\alpha = 1$. For $\alpha = 1$, this proves the conjecture proposed by [HKS14], and for $\alpha &lt; 1$, it quantifies how sparseness in twist affects the regime of universality. Furthermore, this implies a precise lower bound on the temperature of near-extremal BTZ black holes, above which we can trust the black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Levi-Civita connection on the irreducible quantum flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify covariant metrics (in the sense of Beggs and Majid) on a class of quantum homogeneous spaces. In particular, our classification implies the existence of a unique (up to scalar) quantum symmetric covariant metric on the Heckenberger--Kolb calculi for the quantized irreducible flag manifolds. Moreover, we prove the existence and uniqueness of Levi-Civita connection for any real covariant metric for the Heckenberger--Kolb calculi. This generalizes Matassa's result for the quantum projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Jacobi matrices that realize perfect quantum state transfer and early state exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how to construct 1D Hamiltonians, that is, Jacobi matrices, that realize perfect quantum state transfer and also have the property that the overlap of the time evolved state with the initial state is zero for some time before the transfer time. If the latter takes place we call it an early exclusion state. We also show that in some case early state exclusion is impossible. The proofs rely on properties of Krawtchouk and Chebyshev polynomials.</description>

      <title>Adding the algebraic Ryu-Takayanagi formula to the algebraic reconstruction theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A huge progress in studying holographic theories is that holography can be interpreted via the quantum error correction, which makes equal the entanglement wedge reconstruction, the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh formula, the radial commutativity and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We call the equivalence the reconstruction theorem, whose infinite-dimensional generalization via algebraic language was believed to exclude the algebraic version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. However, recent developments regarding gravitational algebras have shown that the inclusion of the algebraic Ryu-Takayanagi formula is plausible. In this letter, we prove that such inclusion holds for the cases of type I/II factors, which are expected to describe holographic theories.</description>
