      <title>Individuation of 3D perceptual units from neurogeometry of binocular cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the functional architecture of the early stages of three-dimensional vision by extending the neurogeometric sub-Riemannian model for stereo-vision introduced in \cite{BCSZ23}. A new framework for correspondence is introduced that integrates a neural-based algorithm to achieve stereo correspondence locally while, simultaneously, organizing the corresponding points into global perceptual units. The result is an effective scene segmentation. We achieve this using harmonic analysis on the sub-Riemannian structure and show, in a comparison against Riemannian distance, that the sub-Riemannian metric is central to the solution.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Mechanics of Synaptic Learning under the Free Energy Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain is a biological system comprising nerve cells and orchestrates its embodied agent's perception, behavior, and learning in the dynamic environment. The free energy principle (FEP) advocated by Karl Friston explicates the local, recurrent, and self-supervised neurodynamics of the brain's higher-order functions. In this paper, we continue to finesse the FEP through the physics-guided formulation; specifically, we apply our theory to synaptic learning by considering it an inference problem under the FEP and derive the governing equations, called Bayesian mechanics. Our study uncovers how the brain infers weight change and postsynaptic activity, conditioned on the presynaptic input, by deploying the generative models of the likelihood and prior belief. Consequently, we exemplify the synaptic plasticity in the brain with a simple model: we illustrate that the brain organizes an optimal trajectory in neural phase space during synaptic learning in continuous time, which variationally minimizes synaptic surprisal.</description>

      <title>Cognitive maps and schizophrenia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured internal representations (cognitive maps) shape cognition, from imagining the future and counterfactual past, to transferring knowledge to new settings. Our understanding of how such representations are formed and maintained in biological and artificial neural networks has grown enormously. The cognitive mapping hypothesis of schizophrenia extends this enquiry to psychiatry, proposing that diverse symptoms - from delusions to conceptual disorganisation - stem from abnormalities in how the brain forms structured representations. These abnormalities may arise from a confluence of neurophysiological perturbations (excitation-inhibition imbalance, resulting in attractor instability and impaired representational capacity), and/or environmental factors such as early life psychosocial stressors (which impinge on representation learning). This proposal thus links knowledge of neural circuit abnormalities, environmental risk factors, and symptoms.</description>

      <title>Seizure freedom after surgical resection of diffusion-weighted MRI abnormalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Importance: Many individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy continue to have seizures after resective surgery. Accurate identification of focal brain abnormalities is essential for successful neurosurgical intervention. Current clinical approaches to identify structural abnormalities for surgical targeting in epilepsy do not use diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), despite evidence that dMRI abnormalities are present in epilepsy and may relate to the epileptogenic zone. Objective: To investigate whether surgical resection of diffusion abnormalities relates to post-operative seizure freedom. Design: This retrospective case-control study was conducted between 2009 and 2022. Data were acquired at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UK. Study participants included 200 individuals with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, who underwent resective surgery, and 97 healthy controls used as a normative baseline. Main Outcomes: Spatial overlap between diffusion abnormality clusters and surgical resection masks, and relation to post-surgical outcome. Results: Surgical resections overlapping with the largest abnormal cluster significantly correlated with sustained seizure freedom at 12 months (83% vs 55%; p&lt;0.0001) and over five years (p&lt;0.0001). Notably, resecting only a small proportion of the largest cluster was associated with better seizure outcomes than cases with no resection of this cluster (p=0.008). Furthermore, sparing the largest cluster but resecting other large clusters still improved seizure freedom rates compared to no overlap (p=0.03). Conclusions: Our results suggest that abnormal clusters, identified using dMRI, are integral to the epileptogenic network, and even a partial removal of such an abnormal cluster is sufficient to achieve seizure freedom. The study highlights the potential of incorporating dMRI into pre-surgical planning to improve outcomes in focal epilepsy.</description>

      <title>A low-dimensional model for adaptive networks of spiking neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a large ensemble of Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons with heterogeneous input currents and adaptation variables. For a particular class of adaptation, which we call quadratic spike-frequency adaptation (QSFA), the high-dimensional system admits an exact reduction to a low-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations for three mean-field variables: the population's firing rate, the mean membrane potential, and a mean adaptation variable. These low-dimensional firing rate equations (FRE) reveal an important generic feature of heterogeneous networks with spike frequency adaptation: Both the center and the width of the distribution of the neurons' firing frequencies are reduced, and this largely favors the emergence of collective synchronization in the network. These results are confirmed by the bifurcation analysis of the FRE, which faithfully describe the collective dynamics of the spiking neuron network, including collective oscillations, bursting, and macroscopic chaos.</description>

      <title>From Epilepsy Seizures Classification to Detection: A Deep Learning-based Approach for Raw EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy represents the most prevalent neurological disease in the world. One-third of people suffering from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) exhibit drug resistance, urging the need to develop new treatments. A key part in anti-seizure medication (ASM) development is the capability of detecting and quantifying epileptic seizures occurring in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which is crucial for treatment efficacy evaluation. In this study, we introduced a seizure detection pipeline based on deep learning models applied to raw EEG signals. This pipeline integrates: a new pre-processing technique which segments continuous raw EEG signals without prior distinction between seizure and seizure-free activities; a post-processing algorithm developed to reassemble EEG segments and allow the identification of seizures start/end; and finally, a new evaluation procedure based on a strict seizure events comparison between predicted and real labels. Models training have been performed using a data splitting strategy which addresses the potential for data leakage. We demonstrated the fundamental differences between a seizure classification and a seizure detection task and showed the differences in performance between the two tasks. Finally, we demonstrated the generalization capabilities across species of our best architecture, combining a Convolutional Neural Network and a Transformer encoder. The model was trained on animal EEGs and tested on human EEGs with a F1-score of 93% on a balanced Bonn dataset.</description>

      <title>Multiscale fusion enhanced spiking neural network for invasive BCI neural signal decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are an advanced fusion of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, requiring stable and long-term decoding of neural signals. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their neuronal dynamics and spike-based signal processing, are inherently well-suited for this task. This paper presents a novel approach utilizing a Multiscale Fusion enhanced Spiking Neural Network (MFSNN). The MFSNN emulates the parallel processing and multiscale feature fusion seen in human visual perception to enable real-time, efficient, and energy-conserving neural signal decoding. Initially, the MFSNN employs temporal convolutional networks and channel attention mechanisms to extract spatiotemporal features from raw data. It then enhances decoding performance by integrating these features through skip connections. Additionally, the MFSNN improves generalizability and robustness in cross-day signal decoding through mini-batch supervised generalization learning. In two benchmark invasive BCI paradigms, including the single-hand grasp-and-touch and center-and-out reach tasks, the MFSNN surpasses traditional artificial neural network methods, such as MLP and GRU, in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, the MFSNN's multiscale feature fusion framework is well-suited for the implementation on neuromorphic chips, offering an energy-efficient solution for online decoding of invasive BCI signals.</description>

      <title>Optimizing food taste sensory evaluation through neural network-based taste electroencephalogram channel selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The taste electroencephalogram (EEG) evoked by the taste stimulation can reflect different brain patterns and be used in applications such as sensory evaluation of food. However, considering the computational cost and efficiency, EEG data with many channels has to face the critical issue of channel selection. This paper proposed a channel selection method called class activation mapping with attention (CAM-Attention). The CAM-Attention method combined a convolutional neural network with channel and spatial attention (CNN-CSA) model with a gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) model. The CNN-CSA model exploited key features in EEG data by attention mechanism, and the Grad-CAM model effectively realized the visualization of feature regions. Then, channel selection was effectively implemented based on feature regions. Finally, the CAM-Attention method reduced the computational burden of taste EEG recognition and effectively distinguished the four tastes. In short, it has excellent recognition performance and provides effective technical support for taste sensory evaluation.</description>

      <title>The HCP multi-pipeline dataset: an opportunity to investigate analytical variability in fMRI data analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies can be impacted by many sources of variability including differences due to: the sampling of the participants, differences in acquisition protocols and material but also due to different analytical choices in the processing of the fMRI data. While variability across participants or across acquisition instruments have been extensively studied in the neuroimaging literature the root causes of analytical variability remain an open question. Here, we share the \textit{HCP multi-pipeline dataset}, including the resulting statistic maps for 24 typical fMRI pipelines on 1,080 participants of the HCP-Young Adults dataset. We share both individual and group results - for 1,000 groups of 50 participants - over 5 motor contrasts. We hope that this large dataset covering  a wide range of analysis conditions will provide new opportunities to study analytical variability in fMRI.</description>

      <title>Learning grid cells by predictive coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of the mammalian brain exhibit a strikingly regular hexagonal firing field over space. These cells are learned after birth and are thought to support spatial navigation but also more abstract computations. Although various computational models, including those based on artificial neural networks, have been proposed to explain the formation of grid cells, the process through which the MEC circuit ${\it learns}$ to develop grid cells remains unclear. In this study, we argue that predictive coding, a biologically plausible plasticity rule known to learn visual representations, can also train neural networks to develop hexagonal grid representations from spatial inputs. We demonstrate that grid cells emerge robustly through predictive coding in both static and dynamic environments, and we develop an understanding of this grid cell learning capability by analytically comparing predictive coding with existing models. Our work therefore offers a novel and biologically plausible perspective on the learning mechanisms underlying grid cells. Moreover, it extends the predictive coding theory to the hippocampal formation, suggesting a unified learning algorithm for diverse cortical representations.</description>

      <title>Artificial consciousness. Some logical and conceptual preliminaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is artificial consciousness theoretically possible? Is it plausible? If so, is it technically feasible? To make progress on these questions, it is necessary to lay some groundwork clarifying the logical and empirical conditions for artificial consciousness to arise and the meaning of relevant terms involved. Consciousness is a polysemic word: researchers from different fields, including neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and philosophy, among others, sometimes use different terms in order to refer to the same phenomena or the same terms to refer to different phenomena. In fact, if we want to pursue artificial consciousness, a proper definition of the key concepts is required. Here, after some logical and conceptual preliminaries, we argue for the necessity of using dimensions and profiles of consciousness for a balanced discussion about their possible instantiation or realisation in artificial systems. Our primary goal in this paper is to review the main theoretical questions that arise in the domain of artificial consciousness. On the basis of this review, we propose to assess the issue of artificial consciousness within a multidimensional account. The theoretical possibility of artificial consciousness is already presumed within some theoretical frameworks; however, empirical possibility cannot simply be deduced from these frameworks but needs independent empirical validation. We break down the complexity of consciousness by identifying constituents, components, and dimensions, and reflect pragmatically about the general challenges confronting the creation of artificial consciousness. Despite these challenges, we outline a research strategy for showing how "awareness" as we propose to understand it could plausibly be realised in artificial systems.</description>
