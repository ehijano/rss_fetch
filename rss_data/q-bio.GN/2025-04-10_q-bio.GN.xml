      <title>ProHap Explorer: Visualizing Haplotypes in Proteogenomic Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mass spectrometry-based proteomics, experts usually project data onto a single set of reference sequences, overlooking the influence of common haplotypes (combinations of genetic variants inherited together from a parent). We recently introduced ProHap, a tool for generating customized protein haplotype databases. Here, we present ProHap Explorer, a visualization interface designed to investigate the influence of common haplotypes on the human proteome. It enables users to explore haplotypes, their effects on protein sequences, and the identification of non-canonical peptides in public mass spectrometry datasets. The design builds on well-established representations in biological sequence analysis, ensuring familiarity for domain experts while integrating novel interactive elements tailored to proteogenomic data exploration. User interviews with proteomics experts confirmed the tool's utility, highlighting its ability to reveal whether haplotypes affect proteins of interest. By facilitating the intuitive exploration of proteogenomic variation, ProHap Explorer supports research in personalized medicine and the development of targeted therapies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging State Space Models in Long Range Genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range dependencies are critical for understanding genomic structure and function, yet most conventional methods struggle with them. Widely adopted transformer-based models, while excelling at short-context tasks, are limited by the attention module's quadratic computational complexity and inability to extrapolate to sequences longer than those seen in training. In this work, we explore State Space Models (SSMs) as a promising alternative by benchmarking two SSM-inspired architectures, Caduceus and Hawk, on long-range genomics modeling tasks under conditions parallel to a 50M parameter transformer baseline. We discover that SSMs match transformer performance and exhibit impressive zero-shot extrapolation across multiple tasks, handling contexts 10 to 100 times longer than those seen during training, indicating more generalizable representations better suited for modeling the long and complex human genome. Moreover, we demonstrate that these models can efficiently process sequences of 1M tokens on a single GPU, allowing for modeling entire genomic regions at once, even in labs with limited compute. Our findings establish SSMs as efficient and scalable for long-context genomic analysis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Downstream Analysis in Genome Sequencing: Species Classification While Basecalling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to quickly and accurately identify microbial species in a sample, known as metagenomic profiling, is critical across various fields, from healthcare to environmental science. This paper introduces a novel method to profile signals coming from sequencing devices in parallel with determining their nucleotide sequences, a process known as basecalling, via a multi-objective deep neural network for simultaneous basecalling and multi-class genome classification. We introduce a new loss strategy where losses for basecalling and classification are back-propagated separately, with model weights combined for the shared layers, and a pre-configured ranking strategy allowing top-K species accuracy, giving users flexibility to choose between higher accuracy or higher speed at identifying the species. We achieve state-of-the-art basecalling accuracies, while classification accuracies meet and exceed the results of state-of-the-art binary classifiers, attaining an average of 92.5%/98.9% accuracy at identifying the top-1/3 species among a total of 17 genomes in the Wick bacterial dataset. The work presented here has implications for future studies in metagenomic profiling by accelerating the bottleneck step of matching the DNA sequence to the correct genome.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Replace Data Scientists in Biomedical Research?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data science plays a critical role in biomedical research, but it requires professionals with expertise in coding and medical data analysis. Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting medical tasks and performing well in general coding tests. However, existing evaluations fail to assess their capability in biomedical data science, particularly in handling diverse data types such as genomics and clinical datasets. To address this gap, we developed a benchmark of data science coding tasks derived from the analyses of 39 published studies. This benchmark comprises 293 coding tasks (128 in Python and 165 in R) performed on real-world TCGA-type genomics and clinical data. Our findings reveal that the vanilla prompting of LLMs yields suboptimal performances due to drawbacks in following input instructions, understanding target data, and adhering to standard analysis practices. Next, we benchmarked six cutting-edge LLMs and advanced adaptation methods, finding two methods to be particularly effective: chain-of-thought prompting, which provides a step-by-step plan for data analysis, which led to a 21% code accuracy improvement (56.6% versus 35.3%); and self-reflection, enabling LLMs to refine the buggy code iteratively, yielding an 11% code accuracy improvement (45.5% versus 34.3%). Building on these insights, we developed a platform that integrates LLMs into the data science workflow for medical professionals. In a user study with five medical professionals, we found that while LLMs cannot fully automate programming tasks, they significantly streamline the programming process. We found that 80% of their submitted code solutions were incorporated from LLM-generated code, with up to 96% reuse in some cases. Our analysis highlights the potential of LLMs to enhance data science efficiency in biomedical research when integrated into expert workflows.</description>
