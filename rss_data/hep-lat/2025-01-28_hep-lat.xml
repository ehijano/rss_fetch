      <title>Update of HPQCD $B_c\to J/\psi$ Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an update of our lattice QCD determination of the $B_c\to J/\psi$ vector and axial-vector form factors, including new results for the tensor form factors. We use the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action for all valence quarks, together with the second generation MILC $n_f=2+1+1$ HISQ gluon field configurations. This calculation includes two additional ensembles, one with physically light up and down quarks and $a\approx 0.06 \mathrm{fm}$ and one with $a\approx 0.03\mathrm{fm}$ on which we are able to reach the physical bottom quark mass. Our calculation uses nonperturbatively renormalised current operators and covers the full kinematical range of the decay. Our physical-continuum extrapolation utilises the full dispersive parameterisation for $B_c\to J/\psi$.</description>

      <title>Tensor renormalization group study of the two-dimensional lattice U(1) gauge-Higgs model with a topological $\theta$ term under L\"uscher's admissibility condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional lattice U(1) gauge-Higgs model with a topological term, employing L\"uscher's admissibility condition. The standard Monte Carlo simulation for this model is hindered not only by the complex action problem due to the topological term but also by the topological freezing problem originating from the admissibility condition. Resolving both obstacles simultaneously with the tensor renormalization group approach, we show the advantage of the admissibility condition in dealing with the topological term discretized with the so-called field-theoretical definition.</description>

      <title>Three flavor QCD phase transition with M\"obius domain wall fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated study of the $N_f=3$ QCD phase transition using M\"{o}bius domain wall fermions. Simulations were performed on $N_t=12$ lattices with aspect ratios ranging from 2 to 4 for various quark masses, at a lattice spacing of $a=0.1361(20)$ fm, corresponding to a temperature of 121(2) MeV. To clarify the nature of the phase transition, a large-volume lattice, $48^3 \times 12\times 16$, was added to analyze the volume dependence of disconnected chiral susceptibility. By examining the chiral condensate, disconnected chiral susceptibility, and Binder cumulant, and incorporating results from $24^3 \times 12 \times 16$ and $36^3 \times 12 \times 16$ lattices reported in previous lattice proceedings, we identify a crossover at a quark mass of approximately $m_q^{\mathrm{\overline {MS}}}(2\, \mathrm{GeV}) \sim 4$ MeV at this temperature. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of residual chiral symmetry breaking on the chiral condensate and disconnected chiral susceptibility for different values of $L_s$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid static potentials and gluelumps on $N_f=3+1$ ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD permits the existence of hybrid mesons that are made up of both quarks and gluons, including exotic states, i.e., quantum numbers prohibited for pure quark-antiquark states, with possible candidates found in experiments. We present static hybrid potentials measured via Laplace trial states together with static-light meson thresholds on $N_f=3+1$ dynamical fermion ensembles with 420 MeV pions. Furthermore, we measure corresponding gluelump masses which refer to the $R\rightarrow0$ limit of the hybrid potentials and are essential input parameters for effective models to describe hybrid mesons.</description>

      <title>Smoothing properties of the Wilson flow and the topological charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study SU$(N_C)$ gauge theories with a single fermion in the two-index antisymmetric representation to predict the mesonic spectrum of supersymmetric $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM theories. Using gradient flow methods, we investigate fractional topological charges in $N_C = 4$ ensembles with varying lattice spacings. We show that the use of overimproved gauge actions (specifically the DBW2 action) in the smearing kernel stabilises the values of the topological charge already at moderate values of the flow time, while this is not the case for the standard Wilson flow.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equation of state of three-dimensional compact U(1) gauge theory on the lattice by means of numerical simulations, and discuss the implications of our results for the spectrum of the theory, in connection with previous results from the literature. We also compare our findings to the case of non-Abelian gauge theories and comment on the continuum limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study heavy spin effects in $\bar{b}\bar{b}ud$ and $\bar{b}\bar{c}ud$ four-quark systems using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and existing antistatic-antistatic potentials computed with lattice QCD. We report about a recent refined investigation of the $\bar{b}\bar{b}ud$ system with $I(J^P)=0(1^-)$, where we predicted a tetraquark resonance slightly above the $B^{*}B^{*}$ threshold. Furthermore, we extend our Born-Oppenheimer approach to $\bar{b}\bar{c}ud$ four-quark systems. For quantum numbers $I(J^P)=0(0^+)$ as well as $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ we find virtual bound states rather far away from the lowest meson-meson thresholds.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo examination for the numerical values of universal quantities in spatial dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By simulating a two-dimensional (2D) dimerized spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with the quantum Monte Carlo method, the numerical values of two universal quantities associated with the quantum critical regime (QCR), namely $S(\pi,\pi)/\left(\chi_s T\right)$ and $c/\left(T\xi\right)$, are determined. Here $S(\pi,\pi)$, $\chi_s$, $c$, $\xi,$ and $T$ are the staggered structure factor, the staggered susceptibility, the spin-wave velocity, the correlation length, and the temperature, respectively. For other QCR universal quantities, such as the Wilson ratio $W$ and $\chi_u c^2/T$ ($\chi_u$ is the uniform susceptibility), it is shown that the addition of higher order theoretical contribution makes the agreement between the numerical and the analytic results worse. We find that the same scenario applies to $S(\pi,\pi)/\left(\chi_s T\right)$ and $c/\left(T\xi\right)$ as well. Specifically, our calculations lead to $S(\pi,\pi)/\left(\chi_s T\right)\sim 1.073$ and $c/\left(T\xi\right)\sim 0.963$ which are in better consistence with the leading theoretical predictions than those with the next-to-leading order terms. The presented outcome here as well as those in some relevant literature suggest that it is desirable to conduct a refinement of the analytic calculation to resolve the puzzle of why the inclusion of higher order terms leads to less accurate predictions for these universal quantities.</description>

      <title>Improving accuracy of tree-tensor network approach by optimization of network structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work, we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we precisely analyze how detailed updating schemes in the structural optimization algorithm affect its computational accuracy for the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.</description>

      <title>The charming case of $X(3872)$ and $\chi_{c1}(2P)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than twenty years have elapsed since the discovery of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ (previously denoted as $X(3872)$), and an impressive amount of theoretical and experimental studies has been devoted to its properties, decays and production mechanisms. Despite the extensive work, a full understanding of the nature of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is still missing. In the present study we reconsider a theoretical framework based on the heavy quark large mass limit to analyse the radiative decays of heavy quarkonia, in particular the electric dipole transitions of $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ to S-wave charmonia. The results favourably compare to recent measurements for $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, obtained by the LHCb Collaboration, if this meson is identified with $\chi_{c1}(2P)$.</description>

      <title>Triply heavy tetraquark states in a mass-splitting model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a modified chromomagnetic interaction model, assuming $X(4140)$ to be the lowest $1^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark and treating it as the reference state, we systematically investigated the masses of the triply-heavy tetraquark states $QQ\bar{Q}\bar{q}$ ($Q=c,b;q=u,d,s$). Because of their higher masses, no stable tetraquarks were found. Using a simple scheme, we also estimated the partial widths of the rearrangement decay channels and relevant ratios. A compact triply heavy tetraquark candidate would be favored if its observed mass and partial width ratios were comparable with our predictions. We hope that the present work will be helpful for further studies.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of the nucleon from the generalized parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proton's internal structure is characterized not only by its charge and magnetic distribution but also by its mechanical and mass properties, which are encoded in the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These properties provide insights into the spatial distributions of energy, pressure, and shear forces within the proton. Understanding the proton's internal structure, including properties such as its mechanical and mass radii, is essential for unraveling the complex interplay between quarks and gluons that govern its stability and dynamics. In this study, we investigate the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the proton, particularly the D-term, which encodes key information about the internal stress distribution, pressure, and shear forces within the nucleon. Using a model for skewness-dependent generalized parton distributions (GPDs) constructed from the double-distribution representation, we extract the quark contribution to the $ D(t) $ GFF of the EMT by analyzing available data on Compton form factors (CFFs). We then employ this extracted GFF to explore the mechanical properties of the proton, including its mechanical and mass radii, as well as the internal pressure and shear force distributions. Our results provide new insights into the proton's internal structure and contribute to the broader understanding of nucleon properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic Tensor Renormalization Group (ATRG) is a powerful algorithm for four-dimensional tensor network calculations. However, the larger bond dimensions are known to be difficult to achieve in practice due to the higher computational cost. Adopting the methods of the minimally decomposed TRG and its triad prescriptions, we construct a triad representation of the four-dimensional ATRG by decomposing the unit-cell tensor. We observe that this combining approach can significantly improve the computational cost even with maintaining the convergence accuracy of the free energy in the four-dimensional Ising model. In addition, we also show that a further improvement can be achieved in terms of the computational cost when our proposed approach is implemented in parallel on GPUs.</description>

      <title>One-loop Matching Factors for Singlet Quasi-Parton Distribution Functions in the Hybrid-Ratio Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one loop matching kernels between parton distribution functions (PDFs) for parton $i=u,d,s,g$ and their corresponding quasi-PDFs are computed at one loop in the hybrid-ratio scheme. We found that, in addition to the conservation of the quasi-quark number for each flavor, the second moment $\langle x \rangle_{\tilde{i}}=\langle x \rangle_i$ of quasi-PDF of parton $i$ (denoted as $\tilde{i}$) and PDF of parton $i$ is the same in our approach. This is demonstrated numerically using the CTEQ14 global analysis as input. However, because the quark-quark mixing kernels are not flavor blind, the notion of non-singlet quasi-PDFs is no longer valid. One has to work with the four sets of quasi-PDFs simultaneously to extract the corresponding PDFs.</description>

Abstract: We report the preliminary results of lattice computation for the proton decay matrix elements in $N_f=2+1$ physical point with Wilson-clover fermion. We perform it on the PACS configurations of $64^4$ lattice volume with lattice spacing $a=0.085$ fm, and carefully estimate the systematic uncertainties, especially for the excited state contamination and associated error of the renormalization constant with Regularization Independent (RI, Rome-Southampton) scheme. Our preliminary results of the twelve relevant transition modes in proton decay matrix element and comparison with other lattice results are presented.</description>

Abstract: A new implementation of many-body calculations is of paramount importance in the field of computational physics. In this study, we leverage the capabilities of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for conducting quantum many-body calculations. Through the design of appropriate schemes for Monte Carlo and tensor network methods, we effectively utilize the parallel processing capabilities provided by FPGAs. This has resulted in a tenfold speedup compared to CPU-based computation for a Monte Carlo algorithm. By using a supercell structure and simulating the FPGA architecture on a CPU with High-Level Synthesis, we achieve $O(1)$ scaling for the time of one sweep, regardless of the overall system size. We also demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of FPGA to accelerate a typical tensor network algorithm for many-body ground state calculations. Additionally, we show that the current FPGA computing acceleration is on par with that of multi-threaded GPU parallel processing. Our findings unambiguously highlight the significant advantages of hardware implementation and pave the way for novel approaches to many-body calculations.</description>

      <title>State preparation of lattice field theories using quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the application of quantum optimal control (QOC) techniques to state preparation of lattice field theories on quantum computers. As a first example, we focus on the Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions. We demonstrate that QOC can significantly speed up the ground state preparation compared to gate-based methods, even for models with long-range interactions. Using classical simulations, we explore the dependence on the inter-qubit coupling strength and the device connectivity, and we study the optimization in the presence of noise. While our simulations indicate potential speedups, the results strongly depend on the device specifications. In addition, we perform exploratory studies on the preparation of thermal states. Our results motivate further studies of QOC techniques in the context of quantum simulations for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Isospin breaking corrections in $2\pi$ production in tau decays and $e^+e^-$ annihilation: consequences for the muon $g-2$ and CVC tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the isospin-breaking corrections relating the $e^+e^-$ hadronic cross-section and the tau decay spectral function, focusing on the di-pion channel, that gives the dominant contribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization piece of the muon $g-2$. We test different types of electromagnetic and weak form factors and show that both, the Gounaris-Sakurai and a dispersive-based approach, describe accurately $\tau$ lepton and $e^+e^-$ data (less when KLOE measurements are included in the fits) and comply reasonably well with analyticity constraints. From these results we obtain the isospin-breaking contribution to the conserved vector current (CVC) prediction of the ${\rm BR}(\tau \to \pi\pi\nu_{\tau})$ and to the $2\pi$ hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, in agreement with previous determinations and with similar precision. Our results abound in the convenience of using tau data-based results in the updated data-driven prediction of the muon $g-2$ in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Transverse densities of the energy-momentum tensor and the gravitational form factors the pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present general features of the transverse densities of the stress-energy-momentum tensor $\Theta^{\mu\nu}$ in the pion. We show positivity of the transverse density of $\Theta^{++}$ (analogous to the positivity of the transverse density of the electromagnetic current $J^+$) and discuss its consequences in conjunction with analyticity and quark-hadron duality, as well as the connection to $\pi\pi$ scattering at low energies. Our analysis takes into account the perturbative QCD effects, dominating at high momenta (or low transverse coordinate $b$), the effects of Chiral Perturbation Theory, dominating at low momenta (high $b$), and meson dominance in the intermediate region. We incorporate constraints form analyticity, leading to sum rules for the spectral densities of the corresponding form factors, which {\em i.a.} are relevant for the high-momentum (or the low-$b$) asymptotics. With the obtained high- and low-$b$ behavior, we deduce that the scalar (trace-anomaly) gravitational transverse density $\Theta^{\mu}_\mu(b)$ must change sign, unlike the case of the positive definite $J^+(b)$ or $\Theta^{++}(b)$. We also discuss the transverse pressure in the pion, which is positive and singular at low $b$, and negative at high $b$, in harmony with the stability criterion. The results for the form factors for space-like momenta are compared to the recent lattice QCD data.</description>
