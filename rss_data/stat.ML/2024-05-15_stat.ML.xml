      <title>Additive-Effect Assisted Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is quite popular nowadays for researchers and data analysts holding different datasets to seek assistance from each other to enhance their modeling performance. We consider a scenario where different learners hold datasets with potentially distinct variables, and their observations can be aligned by a nonprivate identifier. Their collaboration faces the following difficulties: First, learners may need to keep data values or even variable names undisclosed due to, e.g., commercial interest or privacy regulations; second, there are restrictions on the number of transmission rounds between them due to e.g., communication costs. To address these challenges, we develop a two-stage assisted learning architecture for an agent, Alice, to seek assistance from another agent, Bob. In the first stage, we propose a privacy-aware hypothesis testing-based screening method for Alice to decide on the usefulness of the data from Bob, in a way that only requires Bob to transmit sketchy data. Once Alice recognizes Bob's usefulness, Alice and Bob move to the second stage, where they jointly apply a synergistic iterative model training procedure. With limited transmissions of summary statistics, we show that Alice can achieve the oracle performance as if the training were from centralized data, both theoretically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Thompson Sampling for Infinite-Horizon Discounted Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model a Markov decision process, parametrized by an unknown parameter, and study the asymptotic behavior of a sampling-based algorithm, called Thompson sampling. The standard definition of regret is not always suitable to evaluate a policy, especially when the underlying chain structure is general. We show that the standard (expected) regret can grow (super-)linearly and fails to capture the notion of learning in realistic settings with non-trivial state evolution. By decomposing the standard (expected) regret, we develop a new metric, called the expected residual regret, which forgets the immutable consequences of past actions. Instead, it measures regret against the optimal reward moving forward from the current period. We show that the expected residual regret of the Thompson sampling algorithm is upper bounded by a term which converges exponentially fast to 0. We present conditions under which the posterior sampling error of Thompson sampling converges to 0 almost surely. We then introduce the probabilistic version of the expected residual regret and present conditions under which it converges to 0 almost surely. Thus, we provide a viable concept of learning for sampling algorithms which will serve useful in broader settings than had been considered previously.</description>

      <title>Scalable Subsampling Inference for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNN) has received increasing attention in machine learning applications in the last several years. Recently, a non-asymptotic error bound has been developed to measure the performance of the fully connected DNN estimator with ReLU activation functions for estimating regression models. The paper at hand gives a small improvement on the current error bound based on the latest results on the approximation ability of DNN. More importantly, however, a non-random subsampling technique--scalable subsampling--is applied to construct a `subagged' DNN estimator. Under regularity conditions, it is shown that the subagged DNN estimator is computationally efficient without sacrificing accuracy for either estimation or prediction tasks. Beyond point estimation/prediction, we propose different approaches to build confidence and prediction intervals based on the subagged DNN estimator. In addition to being asymptotically valid, the proposed confidence/prediction intervals appear to work well in finite samples. All in all, the scalable subsampling DNN estimator offers the complete package in terms of statistical inference, i.e., (a) computational efficiency; (b) point estimation/prediction accuracy; and (c) allowing for the construction of practically useful confidence and prediction intervals.</description>

      <title>Weakly-supervised causal discovery based on fuzzy knowledge and complex data complementarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal discovery based on observational data is important for deciphering the causal mechanism behind complex systems. However, the effectiveness of existing causal discovery methods is limited due to inferior prior knowledge, domain inconsistencies, and the challenges of high-dimensional datasets with small sample sizes. To address this gap, we propose a novel weakly-supervised fuzzy knowledge and data co-driven causal discovery method named KEEL. KEEL adopts a fuzzy causal knowledge schema to encapsulate diverse types of fuzzy knowledge, and forms corresponding weakened constraints. This schema not only lessens the dependency on expertise but also allows various types of limited and error-prone fuzzy knowledge to guide causal discovery. It can enhance the generalization and robustness of causal discovery, especially in high-dimensional and small-sample scenarios. In addition, we integrate the extended linear causal model (ELCM) into KEEL for dealing with the multi-distribution and incomplete data. Extensive experiments with different datasets demonstrate the superiority of KEEL over several state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency. For causal discovery in real protein signal transduction processes, KEEL outperforms the benchmark method with limited data. In summary, KEEL is effective to tackle the causal discovery tasks with higher accuracy while alleviating the requirement for extensive domain expertise.</description>

      <title>Addressing Misspecification in Simulation-based Inference through Data-driven Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by steady progress in generative modeling, simulation-based inference (SBI) has enabled inference over stochastic simulators. However, recent work has demonstrated that model misspecification can harm SBI's reliability. This work introduces robust posterior estimation (ROPE), a framework that overcomes model misspecification with a small real-world calibration set of ground truth parameter measurements. We formalize the misspecification gap as the solution of an optimal transport problem between learned representations of real-world and simulated observations. Assuming the prior distribution over the parameters of interest is known and well-specified, our method offers a controllable balance between calibrated uncertainty and informative inference under all possible misspecifications of the simulator. Our empirical results on four synthetic tasks and two real-world problems demonstrate that ROPE outperforms baselines and consistently returns informative and calibrated credible intervals.</description>

      <title>Mutual information and the encoding of contingency tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual information is commonly used as a measure of similarity between competing labelings of a given set of objects, for example to quantify performance in classification and community detection tasks. As argued recently, however, the mutual information as conventionally defined can return biased results because it neglects the information cost of the so-called contingency table, a crucial component of the similarity calculation. In principle the bias can be rectified by subtracting the appropriate information cost, leading to the modified measure known as the reduced mutual information, but in practice one can only ever compute an upper bound on this information cost, and the value of the reduced mutual information depends crucially on how good a bound is established. In this paper we describe an improved method for encoding contingency tables that gives a substantially better bound in typical use cases, and approaches the ideal value in the common case where the labelings are closely similar, as we demonstrate with extensive numerical results.</description>

      <title>Predicting Ship Responses in Different Seaways using a Generalizable Force Correcting Machine Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A machine learning (ML) method is generalizable if it can make predictions on inputs which differ from the training dataset. For predictions of wave-induced ship responses, generalizability is an important consideration if ML methods are to be useful in design evaluations. Furthermore, the size of the training dataset has a significant impact on the practicality of a method, especially when training data is generated using high-fidelity numerical tools which are expensive. This paper considers a hybrid machine learning method which corrects the force in a low-fidelity equation of motion. The method is applied to two different case studies: the nonlinear responses of a Duffing equation subject to irregular excitation, and high-fidelity heave and pitch response data of a Fast Displacement Ship (FDS) in head seas. The generalizability of the method is determined in both cases by making predictions of the response in irregular wave conditions that differ from those in the training dataset. The influence that low-fidelity physics-based terms in the hybrid model have on generalizability is also investigated. The predictions are compared to two benchmarks: a linear physics-based model and a data-driven LSTM model. It is found that the hybrid method offers an improvement in prediction accuracy and generalizability when trained on a small dataset.</description>

      <title>Do Bayesian imaging methods report trustworthy probabilities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian statistics is a cornerstone of imaging sciences, underpinning many and varied approaches from Markov random fields to score-based denoising diffusion models. In addition to powerful image estimation methods, the Bayesian paradigm also provides a framework for uncertainty quantification and for using image data as quantitative evidence. These probabilistic capabilities are important for the rigorous interpretation of experimental results and for robust interfacing of quantitative imaging pipelines with scientific and decision-making processes. However, are the probabilities delivered by existing Bayesian imaging methods meaningful under replication of an experiment, or are they only meaningful as subjective measures of belief? This paper presents a Monte Carlo method to explore this question. We then leverage the proposed Monte Carlo method and run a large experiment requiring 1,000 GPU-hours to probe the accuracy of five canonical Bayesian imaging methods that are representative of some of the main Bayesian imaging strategies from the past decades (a score-based denoising diffusion technique, a plug-and-play Langevin algorithm utilising a Lipschitz-regularised DnCNN denoiser, a Bayesian method with a dictionary-based prior trained subject to a log-concavity constraint, an empirical Bayesian method with a total-variation prior, and a hierarchical Bayesian Gibbs sampler based on a Gaussian Markov random field model). We find that, a few cases, the probabilities reported by modern Bayesian imaging techniques are in broad agreement with long-term averages as observed over a large number of replication of an experiment, but existing Bayesian imaging methods are generally not able to deliver reliable uncertainty quantification results.</description>

      <title>Data Valuation with Gradient Similarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality data is crucial for accurate machine learning and actionable analytics, however, mislabeled or noisy data is a common problem in many domains. Distinguishing low- from high-quality data can be challenging, often requiring expert knowledge and considerable manual intervention. Data Valuation algorithms are a class of methods that seek to quantify the value of each sample in a dataset based on its contribution or importance to a given predictive task. These data values have shown an impressive ability to identify mislabeled observations, and filtering low-value data can boost machine learning performance. In this work, we present a simple alternative to existing methods, termed Data Valuation with Gradient Similarity (DVGS). This approach can be easily applied to any gradient descent learning algorithm, scales well to large datasets, and performs comparably or better than baseline valuation methods for tasks such as corrupted label discovery and noise quantification. We evaluate the DVGS method on tabular, image and RNA expression datasets to show the effectiveness of the method across domains. Our approach has the ability to rapidly and accurately identify low-quality data, which can reduce the need for expert knowledge and manual intervention in data cleaning tasks.</description>

      <title>Universal replication of chaotic characteristics by classical and quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replicating chaotic characteristics of non-linear dynamics by machine learning (ML) has recently drawn wide attentions. In this work, we propose that a ML model, trained to predict the state one-step-ahead from several latest historic states, can accurately replicate the bifurcation diagram and the Lyapunov exponents of discrete dynamic systems. The characteristics for different values of the hyper-parameters are captured universally by a single ML model, while the previous works considered training the ML model independently by fixing the hyper-parameters to be specific values. Our benchmarks on the one- and two-dimensional Logistic maps show that variational quantum circuit can reproduce the long-term characteristics with higher accuracy than the long short-term memory (a well-recognized classical ML model). Our work reveals an essential difference between the ML for the chaotic characteristics and that for standard tasks, from the perspective of the relation between performance and model complexity. Our results suggest that quantum circuit model exhibits potential advantages on mitigating over-fitting, achieving higher accuracy and stability.</description>

      <title>Learning Decision Policies with Instrumental Variables through Double Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common issue in learning decision-making policies in data-rich settings is spurious correlations in the offline dataset, which can be caused by hidden confounders. Instrumental variable (IV) regression, which utilises a key unconfounded variable known as the instrument, is a standard technique for learning causal relationships between confounded action, outcome, and context variables. Most recent IV regression algorithms use a two-stage approach, where a deep neural network (DNN) estimator learnt in the first stage is directly plugged into the second stage, in which another DNN is used to estimate the causal effect. Naively plugging the estimator can cause heavy bias in the second stage, especially when regularisation bias is present in the first stage estimator. We propose DML-IV, a non-linear IV regression method that reduces the bias in two-stage IV regressions and effectively learns high-performing policies. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and design the DML-IV algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework. The learnt DML-IV estimator has strong convergence rate and $O(N^{-1/2})$ suboptimality guarantees that match those when the dataset is unconfounded. DML-IV outperforms state-of-the-art IV regression methods on IV regression benchmarks and learns high-performing policies in the presence of instruments.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Debiased Inference via Automatic Differentiation and Probabilistic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that simplifies the construction of efficient estimators, making them accessible to a broader audience. 'Dimple' takes as input computer code representing a parameter of interest and outputs an efficient estimator. Unlike standard approaches, it does not require users to derive a functional derivative known as the efficient influence function. Dimple avoids this task by applying automatic differentiation to the statistical functional of interest. Doing so requires expressing this functional as a composition of primitives satisfying a novel differentiability condition. Dimple also uses this composition to determine the nuisances it must estimate. In software, primitives can be implemented independently of one another and reused across different estimation problems. We provide a proof-of-concept Python implementation and showcase through examples how it allows users to go from parameter specification to efficient estimation with just a few lines of code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:nlin/0408039v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We derive a class of macroscopic differential equations that describe collective adaptation, starting from a discrete-time stochastic microscopic model. The behavior of each agent is a dynamic balance between adaptation that locally achieves the best action and memory loss that leads to randomized behavior. We show that, although individual agents interact with their environment and other agents in a purely self-interested way, macroscopic behavior can be interpreted as game dynamics. Application to several familiar, explicit game interactions shows that the adaptation dynamics exhibits a diversity of collective behaviors. The simplicity of the assumptions underlying the macroscopic equations suggests that these behaviors should be expected broadly in collective adaptation. We also analyze the adaptation dynamics from an information-theoretic viewpoint and discuss self-organization induced by information flux between agents, giving a novel view of collective adaptation.</description>

      <title>On the role of surrogates in the efficient estimation of treatment effects with limited outcome data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.12408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many experiments and observational studies, the outcome of interest is often difficult or expensive to observe, reducing effective sample sizes for estimating average treatment effects (ATEs) even when identifiable. We study how incorporating data on units for which only surrogate outcomes not of primary interest are observed can increase the precision of ATE estimation. We refrain from imposing stringent surrogacy conditions, which permit surrogates as perfect replacements for the target outcome. Instead, we supplement the available, albeit limited, observations of the target outcome (which by themselves identify the ATE) with abundant observations of surrogate outcomes, without any assumptions beyond random assignment and missingness and corresponding overlap conditions. To quantify the potential gains, we derive the difference in efficiency bounds on ATE estimation with and without surrogates, both when an overwhelming or comparable number of units have missing outcomes. We develop robust ATE estimation and inference methods that realize these efficiency gains. We empirically demonstrate the gains by studying the long-term-earning effects of job training.</description>

      <title>Learning Linear Polytree Structural Equation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10955v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the problem of learning the directed acyclic graph (DAG) when data are generated from a linear structural equation model (SEM) and the causal structure can be characterized by a polytree. Under the Gaussian polytree models, we study sufficient conditions on the sample sizes for the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm to exactly recover both the skeleton and the equivalence class of the polytree, which is uniquely represented by a CPDAG. On the other hand, necessary conditions on the required sample sizes for both skeleton and CPDAG recovery are also derived in terms of information-theoretic lower bounds, which match the respective sufficient conditions and thereby give a sharp characterization of the difficulty of these tasks. We also consider the problem of inverse correlation matrix estimation under the linear polytree models, and establish the estimation error bound in terms of the dimension and the total number of v-structures. We also consider an extension of group linear polytree models, in which each node represents a group of variables. Our theoretical findings are illustrated by comprehensive numerical simulations, and experiments on benchmark data also demonstrate the robustness of polytree learning when the true graphical structures can only be approximated by polytrees.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we consider the notion of "criterion collapse," in which optimization of one metric implies optimality in another, with a particular focus on conditions for collapse into error probability minimizers under a wide variety of learning criteria, ranging from DRO and OCE risks (CVaR, tilted ERM) to non-monotonic criteria underlying recent ascent-descent algorithms explored in the literature (Flooding, SoftAD). We show how collapse in the context of losses with a Bernoulli distribution goes far beyond existing results for CVaR and DRO, then expand our scope to include surrogate losses, showing conditions where monotonic criteria such as tilted ERM cannot avoid collapse, whereas non-monotonic alternatives can.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Pareto-Smoothed Weighting for High-Dimensional Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects across individuals using their high-dimensional feature attributes. Achieving high performance in such high-dimensional heterogeneous treatment effect estimation is challenging because in this setup, it is usual that some features induce sample selection bias while others do not but are predictive of potential outcomes. To avoid losing such predictive feature information, existing methods learn separate feature representations using inverse probability weighting (IPW). However, due to their numerically unstable IPW weights, these methods suffer from estimation bias under a finite sample setup. To develop a numerically robust estimator by weighted representation learning, we propose a differentiable Pareto-smoothed weighting framework that replaces extreme weight values in an end-to-end fashion. Our experimental results show that by effectively correcting the weight values, our proposed method outperforms the existing ones, including traditional weighting schemes.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Tree-based Ensembles for Anomaly Discovery: Insights, Batch and Streaming Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.08930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world AD applications including computer security and fraud prevention, the anomaly detector must be configurable by the human analyst to minimize the effort on false positives. One important way to configure the detector is by providing true labels (nominal or anomaly) for a few instances. Recent work on active anomaly discovery has shown that greedily querying the top-scoring instance and tuning the weights of ensemble detectors based on label feedback allows us to quickly discover true anomalies.
  This paper makes four main contributions to improve the state-of-the-art in anomaly discovery using tree-based ensembles. First, we provide an important insight that explains the practical successes of unsupervised tree-based ensembles and active learning based on greedy query selection strategy. We also present empirical results on real-world data to support our insights and theoretical analysis to support active learning. Second, we develop a novel batch active learning algorithm to improve the diversity of discovered anomalies based on a formalism called compact description to describe the discovered anomalies. Third, we develop a novel active learning algorithm to handle streaming data setting. We present a data drift detection algorithm that not only detects the drift robustly, but also allows us to take corrective actions to adapt the anomaly detector in a principled manner. Fourth, we present extensive experiments to evaluate our insights and our tree-based active anomaly discovery algorithms in both batch and streaming data settings. Our results show that active learning allows us to discover significantly more anomalies than state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines, our batch active learning algorithm discovers diverse anomalies, and our algorithms under the streaming-data setup are competitive with the batch setup.</description>

      <title>FDive: Learning Relevance Models using Pattern-based Similarity Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12489</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.12489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of interesting patterns in large high-dimensional datasets is difficult because of their dimensionality and pattern complexity. Therefore, analysts require automated support for the extraction of relevant patterns. In this paper, we present FDive, a visual active learning system that helps to create visually explorable relevance models, assisted by learning a pattern-based similarity. We use a small set of user-provided labels to rank similarity measures, consisting of feature descriptor and distance function combinations, by their ability to distinguish relevant from irrelevant data. Based on the best-ranked similarity measure, the system calculates an interactive Self-Organizing Map-based relevance model, which classifies data according to the cluster affiliation. It also automatically prompts further relevance feedback to improve its accuracy. Uncertain areas, especially near the decision boundaries, are highlighted and can be refined by the user. We evaluate our approach by comparison to state-of-the-art feature selection techniques and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by a case study classifying electron microscopy images of brain cells. The results show that FDive enhances both the quality and understanding of relevance models and can thus lead to new insights for brain research.</description>

      <title>Finding Groups of Cross-Correlated Features in Bi-View Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.05079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Datasets in which measurements of two (or more) types are obtained from a common set of samples arise in many scientific applications. A common problem in the exploratory analysis of such data is to identify groups of features of different data types that are strongly associated. A bimodule is a pair (A,B) of feature sets from two data types such that the aggregate cross-correlation between the features in A and those in B is large. A bimodule (A,B) is stable if A coincides with the set of features that have significant aggregate correlation with the features in B, and vice-versa. This paper proposes an iterative-testing based bimodule search procedure (BSP) to identify stable bimodules.
  Compared to existing methods for detecting cross-correlated features, BSP was the best at recovering true bimodules with sufficient signal, while limiting the false discoveries. In addition, we applied BSP to the problem of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis using data from the GTEx consortium. BSP identified several thousand SNP-gene bimodules. While many of the individual SNP-gene pairs appearing in the discovered bimodules were identified by standard eQTL methods, the discovered bimodules revealed genomic subnetworks that appeared to be biologically meaningful and worthy of further scientific investigation.</description>

      <title>Long-term Causal Inference Under Persistent Confounding via Data Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07234v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the identification and estimation of long-term treatment effects when both experimental and observational data are available. Since the long-term outcome is observed only after a long delay, it is not measured in the experimental data, but only recorded in the observational data. However, both types of data include observations of some short-term outcomes. In this paper, we uniquely tackle the challenge of persistent unmeasured confounders, i.e., some unmeasured confounders that can simultaneously affect the treatment, short-term outcomes and the long-term outcome, noting that they invalidate identification strategies in previous literature. To address this challenge, we exploit the sequential structure of multiple short-term outcomes, and develop three novel identification strategies for the average long-term treatment effect. We further propose three corresponding estimators and prove their asymptotic consistency and asymptotic normality. We finally apply our methods to estimate the effect of a job training program on long-term employment using semi-synthetic data. We numerically show that our proposals outperform existing methods that fail to handle persistent confounders.</description>

      <title>Distributed DP-Helmet: Scalable Differentially Private Non-interactive Averaging of Single Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose two differentially private, non-interactive, distributed learning algorithms in a framework called Distributed DP-Helmet. Our framework is based on what we coin blind averaging: each user locally learns and noises a model and all users then jointly compute the mean of their models via a secure summation protocol. We provide experimental evidence that blind averaging for SVMs and single Softmax-layer (Softmax-SLP) can have a strong utility-privacy tradeoff: we reach an accuracy of 86% on CIFAR-10 for $\varepsilon$ = 0.4 and 1,000 users, of 44% on CIFAR-100 for $\varepsilon$ = 1.2 and 100 users, and of 39% on federated EMNIST for $\varepsilon$ = 0.4 and 3,400 users, all after a SimCLR-based pretraining. As an ablation, we study the resilience of our approach to a strongly non-IID setting. On the theoretical side, we show that blind averaging preserves differential privacy if the objective function is smooth, Lipschitz, and strongly convex like SVMs. We show that these properties also hold for Softmax-SLP which is often used for last-layer fine-tuning such that for a fixed model size the privacy bound $\varepsilon$ of Softmax-SLP no longer depends on the number of classes. This marks a significant advantage in utility and privacy of Softmax-SLP over SVMs. Furthermore, in the limit blind averaging of hinge-loss SVMs convergences to a centralized learned SVM. The latter result is based on the representer theorem and can be seen as a blueprint for finding convergence for other empirical risk minimizers (ERM) like Softmax-SLP.</description>

      <title>One-shot Generative Data Augmentation with Bounded Divergence for UAV Identification in Limited RF Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the pressing need for cybersecurity in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), particularly focusing on the challenges of identifying UAVs using radiofrequency (RF) fingerprinting in constrained environments. The complexity and variability of RF signals, influenced by environmental interference and hardware imperfections, often render traditional RF-based identification methods ineffective. To address these complications, the study introduces the rigorous use of one-shot generative methods for augmenting transformed RF signals, offering a significant improvement in UAV identification. This approach shows promise in low-data regimes, outperforming deep generative methods like conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). The paper provides a theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of one-shot generative models in augmenting limited data, setting a precedent for their application in limited RF environments. This research not only contributes to the cybersecurity of UAVs but also rigorously broadens the scope of machine learning techniques in data-constrained scenarios, which may include atypical complex sequences beyond images and videos.</description>

      <title>Locally Adaptive Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a paradigm of distributed machine learning in which multiple clients coordinate with a central server to learn a model, without sharing their own training data. Standard federated optimization methods such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg) ensure balance among the clients by using the same stepsize for local updates on all clients. However, this means that all clients need to respect the global geometry of the function which could yield slow convergence. In this work, we propose locally adaptive federated learning algorithms, that leverage the local geometric information for each client function. We show that such locally adaptive methods with uncoordinated stepsizes across all clients can be particularly efficient in interpolated (overparameterized) settings, and analyze their convergence in the presence of heterogeneous data for convex and strongly convex settings. We validate our theoretical claims by performing illustrative experiments for both i.i.d. non-i.i.d. cases. Our proposed algorithms match the optimization performance of tuned FedAvg in the convex setting, outperform FedAvg as well as state-of-the-art adaptive federated algorithms like FedAMS for non-convex experiments, and come with superior generalization performance.</description>

      <title>SGD-type Methods with Guaranteed Global Stability in Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on providing convergence guarantees for variants of the stochastic subgradient descent (SGD) method in minimizing nonsmooth nonconvex functions. We first develop a general framework to establish global stability for general stochastic subgradient methods, where the corresponding differential inclusion admits a coercive Lyapunov function. We prove that, with sufficiently small stepsizes and controlled noises, the iterates asymptotically stabilize around the stable set of its corresponding differential inclusion. Then we introduce a scheme for developing SGD-type methods with regularized update directions for the primal variables. Based on our developed framework, we prove the global stability of our proposed scheme under mild conditions. We further illustrate that our scheme yields variants of SGD-type methods, which enjoy guaranteed convergence in training nonsmooth neural networks. In particular, by employing the sign map to regularize the update directions, we propose a novel subgradient method named the Sign-map Regularized SGD method (SRSGD). Preliminary numerical experiments exhibit the high efficiency of SRSGD in training deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Anytime-valid t-tests and confidence sequences for Gaussian means with unknown variance</title>

Abstract: In 1976, Lai constructed a nontrivial confidence sequence for the mean $\mu$ of a Gaussian distribution with unknown variance $\sigma^2$. Curiously, he employed both an improper (right Haar) mixture over $\sigma$ and an improper (flat) mixture over $\mu$. Here, we elaborate carefully on the details of his construction, which use generalized nonintegrable martingales and an extended Ville's inequality. While this does yield a sequential t-test, it does not yield an "e-process" (due to the nonintegrability of his martingale). In this paper, we develop two new e-processes and confidence sequences for the same setting: one is a test martingale in a reduced filtration, while the other is an e-process in the canonical data filtration. These are respectively obtained by swapping Lai's flat mixture for a Gaussian mixture, and swapping the right Haar mixture over $\sigma$ with the maximum likelihood estimate under the null, as done in universal inference. We also analyze the width of resulting confidence sequences, which have a curious polynomial dependence on the error probability $\alpha$ that we prove to be not only unavoidable, but (for universal inference) even better than the classical fixed-sample t-test. Numerical experiments are provided along the way to compare and contrast the various approaches, including some recent suboptimal ones.</description>

      <title>Filtered Partial Differential Equations: a robust surrogate constraint in physics-informed deep learning framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedding physical knowledge into neural network (NN) training has been a hot topic. However, when facing the complex real-world, most of the existing methods still strongly rely on the quantity and quality of observation data. Furthermore, the neural networks often struggle to converge when the solution to the real equation is very complex. Inspired by large eddy simulation in computational fluid dynamics, we propose an improved method based on filtering. We analyzed the causes of the difficulties in physics informed machine learning, and proposed a surrogate constraint (filtered PDE, FPDE in short) of the original physical equations to reduce the influence of noisy and sparse observation data. In the noise and sparsity experiment, the proposed FPDE models (which are optimized by FPDE constraints) have better robustness than the conventional PDE models. Experiments demonstrate that the FPDE model can obtain the same quality solution with 100% higher noise and 12% quantity of observation data of the baseline. Besides, two groups of real measurement data are used to show the FPDE improvements in real cases. The final results show that FPDE still gives more physically reasonable solutions when facing the incomplete equation problem and the extremely sparse and high-noise conditions. For combining real-world experiment data into physics-informed training, the proposed FPDE constraint is useful and performs well in two real-world experiments: modeling the blood velocity in vessels and cell migration in scratches.</description>

      <title>More is Better in Modern Machine Learning: when Infinite Overparameterization is Optimal and Overfitting is Obligatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our era of enormous neural networks, empirical progress has been driven by the philosophy that more is better. Recent deep learning practice has found repeatedly that larger model size, more data, and more computation (resulting in lower training loss) improves performance. In this paper, we give theoretical backing to these empirical observations by showing that these three properties hold in random feature (RF) regression, a class of models equivalent to shallow networks with only the last layer trained.
  Concretely, we first show that the test risk of RF regression decreases monotonically with both the number of features and the number of samples, provided the ridge penalty is tuned optimally. In particular, this implies that infinite width RF architectures are preferable to those of any finite width. We then proceed to demonstrate that, for a large class of tasks characterized by powerlaw eigenstructure, training to near-zero training loss is obligatory: near-optimal performance can only be achieved when the training error is much smaller than the test error. Grounding our theory in real-world data, we find empirically that standard computer vision tasks with convolutional neural tangent kernels clearly fall into this class. Taken together, our results tell a simple, testable story of the benefits of overparameterization, overfitting, and more data in random feature models.</description>

      <title>A structured regression approach for evaluating model performance across intersectional subgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disaggregated evaluation is a central task in AI fairness assessment, where the goal is to measure an AI system's performance across different subgroups defined by combinations of demographic or other sensitive attributes. The standard approach is to stratify the evaluation data across subgroups and compute performance metrics separately for each group. However, even for moderately-sized evaluation datasets, sample sizes quickly get small once considering intersectional subgroups, which greatly limits the extent to which intersectional groups are included in analysis. In this work, we introduce a structured regression approach to disaggregated evaluation that we demonstrate can yield reliable system performance estimates even for very small subgroups. We provide corresponding inference strategies for constructing confidence intervals and explore how goodness-of-fit testing can yield insight into the structure of fairness-related harms experienced by intersectional groups. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available datasets, and several variants of semi-synthetic data. The results show that our method is considerably more accurate than the standard approach, especially for small subgroups, and demonstrate how goodness-of-fit testing helps identify the key factors that drive differences in performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the problem of online convex optimization in different settings. We show that any algorithm for online linear optimization with fully adaptive adversaries is an algorithm for online convex optimization. We also show that any such algorithm that requires full-information feedback may be transformed to an algorithm with semi-bandit feedback with comparable regret bound. We further show that algorithms that are designed for fully adaptive adversaries using deterministic semi-bandit feedback can obtain similar bounds using only stochastic semi-bandit feedback when facing oblivious adversaries. We use this to describe general meta-algorithms to convert first order algorithms to zeroth order algorithms with comparable regret bounds. Our framework allows us to analyze online optimization in various settings, such full-information feedback, bandit feedback, stochastic regret, adversarial regret and various forms of non-stationary regret.</description>

      <title>A Short Survey on Importance Weighting for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Importance weighting is a fundamental procedure in statistics and machine learning that weights the objective function or probability distribution based on the importance of the instance in some sense. The simplicity and usefulness of the idea has led to many applications of importance weighting. For example, it is known that supervised learning under an assumption about the difference between the training and test distributions, called distribution shift, can guarantee statistically desirable properties through importance weighting by their density ratio. This survey summarizes the broad applications of importance weighting in machine learning and related research.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Policy Imitation, Transferable Reward Recovery and Algebraic Equilibrium Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) stands as a cornerstone approach in imitation learning, yet it faces criticisms from prior studies. In this paper, we rethink AIRL and respond to these criticisms. Criticism 1 lies in Inadequate Policy Imitation. We show that substituting the built-in algorithm with soft actor-critic (SAC) during policy updating (requires multi-iterations) significantly enhances the efficiency of policy imitation. Criticism 2 lies in Limited Performance in Transferable Reward Recovery Despite SAC Integration. While we find that SAC indeed exhibits a significant improvement in policy imitation, it introduces drawbacks to transferable reward recovery. We prove that the SAC algorithm itself is not feasible to disentangle the reward function comprehensively during the AIRL training process, and propose a hybrid framework, PPO-AIRL + SAC, for a satisfactory transfer effect. Criticism 3 lies in Unsatisfactory Proof from the Perspective of Potential Equilibrium. We reanalyze it from an algebraic theory perspective.</description>

      <title>Learning the mechanisms of network growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel model-selection method for dynamic networks. Our approach involves training a classifier on a large body of synthetic network data. The data is generated by simulating nine state-of-the-art random graph models for dynamic networks, with parameter range chosen to ensure exponential growth of the network size in time. We design a conceptually novel type of dynamic features that count new links received by a group of vertices in a particular time interval. The proposed features are easy to compute, analytically tractable, and interpretable. Our approach achieves a near-perfect classification of synthetic networks, exceeding the state-of-the-art by a large margin. Applying our classification method to real-world citation networks gives credibility to the claims in the literature that models with preferential attachment, fitness and aging fit real-world citation networks best, although sometimes, the predicted model does not involve vertex fitness.</description>

      <title>From Linear to Linearizable Optimization: A Novel Framework with Applications to Stationary and Non-stationary DR-submodular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of upper linearizable/quadratizable functions, a class that extends concavity and DR-submodularity in various settings, including monotone and non-monotone cases over different convex sets. A general meta-algorithm is devised to convert algorithms for linear/quadratic maximization into ones that optimize upper quadratizable functions, offering a unified approach to tackling concave and DR-submodular optimization problems. The paper extends these results to multiple feedback settings, facilitating conversions between semi-bandit/first-order feedback and bandit/zeroth-order feedback, as well as between first/zeroth-order feedback and semi-bandit/bandit feedback. Leveraging this framework, new algorithms are derived using existing results as base algorithms for convex optimization, improving upon state-of-the-art results in various cases. Dynamic and adaptive regret guarantees are obtained for DR-submodular maximization, marking the first algorithms to achieve such guarantees in these settings. Notably, the paper achieves these advancements with fewer assumptions compared to existing state-of-the-art results, underscoring its broad applicability and theoretical contributions to non-convex optimization.</description>

      <title>How Inverse Conditional Flows Can Serve as a Substitute for Distributional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network representations of simple models, such as linear regression, are being studied increasingly to better understand the underlying principles of deep learning algorithms. However, neural representations of distributional regression models, such as the Cox model, have received little attention so far. We close this gap by proposing a framework for distributional regression using inverse flow transformations (DRIFT), which includes neural representations of the aforementioned models. We empirically demonstrate that the neural representations of models in DRIFT can serve as a substitute for their classical statistical counterparts in several applications involving continuous, ordered, time-series, and survival outcomes. We confirm that models in DRIFT empirically match the performance of several statistical methods in terms of estimation of partial effects, prediction, and aleatoric uncertainty quantification. DRIFT covers both interpretable statistical models and flexible neural networks opening up new avenues in both statistical modeling and deep learning.</description>
