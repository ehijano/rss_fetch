      <title>Green relations over finite monoids of $G$-equivariant functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a group $G$ acting over a set $X$, the set of all the $G$-equivariant functions, i.e., the set of functions which conmute with the action, ($g\cdot f(x)=g\cdot f(x), \forall g\in G, \forall x\in X$), is a monoid with the composition. The Green Relations are powerful tools to comprehend the structure of a semigroup. We study the case where $X$ is a finite set and compute the green relations for its monoid of $G$-equivariant functions, attempting to describe them based on some particular elements in the monoid called elementary collapsings.</description>

      <title>On finite nilpotent groups with the same enhanced power graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhanced power graph of a group $G$ is the graph $P_e(G)$ whose vertex set is $G$, such that two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$, are adjacent if $\langle x, y\rangle$ is cyclic. In this paper, we analyze the structure of the enhanced power graph of a finite nilpotent group in terms of the enhanced power graphs of its Sylow subgroups. We establish that for two nilpotent groups, their enhanced power graphs are isomorphic if and only if the enhanced power graphs of their Sylow subgroups are isomorphic. Additionally, we identify specific nilpotent groups for which the enhanced power graphs uniquely characterize the group structure, meaning that if $P_e(G)\cong P_e(H)$ then $G \cong H$. Finally, we extend these results to power graphs and cyclic graphs.</description>

      <title>Powerful subgroups of extensions of powerful $p$-groups and pro-$p$ groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ H $ be a finitely generated pro-$ p $ group. We prove that, if $H/Z_{n-1}(H)$ is a powerful group, then the $n$-th terms of the lower $p$-series and the lower central series of $H$ are powerfully embedded in $H$. As a consequence, we obtain that if $ H/Z_n(H) $ is a $p$-adic analytic pro-$p$ group for some positive integer $n$, then $ H $ is a $ p $-adic analytic pro-$ p $ group. Furthermore, we extend these results to pro-$ p $ groups that are not necessarily finitely generated, provided some additional conditions are imposed.</description>

      <title>Quasi-convex Splittings of Acylindrical Graphs of Locally Finite-Height Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a condition on the action of a finitely presented group on a simplicial tree which guarantees that this action will be dominated by an acylindrical action with finitely generated edge stabilisers, and find the first example of an action of a finitely presented group where there is no such dominating action. As a consequence, we show that any hyperbolic group that admits a decomposition as an acylindrical graph of (possibly infinitely generated) free groups is virtually cocompact special, and that if one assumes that every finite-height subgroup of a hyperbolic group is quasi-convex then every finitely generated subgroup of a one-relator group with an acylindrical Magnus hierarchy admits a quasi-convex hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Connecting the space of marked groups and the space of group operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between two well-studied spaces of countable groups: the space of group operations and the space of marked groups. This connection shows that the two spaces are equivalent in terms of generic properties in the sense of Baire category, which allows us to translate several results from the former setting to the latter. As an application, we give new, shorter proofs of two theorems that concern the generic behavior of compact metrizable abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Groups Acting Acylindrically on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12192v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a notion of groups that act acylindrically and non-elementarily on simplicial trees, which we call acylindrically arboreal groups. We then prove a complete classification of when graph products of groups and the fundamental groups of certain hyperbolic $3$-manifolds are acylindrically arboreal, and use these classifications to provide examples of acylindrically hyperbolic groups that have actions on trees but have no non-elementary acylindrical actions on trees.</description>

      <title>Homomorphisms between XL-type Artin groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study homomorphisms between XL-type Artin groups and show that, in a suitable sense, a generic Artin group is both hopfian and co-hopfian.
  For XL-type Artin groups over complete graphs, we describe all possible homomorphisms with sufficiently large image, and prove in particular that such groups are both hopfian and co-hopfian. For Artin groups over general graphs with all labels at least $6$, we characterise in terms of the presentation graph exactly when these groups are co-hopfian, as well as when they have a finite outer automorphism group. When in addition the presentation graph has no cut-vertex, we show that their automorphism group is finitely generated and we provide a generating set.</description>

      <title>Sign-twisted generating functions of the odd length for Weyl groups of type $D$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07658v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The odd length in Weyl groups is a new statistic analogous to the classical Coxeter length, and features combinatorial and parity conditions. We establish explicit closed product formulas for the sign-twisted generating functions of the odd length for parabolic quotients of Weyl groups of type $D$. As a consequence, we verify three conjectures of Brenti and Carnevale on evaluating closed forms for these generating functions. We then give an equivalent condition for the sign-twisted generating functions to be expressible as products of cyclotomic polynomials, settling a conjecture of Stembridge.</description>

      <title>Separable elements and splittings in Weyl groups of Type $B$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Separable elements in Weyl groups are generalizations of the well-known class of separable permutations in symmetric groups. Gaetz and Gao showed that for any pair $(X,Y)$ of subsets of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$, the multiplication map $X\times Y\rightarrow \mathfrak{S}_n$ is a splitting (i.e., a length-additive bijection) of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ if and only if $X$ is the generalized quotient of $Y$ and $Y$ is a principal lower order ideal in the right weak order generated by a separable element. They conjectured this result can be extended to all finite Weyl groups. In this paper, we classify all separable and minimal non-separable signed permutations in terms of forbidden patterns and confirm the conjecture of Gaetz and Gao for Weyl groups of type $B$.</description>

      <title>On the Fourier analysis in the SO(3) space : EquiLoPO Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing volumetric data with rotational invariance or equivariance is an active topic in current research. Existing deep-learning approaches utilize either group convolutional networks limited to discrete rotations or steerable convolutional networks with constrained filter structures. This work proposes a novel equivariant neural network architecture that achieves analytical Equivariance to Local Pattern Orientation on the continuous SO(3) group while allowing unconstrained trainable filters - EquiLoPO Network. Our key innovations are a group convolutional operation leveraging irreducible representations as the Fourier basis and a local activation function in the SO(3) space that provides a well-defined mapping from input to output functions, preserving equivariance. By integrating these operations into a ResNet-style architecture, we propose a model that overcomes the limitations of prior methods. A comprehensive evaluation on diverse 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, which consistently outperforms state of the art. This work suggests the benefits of true rotational equivariance on SO(3) and flexible unconstrained filters enabled by the local activation function, providing a flexible framework for equivariant deep learning on volumetric data with potential applications across domains. Our code is publicly available at https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/GruLab/ILPO/-/tree/main/EquiLoPO.</description>
