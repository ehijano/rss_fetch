      <title>Deep learning inference with the Event Horizon Telescope I. Calibration improvements and a comprehensive synthetic data library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) In a series of publications, we describe a comprehensive comparison of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data with theoretical models of Sgr A* and M87*. Here, we report on improvements made to our observational data reduction pipeline and present the generation of observables derived from the EHT models. We make use of ray-traced GRMHD simulations that are based on different black hole spacetime metrics and accretion physics parameters. These broad classes of models provide a good representation of the primary targets observed by the EHT. To generate realistic synthetic data from our models, we took the signal path as well as the calibration process, and thereby the aforementioned improvements, into account. We could thus produce synthetic visibilities akin to calibrated EHT data and identify salient features for the discrimination of model parameters. We have produced a library consisting of an unparalleled 962,000 synthetic Sgr A* and M87* datasets. In terms of baseline coverage and noise properties, the library encompasses 2017 EHT measurements as well as future observations with an extended telescope array. We differentiate between robust visibility data products related to model features and data products that are strongly affected by data corruption effects. Parameter inference is mostly limited by intrinsic model variability, which highlights the importance of long-term monitoring observations with the EHT. In later papers in this series, we will show how a Bayesian neural network trained on our synthetic data is capable of dealing with the model variability and extracting physical parameters from EHT observations. With our calibration improvements, our newly reduced EHT datasets have a considerably better quality compared to previously analyzed data.</description>

      <title>Deep learning inference with the Event Horizon Telescope II. The Zingularity framework for Bayesian artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) In this second paper in our publication series, we present the open-source Zingularity framework for parameter inference with deep Bayesian artificial neural networks. We carried out out supervised learning with synthetic millimeter very long baseline interferometry observations of the EHT. Our ground-truth models are based on GRMHD simulations of Sgr A* and M87* on horizon scales. We investigated how well Zingularity neural networks are able to infer key model parameters from EHT observations, such as the black hole spin and the magnetic state of the accretion disk, when uncertainties in the data are accurately taken into account. Zingularity makes use of the TensorFlow Probability library and is able to handle large amounts of data with a combination of the efficient TFRecord data format plus the Horovod framework. Our approach is the first analysis of EHT data with Bayesian neural networks, where an unprecedented training data size, under consideration of a closely modeled EHT signal path, and the full information content of the observational data are used. Zingularity infers parameters based on salient features in the data and is containerized. Through parameter surveys and dedicated validation tests, we identified neural network architectures, that are robust against internal stochastic processes and unaffected by noise in the observational and model data. We give examples of how different data properties affect the network training. We show how the Bayesian nature of our networks gives trustworthy uncertainties and uncovers failure modes for uncharacterizable data. It is easy to achieve low validation errors during training on synthetic data with neural networks, particularly when the forward modeling is too simplified. Through careful studies, we demonstrate that our trained networks can generalize well so that reliable results can be obtained from observational data.</description>

      <title>pynamicalsys: A Python toolkit for the analysis of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since Lorenz's seminal work on a simplified weather model, the numerical analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems has become one of the main subjects of research in physics. Despite of that, there remains a need for accessible, efficient, and easy-to-use computational tools to study such systems. In this paper, we introduce pynamicalsys, a simple yet powerful open-source Python module for the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. In particular, pynamicalsys implements tools for trajectory simulation, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents and several others chaotic indicators, period orbit detection and their manifolds, as well as escape and basins analysis. It also includes many built-in models and the use of custom models is straighforward. We demonstrate the capabilities of pynamicalsys through a series of examples that reproduces well-known results in the literature while developing the mathematical analysis at the same time. We also provide the Jupyter notebook containing all the code used in this paper, including performance benchmarks. pynamicalsys is freely available via the Python Package Index (PyPI) and is indented to support both research and teaching in nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>ReLCP: Scalable Complementarity-Based Collision Resolution for Smooth Rigid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complementarity-based collision resolution algorithm for smooth, non-spherical, rigid bodies. Unlike discrete surface representation approaches, which approximate surfaces using discrete elements (e.g., tessellations or sub-spheres) with constraints between nearby faces, edges, nodes, or sub-objects, our algorithm solves a recursively generated linear complementarity problem (ReLCP) to adaptively identify potential collision locations during the collision resolution procedure. Despite adaptively and in contrast to Newton-esque schemes, we prove conditions under which the resulting solution exists and the center of mass translational and rotational dynamics are unique. Our ReLCP also converges to classical LCP-based collision resolution for sufficiently small timesteps. Because increasing the surface resolution in discrete representation methods necessitates subdividing geometry into finer elements -- leading to a super-linear increase in the number of collision constraints -- these approaches scale poorly with increased surface resolution. In contrast, our adaptive ReLCP framework begins with a single constraint per pair of nearby bodies and introduces new constraints only when unconstrained motion would lead to overlap, circumventing the oversampling required by discrete methods. By requiring one to two orders of magnitude fewer collision constraints to achieve the same surface resolution, we observe 10-100x speedup in densely packed applications. We validate our ReLCP method against multisphere and single-constraint methods, comparing convergence in a two-ellipsoid collision test, scalability and performance in a compacting ellipsoid suspension and growing bacterial colony, and stability in a taut chainmail network, highlighting our ability to achieve high-fidelity surface representations without suffering from poor scalability or artificial surface roughness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) nanomagnetism is a rapidly developing field within magnetic materials research, where exploiting the third dimension unlocks opportunities for innovative applications in areas such as sensing, data storage, and neuromorphic computing. Among various fabrication techniques, focused electron beam-induced deposition (FEBID) offers high flexibility in creating complex 3D nanostructures with sub-100 nm resolution. A key challenge in the development of 3D nanomagnets is the ability to locally control the magnetic configuration, which is essential to achieve desired functionalities. In this work, the magnetization reversal mechanism of a three-dimensional nanoarchitecture fabricated using focused electron beam-induced deposition is investigated by combining direct observation via scanning transmission X-ray microscopy with finite element micromagnetic simulations. In particular, our investigation shows that the magnetization of the components of a three-dimensional Co3 Fe tetrapod can be reversed individually and sequentially. Finally, it is demonstrated that complete control and reconfigurability of the system can be achieved by tuning the direction of the applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Higher-Oder Splitting Schemes for Fluids with Variable Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14424v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates matrix-free higher-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows with variable viscosity. The viscosity field may be prescribed analytically or governed by a rheological law, as often found in biomedical or industrial applications. The DG discretization of the adapted second-order viscous terms is carried out via the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method, obviating auxiliary variables. Based on this spatial discretization, we compare several linearized variants of saddle point block systems and projection-based splitting time integration schemes in terms of their computational performance. Compared to the velocity-pressure block-system for the former, the splitting scheme allows solving a sequence of simple problems such as mass, convection-diffusion and Poisson equations. We investigate under which conditions the improved temporal stability of fully implicit schemes and resulting expensive nonlinear solves outperform the splitting schemes and linearized variants that are stable under hyperbolic time step restrictions.
  The key aspects of this work are i) a higher-order DG discretization for incompressible flows with variable viscosity, ii) accelerated nonlinear solver variants and suitable linearizations adopting a matrix-free $hp$-multigrid solver, and iii) a detailed comparison of the monolithic and projection-based solvers in terms of their (non-)linear solver performance.
  The presented schemes are evaluated in a series of numerical examples verifying their spatial and temporal accuracy, and the preconditioner performance under increasing viscosity contrasts, while their efficiency is showcased in the backward-facing step benchmark.</description>

      <title>Versatile SPH Open Boundary Conditions for Multiphase Flows in Extreme Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method has been demonstrated as a promising numerical solver for multiphase flow problems due to its Lagrangian nature, its application to complex channel flow may encounter additional issues such as the open boundary condition and numerical instability in the extreme flow state. The present work aims to establish a general SPH algorithm for accurate and stable simulation of complex multiphase flows in configurations with open boundaries. The general scheme of weakly compressible SPH is adopted with special treatments implemented to ease the numerical oscillation in the density discontinuity scenario, and the turbulent model is implemented for interpretations of extreme flow conditions in high Reynolds numbers. Then, the conventional open boundary condition is fine-tuned by two new algorithms to guarantee the numerical stability in the inflow and the outflow regions. Firstly, a density relaxation is proposed to alleviate the pressure instability in the inflow region, which improves the smoothness of the particle pre-processing procedure. Secondly, the particle shifting technique with adaptive damper is implemented to adjust the magnitude of correction in the outflow region, which helps to suppress the velocity oscillation near the outlet. Validations of the proposed algorithms are carried out through four classic numerical examples, presenting appealing agreements with the analytical solutions and thus demonstrating the versatility in various flow conditions. Then, the robustness of the method is established through the turbulent multiphase channel flow cases and the horizontal slug channel flow with large density ratios. These results shed light on the value of the proposed algorithm as a general solver for complex multiphase flow problems with open boundaries.</description>

      <title>First-passage time to capture for diffusion in a 3D harmonic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the survival probability and first-passage time (FPT) to capture for a harmonically trapped particle, diffusing outside an absorbing spherical boundary by directly solving the differential equation for the survival probability. This solution, obtained as an infinite sum over the relevant eigenfunctions, corrects previously published results [D. S. Grebenkov, J. Phys. A 48, 013001 (2014)]. To verify our calculations, we perform simulations of the survival probability, that accurately reproduce the analytic solutions for a range of parameter values. We then obtain the corresponding FPT distribution as the negative time derivative of the survival probability. Finally, we derive an expression for mean first-passage time (MFPT), also as a sum over eigenfunctions. Numerical evaluation of the first twenty-five terms in this sum closely matches the MFPT obtained by a different method in D. S. Grebenkov, J. Phys. A 48, 013001 (2014). We also find that, in the limit of vanishing trap stiffness, the amplitude of the first term in our infinite-sum solution for the survival probability matches the theoretical escape probability for the potential-free diffusion-to-capture process.</description>

      <title>Accurate and scalable exchange-correlation with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14665v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description>

      <title>A stochastic noise model based excess noise factor expressions for staircase avalanche photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are the solid-state analogue of photomultiplier tubes, owing to their deterministic amplification with twofold stepwise gain via impact ionization. Yet, the stepwise impact ionization irregularities worsen with increasing step counts, which are a major source of internal noise in these APDs. Some noise models for staircase APDs have been previously reported, where the excess noise factor expressions are based on Friis' noise factor formula for cascade networks, erroneously considering the power gains as the gains. Excess noise factor being a key component in staircase APDs' noise models, we formulate generalized excess noise factor expressions for multilayer graded-bandgap APDs in terms of their layer-wise ionization probabilities, applicable for all operating biases, which include the sub-threshold, staircase, and tunnelling breakdown regimes. We further derive simplified expressions for staircase APDs and prove that these expressions match Bangera's corrections to Friis' noise factor formulas for cascade networks.</description>

      <title>Configuration Interaction Guided Sampling with Interpretable Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to solve the Schr\"odinger equation in configuration space. Traditional Configuration Interaction (CI) methods construct the wavefunction as a linear combination of Slater determinants, but this becomes computationally expensive due to the factorial growth in the number of configurations. Our approach extends the use of a generative model such as the RBM by incorporating a taboo list strategy to enhance efficiency and convergence. The RBM is used to efficiently identify and sample the most significant determinants, thus accelerating convergence and substantially reducing computational cost. This method achieves up to 99.99% of the correlation energy while using up to four orders of magnitude fewer determinants compared to full CI calculations and up to two orders of magnitude fewer than previous state of the art methods. Beyond efficiency, our analysis reveals that the RBM learns electron distributions over molecular orbitals by capturing quantum patterns that resemble Radial Distribution Functions (RDFs) linked to molecular bonding. This suggests that the learned pattern is interpretable, highlighting the potential of machine learning for explainable quantum chemistry</description>

      <title>Optimization of Second-Order Transport Models for Transition-Continuum Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling transition-continuum hypersonic flows poses significant challenges due to thermodynamic nonequilibrium and the associated breakdown of the continuum assumption. Standard continuum models such as the Navier-Stokes equations are inaccurate for these flows, and molecular models can be inefficient due to the large number of computational particles required at moderately high densities. We explore computational modeling of transition-continuum flows using a second-order constitutive theory that provides closures for the terms representing the molecular transport of momentum and energy. We optimize the second-order model parameters for one-dimensional viscous shocks using an adjoint-based optimization method, with the objective function comprising the primitive flow variables. Target data is obtained from moments of distribution functions obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation. We compare results using optimized second-order models, the unoptimized second-order model, and the first-order Navier-Stokes model for Mach numbers $M\in[1.1,10]$ and observe improvements to the shock profiles and shock thickness calculations. We validate the optimized models by comparing the predicted viscous stress and heat flux, which are not included in the objective function, to those obtained by integrating the distribution function. The close match to these moments indicates that the satisfactory performance of the optimized second-order models is consistent with the nonequilibrium flow physics.</description>

Abstract: The choice of vibrational coordinates is crucial for the accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of molecular vibrational dynamics and spectra calculations. We explore the recently proposed normalizing-flow vibrational coordinates, which are learned molecule-specific coordinate transformations optimized for a given basis set. Much like how spherical coordinates naturally simplify the hydrogen atom by embedding physical insight into the coordinate system, normalizing-flow coordinates offload complexity from the basis functions into the coordinate transformation itself. This shift not only improves basis-set convergence, but also enhances interpretability of vibrational motions. We provide an analysis of the utility, interpretation and associated constraints of normalizing-flow vibrational coordinates. Moreover, we demonstrate that these coordinates can be generalized across different isotopologues, and even structurally related molecules, achieved with minimal fine-tuning of selected output parameters.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization of neural network backflow for ab-initio quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians is key to determining molecular properties. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer flexible and expressive wavefunction ansatze for this task but face two main challenges: highly peaked ground-state wavefunctions hinder efficient sampling, and local energy evaluations scale quartically with system size, incurring significant computational costs. In this work, we overcome these challenges by introducing a suite of algorithmic enhancements, which includes efficient periodic compact subspace construction, truncated local energy evaluations, improved stochastic sampling, and physics-informed modifications.
  Applying these techniques to the neural network backflow (NNBF) ansatz, we demonstrate significant gains in both accuracy and scalability. Our enhanced method surpasses traditional quantum chemistry methods like CCSD and CCSD(T), outperforms other NQS approaches, and achieves competitive energies with state-of-the-art ab initio techniques such as HCI, ASCI, FCIQMC, and DMRG. A series of ablation and comparative studies quantifies the contribution of each enhancement to the observed improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate the representational capacity of the ansatz, finding that its performance correlates with the inverse participation ratio (IPR), with more delocalized states being more challenging to approximate.</description>

      <title>Path integral spin dynamics with exchange and external field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a path integral-inspired formalism for computing the quantum thermal expectation values of spin systems, when subject to magnetic fields that can be time-dependent and can accommodate the presence of Heisenberg exchange interactions between the spins. This is done by deriving an effective magnetic field from the quantum partition function of the system to use in classical atomistic spin dynamics simulations and generalises the formalism presented in our previous work [Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043075 (2023)]. In special cases where the effective field can be computed exactly we compare our results with exact/numerical diagonalisation methods for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling. We show that our method works well across a large temperature range and can reproduce quantum expectation values for antiferromagnetic coupling which is usually not possible with classical models.</description>
