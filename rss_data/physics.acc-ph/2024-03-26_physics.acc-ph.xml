      <title>Interplay of space charge, intrabeam scattering and synchrotron radiation in the Compact Linear Collider damping rings</title>

Abstract: Future ultra-low emittance rings for electron/positron colliders requiring extremely high beam brightness can be limited by collective effects. In this paper, the interplay of effects such as synchrotron radiation, intra-beam scattering (IBS) and space charge in the vicinity of excited betatron resonances is assessed. In this respect, two algorithms were developed to simulate IBS and synchrotron radiation effects and integrated in the PyORBIT tracking code, to be combined with its widely used space charge module. The impact of these effects on the achievable beam parameters of the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) Damping Rings was studied, showing that synchrotron radiation damping mitigates the adverse effects of IBS and space charge induced resonance crossing. The studies include also a full dynamic simulation of the CLIC damping ring cycle starting from the injection beam parameters. It is demonstrated that a careful working point choice is necessary, in order to accommodate the transition from a non-linear lattice induced detuning to a space-charge dominated one and thereby avoid excessive losses and emittance growth generated in the vicinity of strong resonances.</description>

      <title>Relativistic beam loading, recoil-reduction, and residual-wake acceleration with a covariant retarded-potential integrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An algorithm is demonstrated that performs first-principles tracking of relativistic charged-particles. A covariant approach is used which relies on retarded vector potentials for trajectory integration instead of performing electromagnetic field calculations. When accounting for retardation effects, the peak vector potential and corresponding Lorentz force in the direction of travel increase asymptotically for high-$\beta$ particles. This produces a very strong field distribution at small angles from the particle's direction of travel, which can result in considerable change in momentum when approaching a conducting surface or another charged particle. We quantify the former effect for protons and electrons at various energies and aperture sizes, where substantial power deposition can be avoided by ensuring that particles do not pass within roughly 10 microns of the aperture surface.
  We also simulate breaking a test particle's line of sight with a conductor or other charged body. After this instant, the test particle continues to accelerate due to residual fields, but no longer produces an opposing force on any charged or conducting object; thus any recoil on the enclosing structure is effectively reduced.
  Resulting acceleration dynamics are characterized using protons and electrons at various energies; with, for example, a 1% energy gain for an 85 MeV electron traversing its reflected wake while approaching a pinhole aperture. We then integrate a micro-scale dielectric laser acceleration (DLA) device into our simulations: compared with a solitary 2 mm DLA, we find a factor of two increase in energy gain when combining the DLA with a series of conducting-surface choppers.</description>
