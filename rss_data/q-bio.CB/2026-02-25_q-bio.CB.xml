Abstract: Fibroblast cells play a key role in maintaining the extracellular matrix. During wound healing, fibroblasts differentiate into highly contractile myofibroblasts, which secrete extracellular matrix proteins like collagen to facilitate tissue repair. Under normal conditions, myofibroblasts undergo programmed cell death after healing to prevent excessive scar formation. However, in diseases like fibrosis, the myofibroblasts remain active even after the wound is closed, resulting in excessive collagen buildup and a stiff, fibrotic matrix. The reasons for the persistence of myofibroblasts in fibrosis are not well understood. Here, we show the existence of a mechanism where direct physical contact between a fibroblast and a myofibroblast is sufficient for fibroblasts to transition into myofibroblasts. We demonstrate that the fibroblast-myofibroblast transition can occur even in the absence of known biochemical cues, such as growth factor activation or mechanical cues from a stiff, fibrotic matrix. Furthermore, we demonstrate that contact-based fibroblast-myofibroblast activation can be inhibited by the G{\alpha}q/11/14 inhibitor FR900359, which prevents the formation of myofibroblasts. These findings provide new insights into the persistence of fibrosis despite therapeutic interventions, suggesting a potential strategy for targeting the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition in fibrotic conditions.</description>
