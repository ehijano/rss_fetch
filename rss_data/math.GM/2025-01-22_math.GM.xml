      <title>Polynomial potential minimization on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the following, we study the minimization of polynomial potentials $ f(t) $ on the unit circle, where the potentials take the form \[ f(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n b_i x^{2i}, \quad b_i \in \mathbb{R}. \] This form arises in the context of truncations of expansions of $ p $-frame potentials. One approach to minimize these potentials involves rewriting the integral as a sum of integrals obtained by expanding the potential $ f(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i T_i(t) $ in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. By replacing the inner product $ \langle x, y \rangle $ with $ \cos(\theta_{x, y}) $, we can reformulate the original problem as: \[ \min_{\mu \in P(T)} \int_T \int_T f(\langle x, y \rangle) d\mu(x) d\mu(y) \] as an equivalent form: \[ \min_{\nu \in P([-\pi, \pi])} \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \int_{-\pi}^\pi \int_{-\pi}^\pi \cos(n(x - y)) d\nu(x) d\nu(y) \].</description>

      <title>Riemann-Liouville type fractional a new generalization of Bernstein-Kantorovich operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximation theory is a substantial field of mathematical analysis that emerged in the 19th century and has been developed by mathematicians across the globe ever since. Its importance has increased over time, as it provides solutions to numerous scientific challenges not only in mathematics but also in fields like as physics and engineering etc. In the present work, we construct Riemann-Liouville type fractional a new generalization of Bernstein-Kantorovich type operators. First, we obtain the moment and central moments from some basic calculations. Also, we study several direct and local approximation outcomes of the constructed operators. Next, we serve up certain graphical and numerical results to demonstrate the convergence, accuracy and significance of constructed operators. Further, we provide bivariate version of the newly constructed operators and establish degree of approximation through of partial and complete modulus of continuity. Lastly, we present some graphical representations and maximum error of approximation tables to verify the convergence behavior of bivariate form of related operators based on various parameters.</description>

      <title>The sliding tile puzzle, roots to polynomials, and $\textbf{P}$ vs. $\textbf{NP}$ complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the relationship between solution space and time complexity in the context of the $\textbf{P}$ vs. $\textbf{NP}$ problem, particularly through the lens of the sliding tile puzzle and root finding algorithms. We focus on the trade-off between finding a solution and verifying it, highlighting how understanding the structure of the solution space can inform the complexity of these problems. By examining the relationship between the number of possible configurations and the time complexity required to traverse this space we demonstrate that the minimal time to verify a solution is often smaller than the time required to discover it. Our results suggest that the efficiency of solving $\textbf{NP}$-complete problems is not only determined by the ability to find solutions but also by how effectively we can navigate and characterize the solution space. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on computational complexity, particularly in understanding the interplay between solution space size, algorithm design, and the inherent challenges of finding versus verifying solutions.</description>

      <title>Heat equation and Schr\"{o}dinger equation with translation invariance on the infinite-dimensional vector space $\mathbb R^\infty$</title>

Abstract: The standard Laplacian $-\triangle_{\mathbb R^n}$ in $L^2(\mathbb R^n)$ is self-adjoint and translation invariant on the finite-dimensional linear space $\mathbb R^n$. In this paper, we define a translation invariant operator $-\triangle_{\mathbb R^\infty}$ on $\mathbb R^\infty$ as a non-negative self-adjoint operator in some non-separable Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb R^\infty)$. The set $L^2(\mathbb R^\infty)$ is a translation invariant subset of the set $CM(\mathbb R^\infty)$ of all complex measures on the product measurable space $\mathbb R^\infty$. Furthermore, we show that for any $f\in L^2(\mathbb R^n)$ and any $u\in L^2(\mathbb R^\infty)$, the separations of variables $e^{\triangle_{\mathbb R^\infty}t}(f\otimes u) =(e^{\triangle_{\mathbb R^n}t}f)\otimes (e^{\triangle_{\mathbb R^\infty}t}u) \ (t\in [0,+\infty))$ and $e^{\sqrt{-1}\triangle_{\mathbb R^\infty}t}(f\otimes u) =(e^{\sqrt{-1}\triangle_{\mathbb R^n}t}f)\otimes (e^{\sqrt{-1}\triangle_{\mathbb R^\infty}t}u) \ (t\in (-\infty,+\infty))$ hold. This clearly shows that $-\triangle_{\mathbb R^\infty}$ is an analog of $-\triangle_{\mathbb R^n}$. The starting point for the discussion in this paper is to naturally introduce a translation invariant structure of Hilbert space into $CM(\mathbb R^\infty)$. $L^2(\mathbb R^\infty)$ is a closed linear subspace of $CM(\mathbb R^\infty)$. The inner product of $L^2(\mathbb R^\infty)$ is defined as that of $CM(\mathbb R^\infty)$. For a manifold, H\"{o}rmander defined an inner product that does not depend on a particular measure. In fact, the way we introduce the inner product into $CM(\mathbb R^\infty)$ is a generalization of his.</description>

      <title>Disproof of the Riemann Hypothesis</title>

Abstract: The Riemann Hypothesis is a conjecture that all non-trivial zeros of Riemann Zeta function are located on the critical line in the complex plane. Hundreds of propositions in function theory and analytic number theory rely on this hypothesis. However, the problem has been unresolved for over a century. Here we show that at least one set of quadruplet-zeros exists outside the critical line through expanding the infinite product of the Riemann Xi zero function. We found that assuming there are no zeros outside the critical line will result in a contradiction with the known result that the reciprocal sum of all zeros of the xi-function is a constant, thereby refuting the Riemann Hypothesis. Furthermore, we give a lower bound estimation of a kind of summation formula for the zero points outside the critical line.</description>

      <title>Generalizing upper bounds for the prime divisors of friendly number of 10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose necessary upper bounds for all prime divisors of friends of 10. This is precisely a generalization of a recent paper \cite{SS} of the authors where they proposed upper bounds for the second, third, and fourth smallest prime divisors of friends of 10.</description>
