      <title>Niel's Chess: A Quantum Game for Schools and the General Public</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a quantum variant of chess is introduced, which can be played on a traditional board, without using computers or other electronic devices. The rules of the game arise naturally by combining the rules of conventional chess with key quantum-physical effects such as superposition and entanglement. Niel's Chess is recommended for ages 10 and above, to everyone who wishes to play a creative game with historical roots and at the same time gain intuition about the foundational quantum effects that power cutting-edge technologies like quantum computing and quantum communication, which are poised to revolutionize our society in the coming decades. Takeaways from a pilot educational session that was carried out with 10-to-12-year-old children are also presented.</description>

      <title>Science Fiction Media Representations of Exoplanets: Portrayals of Changing Astronomical Discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in science fiction's (SF's) potential science communication use is hindered by concerns about SF misrepresenting science. This study addresses these concerns by asking how SF media reflects scientific findings in exoplanet science. A database of SF exoplanets was analysed using a Bayesian network to find interconnected interactions between planetary characterisation features and literary data. Results reveal SF exoplanets designed after the discovery of real exoplanets are less Earth-like, providing statistical evidence that SF incorporates rapidly-evolving science. Understanding SF's portrayal of science is crucial for its potential use in science communication.</description>

      <title>Technical, organizational and oral history regarding the soil samples measurements for Cs-137 because of the Chernobyl accident fallout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data are given, commentary is supplied and explanations are provided with regard to the technical, the organizational and, of course, the human history connected to the time of research, which resulted to the paper entitled "Soil sampling and Cs-137 analysis of the Chernobyl fallout in Greece", written by late Professor S.E. Simopoulos. This paper has been provided in Greek translation within an issued honorary volume (ISBN 978-960-254-714-4). Reasonably, the narration starts with the review of the political, the financial and the social situation of Greece around 1986. Subsequently, an analysis is given on the then available means, the persons involved, the methods used, the lessons learned and any other connection with the oral history of the NTUA's Nuclear Engineering Laboratory and other relevant Greek Laboratories. For this history, written proof is now scarce and the persons available to pass it on are growing less and less. N.P. Petropoulos, now Laboratory member and then student of Professor S.E. Simopoulos was in charge of preparation of this text.</description>
