      <title>Scaling IP Lookup to Large Databases using the CRAM Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-area scaling trends require new approaches to Internet Protocol (IP) lookup, enabled by modern networking chips such as Intel Tofino, AMD Pensando, and Nvidia BlueField, which provide substantial ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) and static random-access memory (SRAM). However, designing and evaluating scalable algorithms for these chips is challenging due to hardware-level constraints. To address this, we introduce the CRAM (CAM+RAM) lens, a framework that combines a formal model for evaluating algorithms on modern network processors with a set of optimization idioms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRAM by designing and evaluating three new IP lookup schemes: RESAIL, BSIC, and MashUp. RESAIL enables Tofino-2 to scale to 2.25 million IPv4 prefixes$\unicode{x2014}$likely sufficient for the next decade$\unicode{x2014}$while a pure TCAM approach supports only 250k prefixes, just 27% of the current global IPv4 routing table. Similarly, BSIC scales to 390k IPv6 prefixes on Tofino-2, supporting 3.2 times as many prefixes as a pure TCAM implementation. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art algorithms, SAIL for IPv4 and Hi-BST for IPv6, scale to considerably smaller sizes on Tofino-2.</description>

      <title>Generative Active Adaptation for Drifting and Imbalanced Network Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has shown promise in network intrusion detection systems, yet its performance often degrades due to concept drift and imbalanced data. These challenges are compounded by the labor-intensive process of labeling network traffic, especially when dealing with evolving and rare attack types, which makes selecting the right data for adaptation difficult. To address these issues, we propose a generative active adaptation framework that minimizes labeling effort while enhancing model robustness. Our approach employs density-aware active sampling to identify the most informative samples for annotation and leverages deep generative models to synthesize diverse samples, thereby augmenting the training set and mitigating the effects of concept drift. We evaluate our end-to-end framework on both simulated IDS data and a real-world ISP dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in intrusion detection performance. Our method boosts the overall F1-score from 0.60 (without adaptation) to 0.86. Rare attacks such as Infiltration, Web Attack, and FTP-BruteForce, which originally achieve F1 scores of 0.001, 0.04, and 0.00, improve to 0.30, 0.50, and 0.71, respectively, with generative active adaptation in the CIC-IDS 2018 dataset. Our framework effectively enhances rare attack detection while reducing labeling costs, making it a scalable and adaptive solution for real-world intrusion detection.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Information Freshness in Heterogeneous Random Access Networks with Correlated Status Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on the characterization and optimization of the Age of Information (AoI) in heterogeneous random access networks with correlated sensors, where each sensor has a unique transmission probability and correlation with other sensors. Specifically, we propose an analytical model to analyze the AoI dynamics and further derive the long-term average AoI for each sensor. Furthermore, under the assumption that only one sensor is time-sensitive, we derive the optimal transmission probability for the single sensor in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. The optimal transmission probability in homogeneous networks is equal to the inverse of the number of nodes and the optimal AoI, compared with the uncorrelated networks, is significantly improved. Additionally, the optimal transmission probability in the heterogeneous network is a threshold-type indicator function, where the specific threshold is determined by the correlation structure and the transmission probability of the rest time-insensitive sensors. Moreover, when all sensors are time-sensitive, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the Multi-Start Projected Adaptive Moment Estimation (MSP-Adam) method to optimize the network average AoI. The algorithm effectively and rapidly converges to the minimum network average AoI while providing the optimal transmission probability vector. The numerical results of the network AoI optimization under the MSP-Adam algorithm reveal that there exists a harmonious transmission strategy that can mitigate performance degradation caused by severe contention in high-density distributed access networks.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Random Access (GORA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Goal-Oriented Random Access (GORA), where transmitters jointly optimize what to send and when to access the shared channel to a common access point, considering the ultimate goal of the information transfer at its final destination. This goal is captured by an objective function, which is expressed as a general (not necessarily monotonic) function of the Age of Information. Our findings reveal that, under certain conditions, it may be desirable for transmitters to delay channel access intentionally and, when accessing the channel, transmit aged samples to reach a specific goal at the receiver.</description>

      <title>Delay Analysis of Random Network Coding Enabled ad-hoc M-to-N broadcast network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the delay performance of an ad-hoc dynamic network where random network coding and broadcast are used in combination to distribute the messages. The analysis is comprehensive for that we consider M-to-N broadcast instead of 1-to-N, which allows both different messages and same messages to be transmitted by several sources at the same time. Although the routes between source-destination pairs are subject to change when some nodes have large backlogs, we derive fixed equivalent routes to provide a upper bound of delay. For some special cases, an detour method is also provided to increase the estimation accuracy. Different network topologies are tested in numeric simulation. The results demonstrate the accuracy of our delay performance approximation.</description>

      <title>Potential gains of communication-compute-control co-design based performance optimization methods in cyber-physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and quantitatively evaluate three performance optimization methods that exploit the concept of communication-compute-control co-design by introducing awareness of communication and compute characteristics into the application logic in different ways to improve overall system performance. We have implemented a closed-loop control of a robotic arm over a wireless network where the controller is deployed into an edge cloud environment. When implementing an industrial system that leverages network and cloud technologies, the level of determinism of the control application can be decreased by nature. This means that some imperfections may be introduced into the control system, and the closed-loop control in substance changes to open-loop during disturbances. We aim to improve the performance of these open-loop control periods by applying methods that can compensate for the imperfections statistically or in a guaranteed way. We demonstrate that co-design-based application improvements with minimal dependencies on the underlying technologies can already yield an order of magnitude gain when it comes to the accurate execution of the robot trajectories during the openloop control periods. Furthermore, by combining the proposed methods, the performance improvements add up and can produce up to 45% shorter trajectory executions compared to individual evaluations.</description>

      <title>O-RAN xApps Conflict Management using Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) adopts a flexible, open, and virtualized structure with standardized interfaces, reducing dependency on a single supplier. Conflict management in O-RAN refers to the process of identifying and resolving conflicts between network applications. xApps are applications deployed at the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) that leverage advanced AI/ML algorithms to make dynamic decisions for network optimization. The lack of a unified mechanism to coordinate and prioritize the actions of different applications can create three types of conflicts (direct, indirect, and implicit). In our paper, we introduce a novel data-driven GCN-based method called Graph-based xApps Conflict and Root Cause Analysis Engine (GRACE) based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). It detects three types of conflicts (direct, indirect, and implicit) and pinpoints the root causes (xApps). GRACE captures the complex and hidden dependencies among the xApps, the controlled parameters, and the KPIs in O-RAN to detect possible conflicts. Then, it identifies the root causes (xApps) contributing to the detected conflicts. The proposed method was tested on highly imbalanced datasets where the number of conflict instances ranges from 40% to 10%. The model is tested in a setting that simulates real-world scenarios where conflicts are rare to assess its performance and generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate an exceptional performance, achieving a high F1-score greater than 98% for all the case studies.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Enabled Blockage-Aware Dynamic mmWave Multi-Hop V2X Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication offers unprecedented data rates and low latency, but faces significant reliability challenges due to signal blockages and limited range. This paper introduces a novel system for managing dynamic multi-hop mmWave V2X communications in complex blocking environments. We present a system architecture that integrates a mobility digital twin (DT) with the multi-hop routing control plane, providing a comprehensive, real-time view of the network and its surrounding traffic environment. This integration enables the control plane to make informed routing decisions based on rich contextual data about vehicles, infrastructure, and potential signal blockages. Leveraging this DT-enhanced architecture, we propose an advanced routing algorithm that combines high-precision environmental data with trajectory prediction to achieve blockage-aware mmWave multi-hop V2X routing. Our algorithm anticipates network topology changes and adapts topology dynamically to maintain reliable connections. We evaluate our approach through proof-of-concept simulations using a mobility DT of the Nishishinjuku area. Results demonstrate that our DT-enabled routing strategy significantly outperforms conventional methods in maintaining reliable mmWave V2X connections across various traffic scenarios, including fully connected and mixed traffic environments.</description>

      <title>Does More Bandwidth Really Not Matter (Much)?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevailing wisdom is that more network bandwidth does not matter much and that website performance is primarily limited by network latency. However, as mobile websites become more complex and mobile network performance improves, does this adage continue to hold? To understand the effects of small changes in network bandwidth and latency on website performance, we propose a novel webpage characterization metrics, Critical Path of Improvement (CPI). We compute CPI for 45 websites and analyze it against the network performance of four mobile ISPs in 57 US cities. Our results show that 18% of websites are primarily limited by bandwidth with others limited by bandwidth to some extent. These results show that contrary to accepted wisdom, insufficient bandwidth is a limiting factor in some website/network combinations. We also offer a discussion of approaches website developers and mobile network administrators can follow to understand and mitigate bandwidth limitations to website performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-access edge computing is a technique that combines the use of communication networks and remote computing resources. It allows to perform complex computational tasks for devices with low computing power while maintaining low latencies. However, it is important to effectively allocate the computing tasks to individual nodes. The work will present how the multi-access edge computing system can be integrated into the 5G network, as well as how resources can be distributed between individual nodes to minimize energy consumption. Some new degrees of freedom will be presented, which enable a significant reduction in energy consumption compared to existing solutions for independent optimization of the computation and communication parts.

      <title>Benchmarking Dynamic SLO Compliance in Distributed Computing Continuum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring Service Level Objectives (SLOs) in large-scale architectures, such as Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS), is challenging due to their heterogeneous nature and varying service requirements across different devices and applications. Additionally, unpredictable workloads and resource limitations lead to fluctuating performance and violated SLOs. To improve SLO compliance in DCCS, one possibility is to apply machine learning; however, the design choices are often left to the developer. To that extent, we provide a benchmark of Active Inference -- an emerging method from neuroscience -- against three established reinforcement learning algorithms (Deep Q-Network, Advantage Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization). We consider a realistic DCCS use case: an edge device running a video conferencing application alongside a WebSocket server streaming videos. Using one of the respective algorithms, we continuously monitor key performance metrics, such as latency and bandwidth usage, to dynamically adjust parameters -- including the number of streams, frame rate, and resolution -- to optimize service quality and user experience. To test algorithms' adaptability to constant system changes, we simulate dynamically changing SLOs and both instant and gradual data-shift scenarios, such as network bandwidth limitations and fluctuating device thermal states. Although the evaluated algorithms all showed advantages and limitations, our findings demonstrate that Active Inference is a promising approach for ensuring SLO compliance in DCCS, offering lower memory usage, stable CPU utilization, and fast convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Access Point Coordination (MAPC) and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) are expected to be key features in future Wi-Fi, such as the forthcoming IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi~8) and beyond. In this paper, we explore a coordinated solution based on online learning to drive the optimization of Spatial Reuse (SR), a method that allows multiple devices to perform simultaneous transmissions by controlling interference through Packet Detect (PD) adjustment and transmit power control. In particular, we focus on a Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandit (MA-MAB) setting, where multiple decision-making agents concurrently configure SR parameters from coexisting networks by leveraging the MAPC framework, and study various algorithms and reward-sharing mechanisms. We evaluate different MA-MAB implementations using Komondor, a well-adopted Wi-Fi simulator, and demonstrate that AI-native SR enabled by coordinated MABs can improve the network performance over current Wi-Fi operation: mean throughput increases by 15%, fairness is improved by increasing the minimum throughput across the network by 210%, while the maximum access delay is kept below 3 ms.</description>

Abstract: The traditional industrial communication networks may not meet the requirements of the main smart factory applications together, such as Remote control and safety applications (which considered as strict real time applications) and augmented reality (which consumes wide bandwidth). This work suggests an enhanced communication network to serve an optimum case for the smart factory includes heavy data applications and real-time applications in one hand using the concepts of time sensitive networks (TSN) to address the limitation of real-time applications and the edge computing to assimilate the heavy data applications. The current work submits an experimental scenario to exploit H.265 compression method based on edge computing concept to mitigate consuming the capacity on overall network performance for augmented reality application. The results of enhanced communication network indicated that the latency of real time applications was less than 1msec while the packet data delivery of rest applications was 99.999%.</description>

Abstract: The growing complexity of network traffic and demand for ultra-low latency communication require smarter packet traffic management. Existing Deep Learning-based queuing approaches struggle with dynamic network scenarios and demand high engineering effort. We propose AQM-LLM, distilling Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot learning, contextual understanding, and pattern recognition to improve Active Queue Management (AQM) [RFC 9330] with minimal manual effort. We consider a specific case where AQM is Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) and our design of AQM-LLM builds on speculative decoding and reinforcement-based distilling of LLM by tackling congestion prevention in the L4S architecture using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC 9331] and periodic packet dropping. We develop a new open-source experimental platform by executing L4S-AQM on FreeBSD-14, providing interoperable modules to support LLM integration and facilitate IETF recognition through wider testing. Our extensive evaluations show L4S-LLM enhances queue management, prevents congestion, reduces latency, and boosts network performance, showcasing LLMs' adaptability and efficiency in uplifting AQM systems.</description>

      <title>MobileViM: A Light-weight and Dimension-independent Vision Mamba for 3D Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13524</link>

Abstract: Efficient evaluation of three-dimensional (3D) medical images is crucial for diagnostic and therapeutic practices in healthcare. Recent years have seen a substantial uptake in applying deep learning and computer vision to analyse and interpret medical images. Traditional approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), face significant computational challenges, prompting the need for architectural advancements. Recent efforts have led to the introduction of novel architectures like the ``Mamba'' model as alternative solutions to traditional CNNs or ViTs. The Mamba model excels in the linear processing of one-dimensional data with low computational demands. However, Mamba's potential for 3D medical image analysis remains underexplored and could face significant computational challenges as the dimension increases. This manuscript presents MobileViM, a streamlined architecture for efficient segmentation of 3D medical images. In the MobileViM network, we invent a new dimension-independent mechanism and a dual-direction traversing approach to incorporate with a vision-Mamba-based framework. MobileViM also features a cross-scale bridging technique to improve efficiency and accuracy across various medical imaging modalities. With these enhancements, MobileViM achieves segmentation speeds exceeding 90 frames per second (FPS) on a single graphics processing unit (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 4090). This performance is over 24 FPS faster than the state-of-the-art deep learning models for processing 3D images with the same computational resources. In addition, experimental evaluations demonstrate that MobileViM delivers superior performance, with Dice similarity scores reaching 92.72%, 86.69%, 80.46%, and 77.43% for PENGWIN, BraTS2024, ATLAS, and Toothfairy2 datasets, respectively, which significantly surpasses existing models.</description>
