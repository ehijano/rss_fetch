      <description>arXiv:2404.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Airy point process is a determinantal point process that arises from the spectral edge of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. In this paper, we establish a large deviation principle for the Airy point process. Our result also extends to point processes arising from the spectrum of the stochastic Airy operator.</description>

      <title>Behaviors near explosion of nonlinear CSBPs with regularly varying mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the explosion phenomenon of nonlinear continuous-state branching processes (nonlinear CSBPs). First an explicit integral test for explosion is designed when the rate function does not increase too fast. We then exhibit three different regimes of explosion when the branching mechanism and the rate function are regularly varying respectively at $0$ and $\infty$ with indices $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $0\leq\alpha\leq \beta$ and $\beta&gt;0$. If $\alpha&gt;0$ then the renormalisation of the process before its explosion is linear. When moreover $\alpha\neq \beta$, the limiting distribution is that of a ratio of two independent random variables whose laws are identified. When $\alpha=\beta$, the limiting random variable shrinks to a constant. Last, when $\alpha=0$, i.e. the branching mechanism is slowly varying at $0$, the process is studied with the help of a nonlinear renormalisation. The limiting distribution becomes the inverse uniform distribution. This complements results known in the case of finite mean and provides new insight for the classical explosive continuous-state branching processes (for which $\beta=1$).</description>

      <title>Maximum Degree in Random Hyperbolic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random hyperbolic graph, introduced in 2010 by Krioukov, Papadopoulos, Kitsak, Vahdat and Bogu\~{n}\'a, is a graph model suitable for modelling a large class of real-world networks, known as complex networks. Gugelmann, Panagiotou and Peter proved that for curvature parameter $\alpha &gt; 1/2$, the degree sequence of the random hyperbolic graph follows a power-law distribution with controllable exponent up to the maximum degree. To achieve this, they showed, among other results, that with high probability, the maximum degree is $n^{\frac{1}{2\alpha} + o(1)}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes. In this paper, we refine this estimate of the maximum degree, and we extend it to the case $\alpha \leq 1/2$: we first show that, with high probability, the node with the maximum degree is eventually the one that is the closest to the origin of the underlying hyperbolic space. From this, we get the convergence in distribution of the renormalised maximum degree. Except for the critical case $\alpha = 1/2$, the limit distribution belongs to the extreme value distribution family (Weibull distribution in the case $\alpha &lt; 1/2$ and Fr\'echet distribution in the case $\alpha &gt; 1/2$).</description>

      <title>Sharp Propagation of Chaos for the Ensemble Langevin Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to revisit propagation of chaos for a Langevin-type interacting particle system used for sampling probability measures. The interacting particle system we consider coincides, in the setting of a log-quadratic target distribution, with the ensemble Kalman sampler, for which propagation of chaos was first proved by Ding and Li. Like these authors, we prove propagation of chaos using a synchronous coupling as a starting point, as in Sznitman's classical argument. Instead of relying on a boostrapping argument, however, we use a technique based on stopping times in order to handle the presence of the empirical covariance in the coefficients of the dynamics. This approach originates from numerical analysis and was recently employed to prove mean field limits for consensus-based optimization and related interacting particle systems. In the context of ensemble Langevin sampling, it enables proving pathwise propagation of chaos with optimal rate, whereas previous results were optimal only up to a positive epsilon.</description>

      <title>Phase space contraction of degenerately damped random splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When studying out-of-equilibrium systems, one often excites the dynamics in some degrees of freedom while removing the excitation in others through damping. In order for the system to converge to a statistical steady state, the dynamics must transfer the energy from the excited modes to the dissipative directions. The precise mechanisms underlying this transfer are of particular interest and are the topic of this paper. We explore a class of randomly switched models introduced in [2,3] and provide some of the first results showing that minimal damping is sufficient to stabilize the system in a fluids model.</description>

      <title>Server saturation in skewed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model inspired by compatibility constraints that arise between tasks and servers in data centers, cloud computing systems and content delivery networks. The constraints are represented by a bipartite graph or network that interconnects dispatchers with compatible servers. Each dispatcher receives tasks over time and sends every task to a compatible server with the least number of tasks, or to a server with the least number of tasks among $d$ compatible servers selected uniformly at random. We focus on networks where the neighborhood of at least one server is skewed in a limiting regime. This means that a diverging number of dispatchers are in the neighborhood which are each compatible with a uniformly bounded number of servers; thus, the degree of the central server approaches infinity while the degrees of many neighboring dispatchers remain bounded. We prove that each server with a skewed neighborhood saturates, in the sense that the mean number of tasks queueing in front of it in steady state approaches infinity. Paradoxically, this pathological behavior can even arise in random networks where nearly all the servers have at most one task in the limit.</description>

      <title>Limit theorem for subdiffusive random walk in Dirichlet random environment in dimension $d \ge 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random walk in Dirichlet random environment in ${\mathbf{Z}^d, d\ge 3}$, which corresponds to the case where the environment is constructed from i.i.d. transition probabilities at each vertex with a Dirichlet distribution with parameters $(\alpha_i)_{1 \le i \le 2d}$. Dirichlet environments are weakly elliptic and the walk can be slowdowned by local traps whose strength are governed by a parameter $\kappa$. In this paper we prove a stable limit theorem when the walk is ballistic but subdiffusive, i.e. when ${\kappa \in (1,2)}$. This completes the result of Poudevigne (arXiv:1909.03866) who proved a sub-ballistic stable limit theorem when $\kappa\in (0,1)$. Contrary to Poudevigne, we have to assume Sznitman's condition $\mathbf{(T)}$ to prove the limit theorem since we work at the level of fluctuations and need a better control on renewal times.</description>

      <title>Just Wing It: Optimal Estimation of Missing Mass in a Markovian Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the stationary mass -- also called the unigram mass -- that is missing from a single trajectory of a discrete-time, ergodic Markov chain. This problem has several applications -- for example, estimating the stationary missing mass is critical for accurately smoothing probability estimates in sequence models. While the classical Good--Turing estimator from the 1950s has appealing properties for i.i.d. data, it is known to be biased in the Markov setting, and other heuristic estimators do not come equipped with guarantees. Operating in the general setting in which the size of the state space may be much larger than the length $n$ of the trajectory, we develop a linear-runtime estimator called \emph{Windowed Good--Turing} (\textsc{WingIt}) and show that its risk decays as $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathsf{T_{mix}}/n)$, where $\mathsf{T_{mix}}$ denotes the mixing time of the chain in total variation distance. Notably, this rate is independent of the size of the state space and minimax-optimal up to a logarithmic factor in $n / \mathsf{T_{mix}}$. We also present a bound on the variance of the missing mass random variable, which may be of independent interest. We extend our estimator to approximate the stationary mass placed on elements occurring with small frequency in $X^n$. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our estimators both in simulations on canonical chains and on sequences constructed from a popular natural language corpus.</description>

      <title>About the Moments of the Generalized Ulam Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $\pi \in S_n$, let $Z_{n,k}(\pi)=\sum_{1\leq i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_k\leq n} \mathbf{1}(\{ \pi_{i_1}&lt;\dots&lt;\pi_{i_k}\}$ denote the number of increasing subsequences of length $k$. Consider the problem of studing the distribution of $Z_{n,k}$ for general $k$ and $n$. For the 2nd moment, Ross Pinsky made a combinatorial study by considering a pair of subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, and conditioning on the size of the intersection $j = |\{i_1^{(1)},\dots,i^{(1)}_k\} \cap \{i^{(2)}_1,\dots,i^{(2)}_k\}|$. We obtain the large deviation rate function for $\mathbf{E}[Z_{n,k} Z_{n,\ell}]$ in the asymptotic regime $k\sim \kappa n^{1/2}$, $\ell \sim \lambda n^{1/2}$ as $n \to \infty$, for $\kappa,\lambda \in (0,\infty)$. This uses multivariate generating function techniques, as found in the textbook of Pemantle and Wilson. For higher moments, if one thinks of the ``overlap'' between two subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, as the size of their intersection $j$, then an ultrametric ansatz leads to rigorous lower bounds for the higher moments. For the 3rd moment, the replica symmetric ansatz leads to a complete elliptic integral for the generating function, following a method similar to the diagonal method of Furstenberg, Hautus and Klarner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a probabilistic representation of the solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by random generation of Butcher trees. This approach complements and simplifies a recent probabilistic representation of ODE solutions, by removing the need to generate random branching times. The random sampling of trees allows one to improve numerical accuracy by Monte Carlo iterations whereas the finite order truncation of Butcher series can have higher time complexity, as shown in examples.</description>

      <title>Prelimit Coupling and Steady-State Convergence of Constant-stepsize Nonsmooth Contractive SA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Q-learning, we study nonsmooth contractive stochastic approximation (SA) with constant stepsize. We focus on two important classes of dynamics: 1) nonsmooth contractive SA with additive noise, and 2) synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning, which features both additive and multiplicative noise. For both dynamics, we establish weak convergence of the iterates to a stationary limit distribution in Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, we propose a prelimit coupling technique for establishing steady-state convergence and characterize the limit of the stationary distribution as the stepsize goes to zero. Using this result, we derive that the asymptotic bias of nonsmooth SA is proportional to the square root of the stepsize, which stands in sharp contrast to smooth SA. This bias characterization allows for the use of Richardson-Romberg extrapolation for bias reduction in nonsmooth SA.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish Hoeffding and Bernstein type concentration inequalities for weighted sums of exchangeable random variables. A special case is the i.i.d. setting, where random variables are sampled independently from some distribution (and are therefore exchangeable). In contrast to the existing literature on this problem, our results provide a natural unified view of both the i.i.d. and the exchangeable setting.</description>

Abstract: Given global Lipschitz continuity and differentiability of high enough order on the coefficients in It\^{o}'s equation, differentiability of associated semigroups, existence of twice differentiable solutions to Kolmogorov equations and weak convergence rates of numerical approximations are known results. In this work and against the counterexamples of Hairer et al.(2015), the drift and diffusion coefficients having Lipschitz constants that are $o(\log V)$ and $o(\sqrt{\log V})$ respectively for a function $V$ satisfying $(\partial_t + L)V\leq CV$ is shown to be a generalizing condition in place of global Lipschitz continuity for the above.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the characterizations of fixed points of the generating function of branching processes with countably infinitely many types. We assume each particle of type $i$ can only give offspring of type $j\geq i$, whose number only depends on $j-i$. We prove that, for these processes, there are at least countably infinitely many fixed points of the offspring generating function, while the extinction probability set of the process has only $2$ elements. This phenomenon contrasts sharply with those of finite-type branching processes. Our result takes one step forward on the related conjecture on the fixed points of infinite-dimensional generating functions in literature. In addition, the asymptotic behavior of the components of fixed point is given.</description>

      <title>Representing General Stochastic Processes as Martingale Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random variables $X^i$, $i=1,2$ are 'probabilistically equivalent' if they have the same law. Moreover, in any class of equivalent random variables it is easy to select canonical representatives.
  The corresponding questions are more involved for processes $X^i$ on filtered stochastic bases $(\Omega^i, \mathcal F^i, \mathbb P^i, (\mathcal F^i_t)_{t\in [0,1]})$. Here equivalence in law does not capture relevant properties of processes such as the solutions to stochastic control or multistage decision problems. This motivates Aldous to introduce the stronger notion of synonymity based on prediction processes. Stronger still, Hoover--Keisler formalize what it means that $X^i$, $i=1,2$ have the same probabilistic properties. We establish that canonical representatives of the Hoover--Keisler equivalence classes are given precisely by the set of all Markov-martingale laws on a specific nested path space $\mathsf M_\infty$. As a consequence we obtain that, modulo Hoover--Keisler equivalence, the class of stochastic processes forms a Polish space.
  On this space, processes are topologically close iff they model similar probabilistic phenomena. In particular this means that their laws as well as the information encoded in the respective filtrations are similar. Importantly, compact sets of processes admit a Prohorov-type characterization. We also obtain that for every stochastic process, defined on some abstract basis, there exists a process with identical probabilistic properties which is defined on a standard Borel space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Marcu-Fredenhagen ratio is a quantity used in the physics literature to differentiate between phases in lattice Higgs models. It is defined as the limit of a ratio of expectations of Wilson line observables as the length of these lines go to infinity while the parameters of the model are kept fixed. In this paper, we show that the Marcu-Fredenhagen ratio exists in all predicted phases of the model, and show that it indeed undergoes a phase transition. In the Higgs phase of the model we do a more careful analysis of the ratio to deduce its first order behaviour and also give an upper bound on its rate of convergence. Finally, we also present a short and concise proof of the exponential decay of correlations in the Higgs phase.</description>

Abstract: We give an asymptotic development of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), or any other estimator defined implicitly, in a way which involves the limiting behavior of the score and its higher-order derivatives. This development, which is explicitly computable, gives some insights about the non-asymptotic behavior of the renormalized MLE and its departure from its limit. We highlight that the results hold whenever the score and its derivative converge, including to non Gaussian limits. Our approach is based on an asymptotic implicit function theorem, inspired from perturbative approaches.</description>

      <title>Strong 1-boundedness, $L^2$-Betti numbers, algebraic soficity, and graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that graph products of non trivial finite dimensional von Neumann algebras are strongly 1-bounded when the underlying *-algebra has vanishing first L2-Betti number. The proof uses a combination of the following two key ideas to obtain lower bounds on the Fuglede-Kadison determinant of matrix polynomials in a generating set: a notion called ''algebraic soficity'' for *-algebras allowing for the existence of Galois bounded microstates with asymptotically constant diagonals; a probabilistic construction of the authors of permutation models for graph independence over the diagonal.</description>

      <title>On the Metric Temporal Logic for Continuous Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00984v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove measurability of event for which a general continuous-time stochastic process satisfies continuous-time Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formula. Continuous-time MTL can define temporal constrains for physical system in natural way. Then there are several researches that deal with probability of continuous MTL semantics for stochastic processes. However, proving measurability for such events is by no means an obvious task, even though it is essential. The difficulty comes from the semantics of "until operator", which is defined by logical sum of uncountably many propositions. Given the difficulty involved in proving the measurability of such an event using classical measure-theoretic methods, we employ a theorem from stochastic analysis. This theorem is utilized to prove the measurability of hitting times for stochastic processes, and it stands as a profound result within the theory of capacity. Next, we provide an example that illustrates the failure of probability approximation when discretizing the continuous semantics of MTL formulas with respect to time. Additionally, we prove that the probability of the discretized semantics converges to that of the continuous semantics when we impose restrictions on diamond operators to prevent nesting.</description>

      <title>Higher order expansion for the probabilistic local well-posedness theory for a cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the probabilistic local well-posedness of the cubic Schr\"odinger equation (cubic NLS): \[ (i\partial_{t} + \Delta) u = \pm |u|^{2} u \text{ on } [0,T) \times \mathbb{R}^{d}, \] with initial data being a Wiener randomization at unit scale of a given function $f$. We prove that a solution exists almost-surely locally in time provided \(f\in H^{S}_{x}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\) with \(S&gt;\max\big(\frac{d-3}{4},\frac{d-4}{2}\big)\) for \(d\geq 3\). In particular, we establish that the local well-posedness holds for any \(S&gt;0\) when \(d=3\). We also show that, under appropriate smallness conditions for the initial data, the solutions are global in time and scatter.
  The solutions are constructed as a sum of an explicit multilinear expansion of the flow in terms of the random initial data and of an additional smoother remainder term with deterministically subcritical regularity. This construction allows us to introduce a new and refined notion of graded scattering.
  We develop the framework of directional space-time norms to control the (probabilistic) multilinear expansion and the (deterministic) remainder term and to obtain improved bilinear probabilistic-deterministic Strichartz estimates.</description>

      <title>Online Locality Meets Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs) from the classical LOCAL model to a number of other models that have been studied recently, including the quantum-LOCAL model, finitely-dependent processes, non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL model, and online-LOCAL model [e.g. STOC 2024, ICALP 2023].
  First, we demonstrate the advantage that finitely-dependent processes have over the classical LOCAL model. We show that all LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution (with constant locality). In particular, this gives a finitely-dependent coloring for regular trees, answering an open question by Holroyd [2023]. This also introduces a new formal barrier for understanding the distributed quantum advantage: it is not possible to exclude quantum advantage for any LCL in the $\Theta(\log^\star n)$ complexity class by using non-signaling arguments.
  Second, we put limits on the capabilities of all of these models. To this end, we introduce a model called randomized online-LOCAL, which is strong enough to simulate e.g. SLOCAL and dynamic-LOCAL, and we show that it is also strong enough to simulate any non-signaling distribution and hence any quantum-LOCAL algorithm. We prove the following result for rooted trees: if we can solve an LCL problem with locality $o(\log \log n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL model, we can solve it with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model.
  Put together, these results show that in rooted trees the set of LCLs that can be solved with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ is the same across all these models: classical deterministic and randomized LOCAL, quantum-LOCAL, non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL, and deterministic and randomized online-LOCAL.</description>
