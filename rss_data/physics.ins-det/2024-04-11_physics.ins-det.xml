      <title>Compton Edge Convolutional Model and Algorithm for Energy-channel Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scintillation detectors are essential tools for radiation measurement, but calibrating them accurately can be challenging, especially when full-energy peaks are not prominent. This is common in detectors like plastic scintillators. Current methods for calibrating these detectors often require manual adjustments. To address this, we propose a new method called the convolution model. This model accurately calibrates the energy-channel relationship of the Compton edge in various detectors. We tested it with plastic scintillator BC408, NaI crystal, and LaBr$_3$ crystal. Using ${}^{137}$Cs radioactive sources, we calibrated NaI and LaBr$_3$ detectors using full-energy peaks, then applied the convolution model to fit the Compton edge. Our results show errors within 1\% when compared to full-energy peak calibration.</description>

      <title>Temperature stabilization of a lab space at $10\,\mathrm{mK}$-level over a day</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature fluctuations over long time scales ($\gtrsim 1\,\mathrm{h}$) are an insidious problem for precision measurements. In optical laboratories, the primary effect of temperature fluctuations is drifts in optical circuits over spatial scales of a few meters and temporal scales extending beyond a few minutes. We present a lab-scale environment temperature control system approaching $10\, \mathrm{mK}$-level temperature instability across a lab for integration times above an hour and extending to a few days. This is achieved by passive isolation of the laboratory space from the building walls using a circulating air gap and an active control system feeding back to heating coils at the outlet of the laboratory HVAC unit. The latter achieves 20 dB suppression of temperature fluctuations across the lab, approaching the limit set by statistical coherence of the temperature field.</description>

      <title>TEMPUS, a Timepix4-based system for event-based X-rays detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A readout system based on the Timepix4 ASIC, is being developed for photon science. The TEMPUS detector can be operated in two distinct modes: a photon counting mode, which allows for conventional full-frame readout at rates up to 40 kfps; and an event-driven time-stamping mode, which allows excellent time resolution in the nanosecond regime in measurements with moderate X-ray flux. In this paper, we introduce the initial prototype, a single-chip system, and present the first results obtained at PETRA III and ESRF.</description>

      <title>A Beehive Haloscope for High-mass Axion Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new haloscope geometry that can arbitrarily increase the resonator volume for a given target axion mass. This geometry consists of closely packed, overlapping coaxial cavities operating as a single resonator. While the resonant frequency is still determined by the dimensions of the individual "cells," the strong interactions between the cells encourage the entire "beehive" to oscillate in phase, a phenomenon expected of tightly coupled harmonic oscillators. This synchronization behavior allows the construction of a singly connected large-volume resonator at high frequency by simply increasing the number of the cells. Using direct numerical simulations, we verify the existence of a global eigenmode that has a high (40%) form factor in a 169-element beehive resonator. The resonant frequency of the eigenmode is tunable by moving the center rods laterally in unison. The form factor is very tolerant to dimensional deviations and misalignment, as a result of mode hybridization due to strong coupling. The beehive haloscope inherits many appealing properties from the conventional coaxial cavity: a high quality factor, compatibility with a solenoid magnet, ease of fabrication, tuning, and coupling. We argue that this geometry is an excellent candidate for high-mass axion searches covering the post-inflationary parameter space (&gt;5 GHz).</description>

      <title>Modeling of antenna-coupled Si MOSFETs in the Terahertz Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the modeling and experimental characterization of Si CMOS detectors of terahertz radiation based on antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs). The detectors are manufactured using TSMC's 65-nm technology. We apply two models -- the TSMC RF foundry model and our own ADS-HDM -- to simulate the Si CMOS TeraFET performance and compare their predictions with respective experimental data. Both models are implemented in the commercial circuit simulation software Keysight Advanced Design System (ADS). We find that the compact model TSMC RF is capable to predict the detector responsivity and its dependence on frequency and gate voltage with good accuracy up to the highest frequency of 1.2 THz covered in this study. This frequency is well beyond the tool's intended operation range for 5G communications and 110-GHz millimeter wave applications. We demonstrate that our self-developed physics-based ADS-HDM tool, which relies on an extended one-dimensional hydrodynamic transport model and can be adapted readily to other material technologies, has high predictive qualities comparable to those of the foundry model. We use the ADS-HDM to discuss the contribution of diffusive and plasmonic effects to the THz response of Si CMOS TeraFETs, finding that these effects, while becoming more significant with rising frequency, are never dominant. Finally, we estimate that the electrical NEP (perfect power coupling conditions) is on the order of 5 pW/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ at room-temperature.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Micro-Bunching based on Transverse-Longitudinal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, three specific scenarios of a novel accelerator light source mechanism called steady-state micro-bunching (SSMB) have been studied, i.e., longitudinal weak focusing, longitudinal strong focusing and generalized longitudinal strong focusing (GLSF). Presently, GLSF is the most promising among them in realizing high-power short-wavelength coherent radiation with a mild requirement on the modulation laser power. Its essence is to exploit the ultrasmall natural vertical emittance in a planar electron storage ring for efficient microbunching formation, like a partial transverse-longitudinal emittance exchange at the optical laser wavelength range. By invoking such a scheme, the laser modulator of an SSMB storage ring can work in a continuous wave or high duty cycle mode, thus allowing a high filling factor of microbunched electron beam in the storage ring and high average output radiation power. The backbone of it is the precision transverse-longitudinal phase space coupling dynamics, which is analyzed in depth in this paper. Based on the investigation, an example parameters set of a GLSF SSMB storage ring which can deliver 1 kW-average-power EUV light is presented. The presented work here, like the analysis on theoretical minimum emittances, transverse-longitudinal coupling dynamics, derivation of bunching factor and modulation strengths, is expected to be useful not only for the development of SSMB, but also future accelerator light sources in general which demand more and more precise electron beam phase space manipulations.</description>

      <title>Event-by-Event Direction Reconstruction of Solar Neutrinos in a High Light-Yield Liquid Scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The direction of individual $^8$B solar neutrinos has been reconstructed using the SNO+ liquid scintillator detector. Prompt, directional Cherenkov light was separated from the slower, isotropic scintillation light using time information, and a maximum likelihood method was used to reconstruct the direction of individual scattered electrons. A clear directional signal was observed, correlated with the solar angle. The observation was aided by a period of low primary fluor concentration that resulted in a slower scintillator decay time. This is the first time that event-by-event direction reconstruction in high light-yield liquid scintillator has been demonstrated in a large-scale detector.</description>
