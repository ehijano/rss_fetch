      <title>A Constraint Programming Approach to Fair High School Course Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Issues of inequity in U.S. high schools' course scheduling did not previously exist. However, in recent years, with the increase in student population and course variety, students perceive that the course scheduling method is unfair. Current integer programming (IP) methods to the high school scheduling problem (HSSP) fall short in addressing these fairness concerns. The purpose of this research is to develop a solution methodology that generates feasible and fair course schedules using student preferences. Utilizing principles of fairness, which have been well studied in market design, we define the fair high school scheduling problem (FHSSP), a novel extension to the HSSP, and devise a corresponding algorithm based on integer programming to solve the FHSSP. We test our approach on a real course request dataset from a high school in California, USA. Results show that our algorithm can generate schedules that are both feasible and fair. In this paper, we demonstrate that our IP algorithm not only solves the HSSP and FHSSP in the United States but has the potential to be applied to various real-world scheduling problems. Additionally, we show the feasibility of integrating human emotions into mathematical modeling.</description>

      <title>Weighted Envy-Freeness in House Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic house allocation problem involves assigning $m$ houses to $n$ agents based on their utility functions, ensuring each agent receives exactly one house. A key criterion in these problems is satisfying fairness constraints such as envy-freeness. We extend this problem by considering agents with arbitrary weights, focusing on the concept of weighted envy-freeness, which has been extensively studied in fair division. We present a polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether weighted envy-free allocations exist and, if so, to compute one. Since weighted envy-free allocations do not always exist, we also investigate the potential of achieving such allocations through the use of subsidies. We provide several characterizations for weighted envy-freeable allocations (allocations that can be turned weighted envy-free by introducing subsidies) and show that they do not always exist, which is different from the unweighted setting. Furthermore, we explore the existence of weighted envy-freeable allocations in specific scenarios and outline the conditions under which they exist.</description>

      <title>Rank-Guaranteed Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a combinatorial ascending auction that is "approximately" optimal, requiring minimal rationality to achieve this level of optimality, and is robust to strategic and distributional uncertainties. Specifically, the auction is rank-guaranteed, meaning that for any menu M and any valuation profile, the ex-post revenue is guaranteed to be at least as high as the highest revenue achievable from feasible allocations, taking the (|M|+ 1)th-highest valuation for each bundle as the price. Our analysis highlights a crucial aspect of combinatorial auction design, namely, the design of menus. We provide simple and approximately optimal menus in various settings.</description>

      <title>Empirical Equilibria in Agent-based Economic systems with Learning agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an agent-based simulator for economic systems with heterogeneous households, firms, central bank, and government agents. These agents interact to define production, consumption, and monetary flow. Each agent type has distinct objectives, such as households seeking utility from consumption and the central bank targeting inflation and production. We define this multi-agent economic system using an OpenAI Gym-style environment, enabling agents to optimize their objectives through reinforcement learning. Standard multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) schemes, like independent learning, enable agents to learn concurrently but do not address whether the resulting strategies are at equilibrium. This study integrates the Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO) algorithm, which has shown superior performance over independent MARL in games with homogeneous agents, with economic agent-based modeling. We use PSRO to develop agent policies approximating Nash equilibria of the empirical economic game, thereby linking to economic equilibria. Our results demonstrate that PSRO strategies achieve lower regret values than independent MARL strategies in our economic system with four agent types. This work aims to bridge artificial intelligence, economics, and empirical game theory towards future research.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Auctions without a Numeraire: The Case of Blockchain Trade-Intent Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain trade intent auctions currently intermediate approximately USD 5 billion monthly. Due to production complementarities, the auction is combinatorial: when multiple trade intents from different traders are auctioned off simultaneously, a bidder (here called solver) can generate additional efficiencies by winning a batch of multiple trade intents. However, unlike other combinatorial auctions studied in the literature, the auction has no numeraire. Fairness is a concern as the efficiencies from batching cannot be easily shared between traders. We formalize this problem and study the most commonly used auction formats: batch auctions and multiple simultaneous auctions. We also propose a novel fair combinatorial auction that combines batch auction and multiple simultaneous auctions: solvers submit individual-trade bids and batched bids, but batched bids are considered only if they are better for all traders relative to the outcome of multiple simultaneous auctions (constructed using the individual-trade bids). We find a trade-off between the fairness guarantees provided by the auction (i.e., the minimum each trader can expect to receive) and the expected value of the assets returned to the traders. Also, the amount that each trader receives in the equilibrium of the fair combinatorial auction may be higher or lower than what they receive in the equilibrium of the simultaneous auctions used as a benchmark for fairness.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Online Correlated Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Stochastic Online Correlated Selection (SOCS), a family of online rounding algorithms for Non-IID Stochastic Online Submodular Welfare Maximization and special cases such as Online Stochastic Matching, Stochastic AdWords, and Stochastic Display Ads. At each step, the algorithm sees an online item's type and fractional allocation, then immediately allocates it to an agent. We propose a metric called the convergence rate for the quality of SOCS. This is cleaner than most metrics in the OCS literature.
  We propose a Type Decomposition that reduces SOCS to the two-way special case. First, we sample a surrogate type with half-integer allocation. The rounding is trivial for a one-way type fully allocated to an agent. For a two-way type split equally between two agents, we round it using two-way SOCS. We design the distribution of surrogate types to get two-way types as often as possible while respecting the original fractional allocation in expectation.
  Following this framework, we make progress on numerous problems:
  1) Online Stochastic Matching: We improve the state-of-the-art $0.666$ competitive ratio for unweighted/vertex-weighted matching to $0.69$.
  2) Query-Commit Matching: We enhance the ratio to $0.705$ in the Query-Commit model, improving the best previous $0.696$ and $0.662$ for unweighted and vertex-weighted matching.
  3) Stochastic AdWords: We give a $0.6338$ competitive algorithm, breaking the $1-\frac{1}{e}$ barrier and answering a decade-old open question.
  4) AdWords: The framework applies to the adversarial model if the rounding is oblivious to future items' distributions. We get the first multi-way OCS for AdWords, addressing an open question about OCS. This gives a $0.504$ competitive ratio for AdWords, improving the previous $0.501$.
  5) Stochastic Display Ads: We design a $0.644$ competitive algorithm, breaking the $1-\frac{1}{e}$ barrier.</description>

      <title>Fair Division with Two-Sided Preferences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a fair division setting in which participants are to be fairly distributed among teams, where not only do the teams have preferences over the participants as in the canonical fair division setting, but the participants also have preferences over the teams. We focus on guaranteeing envy-freeness up to one participant (EF1) for the teams together with a stability condition for both sides. We show that an allocation satisfying EF1, swap stability, and individual stability always exists and can be computed in polynomial time, even when teams may have positive or negative values for participants. When teams have nonnegative values for participants, we prove that an EF1 and Pareto optimal allocation exists and, if the valuations are binary, can be found in polynomial time. We also show that an EF1 and justified envy-free allocation does not necessarily exist, and deciding whether such an allocation exists is computationally difficult.</description>

      <title>A Reduction from Multi-Parameter to Single-Parameter Bayesian Contract Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is an almost approximation-preserving polynomial-time reduction from the most general multi-parameter Bayesian contract design (BCD) to single-parameter BCD. That is, for any multi-parameter BCD instance $I^M$, we construct a single-parameter instance $I^S$ such that any $\beta$-approximate contract (resp. menu of contracts) of $I^S$ can in turn be converted to a $(\beta -\epsilon)$-approximate contract (resp. menu of contracts) of $I^M$. The reduction is in time polynomial in the input size and $\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$; moreover, when $\beta = 1$ (i.e., the given single-parameter solution is exactly optimal), the dependence on $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ can be removed, leading to a polynomial-time exact reduction. This efficient reduction is somewhat surprising because in the closely related problem of Bayesian mechanism design, a polynomial-time reduction from multi-parameter to single-parameter setting is believed to not exist. Our result demonstrates the intrinsic difficulty of addressing moral hazard in Bayesian contract design, regardless of being single-parameter or multi-parameter.
  As byproducts, our reduction answers two open questions in recent literature of algorithmic contract design: (a) it implies that optimal contract design in single-parameter BCD is not in APX unless P=NP even when the agent's type distribution is regular, answering the open question of [Alon et al. 2021] in the negative; (b) it implies that the principal's (order-wise) tight utility gap between using a menu of contracts and a single contract is $\Theta(n)$ where $n$ is the number of actions, answering the major open question of [Guruganesh et al. 2021] for the single-parameter case.</description>

      <title>Two competing populations with a common environmental resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback-evolving games is a framework that models the co-evolution between payoff functions and an environmental state. It serves as a useful tool to analyze many social dilemmas such as natural resource consumption, behaviors in epidemics, and the evolution of biological populations. However, it has primarily focused on the dynamics of a single population of agents. In this paper, we consider the impact of two populations of agents that share a common environmental resource. We focus on a scenario where individuals in one population are governed by an environmentally ``responsible" incentive policy, and individuals in the other population are environmentally ``irresponsible". An analysis on the asymptotic stability of the coupled system is provided, and conditions for which the resource collapses are identified. We then derive consumption rates for the irresponsible population that optimally exploit the environmental resource, and analyze how incentives should be allocated to the responsible population that most effectively promote the environment via a sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Social Learning with Bounded Rationality: Negative Reviews Persist under Newest First</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a model of social learning from reviews where customers are computationally limited and make purchases based on reading only the first few reviews displayed by the platform. Under this bounded rationality, we establish that the review ordering policy can have a significant impact. In particular, the popular Newest First ordering induces a negative review to persist as the most recent review longer than a positive review. This phenomenon, which we term the Cost of Newest First, can make the long-term revenue unboundedly lower than a counterpart where reviews are exogenously drawn for each customer.
  We show that the impact of the Cost of Newest First can be mitigated under dynamic pricing, which allows the price to depend on the set of displayed reviews. Under the optimal dynamic pricing policy, the revenue loss is at most a factor of 2. On the way, we identify a structural property for this optimal dynamic pricing: the prices should ensure that the probability of a purchase is always the same, regardless of the state of reviews. We also study an extension of the model where customers put more weight on more recent reviews (and discount older reviews based on their time of posting), and we show that Newest First is still not the optimal ordering policy if customers discount slowly.
  Lastly, we corroborate our theoretical findings using a real-world review dataset. We find that the average rating of the first page of reviews is statistically significantly smaller than the overall average rating, which is in line with our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Stake-governed tug-of-war and the biased infinity Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In tug-of-war, two players compete by moving a counter along edges of a graph, each winning the right to move at a given turn according to the flip of a possibly biased coin. The game ends when the counter reaches the boundary, a fixed subset of the vertices, at which point one player pays the other an amount determined by the boundary vertex. Economists and mathematicians have independently studied tug-of-war for many years, focussing respectively on resource-allocation forms of the game, in which players iteratively spend precious budgets in an effort to influence the bias of the coins that determine the turn victors; and on PDE arising in fine mesh limits of the constant-bias game in a Euclidean setting.
  In this article, we offer a mathematical treatment of a class of tug-of-war games with allocated budgets: each player is initially given a fixed budget which she draws on throughout the game to offer a stake at the start of each turn, and her probability of winning the turn is the ratio of her stake and the sum of the two stakes. We consider the game played on a tree, with boundary being the set of leaves, and the payment function being the indicator of a single distinguished leaf. We find the game value and the essentially unique Nash equilibrium of a leisurely version of the game, in which the move at any given turn is cancelled with constant probability after stakes have been placed. We show that the ratio of the players' remaining budgets is maintained at its initial value $\lambda$; game value is a biased infinity harmonic function; and the proportion of remaining budget that players stake at a given turn is given in terms of the spatial gradient and the $\lambda$-derivative of game value. We also indicate examples in which the solution takes a different form in the non-leisurely game.</description>
