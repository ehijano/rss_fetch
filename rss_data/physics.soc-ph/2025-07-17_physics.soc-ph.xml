      <title>The Impact of Social Attractiveness on Casual Group Formation: Power-Law Group Sizes and Suppressed Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of casual group formation has long been a subject of interest in social sciences. While early stochastic models offered foundational insights into group size distributions, they often simplified individual behaviors and lacked mechanisms for heterogeneous social appeal. Here, we re-examine the attractiveness-driven interaction model, an agent-based framework where point-like agents move randomly in a 2D arena and exhibit varied social appeal, leading them to pause near highly attractive celebrity peers. We compare this model to a null model where the agents are continuously in movement, which resembles a Random Geometric Graph. Our extensive simulations reveal significant structural and dynamic differences: unlike the null model, the attractiveness-driven model's average degree increases linearly with system size for fixed density, resulting in more compact groups and the suppression of a percolation transition. Crucially, while the null model's group size distribution is either exponentially decaying or bimodal, the attractiveness-driven model robustly exhibits a power-law distribution, $P(n) \propto n^{-2.5}$, with an exponent independent of density. These findings, obtained through computationally intensive simulations due to long equilibration times, offer a thorough quantitative characterization of this model, highlighting the critical role of individual attractiveness in shaping social aggregation in physical space.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Informal Communication: An Archaeology of the Early Pre-Web Preprint Infrastructure at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the early development of preprint communication in high-energy physics, specifically with how preprint communication was formalized in the early 1960s at CERN. It employs a sociological conception of infrastructures to ask which practices and technologies of communication structured the use of preprints in high-energy physics at the time and subsequently solidified into the research community's communication and information infrastructure. The investigation conducts a media archaeology of the uses and understandings of the preprint medium in three historical layers to explore the sociocultural specificities that became inscribed into the preprint infrastructure at CERN: 1. The use of preprints as separate copies of papers accepted for publication and distributed informally to members of societies and academies in the early-20th century to make the content immediately available without delay of publication, 2. The use of preprints in postwar physics as media to privately and informally share practical instructions and theoretical tools in the fast-moving current of theoretical physics, and 3. As a formalized information system developed at the CERN library in the early 1960s, which treated preprints as public current awareness tools for the benefit of the whole HEP community to inform its members of recent progress in the field. The article concludes with a discussion of the infrastructural regimes that shaped the early pre-Web history of preprint communication as well as an outlook to the research program to comprehensively study the infrastructuring of preprint communication in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>The Trade-Off between Directness and Coverage in Transport Network Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing spatial networks, such as transport networks, commonly deals with the problem of how to best connect a set of locations through a set of links. In practice, it can be crucial to order the implementation of the links in a way that facilitates early functioning of the network during growth, like in bicycle networks. However, it is unclear how this early functional structure can be achieved by different growth processes. Here, we systematically study the growth of connected planar networks, quantifying functionality of the growing network structure. We compare random growth with various greedy and human-designed, manual growth strategies. We evaluate our results via the fundamental performance metrics of directness and coverage, finding non-trivial trade-offs between them. Manual strategies fare better than greedy strategies on both metrics, while random strategies perform worst and are unlikely to be Pareto efficient. Centrality-based greedy strategies tend to perform best for directness but are worse than random strategies for coverage, while coverage-based greedy strategies can achieve maximum global coverage as fast as possible but perform as poorly for directness as random strategies. Directness-based greedy strategies get stuck in local optimum traps. These results hold for a number of stylized urban transport network topologies. Our insights are crucial for applications where the order in which links are added to a spatial network is important, such as in urban or regional transport network design problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum at a Music Festival: the Impact of an Exhibit about Quantum Science and Technologies on Festival Visitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies are seen as transformative, with a potential to revolutionize fields like drug discovery and machine learning. Public engagement is crucial to align these developments with societal needs and foster acceptance. This study measured the impact of an exhibit about quantum technologies at the 2024 Lowlands music festival (n = 812). Pre- and post-surveys assessed changes in attitude, concern, interest and subjective knowledge. Results showed an increase in subjective knowledge but a decrease in interest, possibly due to reduced novelty or increased perceived difficulty. These findings underscore the effectiveness of exhibits as outreach tools in informal settings and highlight the critical role of maintaining novelty and emphasizing the relevance of quantum technologies in future outreach efforts. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of assessing outreach effectiveness to ensure that objectives are successfully achieved.</description>

      <title>Language bubbles in online social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become essential spaces for public discourse. While political polarisation and limited communication across different groups are widely acknowledged, the connection between social network fragmentation and the language features and quality used by various communities has received insufficient attention. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the social structure and linguistic richness of the Italian debate on Twitter/X. We analyse tweets and retweets from Italian politicians and news outlets between 2018 and 2022, characterising the retweet network and evaluating the language used within different communities through various lexical metrics. Our analysis uncovers two systematic patterns: communities closer in the network tend to use more similar vocabulary, while isolated communities consistently demonstrate lower lexical diversity and richness. Together, these patterns illustrate what we call ``language bubbles''. These findings indicate that socially isolated communities interact less with others and develop distinct and poorer linguistic profiles, highlighting a structural link between social fragmentation and linguistic divergence.</description>

      <title>Undulating patterns of Hysteresis loops in diurnal seasonality of air temperature in Urban Heat Island effect: Insights from Paris and Madrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the dynamics of the urban heat island (UHI) effect by conducting a comparative analysis of air temperature hysteresis patterns in Paris and Madrid, two major European cities with distinct climatic and urban characteristics. Utilizing high-resolution modelled air temperature data aggregated at a fine temporal resolution of three-hour intervals from 2008 to 2017, we investigate how diurnal and seasonal hysteresis loops reveal both unique and universal aspects of UHI variability. Paris, located in a temperate oceanic climate, and Madrid, situated in a cold semi-arid zone, display pronounced differences in UHI intensity, seasonal distribution, and diurnal patterns. Despite these contrasts, both cities exhibit remarkably similar hysteresis loop directions and slopes, suggesting that time-dependent mechanisms such as solar radiation and heat storage fundamentally govern air temperature UHI across diverse urban contexts. Our findings underscore the importance of considering both local climate and universal physical processes in developing targeted, climate-resilient urban strategies. The results pave the way for group-based interventions and classification of cities by hysteresis patterns to inform urban planning and heat mitigation efforts.</description>

      <title>Modelling the spillover from online engagement to offline protest: stochastic dynamics and mean-field approximations on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media is transforming various aspects of offline life, from everyday decisions such as dining choices to the progression of conflicts. In this study, we propose a coupled modelling framework with an online social network layer to analyse how engagement on a specific topic spills over into offline protest activities. We develop a stochastic model and derive several mean-field models of varying complexity. These models allow us to estimate the reproductive number and anticipate when surges in activity are likely to occur. A key factor is the transmission rate between the online and offline domains; for offline outbursts to emerge, this rate must fall within a critical range, neither too low nor too high. Additionally, using synthetic networks, we examine how network structure influences the accuracy of these approximations. Our findings indicate that low-density networks need more complex approximations, whereas simpler models can effectively represent higher-density networks. When tested on two real-world networks, however, increased complexity did not enhance accuracy.</description>

      <title>Assessing the economic benefits of space weather mitigation investment decisions: Evidence from Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space weather events pose a growing threat to modern economies, yet their macroeconomic consequences still remain underexplored. This study presents the first dedicated economic assessment of geomagnetic storm impacts on Aotearoa New Zealand, quantifying potential GDP losses across seven disruption and mitigation scenarios due to an extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). The primary focus is upon the damaging impacts of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) on the electrical power transmission network. The goal is to support decision-making around space weather mitigation investments by providing a first-order approximation of their potential economic benefits. We find that in the absence of mitigation, a severe but realistic storm could result in up to NZ\$8.36 billion in lost GDP, with more than half stemming from cascading supply chain effects. Yet, even less severe scenarios incur losses exceeding NZ\$3 billion. Importantly, research-led operational strategies, such as optimized switching and islanding, can avoid up to NZ\$370 million in losses for as little as NZ\$500,000 in expenditure, delivering a benefit-cost ratio of 740 to 1. Moreover, physical protections such as GIC blocking devices further reduce disruption to as low as NZ\$1.12 billion, with avoided GDP losses up to NZ\$2.3 billion, and benefit-cost returns up to 80 to 1. When also acknowledging unmodelled impacts, including multi-billion losses in capital equipment and long-term revenue, the economic rationale for pre-emptive mitigation becomes even more pertinent. Future research needs to integrate the modelling of capital and revenue losses for strategically important industrial facilities.</description>

      <title>From Signed Networks to Group Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I define a "group graph" which encodes the symmetry in a dynamical process on a network. Group graphs extend signed networks, where links are labelled with plus or minus one, by allowing link labels from any group and generalising the standard notion of balance. I show that for processes on a balanced group graph the time evolution is completely determined by the network topology, not by the group structure. This unifies and extends recent findings on signed networks (Tian \&amp; Lambiotte, 2024a) and complex networks (Tian \&amp; Lambiotte, 2024b). I will also relate the results discussed here to related work such as the "group graph" of Harary (1982), a "voltage graph" (Gross, 1974) and a "gain graph" (Zaslavsky 1989). Finally, I will review some promising applications for network dynamics and symmetry-driven modelling including status, edges with a zero label, weak balance, unbalanced group graphs and using monoids.</description>

      <title>A biophysical approach to the design of networks of communication systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the growth dynamics of the protist \textit{Physarum polycephalum}, we employ a formalism that describes adaptive, incompressible Hagen-Poiseuille flows on channel networks to identify graphs connecting different nodes within Euclidean space. These graphs are either suboptimal or optimal with respect to their length. Occasionally, we derive graph tree configurations that are topologically equivalent to Steiner trees. This methodology can be utilised to assist in making decisions regarding the design of communication networks, such as fibre webs, motorways, or railway networks. As a demonstration of the practicality of this approach, we explicitly apply this framework to the Portuguese railway network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce model-based transition rates for controlled compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology, with a focus on the effects of control strategies applied to interacting multi-agent systems describing contact formation dynamics. In the framework of kinetic control problems, we compare two prototypical control protocols: one additive control directly influencing the dynamics and another targeting the interaction strength between agents. The emerging controlled macroscopic models are derived for an SIR compartmentalization to illustrate their impact on epidemic progression and contact interaction dynamics. Numerical results show the effectiveness of this approach in steering the dynamics and controlling epidemic trends, even in scenarios where contact distributions exhibit an overpopulated tail.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Link Prediction via Hyperedge Copying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative model of temporally-evolving hypergraphs in which hyperedges form via noisy copying of previous hyperedges. Our proposed model reproduces several stylized facts from many empirical hypergraphs, is learnable from data, and defines a likelihood over a complete hypergraph rather than ego-based or other sub-hypergraphs. Analyzing our model, we derive descriptions of node degree, edge size, and edge intersection size distributions in terms of the model parameters. We also show several features of empirical hypergraphs which are and are not successfully captured by our model. We provide a scalable stochastic expectation maximization algorithm with which we can fit our model to hypergraph data sets with millions of nodes and edges. Finally, we assess our model on a hypergraph link prediction task, finding that an instantiation of our model with just 11 parameters can achieve competitive predictive performance with large neural networks.</description>
