      <title>Harmonic oscillator system in topologically charged Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity space-time and Wu-Yang magnetic monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a harmonic oscillator (HO) system within the framework of topologically charged Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity space-time. Additionally, we incorporate the Wu-Yang magnetic monopole (WYMM) into the quantum system and analyze the influences of modified gravity, the topological charge, and WYMM on this HO quantum mechanical system. Using analytical methods, we derive the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the HO. Moreover, we consider a scenario where the EiBI-gravity parameter is absent and introduce an inverse square potential, including the WYMM, into the HO system. Our findings show significant deviations in the behavior of the HO system compared to the traditional quantum mechanical HO model, including alterations in the bound-state spectra and eigenfunctions. These results provide valuable insights into the interplay between quantum mechanical problems and alternative gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Searching for asymmetric and heavily precessing Binary Black Holes in the gravitational wave data from the LIGO and Virgo third Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the features of the GstLAL pipeline, we present the results of a matched filtering search for asymmetric binary black hole systems with heavily mis-aligned spins in LIGO and Virgo data taken during the third observing run. Our target systems show strong imprints of precession and current searches have non-optimal sensitivity in detecting them. After measuring the sensitivity improvement brought by our search over standard spin-aligned searches, we report the detection of 30 gravitational wave events already discovered in the latest Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogues. However, we do not find any additional significant gravitational wave candidates. Our results allow us to place an upper limit of $R_{90\%} = 0.28^{+0.33}_{-0.04}\;\; \mathrm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ on the merger rate of a hypothetical subpopulation of asymmetric, heavily precessing signals, not identified by other searches. Since our upper limit is consistent with the latest rate estimates from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, our findings rule out the existence of a yet-to-be-discovered population of precessing binaries.</description>

      <title>Gravitational spinoptics in a curved space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss propagation of the weak high-frequency gravitational waves in a curved spacetime background. We develop a so-called spinoptics approximation which takes into account interaction of the spin of the field with the curvature of the background metric. This is achieved by modifying the standard geometric optics approximation by including the helicity sensitive terms of the order $1/\omega$ in the eikonal equation. The novelty of the approach developed in this paper is that instead of study of the high-frequency expansion of the equations for the gravitational field perturbations we construct the effective action for the gravitational spinoptics. The gravitational spinoptics equations derived by variation of the effective action correctly reproduce the earlier obtained results. However, the proposed effective action approach is technically more simple and transparent. It allows one to reduce the study of the high-frequency gravitational waves to study classical dynamics of massless particles with internal discrete degree of freedom (helicity). The formalism is covariant and it can be applied for arbitrary vacuum space-time background.</description>

      <title>Initial Data for First-order Causal Viscous Conformal Fluids in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the Einstein constraint equations for a first-order causal viscous relativistic hydrodynamic theory in the case of a conformal fluid. For such a theory, a direct application of the conformal method does not lead to a decoupling of the equations, even for constant-mean curvature initial data. We combine the conformal method applied to a background perfect fluid theory with a perturbative argument in order to obtain the result.</description>

      <title>Acceleration and radiation: Classical and quantum aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known for some time that the classical concept of radiation is not covariant: for uniformly accelerated particles, it depends on the state of motion of the observer relative to the particle emitting it. Moreover, recent literature in the field of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes suggests a deep connection between bremsstrahlung and the Unruh effect, where zero-Rindler energy particles have played a central role beyond constructing the radiation contents of systems; as this is an unfamiliar concept, it seems unsettling to deal with particles having no energy. This thesis studies such a connection in both the classical and quantum perspectives, showing how the quantum Unruh effect is responsible for the classical radiation detected for the electric and gravitational cases, and studies the role of zero-Rindler-energy particles and how they relate to the radiative field of uniformly accelerated particles.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Particle Creation Using an Equal-Time Wigner Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the expansion of the universe can create particles. However, due to ambiguities when defining particles during the expansion, there are still debates about how to choose vacuum and particle states. To clarify how particles are produced in an expanding universe, we study the creation of real scalar particles in flat FLRW spacetimes by using a recently developed equal-time Wigner formalism. By comparing this quantum kinetic formalism with the standard Bogoliubov approach, we make a natural definition of a particle number in terms of kinetic phase-space functions, which we then compare with common adiabatic particle numbers. With inspiration from flat spacetime QED, we perform numerical calculations and discuss the interpretation of the particle numbers in terms of a hypothetical switch-off in the expansion rate. Finally, we consider how this interpretation is affected by regularization.</description>

      <title>Extended thermodynamics and critical behavior of generalized dilatonic Lifshitz black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a particular Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton black hole configuration with cosmological constant, expressed in terms of the curvature radius, from the point of view of quasi-homogeneous thermodynamics. In particular, we show that the curvature radius and the coupling constant of the matter fields can be treated as thermodynamic variables in the framework of extended thermodynamics, leading in both cases to a van der Waals-like behavior. We also investigate in detail the stability and critical properties of the black holes and obtain results, which are compatible with the mean field approach.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars in Aether Scalar-Tensor Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aether Scalar-Tensor theory is a modification of general relativity proposed to explain galactic and cosmological mass discrepancies conventionally attributed to dark matter. The theory is able to fit the cosmic microwave background and the linear matter power spectrum without dark matter. In this work, we derive the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this theory and solve it for realistic nuclear equations of state to predict the mass-radius relation of neutron stars. We find solutions that are compatible with all current observations of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Traces of quantum gravitational correction at third-order curvature through the black hole shadow and particle deflection at the weak field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the quantum-gravity correction at the third-order curvature ($c_6$) on the black hole's shadow and deflection angle on the weak field regime, both involving finite distances of observers. While the calculation of the photonsphere and shadow radius $R_{\rm sh}$ can easily be achieved by the standard Lagrangian for photons, the deflection angle $\alpha$ employs the finite-distance version of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT). We find that the photonsphere reduces to the classical expression $r_{\rm ph} = 3M$ for both the Planck mass and the theoretical mass limit for BH, thus concealing the information about the applicability of the metric on the quantum and astrophysical grounds. Our calculation of the shadow, however, revealed that $c_6$ is strictly negative and constrains the applicability of the metric to quantum black holes. For instance, the bounds for the mass is $M/l_{\rm Pl} \in [0.192, 4.315]$. We also derived the analytic formula for the observer-dependent shadow, which confirms $c_6$'s influence on quantum black holes even for observers in the asymptotic regions. The influence of such a parameter also strengthens near the quantum black hole. Our analytic calculation of $\alpha$ is shown to be independent of $c_6$ if the finite distance $u \rightarrow 0$, and $c_6$ is not coupled to any time-like geodesic. Finally, the effect of $c_6$ manifests in two ways: if $M^2$ is large enough to offset the small value of $l_{\rm Pl}$ (which is beyond the theoretical mass limit), or if $b$ is comparable to $l_{\rm Pl}$ for a quantum black hole.</description>

      <title>Shadow and quasinormal modes of the rotating Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) black hole model is an extension of classical black hole solutions in general relativity, incorporating quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects via the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian. The Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian describes the nonlinear corrections to Maxwell's equations due to virtual electron-positron pair production in a strong electromagnetic field. When this Lagrangian is coupled with Einstein's field equations, it leads to modified black hole solutions that took into account these quantum corrections. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the screening parameter, acting as an effective dielectric constant endowed in a vacuum due to such QED effects, on the properties of the rotating and electrically charged Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black holes (EEH). To this aim, we analyzed and discussed findings as to how the screening parameter, being positive or negative, affects certain black hole properties such as null regions, shadow cast and its observables, and quasinormal modes (QNMs) relative to the Kerr and Kerr-Newman cases. We find that the presence of a screened charge due to the associated QED effects in this screened Maxwell theory might noticeably alter the properties of black holes, offering insights into the interplay between gravity and quantum field effects.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes, thermodynamics and shadow of black holes in Hu-Sawicki f(R) gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive novel black hole solutions in a modified gravity theory, namely the Hu-Sawicki model of $f(R)$ gravity. After obtaining the black hole solution, we study the horizon radius of the black hole from the metric and then analyse the dependence of the model parameters on the horizon. We then use the 6th-order WKB method to study the quasinormal modes of oscillations (QNMs) of the black hole perturbed by a scalar field. The dependence of the amplitude and damping part of the QNMs are analysed with respect to variations in model parameters and the errors associated with the QNMs are also computed. After that, we study some thermodynamic properties associated with the black hole such as its thermodynamic temperature as well as greybody factors. It is found that the black hole has the possibility of showcasing negative temperatures. We also analyse the geodesics and derive the photon sphere radius as well as the shadow radius of the black hole. The photon radius is independent of the model parameters while the shadow radius showed a fair amount of dependence on the model parameters. We tried to constrain the parameters with the help of Keck and VLTI observational data and obtained some bounds on $m$ and $c_{2}$ parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate future singularities originating from the anisotropy in the universe. We formulate a new class of singularities in the homogeneous and anisotropic universe, comparing them with the known singularities in the homogeneous and isotropic universe. We also discuss the physical consequences of the new singularities. Moreover, we develop a novel reconstruction method for the anisotropic universe by introducing four scalar fields to reconstruct cosmological models in which future singularities appear. We present an explicit example where the anisotropy may grow in the future up to singularity.</description>

      <title>Photon frequency variation in non-linear electro-magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set a generalised non-linear Lagrangian, encompassing Born-Infeld and Heisenberg-Euler theories among others. The Lagrangian reduces to the Maxwell Lagrangian at lowest order. The field is composed by a propagating light-wave in an electro-magnetic background. The wave exhibits energy variation when the background is space-time dependent. In the photon description, this implies a red or a blue shift, like what we obtained in massive theories, as the de Broglie-Proca or effective mass theories as the Standard-Model Extension under Lorentz symmetry violation. The two results, photon energy-conservation and the frequency shift are instead new for non-linear electro-magnetism. We conclude by discussing how these static frequency shifts when added to the expansion red shift allow new interpretations in cosmology or for atomic spectra. We finally consider the consequences on the Poincar\'e symmetry.</description>

      <title>In-in formalism for the entropy of quantum fields in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to compute the purity and entanglement entropy for quantum fields in a systematic perturbative expansion. To that end, we generalize the in-in formalism to non-unitary dynamics (i.e. accounting for the presence of an environment) and to the calculation of quantum information measures, which are not observables in the usual sense. This allows us to reduce the problem to one involving standard correlation functions, and to organize their computation in a diagrammatic expansion for which we construct the corresponding Feynman rules. As an illustration, we apply the formalism to a cosmological setting inspired by the effective field theory of inflation. We find that at late times, non-linear loop corrections share the same time behavior as the linear contribution, and only yield a slight redressing of the purity. In particular, when the environment is heavy compared to the Hubble scale, the phenomenon of recoherence previously encountered is robust to the class of non-linear extensions considered. Bridging the gap between perturbative quantum field theory and open quantum systems paves the way to a better understanding of renormalization and resummation in open effective field theories. It also enables a more systematic exploration of quantum information properties in field theoretic settings.</description>

      <title>Quantum inequalities for quantum black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate spacetime inequalities applicable to quantum-corrected black holes to all orders of backreaction in semiclassical gravity. Namely, we propose refined versions of the quantum Penrose and reverse isoperimetric inequalities, valid for all known three-dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter quantum black holes. Previous proposals of the quantum Penrose inequality apply in higher dimensions but fail when applied in three dimensions beyond the perturbative regime. Our quantum Penrose inequality, valid in three dimensions, holds at all orders of backreaction. This suggests cosmic censorship must exist in non-perturbative semiclassical gravity. Our quantum reverse isoperimetric inequality implies a maximum entropy state for quantum black holes at fixed volume.</description>

      <title>Galactic Rotation Curves of LSB Galaxies using core-halo FDM configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct galactic halos in order to fit the rotation curves (RCs) of a sample of low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. These halos are made of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) with a multimode expansion of non-spherical modes that in average contribute to the appropriate density profile consisting of a core and an envelope needed to fit the rotation curves. These halos are constructed assuming a solitonic core at the center and two types of envelopes, Navarro-Frenk-White and Pseudo-Isothermal density profiles. The resulting FDM configurations are then evolved in order to show how the average density changes in time due to the secular dynamical evolution, along with a condensation process that lead to the growth of the solitonic core.</description>

      <title>Running of the Number of Degrees of Freedom in Quantum Conformal Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the number of degrees of freedom in Weyl conformal gravity runs with the energy scale from the UV fixed point. To this end we employ two approaches. First, we utilize the Fradkin--Tseytlin prescription for the number of degrees of freedom and demonstrate that the one-loop results are highly dependent on the selected background. We then employ the counting methodology based on the $a$- and $c$-functions, which are typically used to characterize the trace anomaly of conformal field theory in four dimensions. We compute these in the enhanced one-loop approximation and demonstrate that the degrees of freedom decrease monotonically from six degrees in the UV regime. This behavior is independent of the backgrounds considered. Finally, we show how to relate the Fradkin--Tseytlin prescription to counting based on the $a$- and $c$-functions.</description>

      <title>A study of three butterflies: entanglement wedge method, OTOC and pole-skipping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate two salient chaotic features, namely Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, in the context of an asymptotically Lifshitz black hole background with an arbitrary critical exponent. These features are computed using three methods: entanglement wedge method, out-of-time-ordered correlator computation and pole-skipping. We provide a comparative analysis of the results from these methods, where the features derived from the entanglement wedge and OTOC methods are equivalent. On the contrary, the butterfly velocity obtained from pole-skipping matches only when the critical exponent becomes unity, i.e., the usual asymptotically AdS black hole. Furthermore, we evaluate the chaos at the classical level by computing the eikonal phase and Lyapunov exponent from the bulk gravity. These quantities emerge as nontrivial functions of the anisotropy index. By examining the classical eikonal phase, we uncover different scattering scenarios in the near-horizon and near-boundary regimes. We also discuss potential limitations regarding the choice of the turning point of the null geodesic in our approach.</description>

      <title>Hint to Supersymmetry from GR Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $S$-matrix formulation of gravity suggests that the $\theta$-vacuum structure must not be sustained by the theory. We point out that, when applied to the vacuum of general relativity, this criterion hints to supersymmetry. The topological susceptibility of gravitational vacuum induced by Eguchi-Hanson instantons can be eliminated neither by spin-$1/2$ fermions nor by an axion coupled via them since such fermions do not provide instanton zero modes. Instead, the job is done by a spin-$3/2$ fermion, hence realizing a local supersymmetry. This scenario also necessitates the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry and predicts the existence of axion of $R$-symmetry which gets mass exclusively from the gravitational instantons. The $R$-axion can be a viable dark matter candidate. Matching between the index and the anomaly imposes a constraint that spin-$1/2$ fermions should not contribute to the chiral gravitational anomaly.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on the Mass of Fundamental Fields from Primordial Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in the vacuum zero point energy associated to quantum fields and their statistical distributions during inflation. It is shown that the perturbations in the vacuum zero point energy have large amplitudes which are highly non-Gaussian. The effects of vacuum zero point fluctuations can be interpreted as the loop corrections in primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. Requiring that the primordial curvature perturbation to remain nearly scale-invariant and Gaussian imposes strong upper bounds on the mass of fundamental fields during inflation. We show that the fundamental fields can not be much heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, otherwise their vacuum zero point fluctuations induce large non-Gaussianities and scale-dependence in primordial perturbations. Considering the observational upper bound on tensor to scalar ratio, we conclude that all fundamental fields are lighter than $10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Indefinite Causal Structure and Causal Inequalities with Time-Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry is a prevalent feature of microscopic physics, including operational quantum theory and classical general relativity. Previous works have studied indefinite causal structure using the language of operational quantum theory, however, these rely on time-asymmetric conditions to constrain both operations and the process matrix. Here, we use time-symmetric, operational probabilistic theory to develop a time-symmetric process matrix formalism for indefinite causal structure. This framework allows for more processes than previously considered and a larger set of causal inequalities. We demonstrate that this larger set of causal inequalities offers new opportunities for device-independent certification of causal non-separability by violating new inequalities. Additionally, we determined that the larger class of time-symmetric processes found here is equivalent to those with Indefinite Causal Order and Time Direction (ICOTD) considered by Chiribella and Liu, thereby providing a description of these processes in terms of process matrices.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM cosmology: Alleviating major cosmological tensions by predicting standard neutrino properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-parameter extension of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model by allowing variations in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ and their total mass $\sum m_\nu$. Our motivation is twofold: (i) to examine whether $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM retains its success in fitting the data and addressing major cosmological tensions, without suggesting a need for a deviation from the standard model of particle physics, and (ii) to determine whether the data indicate new physics that could potentially address cosmological tensions, either in the post-recombination universe through the late-time mirror AdS-dS transition, or in the pre-recombination universe through modifications in the standard values of $N_{\rm eff}$ and $\sum m_\nu$, or both. Within the extended $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, referred to as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$+$\sum m_{\rm \nu}$, we find no significant tension when considering the Planck-alone analysis. We observe that incorporating BAO data limits the further success of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM extension. However, the weakly model-dependent BAOtr data, along with Planck and Planck+PP\&amp;SH0ES, favor $H_0\sim 73\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}\, Mpc^{-1}}$. In cases where BAOtr dataset is used, the mirror AdS-dS transition is very effective in providing enhanced $H_0$ values, and thus the model requires no significant deviation from the standard value of $N_{\rm eff} = 3.044$. Both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are effectively addressed, with some compromise in the case of the Planck+BAO dataset. Finally, the upper bounds obtained on $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.5$~eV are fully compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments. Our findings provide evidence that late-time physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, such as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, without altering the standard pre-recombination universe, can suffice to alleviate the major cosmological tensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06614v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we consider dark matter and dark energy as grand-canonical systems which are open, non-equilibrium coupled, and interacting systems. For the first time, we propose a new more realistic interaction scheme to explain dynamics between coupled interacting thermodynamic systems. Based on this new interaction schema, we propose new theorems to define the interactions including mutual and self-interactions. We proved the theorems based on the energy conservation law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, we obtain new coupled equations using the theorems. We numerically solved the interaction equations and obtained phase space diagrams and Lyapunov exponents. We show that the interaction between dark matter and dark energy is chaotic. We conclude that these theorems and results can be generalized to all coupled interacting particle and thermodynamic systems. Finally, we evaluated that the obtained results indicate the existence of a new law in physics. Additionally, based on the results, we gave physical definitions of basic concepts such as chaos and self-organization and pointed out the existence of hidden symmetries and variables in interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Direct Detection of Black Hole Formation in Neutron Star Mergers with Next-Generation Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A direct detection of black hole formation in neutron star mergers would provide invaluable information about matter in neutron star cores and finite temperature effects on the nuclear equation of state. We study black hole formation in neutron star mergers using a set of 190 numerical relativity simulations consisting of long-lived and black-hole-forming remnants. The postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum of a long-lived remnant has greatly reduced power at a frequency $f$ greater than $f_{\rm peak}$, for $f \gtrsim 4\,\rm kHz$, with $f_{\rm peak} \in [2.5, 4]\,\rm kHz$. On the other hand, black-hole-forming remnants exhibit excess power in the same large $f$ region and manifest exponential damping in the time domain characteristic of a quasinormal mode. We demonstrate that the gravitational-wave signal from a collapsed remnant is indeed a quasinormal ringing. We report on the opportunity for direct detections of black hole formation with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope and set forth the tantalizing prospect of such observations up to a distance of 100 Mpc for an optimally oriented and located source with an SNR of 4.</description>

Abstract: We consider a type of k-inflation under the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. We calculate various observables such as the scalar power spectrum, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the scalar spectra index for the case where the Hubble parameter is a power-law function of k-field. The model's parameters are constrained with Planck data and the concrete form of the potential is presented. The results show that the model can be in good agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Template bank to search for exotic gravitational wave signals from astrophysical compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeled searches of gravitational wave signals from compact binary mergers rely on template waveforms determined by the theory of general relativity (GR). Once a signal is detected, one generally performs the model agnostic test of GR, either looking for consistency between the GR waveform and data or introducing phenomenological deviations to detect the departure from GR. The non-trivial presence of beyond-GR physics can alter the waveform and could be missed by the GR template-based searches. A recent study [Phys. Rev. D 107, 024017 (2023)] targeted the binary black hole merger, assuming the parametrized deviation in lower post-Newtonian terms and demonstrated a mild effect on the search sensitivity. Surprisingly, for the search space of binary neutron star (BNS) systems where component masses range from 1 to $2.4\:\rm{M}_\odot$ and parametrized deviations span $1\sigma$ width of the deviation parameters measured from the GW170817 event, the GR template bank is highly ineffectual for detecting the non-GR signals. Here, we present a new hybrid method to construct a non-GR template bank for the BNS search space. The hybrid method uses the geometric approach of three-dimensional lattice placement to cover most of the parameter space volume, followed by the random method to cover the boundary regions of parameter space. We find that the non-GR bank size is $\sim$15 times larger than the conventional GR bank and is effectual towards detecting non-GR signals in the target search space.</description>

      <title>Glitch veto based on unphysical gravitational wave binary inspiral templates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient signals arising from instrumental or environmental factors, commonly referred to as glitches, constitute the predominant background of false alarms in gravitational wave searches with ground-based detectors. Therefore, effective data analysis methods for vetoing glitch-induced false alarms are crucial to enhancing the sensitivity of a search. We present a veto method for glitches that impact matched filtering-based searches for binary inspiral signals. The veto uses unphysical sectors in the space of chirp time parameters as well as an unphysical extension including negative chirp times to efficiently segregate glitches from gravitational wave signals in data from a single detector. Inhabited predominantly by glitches but nearly depopulated of genuine gravitational wave signals, these unphysical sectors can be efficiently explored using Particle Swarm Optimization. In a test carried out on data taken from both LIGO detectors spanning multiple observation runs, the veto was able to reject $99.9\%$ of glitches with no loss of signals detected with signal-to-noise ratio $\geq 9.0$ and total detector frame mass $\leq 80$ $M_\odot$. Our results show that extending a matched filter search to unphysical parts of a signal parameter space promises to be an effective strategy for mitigating glitches.</description>

      <title>Notes on thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-like bumblebee black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-like bumblebee black hole using Iyer-Wald covariant phase space formalism. With a non zero vacuum expectation value, the bumblebee field is responsible for spontaneously breaking the Lorentz symmetry. As the bumblebee field is non-minimally coupled to gravity, we showed that the thermodynamic variables will be different from the counterpart in Einstein gravity. Especially, by using Iyer-Wald formalism, we found that the black hole entropy also differs from the result obtained from Wald entropy formula. Like Horndeski gravity, this mismatch is due to the divergence of bumblebee one-form field at the horizon. After figuring out the thermodynamics, we also briefly discussed the evaporation behavior of Schwarzschild like bumblebee black hole. We found that although bumblebee field has no influence on the critical impact factor, it can influence the black hole evaporation time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misner (1967) space is a portion of 2-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, identified under a boost $\mathcal B$. It is well known that the maximal analytic extension of Misner space that is Hausdorff consists of one half of Minkowski spacetime, identified under $\mathcal B$; and Hawking and Ellis (1973) have shown that the maximal analytic extension that is non-Hausdorff is equal to the full Minkowski spacetime with the point $Q$ at the origin removed, identifed under $\mathcal B$. In this paper I show that, in fact, there is an infinite set of non-Hausdorff maximal analytic extensions, each with a different causal structure. The extension constructed by Hawking and Ellis is the simplest of these. Another extension is obtained by wrapping an infinite number of copies of Minkowski spacetime around the removed $Q$ as a helicoid or Riemann surface and then identifying events under the boost $\mathcal B$. The other extensions are obtained by wrapping some number $n$ of successive copies of Minkowski spacetime around the missing $Q$ as a helicoid, then identifying the end of the $n$'th copy with the beginning of the initial copy, and then identifying events under $\mathcal B$. I discuss the causal structure and covering spaces of each of these extensions.</description>

Abstract: The classical dynamics and the construction of quantum states in a plane wave curved spacetime are examined, paying particular attention to the similarities with the case of an electromagnetic plane wave in flat spacetime. A natural map connecting the dynamics of a particle in the Rosen metric and the motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic plane wave is unveiled. We then discuss how this map can be translated into the quantum description by exploiting the large number of underlying symmetries. We examine the complete analogy between Volkov solutions and fermion states in the Rosen chart and properly extend this to massive vector bosons. We finally report the squared S-matrix element of Compton scattering in a sandwich plane wave spacetime in the form of a two-dimensional integral.</description>

Abstract: We investigate thermodynamics of static and spherically symmetric black holes (BHs) in generalized Proca (GP) theories by applying the Iyer-Wald prescription. BH solutions in GP theories are divided into the two classes. The first class corresponds to the solutions obtained by the direct promotion of the BH solutions in shift-symmetric Horndeski theories, while the second class consists of the solutions which are obtained only in GP theories and contain a nonzero electromagnetic field. For BH solutions in the first class, we confirm that the BH entropy and its thermodynamic mass remain the same as those in the counterpart solution in shift-symmetric Horndeski theories. We also calculate the thermodynamical variables of the several static and spherically-symmetric BH solutions in the second class, and investigate the thermodynamical stability when there exist two BH solutions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the pre-inflationary dynamics in loop quantum cosmology with a DBI scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology is a symmetry-reduced application of loop quantum gravity. The theory predicts a bounce for the universe at the Planck scale and resolves the singularity of standard cosmology. The dynamics is also governed by an effective Hamiltonian, which predicts a modified Friedmann equation containing the quadratic terms of the energy density. The term plays an essential role in the high energy regime, but the equations return to the standard form in the low energy regime. The evolution of the universe in the pre-inflationary period is studied in the framework of loop quantum cosmology, where the DBI scalar field is assumed to be the dominant component of the universe. Using the numerical method, we provide the evolution of the DBI field. The background evolution shows that there are three phases as: bouncing phase, transition phase and slow-roll inflationary phase. There is also a short period of super-inflation just at the beginning of the bounce phase. The field first climbs the potential and then reaches the turning point where $\dot{\phi}$ disappears and the potential energy becomes the dominant part of the energy density. This is the time when the slow roll inflation begins and the field slowly rolls down the potential. The results indicate that there are a few e-fold expansions in the bounce phase, about $N = 3.5-4$, and the universe experiences about $N = 59$ e-fold expansions in the slow-roll inflation phase.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating as a discriminator for horizons in equatorial eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal heating in a binary black hole system is driven by the absorption of energy and angular momentum by the black hole's horizon. Previous works have shown that this phenomenon becomes particularly significant during the late stages of an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) into a rapidly spinning massive black hole, a key focus for future low-frequency gravitational-wave observations by (for instance) the LISA mission. Past analyses have largely focused on quasi-circular inspiral geometry, with some of the most detailed studies looking at equatorial cases. Though useful for illustrating the physical principles, this limit is not very realistic astrophysically, since the population of EMRI events is expected to arise from compact objects scattered onto relativistic orbits in galactic centers through many-body events. In this work, we extend those results by studying the importance of tidal heating in equatorial EMRIs with generic eccentricities. Our results suggest that accurate modeling of tidal heating is crucial to prevent significant dephasing and systematic errors in EMRI parameter estimation. We examine a phenomenological model for EMRIs around exotic compact objects by parameterizing deviations from the black hole picture in terms of the fraction of radiation absorbed compared to the BH case. Based on a mismatch calculation we find that reflectivities as small as $|\mathcal{R}|^2 \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ are distinguishable from the BH case, irrespective of the value of the eccentricity. We stress, however, that this finding should be corroborated by future parameter estimation studies.</description>

      <title>Towards efficient Effective One Body models for generic, non-planar orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complete waveform models able to account for arbitrary non-planar orbits represent a holy grail in current gravitational-wave astronomy. Here, we take a step towards this direction and present a simple yet efficient prescription to obtain the evolution of the spin vectors and of the orbital angular momentum along non-circularized orbits, that can be applied to any eccentric aligned-spins waveform model. The scheme employed is motivated by insights gained from the post-Newtonian (PN) regime. We investigate the phenomenology of the Euler angles characterizing the time-dependent rotation that connects the co-precessing frame to the inertial one, gauging the importance of non-circular terms in the evolution of the spins of a precessing binary. We demonstrate that such terms are largely negligible, irrespectively of the details of the orbit. Such insights are confirmed by studying the radiation-frame of a few eccentric, precessing numerical relativity (NR) simulations. Our investigations confirm that the usual "twisting" technique employed for quasi-spherical systems can be safely applied to non-circularized binaries. By then augmenting a state-of-the-art Effective-One-Body (EOB) model for non-circular planar orbits with the prescription discussed, we obtain an inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) model for eccentric, precessing binary black holes (BBHs). We validate the model in the quasi-spherical limit via mismatches and present one phasing comparison against a precessing, eccentric simulation from the RIT catalog.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Carrollian Stretched Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive toolbox for studying Carrollian stretched horizons, encompassing their geometry, dynamics, symplectic geometry, symmetries, and corresponding Noether charges. We introduce a precise definition of ruled stretched Carrollian structures (sCarrollian structures) on any surface, generalizing the conventional Carrollian structures of null surfaces, along with the notions of sCarrollian connection and sCarrollian stress tensor. Our approach unifies the sCarrollian (intrinsic) and stretched horizon (embedding) perspectives, providing a universal framework for any causal surface, whether timelike or null. We express the Einstein equations in sCarrollian variables and discuss the phase space symplectic structure of the sCarrollian geometry. Through Noether's theorem, we derive the Einstein equation and canonical charge and compute the evolution of the canonical charge along the transverse (radial) direction. The latter can be interpreted as a spin-2 symmetry charge.
  Our framework establishes a novel link between gravity on stretched horizons and Carrollian fluid dynamics and unifies various causal surfaces studied in the literature, including non-expanding and isolated horizons. We expect this work to provide insights into the hydrodynamical description of black holes and the quantization of null surfaces.</description>

      <title>Black hole scattering near the transition to plunge: Self-force and resummation of post-Minkowskian theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geodesic scattering of a test particle off a Schwarzschild black hole can be parameterized by the speed-at-infinity $v$ and the impact parameter $b$, with a "separatrix", $b=b_c(v)$, marking the threshold between scattering and plunge. Near the separatrix, the scattering angle diverges as $\sim\log(b-b_c)$. The self-force correction to the scattering angle (at fixed $v,b$) diverges even faster, like $\sim A_1(v)b_c/(b-b_c)$. Here we numerically calculate the divergence coefficient $A_1(v)$ in a scalar-charge toy model. We then use our knowledge of $A_1(v)$ to inform a resummation of the post-Minkowskian expansion for the scattering angle, and demonstrate that the resummed series agrees remarkably well with numerical self-force results even in the strong-field regime. We propose that a similar resummation technique, applied to a mass particle subject to a gravitational self-force, can significantly enhance the utility and regime of validity of post-Minkowskian calculations for black-hole scattering.</description>

      <title>Charged Wormhole Solutions in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we construct models of static wormholes within the framework of 4-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4D EGB) gravity an (an)isotropic energy momentum tensor (EMT) and a Maxwell field as supporting matters for the wormhole geometry assuming a constant redshift function. We obtain exact spherically symmetric wormhole solutions in 4D EGB gravity for an isotropic and anisotropic matter sources under the effect of electric charge. The solutions are more generalized in the sense of incorporating the charge contributions. Furthermore, we examine the null, weak and strong energy conditions at the wormhole throat of radius $r=r_{0}$. We demonstrate that at the wormhole throat, the classical energy conditions are violated by arbitrary small amount. Additionally, we analyze the wormhole geometry incorporating semiclassical corrections through embedding diagrams. We discover that the wormhole solutions are in equilibrium as the anisotropic and hydrostatic forces cancel each other.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Beam of Gravitational Radiation from a Cosmic String Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate exact and approximate techniques to calculate the emission of gravitational radiation from cosmic string loops in order to generate beam models covering the entire celestial sphere for a wide range of modes $m$. One approach entails summing over contributions of stationary and nearly-stationary points of individual, factorized, left- and right-moving modes. This "multipoint method" generalizes traditional methods that rely on expansions around exact stationary points of mode products. A second complementary approach extends the method of steepest descent to generate an asymptotic description of the beam as $m \to \infty$. We present example calculations of the emission of power from cusp-containing loops and compare the results with those obtained by numerically exact techniques as well as by previous approaches. The multipoint method achieves its best results at an intermediate range of modes, improving over previous methods in terms of accuracy. It handles the emission from all regions of the loop not just those near cusps. We demonstrate this capability by making a detailed study of the "pseudocusp" phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Compressed baryon acoustic oscillation analysis is robust to modified-gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the robustness of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analysis to the underlying cosmological model. We focus on testing the standard BAO analysis that relies on the use of a template. These templates are constructed assuming a fixed fiducial cosmological model and used to extract the location of the acoustic peaks. Such "compressed analysis" had been shown to be unbiased when applied to the $\Lambda$CDM model and some of its extensions. However, it has not been known whether this type of analysis introduces biases in a wider range of cosmological models where the template may not fully capture relevant features in the BAO signal. In this study, we apply the compressed analysis to noiseless mock power spectra that are based on Horndeski models, a broad class of modified-gravity theories specified with eight additional free parameters. We study the precision and accuracy of the BAO peak-location extraction assuming DESI, DESI II, and MegaMapper survey specifications. We find that the bias in the extracted peak locations is negligible; for example, it is less than 10% of the statistical error for even the proposed future MegaMapper survey. Our findings indicate that the compressed BAO analysis is remarkably robust to the underlying cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Infrared Sensitivity of Cosmological Probes in Horndeski Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological probes constructed in large-scale surveys are independent of the underlying theory of gravity, and their relativistic descriptions are indeed applicable to any theory of gravity. It was shown that the presence of fluctuations with wavelength much larger than the characteristic scales of the surveys has no impact on cosmological probes, if the matter content is adiabatic and the Einstein equations are used. In this paper we study the sensitivity of cosmological probes to infrared fluctuations in Horndeski theory. We find that the extra degree of freedom in the Horndeski scalar field can induce sensitivity to infrared fluctuations in the cosmological probes, even when the matter components are adiabatic on large scales. A generalized adiabatic condition including the extra dof, in contrast, guarantees that cosmological probes are devoid of infrared sensitivity, and this solution corresponds to the adiabatic modes \`a la Weinberg in Horndeski theory, which can be removed by a coordinate transformation in the infrared limit. We discuss the implications of our findings and the connections to the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Testing the isotropy of cosmic acceleration with Pantheon+ and SH0ES: A cosmographic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a recent Pantheon+SH0ES compilation of Type Ia Supernova distance measurements at low-redshift, i.e., $0.01 \leq z \leq 0.10$, in order to investigate the directional dependency of the deceleration parameter ($q_0$) in different patches ($60^{\circ}$ size) across the sky, as a probe of the statistical isotropy of the Universe. We adopt a cosmographic approach to compute the cosmological distances, fixing $H_0$ and $M_B$ to reference values provided by the collaboration. By looking at 500 different patches randomly taken across the sky, we find a maximum $\sim 3\sigma$ CL anisotropy level for $q_0$, whose direction points orthogonally to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole axis, i.e., $(RA^{\rm SN},DEC^{\rm SN}) = (267^{\circ},6^{\circ})$ vs $(RA^{\rm CMB},DEC^{\rm CMB}) = (167^{\circ},-7^{\circ})$. We assessed the statistical significance of those results, finding that such a signal is expected due to the limitations of the observational sample. These results support that there is no significant evidence for a departure from the cosmic isotropy assumption, one of the pillars of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the wedge holography for the de-Sitter space as a bulk theory. First, we discuss a more general mathematical construction of wedge holography in parallel with wedge holography construction for the AdS bulk, and then we construct the wedge holography in the extended static patch. In the first case, we prove that one can construct wedge holography for the de-Sitter bulk for the static patch as well as global coordinate metric on end-of-the-world branes. Extended static patch wedge holography is constructed by joining the two copies of double holography in DS/dS correspondence. We find that wedge holography with extended static patch metric leads to the emergence of communicating universes. Further, we propose a model which provides the theoretical evidence of communicating multiverses.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction in the quasi-linear formulation of modified Newtonian dynamics (QuMOND)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims. We explore the dynamical friction on a test mass in gravitational systems in the Quasi linear formulation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (QuMOND). Methods. Exploiting the quasi linearity of QuMOND we derive a simple expression for the dynamical friction in akin to its Newtonian counterpart in the standard Chandrasekhar derivation. Moreover, adopting a mean field approach based on the Liouville equation we obtain a more rigorous (though in integral form) dynamical friction formula that can be evaluated numerically for a given choice of the QuMOND interpolation function. Results. Consistently with previous work, we observe that dynamical friction is stronger in MOND with respect to a baryon only Newtonian system with the same mass distribution. This amounts to a correction of the Coulomb logarithmic factor via extra terms proportional to the MOND radius of the system. Moreover, with the aid of simple numerical experiments we confirm our theoretical predictions and those of previous work on MOND.</description>

      <title>The Born regime of gravitational amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $2 \to 2$ scattering in the regime where the wavelength of the scattered objects is comparable to their distance but is much larger than any Compton wavelength in the quantum field theory. We observe that in this regime - which differs from the eikonal - the Feynman diagram expansion takes the form of a geometric series, akin to the Born series of quantum mechanics. Conversely, we can define the Feynman diagram expansion as the Born series of a relativistic effective-one-body (EOB) Schr\"odinger equation. For a gravitational theory in this regime we observe that the EOB Schr\"odinger equation reduces to the Regge-Wheeler or Teukolsky wave equations. We make use of this understanding to study the tree-level Compton scattering off a Kerr black hole. We compute the scalar and photon Compton amplitude up to $O(a^{30})$ in the black hole spin $a$ and propose an all-order expression. Remarkably, we find that boundary terms, which are typically neglected, give non-zero contact pieces necessary for restoring crossing symmetry and gauge invariance of the Kerr-Compton amplitude.</description>
