      <title>Extremely amenable automorphism groups of countable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the question: How many pairwise non-isomorphic extremely amenable groups are there which are seprable metrizable or even Polish? We show that there are continuum many such groups. In fact we construct continuum many pairwise non-isomorphic extremely amenable groups as automorphism groups of countable structures. We also consider this classicfication problem from the point of view of descriptive set theory by showing that the class of all extremely amenable closed subgroups of $S_\infty$ is Borel and by obtaining some lower bounds for their isomorphism relation in the Borel reducibility hierarchy.</description>

      <title>The normal decomposition of a morphism in categories without zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a morphism f in a category C with sufficiently many finite limits and colimits, we discuss an elementary construction of a decomposition of f through objects P and N which, if C happens to have a zero object, amounts to the standard decomposition of f through P = Coker(ker f) and N = Ker(coker f). In this way we obtain natural notions of normal monomorphism and normal epimorphism also in non-pointed categories, as special types of regular mono- and epimorphisms. We examine the factorization behaviour of these classes of morphisms in general, compare the generalized normal decompositions with other types of threefold factorizations, and illustrate them in some every-day categories. The concrete construction of normal decompositions in the slices or coslices of these categories can be challenging. Amongst many others, in this regard, we consider particularly the categories of T1-spaces and of groups.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck's theorem on the precompactness of subsets functional spaces over pseudocompact spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizations of the theorems of Eberlein and Grothendieck on the precompactness of subsets of function spaces are considered: if $X$ is a countably compact space and $C_p(X)$ is a space of continuous functions in the pointwise topology convergence, then any countably compact subspace of the space $C_p(X)$ is precompact, that is, it has a compact closure. The paper provides an overview of the results on this topic. It is proved that if a pseudo-compact $X$ contains a dense Lindelof $\Sigma$-space, then pseudocompact subspaces of the space $C_p(X)$ are precompact. If $X$ is the product Cech complete spaces, then bounded subsets of the space $C_p(X)$ are precompact. Results on the continuity of separately continuous functions were also obtained.</description>
