      <title>Decoding Neurodevelopmental Dynamics in Pediatric High Grade Gliomas: Divergences in Transcriptomic Network Complexity from Healthy Neural Stem Cell Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pediatric high grade gliomas are lethal evolutionary disorders with stalled developmental trajectories and disrupted differentiation hierarchies. We integrate transcriptional and algorithmic network complexity based perturbation analysis to elucidate gene expression patterns and molecular divergence between Diffuse Midline Gliomas and glioblastoma, revealing shared developmental programs steering cell fate decision making. Our complex systems approach supports the emerging paradigm that pediatric high grade gliomas are neurodevelopmental disorders with hybrid lineage identities and disrupted patterning. We identify dysregulated neurodevelopmental and morphogenetic signatures, alongside bioelectric and neurotransmitter signaling programs that alter synaptic organization, neuronal fate commitment, and phenotypic plasticity, regulating glioma phenotypic switching. Causal drivers and regulators of plasticity were predicted as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets, reinforcing the view that pediatric gliomas are disorders of cell fate decisions and collective cellular identity. Decoded plasticity signatures indicate a teleonomic bias toward neural progenitor or neuron like identities, while synaptic transmission gene enrichment supports neuron glioma interactions shaping fate trajectories. These findings advance differentiation therapy as a systems medicine strategy, discovering plasticity regulators to reprogram malignant fates toward stable lineages, offering complex systems based targets for cancer reversion and predictive, preventive, precision oncology.</description>

      <title>Neurosymbolic Learning for Predicting Cell Fate Decisions from Longitudinal Single Cell Transcriptomics in Paediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia is a complex adaptive ecosystem with high morbidity. Current trajectory inference algorithms struggle to predict causal dynamics in AML progression, including relapse and recurrence risk. We propose a symbolic AI and deep learning framework grounded in complexity science, integrating Recurrent Neural Networks, Transformers, and Algorithmic Information Dynamics to model longitudinal single cell transcriptomics and infer complex state transitions in paediatric AML. We identify key plasticity markers as predictive signatures regulating developmental trajectories. These were derived by integrating deep learning with complex systems based network perturbation analysis and dynamical systems theory to infer high dimensional state space attractors steering AML evolution.
  Findings reveal dysregulated epigenetic and developmental patterning, with AML cells in maladaptive, reprogrammable plastic states, i.e., developmental arrest blocking terminal differentiation. Predictions forecast neurodevelopmental and morphogenetic signatures guiding AML cell fate bifurcations, suggesting ectoderm mesoderm crosstalk during disrupted differentiation. Neuroplasticity and neurotransmission related transcriptional signals implicate a brain immune hematopoietic axis in AML cell fate cybernetics. This is the first study combining RNNs and AID to predict and decipher longitudinal patterns of cell fate transition trajectories in AML. Our complex systems approach enables causal discovery of predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ecosystem engineering, cancer reversion, precision gene editing, and differentiation therapy, with strong translational potential for precision oncology and patient centered care.</description>

      <title>Utilizing the RAIN method and Graph SAGE Model to Identify Effective Drug Combinations for Gastric Neoplasm Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Gastric neoplasm, primarily adenocarcinoma, is an aggressive cancer with high mortality, often diagnosed late, leading to complications like metastasis. Effective drug combinations are vital to address disease heterogeneity, enhance efficacy, reduce resistance, and improve patient outcomes. Methods: The RAIN method integrated Graph SAGE to propose drug combinations, using a graph model with p-value-weighted edges connecting drugs, genes, and proteins. NLP and systematic literature review (PubMed, Scopus, etc.) validated proposed drugs, followed by network meta-analysis to assess efficacy, implemented in Python. Results: Oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and trastuzumab were identified as effective, supported by 61 studies. Fluorouracil alone had a p-value of 0.0229, improving to 0.0099 with trastuzumab, and 0.0069 for the triple combination, indicating superior efficacy. Conclusion: The RAIN method, combining AI and network meta-analysis, effectively identifies optimal drug combinations for gastric neoplasm, offering a promising strategy to enhance treatment outcomes and guide health policy.</description>
