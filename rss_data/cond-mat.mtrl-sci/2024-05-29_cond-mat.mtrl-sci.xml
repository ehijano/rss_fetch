      <title>On Nirmala indices based entropy measures for the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical parameter, known as a topological index, is employed to represent the molecular structure of a compound by considering its graph-theoretical properties. In the study of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR), topological indices are used to predict the physicochemical properties of chemical compounds. Graph entropies have evolved as information-theoretic tools to investigate the structural information of a molecular graph. In this study, we compute the Nirmala index, the first and second inverse Nirmala index of the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine, with the help of its M-polynomial. Furthermore, entropy measures for the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine are computed using Shannon's entropy model. The comparison between the Nirmala indices and their associated entropy measures is presented through numerical computation. The correlation between the Nirmala indices and associated entropy measurements is then examined using a regression model. Finally, it is shown that the structural characteristics and properties of the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine will be predicted by Nirmala indices-based entropy measures rather than the Nirmala indices.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Probing elasto-quantum materials with X-ray techniques and in situ anisotropic strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic lattice deformation plays an important role in the quantum mechanics of solid state physics. The possibility of mediating the competition and cooperation among different order parameters by applying in situ strain/stress on quantum materials has led to discoveries of a variety of elasto-quantum effects on emergent phenomena. It has become increasingly critical to have the capability of combining the in situ strain tuning with X-ray techniques, especially those based on synchrotrons, to probe the microscopic elasto-responses of the lattice, spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom. Herein, we briefly review the recent studies that embarked on utilizing elasto-X-ray characterizations on representative material systems and demonstrated the emerging opportunities enabled by this method. With that, we further discuss the promising prospect in this rising area of quantum materials research and the bright future of elasto-X-ray techniques.</description>

      <title>Using Thermal Crowding to Direct Pattern Formation on the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal films and other geometries of nanoscale thickness, when exposed to laser irradiation, melt and evolve as fluids as long as their temperature is sufficiently high. This evolution often leads to pattern formation, which may be influenced strongly by material parameters that are temperature dependent. In addition, the laser heat absorption itself depends on the time-dependent metal thickness. Self-consistent modeling of evolving metal films shows that, by controlling the amount and geometry of deposited metal, one could control the instability development. In particular, depositing additional metal leads to elevated temperatures through the `thermal crowding' effect, which strongly influences the metal film evolution. This influence may proceed via disjoint metal geometries, by heat diffusion through the underlying substrate. Fully self-consistent modeling focusing on the dominant effects, as well as accurate time-dependent simulations, allow us to describe the main features of thermal crowding and provide a route to control fluid instabilities and pattern formation on the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Strong Chirality Suppression in 1-D correlated Weyl Semimetal (TaSe4)2I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of light with correlated Weyl semimetals (WSMs) provides a unique platform for exploring non-equilibrium phases and fundamental properties such as chirality. Here, we investigate the structural chirality of (TaSe4)2I, a correlated WSM, under weak optical pumping using Circular Photogalvanic Effect (CPGE) measurements and Raman spectroscopy. Surprisingly, we find that there is a loss of chirality in (TaSe4)2I above a threshold light intensity. We suggest that the loss of chirality is due to an optically driven phase transition into an achiral structure distinct from the ground state. This structural transformation is supported by fluence-dependent Raman spectra, revealing a new peak at low pump fluences that disappears above the threshold fluence. The loss of chirality even at low optical powers suggests that the system quickly transitions into a non WSM phase, and also highlights the importance of considering light-induced structural interactions in understanding the behavior of correlated systems. These studies showcase that even low excitation powers can be used to control the properties of correlated topological systems, opening up new avenues for low power optical devices.</description>

      <title>Structure and magnetic properties of (Fe2O3)n clusters (n = 1-5)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global minimum structures of neutral (Fe2O3)n clusters with n = 1-5 were determined employing the genetic algorithm in combination with ab initio parameterized interatomic potentials and subsequent refinement at the density functional theory level. Systematic investigations of magnetic configurations of the clusters using a broken symmetry approach reveal antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic ground states. Whereas (Fe2O3)n clusters with n = 2-5 contain exclusively Fe3+, Fe2O3 was found to be a special case formally containing both Fe2+ and Fe3+. Calculated magnetic coupling constants revealed predominantly strong antiferromagnetic interactions, which exceed bulk values found in hematite. The precise magnetization (spin) state of the clusters has only small influence on their geometric structure. Starting from n = 4 also the relative energies of different cluster isomers are only weakly influenced by their magnetic configuration. These findings are important for simulations of larger (Fe2O3)n clusters and nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Structure evolution of nanoparticulate Fe2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic structure and properties of nanoparticulate Fe2O3 are characterized starting from its smallest Fe2O3 building unit through (Fe2O3)n clusters to nanometer-sized Fe2O3 particles. This is achieved by combining global structure optimizations at the density functional theory level, molecular dynamics simulations by employing tailored, ab initio parameterized interatomic potential functions and experiments. With the exception of nearly tetrahedral, adamantane-like (Fe2O3)2 small (Fe2O3)n clusters assume compact, virtually amorphous structures with little or no symmetry. For n = 2-5 (Fe2O3)n clusters consist mainly of two- and three-membered Fe-O rings. Starting from n = 5 they increasingly assume tetrahedral shape with the adamantane-like (Fe2O3)2 unit as the main building block. However, the small energy differences between different isomers of the same cluster-size make precise structural assignment for larger (Fe2O3)n clusters difficult. The tetrahedral morphology persists for Fe2O3 nanoparticles with up to 3 nm in diameter. Simulated crystallization of larger nanoparticles with diameters of about 5 nm demonstrates pronounced melting point depression and leads to formation of {\epsilon}-Fe2O3 single crystals with hexagonal morphology. This finding is in excellent agreement with the results obtained for Fe2O3 nanopowders generated by laser vaporization and provides the first direct indication that {\epsilon}-Fe2O3 may be thermodynamically the most stable phase in this size regime.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Chirality in Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using chiral organic cations in two-dimensional metal halide perovskites, chirality can be induced in the metal halide layers, which results in semiconductors with intriguing chiral optical and spin-selective transport properties. The chiral properties strongly depend on temperature, despite the basic crystal symmetry not changing fundamentally. We identify a set of descriptors that characterize the chirality of metal halide perovskites such as MBA$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$, and study their temperature dependence using molecular dynamics simulations with on-the-fly machine-learning force fields obtained from density functional theory calculations. We find that, whereas the organic cations remain chiral upon increasing the temperature, the inorganic framework loses this property more rapidly. We ascribe this to the breaking of hydrogen bonds that link the organic with the inorganic substructures, which leads to a loss of chirality transfer.</description>

      <title>Prominent phonon transmission across aperiodic superlattice through coherent mode-conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both particle and wave descriptions of phonons, the dense, aperiodically arranged interfaces in aperiodic superlattices are expected to strongly attenuate thermal transport due to phonon-interface scattering or broken long-range coherence. However, considerable thermal conductivity is still observed in these structures. In this study, we reveal that incoherent modes propagating in the aperiodic superlattice can convert, through interference, into coherent modes defined by an approximate dispersion relation. This conversion leads to high transmission across the aperiodic superlattice structure, which contains hundreds of interfaces, ultimately resulting in significant thermal conductivity. Such incoherent-to-coherent mode conversion behavior is extensively observed in periodic superlattices. This work suggests an effective strategy to manipulate the phonon band structure through layer patterning or material choice, enabling precise control of phonon transmission across aperiodic superlattices.</description>

      <title>Structure and crystallization of SiO2 and B2O3 doped lithium disilicate glasses from theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid solutions of SiO2 and B2O3 in Li2O 2SiO2 are synthesized and characterized for the first time. Their structure and crystallization mechanisms are investigated employing a combination of simulations at the density functional theory level and experiments on the crystallization of SiO2 and B2O3 doped lithium disilicate glasses. The remarkable agreement of calculated and experimentally determined cell parameters reveals the preferential, kinetically controlled incorporation of [SiO4] and [BO4] at the Li+ lattice sites of the Li2O 2SiO2 crystal structure. While the addition of SiO2 increases the glass viscosity resulting in lower crystal growth velocities, glasses containing B2O3 show a reduction of both viscosities and crystal growth velocities. These observations could be rationalized by a change of the chemical composition of the glass matrix surrounding the precipitated crystal phase during the course of crystallization, which leads to a deceleration of the attachment of building units required for further crystal growth at the liquid-crystal interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarons are quasiparticles formed as a result of lattice distortions induced by charge carriers. The single-electron Holstein model captures the fundamentals of single polaron physics. We examine the power of the exponential ansatz for the polaron ground-state wavefunction in its coupled cluster, canonical transformation, and (canonically transformed) perturbative variants across the parameter space of the Holstein model. Our benchmark serves to guide future developments of polaron wavefunctions beyond the single-electron Holstein model.</description>

      <title>Encoding innumerable charge density waves of FeGe into polymorphs of LiFe6Ge6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals exhibit rich quantum states by the intertwining of lattice, charge, orbital and spin degrees of freedom. Recently, a novel charge density wave (CDW) ground state was discovered in kagome magnet FeGe and was revealed to be driven by lowering magnetic energy via large Ge1-dimerization. Here, based on DFT calculations, we show that such mechanism will yield infinitely many metastable CDWs in FeGe due to different ways to arrange the Ge1-dimerization in enlarged superstructures. Intriguingly, utilizing these metastable CDWs, innumerable polymorphs of kagome magnet LiFe6Ge6 can be stabilized by filling Li atoms in the voids right above/below the dimerized Ge1-sites in the CDW superstructures. Such polymorphs are very stable due to the presence of magnetic-energy-saving mechanism, in sharp contrast to the non-magnetic "166" kagome compounds. In this way, a one-to-one mapping of the metastable CDWs of FeGe to stable polymorphs of LiFe6Ge6 is established. On one hand, the fingerprints of these metastable CDWs, i.e., the induced in-plane atomic distortions and band gaps, are encoded into the corresponding stable polymorphs of LiFe6Ge6, such that further study of their properties becomes possible. On the other hand, such innumerable polymorphs of LiFe6Ge6 offer great degrees of freedom to explore the rich physics of magnetic kagome metals. We thus reveal a novel connection between the unusually abundant CDWs and structural polymorphism in magnetic kagome materials, and establish a new route to obtain structural polymorphism on top of CDW states.</description>

      <title>Isovalent alloying assisted anomalous valley Hall effect in hexagonal antiferromagnetic monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring combination of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics and anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) is one of the most important questions for valleytronic applications. The key to address this issue is to achieve spin splitting around the valleys in AFM systems. Here, we propose a possible way for achieving AVHE in hexagonal AFM monolayer, which involves the isovalent alloying. This can break the combined symmetry ($PT$ symmetry) of spatial inversion ($P$) and time reversal ($T$), giving rise to spin splitting. More specifically, the large spin splitting around the Fermi energy level owes to $d$ orbital mismatch among these different transition metal ions. Based on first-principles calculations, the proposed way can be verified in out-of-plane AFM $\mathrm{CrMoC_2S_6}$ monolayer, which possesses spontaneous valley polarization and spitting splitting, providing possibility to realize AVHE. It is also proved that tensile strain can strengthen the valley splitting and maintain the out-of-plane AFM ordering. Our works provide an experimentally feasible way for developing AFM valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Control of Molecular Charge State in a Single-Component 2D Organic Nanoarray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dots (QD) with electric-field-controlled charge state are promising for electronics applications, e.g., digital information storage, single-electron transistors and quantum computing. Inorganic QDs consisting of semiconductor nanostructures or heterostructures often offer limited control on size and composition distribution, as well as low potential for scalability and/or nanoscale miniaturization. Owing to their tunability and self-assembly capability, using organic molecules as building nano-units can allow for bottom-up synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) nanoarrays of QDs. However, 2D molecular self-assembly protocols are often applicable on metals surfaces, where electronic hybridization and Fermi level pinning can hinder electric-field control of the QD charge state. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a single-component self-assembled 2D array of molecules [9, 10-dicyanoanthracene (DCA)] that exhibit electric-field-controlled spatially periodic charging on a noble metal surface, Ag(111). The charge state of DCA can be altered (between neutral and negative), depending on its adsorption site, by the local electric field induced by a scanning tunneling microscope tip. Limited metal-molecule interactions result in an effective tunneling barrier between DCA and Ag(111) that enables electric-field-induced electron population of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and hence charging of the molecule. Subtle site-dependent variation of the molecular adsorption height translates into a significant spatial modulation of the molecular polarizability, dielectric constant and LUMO energy level alignment, giving rise to a spatially dependent effective molecule-surface tunneling barrier and likelihood of charging. This work offers potential for high-density 2D self-assembled nanoarrays of identical QDs whose charge states can be addressed individually with an electric field.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Promising Alloys for Electrocatalytic CO$_2$ Reduction via Generative Graph Neural Networks Combined with Bird Swarm Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directly generating material structures with optimal properties is a long-standing goal in material design. One of the fundamental challenges lies in how to overcome the limitation of traditional generative models to efficiently explore the global chemical space rather than a small localized space. Herein, we develop a framework named MAGECS to address this dilemma, by integrating the bird swarm algorithm and supervised graph neural network to effectively navigate the generative model in the immense chemical space towards materials with target properties. As a demonstration, MAGECS is applied to design compelling alloy electrocatalysts for CO$_2$ reduction reaction (CO$_2$RR) and works extremely well. Specifically, the chemical space of CO$_2$RR is effectively explored, where over 250,000 promising structures with high activity have been generated and notably, the proportion of desired structures is 2.5-fold increased. Moreover, five predicted alloys, i.e., CuAl, AlPd, Sn$_2$Pd$_5$, Sn$_9$Pd$_7$, and CuAlSe$_2$ are successfully synthesized and characterized experimentally, two of which exhibit about 90% Faraday efficiency of CO$_2$RR, and CuAl achieved 76% efficiency for C$_2$ products. This pioneering application of inverse design in CO$_2$RR catalysis showcases the potential of MAGECS to dramatically accelerate the development of functional materials, paving the way for fully automated, artificial intelligence-driven material design.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Ferroelectricity and Electrically Tunable Berry Curvature Dipole in III-V Monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional ferroelectric monolayers are promising candidates for compact memory devices and flexible electronics. Here, through first-principles calculations, we predict room temperature ferroelectricity in AB-type monolayers comprising group III (A = Al, In, Ga) and group V (B = As, P, Sb) elements. We show that their spontaneous polarization, oriented out-of-plane, ranges from 9.48 to 13.96 pC/m, outperforming most known 2D ferroelectric. We demonstrate electric field tunable Berry curvature dipole and nonlinear Hall current in these monolayers. Additionally, we highlight their applicability in next-generation memory devices by forming efficient ferroelectric tunnel junctions, especially in InP, which supports high tunneling electroresistance. Our findings motivate further exploration of these monolayers for studying the interplay between Berry curvature and ferroelectricity and for integrating these ferroelectric monolayers in next-generation electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Antiferromagnetic Cubic and Ferromagnetic Tetragonal Polymorphs in Epitaxial CuMnSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry shows that epitaxial CuMnSb films exhibit a coexistence of two magnetic phases, coherently intertwined in nanometric scales. The dominant $\alpha$~phase is half-Heusler cubic antiferromagnet with the N\'{e}el temperature of 62~K, the equilibrium structure of bulk CuMnSb. The secondary phase is its ferromagnetic tetragonal $\beta$ polymorph with the Curie temperature of about 100~K. First principles calculations provide a consistent interpretation of experiment, since (i) total energy of $\beta$--CuMnSb is higher than that of $\alpha$--CuMnSb only by 0.12~eV per formula unit, which allows for epitaxial stabilization of this phase, (ii) the metallic character of $\beta$--CuMnSb favors the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida ferromagnetic coupling, and (iii) the calculated effective Curie-Weiss magnetic moment of Mn ions in both phases is about $5.5~\mu_\mathrm{B}$, favorably close to the measured value. Calculated properties of all point native defects indicate that the most likely to occur are $\mathrm{Mn}_\mathrm{Cu}$ antisites. They affect magnetic properties of epilayers, but they cannot induce the ferromagnetic order in CuMnSb. Combined, the findings highlight a practical route towards fabrication of functional materials in which coexisting polymorphs provide complementing functionalities in one host.</description>

      <title>NbSe$_{2}$'s charge density wave collapse in the (LaSe)$_{1.14}$(NbSe$_{2}$)$_{2}$ misfit layer compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misfit layer compounds, heterostructures composed by a regular alternating stacking of rocksalt monochalcogenides bilayers and few-layer transition metal dichalchogenides, are an emergent platform to investigate highly doped transition metal dichalcogenides. Among them, (LaSe)$_{1.14}$(NbSe$_2$)$_2$ displays Ising superconductivity, while the presence of a charge density wave (CDW) in the material is still under debate. Here, by using polarized Raman spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we show that NbSe$_2$ undergoes a doping-driven collapse of the CDW ordering within the misfit, and no signature of the CDW is detected down to 8~K. We provide a complete experimental and theoretical description of the lattice dynamics of this misfit compound. We show that the vibrational properties are obtained from those of the two subunits, namely the LaSe unit and the NbSe$_2$ bilayer, in the presence of a suitable field-effect doping, and then highlight the 2D nature of the lattice dynamics of NbSe$_2$ within the (LaSe)$_{1.14}$(NbSe$_2$)$_2$ 3D structure.</description>

      <title>Predicting Many Properties of Crystals by a Single Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning methods for predicting the properties of crystalline materials encounters significant challenges, primarily related to input encoding, output versatility, and interpretability. Here, we introduce CrystalBERT, an adaptable transformer-based framework with novel structure that integrates space group, elemental, and unit cell information. The method's adaptability lies not only in its ability to seamlessly combine diverse features but also in its capability to accurately predict a wide range of physically important properties, including topological properties, superconducting transition temperatures, dielectric constants, and more. CrystalBERT also provides insightful physical interpretations regarding the features that most significantly influence the target properties. Our findings indicate that space group and elemental information are more important for predicting topological and superconducting properties, in contrast to some properties that primarily depend on the unit cell information. This underscores the intricate nature of topological and superconducting properties. By incorporating all these features, we achieve a high accuracy of 91% in topological classification, surpassing prior studies and identifying previously misclassified topological materials, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our model.</description>

      <title>Duality and degeneracy lifting in two-dimensional electron liquids on SrTiO$_3$(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electron liquids (2DELs) have increasing technological relevance for ultrafast electronics and spintronics, yet significant gaps in their fundamental understanding are exemplified on the prototypical SrTiO$_3$. We correlate the exact SrTiO$_3$(001) surface structure with distinct 2DELs through combined microscopic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and non-contact atomic force microscopy on truly bulk-terminated surfaces that alleviate structural uncertainties inherent to this long-studied system. The SrO termination is shown to develop a 2DEL following the creation of oxygen vacancies, unlike the intrinsically metallic TiO$_2$ termination. Differences in degeneracy of the 2DELs, that share the same band filling and identical band bending, are assigned to polar distortions of the Ti atoms in combination with spin order, supported with the extraction of fundamental electron-phonon coupling strength. These results not only resolve the ambiguities regarding 2DELs on SrTiO$_3$ thus far, but also pave the way to manipulating band filling and spin order in oxide 2DELs in general.</description>

      <title>Classification analysis of transition-metal chalcogenides and oxides using quantum machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) leverages the potential from machine learning to explore the subtle patterns in huge datasets of complex nature with quantum advantages. This exponentially reduces the time and resources necessary for computations. QML accelerates materials research with active screening of chemical space, identifying novel materials for practical applications and classifying structurally diverse materials given their measured properties. This study analyzes the performance of three efficient quantum machine learning algorithms viz., variational quantum eigen solver (VQE), quantum support vector machine (QSVM) and quantum neural networks (QNN) for the classification of transition metal chalcogenides and oxides (TMCs &amp;TMOs). The analysis is performed on three datasets of different sizes containing 102, 192 and 350 materials with TMCs and TMOs labelled as +1 and -1 respectively. By employing feature selection, classical machine learning achieves 100% accuracy whereas QML achieves the highest performance of 99% and 98% for test and train data respectively on QSVC. This study establishes the competence of QML models in materials classification and explores the quantum circuits in terms of over-fitting using the circuit descriptors expressibility and entangling capability. In addition, the perspectives on QML in materials research with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate interface failure of model materials representing architected thin films in contact with heterogeneous substrates. We find that, while systems with statistically isotropic distributions of impurities derive their fracture strength from the ability to develop rough detachment fronts, materials with hierarchical microstructures confine failure near a prescribed surface, where crack growth is arrested and crack surface correlations are suppressed. We develop a theory of network Green's functions for the systems at hand, and we find that the ability of hierarchical microstructures to control failure mode and locations comes at no performance cost in terms of peak stress and specific work of failure and derives from the quenched local anistotropy of the elastic interaction kernel.</description>

      <title>Mechanism and kinetics of sodium diffusion in Na-feldspar from neural network based atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkali diffusion is a first-order control for microstructure and compositional evolution of feldspar during cooling from high temperatures of primary magmatic or metamorphic crystallization, and knowledge of the respective diffusion coefficients is crucial for reconstructing thermal histories. Our understanding of alkali diffusion in feldspar is, however, hindered by an insufficient grasp of the underlying diffusion mechanisms. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of sodium feldspar (Albite) containing different point defects using a recently developed neural network potential. A high degree of agreement between the sodium self-diffusion coefficients obtained from model simulations and those determined experimentally in earlier studies motivated a detailed investigation into the interstitial and vacancy mechanisms, corresponding jump rates, correlation factors and anisotropy. We identified a dumbbell shaped double occupancy of an alkali site as an important point defect and a correlation effect originating from the orientation of the dumbbell as a possible cause for the $\perp\!\!(001) &gt; \, \perp\!\!(010)$ diffusion anisotropy, which has been reported in a slew of feldspar cation diffusion experiments.</description>

      <title>Multiscale simulation of spatially correlated microstructure via a latent space representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When deformation gradients act on the scale of the microstructure of a part due to geometry and loading, spatial correlations and finite-size effects in simulation cells cannot be neglected. We propose a multiscale method that accounts for these effects using a variational autoencoder to encode the structure-property map of the stochastic volume elements making up the statistical description of the part. In this paradigm the autoencoder can be used to directly encode the microstructure or, alternatively, its latent space can be sampled to provide likely realizations. We demonstrate the method on three examples using the common additively manufactured material AlSi10Mg in: (a) a comparison with direct numerical simulation of the part microstructure, (b) a push forward of microstructural uncertainty to performance quantities of interest, and (c) a simulation of functional gradation of a part with stochastic microstructure.</description>

      <title>Revealing Polytypism in 2D Boron Nitride with UV Photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron nitride exhibits diverse crystal structures, predominantly a layered arrangement with strong intraplanar covalent bonds and weak interplanar van der Waals bonds. While commonly referred to as hexagonal BN (hBN), the sp$^2$-bonded BN atomic planes can also arrange in other configurations like Bernal (bBN) or rhombohedral (rBN) stacking orders. Variations in the orientation and translation of successive atomic layers lead to changes in crystal symmetry, potentially resulting in piezoelectric, pyroelectric or ferroelectric effects. However, distinguishing between different polytypes using conventional methods like X-ray diffraction or Raman spectroscopy presents a significant challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that the optical response of the 4.1 eV defect can serve as an indicator of the polytype. To this end, we study BN samples grown by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), which contain different polytypes. The identification of the polytypes was achieved by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence measurements with a high spatial resolution allowed for the deconvolution of the signal into two components from which we can extract a zero-phonon line (ZPL) at 4.096 eV (302.6 nm) for hBN and 4.143 eV (299.2 nm) for rBN. We performed calculations that enable us to identify the defect as a carbon dimer CBCN (C2) and show that the ZPL shift reflects differences in the crystal environment for different polytypes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that different polytypic composition ratios of hBN and rBN can be achieved by MOVPE, which could pave the way for future applications in large-area van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic properties of materials stem from fundamental atomic-scale details, yet for insulators, resolving surface structures remains a challenge. The basal (0001) plane of ${\alpha}$-Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ was imaged with noncontact atomic force microscopy with an atomically-defined tip apex. The surface forms a complex $({\sqrt31} {\times} {\sqrt31})R{\pm}9{\deg}$ reconstruction. The lateral positions of the individual O and Al surface atoms come directly from experiment; how these connect to the underlying crystal bulk was determined based on computational modeling. Before the restructuring, the surface Al atoms assume an unfavorable, threefold planar coordination; the reconstruction allows a rehybridization with subsurface O that leads to a substantial energy gain. The reconstructed surface remains stoichiometric, Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Spin-to-Charge Current Conversion Mechanism and Charge Transfer Dynamics at Interface of Graphene/WS$_2$ Heterostructures at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report experimental investigations of spin-to-charge current conversion and charge transfer dynamics (CT) at the interface of graphene/WS$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure. Pure spin current was produced by the spin precession in the microwave-driven ferromagnetic resonance of a permalloy film (Py-Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$) and injected into the graphene/WS$_2$ heterostructure through the spin pumping process. The observed spin-to-charge current conversion in the heterostructure is attributed to inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect (IREE) at the graphene/WS$_2$ interface. Interfacial CT dynamics in this heterostructure was investigated based on the framework of core-hole-clock (CHC) approach. The results obtained from spin pumping and CHC studies show that the spin-to-charge current conversion and charge transfer process are more efficient in the graphene/WS$_2$ heterostructure compared to isolated WS2 and graphene films. The results show that the presence of WS$_2$ flakes improves the current conversion efficiency. These experimental results are corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal (i) Rashba spin-orbit splitting of graphene orbitals and (ii) electronic coupling between graphene and WS$_2$ orbitals. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing the design and performance of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic compatibility of actives encapsulated into PEG-PLA nanoparticles: In Silico predictions and experimental verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving optimal solubility of active substances in polymeric carriers is of fundamental importance for a number of industrial applications, including targeted drug delivery within the growing field of nanomedicine. However, its experimental optimization using a trial-and-error approach is cumbersome and time-consuming. Here, an approach based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the Flory-Huggins theory is proposed for rapid prediction of thermodynamic compatibility between active species and copolymers comprising hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments. In contrast to similar methods, our approach offers high computational efficiency by employing MD simulations that avoid explicit consideration of the actual copolymer chains. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated for compatibility predictions between pyrene and nile red as model dyes as well as indomethacin as model drug and copolymers containing blocks of poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(lactic acid) in different ratios. The results of the simulations are directly verified by comparison with the observed encapsulation efficiency of nanoparticles prepared by nanoprecipitation.</description>

      <title>Gate-Tunable Multi-Band van der Waals Photodetector and Polarization Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single photodetector with tunable detection wavelengths and polarization sensitivity can potentially be harnessed for diverse optical applications ranging from imaging and sensing to telecommunications. Such a device will require the combination of multiple material systems with different structures, bandgaps, and photoelectrical responses, which is extremely difficult to engineer using traditional epitaxial films. Here, we develop a multi-functional and high-performance photosensor using all van der Waals materials. The device features a gate-tunable spectral response that is switchable between near-infrared/visible and short-/mid-wave infrared, as well as broadband operation, at room temperature. The linear polarization sensitivity in the telecommunications O-band can also be directly modulated between horizontal, vertical, and nonpolarizing modes. These effects originate from the balance of photocurrent generation in two of the active layers that can be manipulated by an electric field. The photodetector features high detectivity (&gt;109 cmHz1/2W-1) together with fast operation speed (~ 1 MHz) and can be further exploited for dual visible and infrared imaging.</description>

      <title>Light-induced topological phase transition with tunable layer Hall effect in axion antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intricate interplay between light and matter provides effective tools for manipulating topological phenomena. Here, we theoretically propose and computationally show that circularly polarized light hold the potential to transform the axion insulating phase into quantum anomalous Hall state in MnBi2Te4 thin films, featuring tunable Chern numbers (ranging up to 2). In particular, we reveal the spatial rearrangement of the hidden layer-resolved anomalous Hall effect under light driven Floquet-engineering. Notably, upon Bi2Te3 layer intercalation, the anomalous Hall conductance predominantly localizes in the nonmagnetic Bi2Te3 layers that hold zero Berry curvature in the intact state, suggesting significant magnetic proximity effect. Additionally, we estimate variations in the magneto-optical Kerr effect, giving a contactless method for detecting topological transitions. Our work not only presents a strategy to investigate emergent topological phases, but also sheds light on the possible applications of the layer Hall effect in topological antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>DFT+U+V Study of Magnetic Ordering in Single-Layer Pentahexoctite: Implications for Magnetic Device Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of single-layer pentahexoctite, a two-dimensional carbon allotrope patterned by pentagons, hexagons, and octagons. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations incorporating on-site and intersite Coulomb interactions, we find that type-II Dirac Fermions are formed by a nearly flat band intersecting with a dispersive band at the Fermi level. We further examine the physical origin of nearly flat bands of pentahexoctite. Constructing ab initio tight-binding Hamiltonian based on Wannier functions, we reveal that nearly flat bands of pentahexoctite originate from quantum-mechanical destructive interference. Remarkably, our DFT calculations including extended Hubbard interactions show that hole doping induces a ferrimagnetic phase transition driven by the enhanced density of states in the nearly flat band. This finding highlights that monolayer pentahexoctite is a promising candidate for pristine all-carbon magnetic materials to serve as a platform for future magnetic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Shot noise in a metal close to Mott transition</title>

Abstract: SrIrO$_3$ is a metallic complex oxide with unusual electronic and magnetic properties believed to originate from electron correlations due to its proximity to Mott metal-insulator transition. However, the nature of its electronic state and the mechanism of metallic conduction remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that shot noise produced by nanoscale SrIrO$_3$ junctions is strongly suppressed, inconsistent with diffusive quasiparticle transport. Analysis of thermal effects and scaling with the junction length reveals that conduction is mediated by collective hopping of electrons almost localized by correlations. Our results provide insight into the non-Fermi liquid state close to Mott transition, and advance shot noise measurements as a powerful technique for the studies of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Towards an exact electronic quantum many-body treatment of Kondo correlation in magnetic impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kondo effect is a prototypical quantum phenomenon arising from the interaction between localized electrons in a magnetic impurity and itinerant electrons in a metallic host. Although it has served as the testing ground for quantum many-body methods for decades, the precise description of Kondo physics with material specificity remains challenging. Here, we present a systematic ab initio approach to converge towards an exact zero-temperature electronic treatment of Kondo correlations. Across a series of 3d transition metals, we extract Kondo temperatures matching the subtle experimental trends, with an accuracy far exceeding that of standard models. We further obtain microscopic insight into the origin of these trends. More broadly, we demonstrate the possibility to start from fully ab initio many-body simulations and push towards the realm of converged predictions.</description>

      <title>Effects of alloying elements on carbon diffusion in the austenite (f.c.c.) and ferrite (b.c.c.) phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TThe effects of alloying elements on diffusion pathways and migration energies of interstitial carbon in austenite (f.c.c.) and ferrite (b.c.c.) are studied using density functional theory first-principles calculations. The binding energies between carbon and alloying elements are determined through 6th nearest-neighbor (NN) distances. The elements studied are Ni, Mo, V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Al, Ti, and Si, relevant to most high-strength steels. Nickel, Mn, Al, and Si have repulsive binding energies; Mo, V, Cr, Cu, and Ti have attractive binding energies in austenite and ferrite. Alloying elements at 1st NN sites of a C atom in an octahedral site introduce asymmetry into the minimum energy diffusion pathway, causing up to about 1 eV changes in saddle-point energies. This pathway goes from one octahedral site to another via intermediate energy states, differing for austenite and ferrite. We find that the elements with attractive binding energies increase the energy barrier for C migration resulting in decelerated carbon diffusion, while the elements with repulsive binding energies decrease the energy barrier for C migration leading to accelerated C diffusion. The magnitude of changes in C migration energies is proportional to the binding energies between C and alloying elements. Among the three austenite stabilizers, Ni and Mn are C diffusion accelerators, while Cu decelerates C diffusion in austenite. Among the four ferrite stabilizers, Si is a C diffusion accelerator, while V and Ti serve as C diffusion decelerators in ferrite. Aluminum has no significant effect on C's diffusivity, while Mo and Cr decelerate C diffusion.</description>

      <title>Computing the thermal transport coefficient of neutral amorphous polymers using exact vibrational density of states: Comparison with experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal transport coefficient $\kappa$ is an important property that often dictates broad applications of a polymeric material, while at the same time its computation remains challenging. In particular, classical simulations overestimate $\kappa$ than the experimentally measured $\kappa^{\rm exp}$ and thus hinder their meaningful comparison. This is even when very careful simulations are performed using the most accurate empirical potentials. A key reason for such a discrepancy is because polymers have quantum--mechanical, nuclear degrees--of--freedom whose contribution to the heat balance is non--trivial. In this work, two semi--analytical approaches are considered to accurately compute $\kappa$ by using the exact vibrational density of states $g(\nu)$. The first approach is based within the framework of the minimum thermal conductivity model, while the second uses computed quantum heat capacity to scale $\kappa$. Computed $\kappa$ of a set of commodity polymers compares quantitatively with $\kappa^{\rm exp}$.</description>

      <title>Multipacting mitigation by atomic layer deposition: the case study of Titanium Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of Atomic Layer deposition (ALD) to mitigate multipacting phenomena inside superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities used in particle accelerators. The unique ALD capability to control the film thickness down to the atomic level on arbitrary complex shape objects enable the fine tuning of TiN film resistivity and total electron emission yield (TEEY) from coupons to devices. This level of control allows us to adequately choose a TiN film thickness that provide both a high resistivity to prevent Ohmic losses and low TEEY to mitigate multipacting for the application of interest. The methodology presented in this work can be scaled to other domain and devices subject to RF fields in vacuum and sensitive to multipacting or electron discharge processes with their own requirements in resistivities and TEEY values</description>

Abstract: A codimension-two spiral spin-liquid is a correlated paramagnetic state with one-dimensional ground state degeneracy hosted within a three-dimensional lattice. Here, via neutron scattering experiments and numerical simulations, we establish the existence of a codimension-two spiral spin-liquid in the effective honeycomb-lattice compound Cs$_3$Fe$_2$Cl$_9$ and demonstrate the selective visibility of the spiral surface through phase tuning. In the long-range ordered regime, competing spiral and spin density wave orders emerge as a function of applied magnetic field, among which a possible order-by-disorder transition is identified.</description>

      <title>Cephalo: Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models for Bio-Inspired Materials Analysis and Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Cephalo, a series of multimodal vision large language models (V-LLMs) designed for materials science applications, integrating visual and linguistic data for enhanced understanding and interaction within human-AI and multi-agent AI frameworks. A key innovation of Cephalo is its advanced dataset generation method, which employs a sophisticated algorithm to accurately detect and separate images and their corresponding textual descriptions from PDF documents, such as scientific papers. The method includes a careful refinement of image-text pairs through integrated vision and language processing, ensuring high-quality, contextually relevant, and well reasoned training data. Cephalo is trained on integrated image and text data extracted from thousands of scientific papers and science-focused Wikipedia pages demonstrates can interpret complex visual scenes, generate precise language descriptions, and answer queries about images effectively. The combination of a vision encoder with an autoregressive transformer supports complex natural language understanding in an integrated model, which can be coupled with other generative methods to create an image-to-text-to-image or image-to-text-to-3D pipeline. To explore the development of larger models from smaller ones, we merge sets of layers that originate from different pre-trained source models. This hybrid approach allows us to leverage the domain-specific expertise and general conversational capabilities to harness the strengths of multiple models. We examine the models in diverse use cases that incorporate biological materials, fracture and engineering analysis, protein biophysics, and bio-inspired design based on insect behavior. Generative applications include bio-inspired designs, including pollen-inspired architected materials, as well as the synthesis of bio-inspired material microstructures from a photograph of a solar eclipse.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking topological insulator-based photodetector: Photo-induced excess noise and role of barrier height inhomogeneity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) with symmetry-protected surface states, offer exciting opportunities for next-generation photonic and optoelectronic device applications. The heterojunctions of TIs and semiconductors (e.g. Si, Ge) have been observed to excellent photo-responsive characteristics. However, the realization of high-frequency operations in these heterojunctions can be hindered by unwanted 1/f (or Flicker) noise and phase noise. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of 1/f noise figures becomes paramount for the effective utilization of such materials.Here we report optoelectronic response and 1/f noise characteristics of a p-n diode fabricated using topological insulator, Bi2Se3 and silicon for potential photo-detector. Through meticulous temperature-dependent current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements, we ascertain crucial parameters like barrier height, ideality factor, and reverse saturation current of the photodetector. The low-frequency 1/f conductance noise spectra suggest a significant presence of trap states influencing the optoelectronic transport properties. The forward noise characteristics exhibit typical 1/f features, having a uni-slope across four decades of frequency, suggesting a homogeneous distribution of barrier height. The spectral and photocurrent-dependent responses show the power law behavior of noise level on photon flux. The hybrid heterojunction demonstrates excellent photo-response and reasonably low noise level, promising signatures for the room-temperature visible photodetector applications.</description>

      <title>Signatures of a Charge Ice State in the Doped Mott Insulator Nb$_3$Cl$_8$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between strong electronic correlations and the inherent frustration of certain lattice geometries is a common mechanism for the formation of nontrivial states of matter. In this work, we theoretically explore the collective electronic effects in the monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, a recently discovered triangular lattice Mott insulator. Our advanced many-body numerical simulations predict the emergence of a phase separation region upon doping this material. Notably, in close proximity to the phase separation, the static charge susceptibility undergoes a drastic change and reveals a distinctive bow-tie structure in momentum space. The appearance of such a signature in the context of spin degrees of freedom would indicate the formation of a spin ice state. This finding allows us to associate the observed phase separation to a charge ice state, a state with a remarkable power-law dependence of both the effective exchange interaction and correlations between electronic densities in real space.</description>

      <title>Origin of the density wave instability in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 revealed by optical and ultrafast spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we employed optical spectroscopy and ultrafast reflectivity measurements to investigate the density wave instability of trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 at ambient pressure. Our optical spectroscopy measurements indicate that La4Ni3O10 is metallic with a large plasma frequency at room temperature. As the temperature decreases, we observe the formation of an energy gap in reflectivity below TDW, signaling the charge/spin density wave transition. The Drude component was largely removed due to the gap opening in the Fermi surface. Our Drude-Lorentz analysis reveals that the energy gap in La4Ni3O10 is approximately 61 meV, which is three times larger than that obtained from ARPES measurements. The density wave gap feature is more prominent than that observed in bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7, suggesting more carriers are gapped at the Fermi surface across the density wave transition. By comparing the measured plasma frequency with the first-principles calculation, we categorize La4Ni3O10 as a moderately electronic correlation material, similar to the parent compound of iron-based superconductors, however, being weaker than the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7. Our ultrafast pump-probe experiments also show that the relaxation time diverges near the transition temperature. By analyzing the amplitude and relaxation time with the Rothwarf-Taylor model, we estimate the energy gap to be 58 meV, which agrees with the result of optical spectroscopy. The more prominent gap feature and weaker electronic correlation might be the cause of a lower superconductivity transition temperature in La4Ni3O10 under high pressure. These findings significantly contribute to understanding the origin of density wave and superconductivity in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation-Driven Hysteretic Adhesion and Repulsion between Opposing Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface interactions mediated by polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes has been of great significance in biotechnology and nanotechnology including lubrication of skeletal joints, protein-coated surfaces, and stabilization of nanoparticles. The addition of salt ions is an important tool to modulate the morphology and mechanical properties of PE brushes. In this work, the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory we previously developed is applied to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts that adding a small amount of trivalent ions can lead to a hysteretic feature of the force profile: repulsion in the compression and adhesion in the separation. Coexistence of two collapsed modes of PE brushes induced by strong ion correlations can be obtained, clearly elucidating the molecular origin of the hysteretic force. Furthermore, trivalent ions with larger radius induce less pronounced ion correlation, leading to stronger repulsion in the compression and weaker adhesion in the separation. Our results are in good agreement with the experiments reported by Tirrell group.</description>

Abstract: Monolayer graphene absorbs 2.3 percent of the incident visible light. This 'small' absorption has been used to emphasize the visual transparency of graphene, but it in fact means that multilayer graphene absorbs a sizable fraction of incident light, which causes non-negligible fluorescence. In this paper, we formulate the light emission properties of multilayer graphene composed of tens to hundreds of layers using a transfer matrix method and confirm the method's validity experimentally. We could quantitatively explain the measured contrasts of multilayer graphene on SiO$_2$/Si substrates and found sizable corrections, which cannot be classified as incoherent light emissions, to the reflectance of visible light. The new component originates from coherent emission caused by absorption at each graphene layer. Multilayer graphene thus functions as a partial coherent light source of various wavelengths, and it may have surface-emitting laser applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New highly oxygen-active materials may enhance many energy-related technologies by enabling efficient oxygen-ion transport at lower temperatures, e.g., below 400 Celsius. Interstitial oxygen conductors have the potential to realize such performance but have received far less attention than vacancy-mediated conductors. Here, we combine physically-motivated structure and property descriptors, ab initio simulations, and experiments to demonstrate an approach to discover new fast interstitial oxygen conductors. Multiple new families were found which adopt completely different structures from known oxygen conductors. From these families, we synthesized and studied oxygen kinetics in La4Mn5Si4O22+d (LMS), a representative member of perrierite/chevkinite family. We found LMS has higher oxygen ionic conductivity than the widely used yttria-stabilized ZrO2, and among the highest surface oxygen exchange rates at intermediate temperature of known materials. The fast oxygen kinetics is the result of simultaneously active interstitial and interstitialcy diffusion pathways. This work developed and demonstrated a powerful approach for discovering new families of interstitial oxygen conductors and suggests many more such materials remain to be discovered.</description>

      <title>The role of microstructure in the thermal fatigue of solder joints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal fatigue is a common failure mode in electronic solder joints, yet the role of microstructure is incompletely understood. Here, we quantify the evolution of microstructure and damage in Sn-3Ag-0.5Cu joints throughout a ball grid array (BGA) package using EBSD mapping of localised subgrains, recrystallisation and heavily coarsened Ag3Sn. We then interpret the results with a multi-scale modelling approach that links from a continuum model at the package/board scale through to a crystal plasticity finite element model at the microstructure scale. We measure and explain the dependence of damage evolution on (i) the beta-Sn crystal orientation(s) in single and multigrain joints, and (ii) the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between tin grains in cyclic twinned multigrain joints. We further explore the relative importance of the solder microstructure versus the joint location in the array. The results provide a basis for designing optimum solder joint microstructures for thermal fatigue resistance.</description>

      <title>Physics-based material parameters extraction from perovskite experiments via Bayesian optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11101v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to extract material parameters of perovskite from quantitative experimental analysis is essential for rational design of photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. However, the difficulty of this analysis increases significantly with the complexity of the theoretical model and the number of material parameters for perovskite. Here we use Bayesian optimization to develop an analysis platform that can extract up to 8 fundamental material parameters of an organometallic perovskite semiconductor from a transient photoluminescence experiment, based on a complex full physics model that includes drift-diffusion of carriers and dynamic defect occupation. An example study of thermal degradation reveals that the carrier mobility and trap-assisted recombination coefficient are reduced noticeably, while the defect energy level remains nearly unchanged. The reduced carrier mobility can dominate the overall effect on thermal degradation of perovskite solar cells by reducing the fill factor, despite the opposite effect of the reduced trap-assisted recombination coefficient on increasing the fill factor. In future, this platform can be conveniently applied to other experiments or to combinations of experiments, accelerating materials discovery and optimization of semiconductor materials for photovoltaics and other applications.</description>

Abstract: We present an exploration of the effect of electron-phonon coupling and broken inversion symmetry on the electronic and thermal properties of the semimetal LaRhGe$_3$. Our transport measurements reveal evidence for electron-hole compensation at low temperatures, resulting in a large magnetoresistance of 3000% at 1.8 K and 14 T. The carrier concentration is on the order of $10^{21}\rm{/cm}^3$ with high carrier mobilities of $2000~\rm{cm}^2/\rm{Vs}$. When coupled to our theoretical demonstration of symmetry-protected $\textit{almost movable}$ Weyl nodal lines, we conclude that LaRhGe$_3$ supports a Weyl semimetallic state. We discover superconductivity in this compound with a $T_{\text c}$ of 0.39(1) K and $B_{\rm{c}}(0)$ of 2.2(1) mT, with evidence from specific heat and transverse-field muon spin relaxation. We find an exponential dependence in the normal state electrical resistivity below $\sim50$ K, while Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity measurements each reveal a prominent peak at low temperatures, indicative of strong electron-phonon interactions. To this end, we examine the temperature-dependent Raman spectra of LaRhGe$_3$ and find that the lifetime of the lowest energy $A_1$ phonon is dominated by phonon-electron scattering instead of anharmonic decay. We conclude that LaRhGe$_3$ has strong electron-phonon coupling in the normal state, while the superconductivity emerges from weak electron-phonon coupling. These results open up the investigation of electron-phonon interactions in the normal state of superconducting non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Parameter identification and uncertainty propagation of hydrogel coupled diffusion-deformation using POD-based reduced-order modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores reduced-order modeling for analyzing the time-dependent diffusion-deformation of hydrogels. The full-order model describing hydrogel transient behavior consists of a coupled system of partial differential equations in which chemical potential and displacements are coupled. This system is formulated in a monolithic fashion and solved using the finite element method. We employ proper orthogonal decomposition as a model order reduction approach. The reduced-order model performance is tested through a benchmark problem on hydrogel swelling and a case study simulating co-axial printing. Then, we embed the reduced-order model into an optimization loop to efficiently identify the coupled problem's material parameters using full-field data. Finally, a study is conducted on the uncertainty propagation of the material parameter.</description>

      <title>Spin Symmetry in Thermally-Assisted-Occupation Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For electronic systems with multi-reference (MR) character, Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) with the conventional exchange-correlation (xc) energy functionals can lead to incorrect spin densities and related properties. For example, for H2 dissociation, the spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted solutions obtained with the same xc energy functional in KS-DFT can be distinctly different, yielding the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking effects in the spin-unrestricted solutions. Recently, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) has been shown to resolve the aforementioned spin-symmetry breaking, when the fictitious temperature is properly chosen. In this work, a response theory based on TAO-DFT is developed to demonstrate that TAO-DFT with a sufficiently large fictitious temperature can always resolve the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking in MR systems. To further support this, TAO-DFT calculations with various fictitious temperatures are performed for the dissociation of H2, N2, He2, and Ne2 as well as the twisted ethylene.</description>
