      <title>Navigating the Landscape of Reproducible Research: A Predictive Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reproducibility of scientific articles is central to the advancement of science. Despite this importance, evaluating reproducibility remains challenging due to the scarcity of ground truth data. Predictive models can address this limitation by streamlining the tedious evaluation process. Typically, a paper's reproducibility is inferred based on the availability of artifacts such as code, data, or supplemental information, often without extensive empirical investigation. To address these issues, we utilized artifacts of papers as fundamental units to develop a novel, dual-spectrum framework that focuses on author-centric and external-agent perspectives. We used the author-centric spectrum, followed by the external-agent spectrum, to guide a structured, model-based approach to quantify and assess reproducibility. We explored the interdependencies between different factors influencing reproducibility and found that linguistic features such as readability and lexical diversity are strongly correlated with papers achieving the highest statuses on both spectrums. Our work provides a model-driven pathway for evaluating the reproducibility of scientific research. The code, methods, and artifacts for our study are publicly available at: https://github.com/reproducibilityproject/NLRR/</description>

      <title>New paper-by-paper classification for Scopus based on references reclassified by the origin of the papers citing them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reference-based classification system for individual Scopus publications is presented which takes into account the categories of the papers citing those references instead of the journals in which those cited papers are published. It supports multiple assignments of up to 5 categories within the Scopus ASJC structure, but eliminates the Multidisciplinary Area and the miscellaneous categories, and it allows for the reclassification of a greater number of publications (potentially 100%) than traditional reference-based systems. Twelve variants of the system were obtained by adjusting different parameters, which were applied to the more than 3.2 million citable papers from the active Scientific Journals in 2020 indexed in Scopus. The results were analyzed and compared with other classification systems such as the original journal-based Scopus ASJC, the 2-generation-reference based M3-AWC-0.8 (\'Alvarez-Llorente et al., 2024), and the corresponding authors' assignment based AAC (\'Alvarez-Llorente et al., 2023). The different variants obtained of the classification give results that improve those used as referents in multiple scientometric fields. The variation called U1-F-0.8 seems especially promising due to its restraint in assigning multiple categories, consistency with reference classifications and the fact of applying normalization processes to avoid the overinfluence of articles that have a greater number of references.</description>

      <title>Metrics to Detect Small-Scale and Large-Scale Citation Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Citation counts and related metrics have pervasive uses and misuses in academia and research appraisal, serving as scholarly influence and recognition measures. Hence, comprehending the citation patterns exhibited by authors is essential for assessing their research impact and contributions within their respective fields. Although the h-index, introduced by Hirsch in 2005, has emerged as a popular bibliometric indicator, it fails to account for the intricate relationships between authors and their citation patterns. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in cases where citations are strategically employed to boost the perceived influence of certain individuals or groups, a phenomenon that we term "orchestration". Orchestrated citations can introduce biases in citation rankings and therefore necessitate the identification of such patterns. Here, we use Scopus data to investigate orchestration of citations across all scientific disciplines. Orchestration could be small-scale, when the author him/herself and/or a small number of other authors use citations strategically to boost citation metrics like h-index; or large-scale, where extensive collaborations among many co-authors lead to high h-index for many/all of them. We propose three orchestration indicators: extremely low values in the ratio of citations over the square of the h-index (indicative of small-scale orchestration); extremely small number of authors who can explain at least 50% of an author's total citations (indicative of either small-scale or large-scale orchestration); and extremely large number of co-authors with more than 50 co-authored papers (indicative of large-scale orchestration). The distributions, potential thresholds based on 1% (and 5%) percentiles, and insights from these indicators are explored and put into perspective across science.</description>

      <title>SUS-Lib: An automated tool for usability evaluation based on the Software Usability Scale from user feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Usability evaluation has received considerable attention from both the research and practice communities. While there are many evaluation tools available, the Software Usability Scale (SUS) is the most widely used. In this paper, we introduce and describe the SUS-Lib software package, which aims to compute SUS scores and generate graphical figures based on user input. SUS-Lib responds to the need for user-friendly software that requires only basic knowledge and skills of the Python environment and command line tools. By using open source solutions and low hardware resources, SUS-Lib is a cost-effective solution. In addition, due to its generic nature, SUS-Lib can also be used in different research setups and settings.</description>
