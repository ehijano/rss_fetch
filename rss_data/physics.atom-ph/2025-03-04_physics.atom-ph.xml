      <title>Electron-positron pair production in bound-bound muon transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explored a distinct mechanism for matter creation via electron-positron pair production during bound-bound transitions in the deexcitation of one-muon ions. For ions with nuclear charges $Z\geq24$, transitions from low-lying excited states to the 1s-muon state can lead to the production of electron-positron pairs. We show that the Breit interaction determines the transition probabilities for states with nonzero orbital momentum. Although the $2s$ state is metastable, pair production arises mainly from the decay of the $2p$ states. Thus, the Breit interaction governs electron-positron pair production in bound-bound muon transitions. This process offers a unique opportunity to explore quantum electrodynamics in strong fields, as well as a class of nonradiative transitions involving electron-positron pair production.</description>

      <title>Extracting RABBITT-like phase information from time-dependent transient absorption spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how the spectral phase of atto\-second pulse trains influences the optical cross section in transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The interaction of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and time-delayed near-infrared (NIR) fields with an atomic or molecular system governs the dynamics. As already shown in RABBITT experiments, the spectral phase of the XUV pulses can be extracted from the photoionization spectrum as a function of the time delay. Similarly, this XUV phase imprints itself on delay-dependent optical cross-section oscillations. With a perturbative analytical approach and by simulating the quantum dynamics both in a few-level model and via solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for atomic hydrogen, we reveal the similarity between the spectral phase in RABBITT and TA spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Light-controlled strong coupling of optical cavity modes spaced by 200 THz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavities have driven significant advances in optical physics and quantum science, with applications ranging from lasers and spectroscopy to quantum information processing, simulation and metrology. For standard optical cavities, each eigenmode corresponds to a single, well-defined frequency. Here, we present a macroscopic optical Fabry-P\'erot cavity whose eigenmodes are coherent superpositions of two frequency modes in the VIS-NIR range. Specifically, we demonstrate strong coupling between 384 THz (780 nm) and 580 THz (516 nm) cavity modes by incorporating an intracavity $\chi^{(2)}$ crystal driven by a non-resonant optical pump at 1529 nm. Strong coupling enables us to demonstrate frequency conversion with an end-to-end, free-space conversion efficiency of 30(1)%, limited by current cavity design and internal cavity losses. We also demonstrate coupling between distinct spatial modes at the two frequencies, extending coherent control to the spatial basis. In conjunction with improved resonator design and low-loss nonlinear crystals, we anticipate a factor of $&gt;$50 increase in two-mode-cooperativity for stronger coupling and near-unity conversion efficiency at low pump powers. This platform opens new avenues for cavity-QED experiments, with potential applications spanning cavity-mediated interactions between distinct atomic species, interconnects for quantum networking and modular computing, and spatially multimode cavity physics.</description>

      <title>A neural-network-based Python package for performing large-scale atomic CI using pCI and other high-performance atomic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern atomic physics applications in science and technology pose ever higher demands on the precision of computations of properties of atoms and ions. Especially challenging is the modeling of electronic correlations within the configuration interaction (CI) framework, which often requires expansions of the atomic state in huge bases of Slater determinants or configuration state functions. This can easily render the problem intractable even for highly efficient atomic codes running on distributed supercomputer systems. Recently, we have successfully addressed this problem using a neural-network (NN) approach [1]. In this work, we present our Python code for performing NN-supported large-scale atomic CI using pCI [2] and other high-performance atomic codes.

      <title>Microcell CPT atomic clock using laser current-actuated power modulation with 10$^{-12}$ range stability at 1 day</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coherent-population trapping (CPT) microcell atomic clock using symmetric auto-balanced Ramsey (SABR) spectroscopy. The pulsed SABR sequence is applied through direct current-based power modulation of the vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser, eliminating the need for an external optical shutter and enabling compatibility with fully-integrated clocks. The sequence is controlled by a single FPGA-based digital electronics board. A key aspect of proper clock operation was the implementation of a real-time tracking of the atomic signal detection window. The clock frequency dependence on laser power, microwave power, laser frequency, and timing of the detection window has been measured, obtaining sensitivity coefficients lower than those obtained with Ramsey-CPT spectroscopy. The Allan deviation of the SABR-CPT clock, based on a microfabricated cell with low-permeation glass windows, is 1.1~$\times$~10$^{-9}$ at 1~s and averages down to the low 10$^{-12}$ range at 1 day integration time. These results pave the way towards the development of Ramsey-CPT chip-scale atomic clocks with enhanced timekeeping performances.</description>

      <title>An Accessible Formulation for Defining the SI Second Based on Multiple Atomic Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel formulation for a redefinition of the second based on the weighted arithmetic mean of multiple normalized frequencies. We demonstrate that it is mathematically equivalent to the previously discussed implementation employing a geometric mean. In our reformulation, the normalization of frequencies provides the defining constants with immediate physical meaning, while maintaining the decoupling of assigned weights from the frequencies of the reference transitions. We believe that a definition based on this formulation would be significantly more accessible to both experts and non-specialists, enhancing understanding and facilitating broader acceptance. We hope that this approach will help overcome barriers to the adoption of a redefinition that effectively values all state-of-the-art atomic clocks.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive review on developments of synthetic dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of synthetic dimensions has emerged as a powerful framework in photonics and atomic physics, enabling the exploration of high-dimensional physics beyond conventional spatial constraints. Originally developed for quantum simulations in high dimensions, synthetic dimensions have since demonstrated advantages in designing novel Hamiltonians and manipulating quantum or optical states for exploring topological physics, and for applications in computing and information processing. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of progress in synthetic dimensions across photonic, atomic, and other physical platforms over the past decade. We showcase different approaches used to construct synthetic dimensions and highlight key physical phenomena enabled by the advantage of such a framework. By offering a unified perspective on developments in this field, we aim to provide insights into how synthetic dimensions can bridge fundamental physics and applied technologies, fostering interdisciplinary engagement in quantum simulation, atomic and photonic engineering, and information processing.</description>

      <title>Tracking chirality in photoelectron circular dichroism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) it is generally difficult to trace how and when the chirality of the molecule is imprinted onto the photoelectron. We present simulations of PECD in a simple model and employ chirality measures to establish a quantitative connection between the chirality of the potential, the electronic wave function's chirality, and the anisotropy of the photoelectron distribution. We show that these measures are suitable indicators for chirality, paving the way for tracking the chiral evolution from the nuclear scaffold to the final observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The differential probability of the process of Compton ionization of a hydrogen atom by a cylindrical electromagnetic wave is calculated taking into account the finite size of the target, which resulted in the appearance of a dependence of this value on the angular momentum of the cylindrical wave. It is shown that the use of a cylindrical wave instead of a plane wave does not lead to new angular distributions of the reaction products.</description>

      <title>Interference of photons from independent hot atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coherence of light from independent ensembles of elementary atomic emitters plays a paramount role in diverse areas of modern optics. We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. relies on the feasibility of the preservation of coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. Presented interferometry promises direct applications in Doppler-free atomic and molecular spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>High-precision measurement of microwave electric field by cavity-enhanced critical behavior in a many-body Rydberg atomic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that the Rydberg criticality in a many-body atomic system can enhance the measurement sensitivity of the microwave electric field by increasing the Fisher information. In our previous work, we proposed and experimentally verified that the Fisher information near the critical point can be increased by more than two orders of magnitude with the Rydberg atoms coupled with an optical cavity compared with that in free space. Here we demonstrate the precision measurement of the microwave electric field by cavity-enhanced critical behavior. We show that the equivalent measurement sensitivity of the microwave electric field can be enhanced by an order of magnitude compared with that in free space. The obtained sensitivity can be enhanced to 2.6 nV/cm/Hz$^{1/2}$.</description>
