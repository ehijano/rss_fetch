      <title>Yin-Yang: Developing Motifs With Long-Term Structure And Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer models have made great strides in generating symbolically represented music with local coherence. However, controlling the development of motifs in a structured way with global form remains an open research area. One of the reasons for this challenge is due to the note-by-note autoregressive generation of such models, which lack the ability to correct themselves after deviations from the motif. In addition, their structural performance on datasets with shorter durations has not been studied in the literature. In this study, we propose Yin-Yang, a framework consisting of a phrase generator, phrase refiner, and phrase selector models for the development of motifs into melodies with long-term structure and controllability. The phrase refiner is trained on a novel corruption-refinement strategy which allows it to produce melodic and rhythmic variations of an original motif at generation time, thereby rectifying deviations of the phrase generator. We also introduce a new objective evaluation metric for quantifying how smoothly the motif manifests itself within the piece. Evaluation results show that our model achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art transformer models while having the advantage of being controllable and making the generated musical structure semi-interpretable, paving the way for musical analysis.

      <title>Unification in the description logic $\mathcal{FL}_\bot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00912v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Description Logics are a formalism used in the knowledge representation, where the knowledge is captured in the form of concepts constructed in a controlled way from a restricted vocabulary. This allows one to test effectively for consistency of and the subsumption between the concepts. Unification of concepts may likewise become a useful tool in analysing the relations between concepts. The unification problem has been solved for the description logics $\mathcal{FL}_0$ and $\mathcal{EL}$. These small logics do not provide any means to express negation. Here we show an algorithm solving unification in $\mathcal{FL}_\bot$, the logic that extends $\mathcal{FL}_0$ with the bottom concept. Bottom allows one to express that two concepts are disjoint. Our algorithm runs in exponential time, with respect to the size of the problem.</description>
