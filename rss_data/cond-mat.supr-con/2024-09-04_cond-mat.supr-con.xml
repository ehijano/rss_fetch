      <title>Nonreciprocal Josephson current through a conical magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductors can form ideal diodes carrying nondissipative supercurrents in the forward direction and dissipative currents in the backward direction. The Josephson diode has proven to be a promising design where the junction between the two superconductors comprises the weakest link and thus provides the dominant mechanism. We here propose a Josephson diode based on a single magnetic material with a conical spin structure. The helical spin rotation produces Rashba-like band splitting inversely proportional to the rotation period. Together with the Zeeman splitting caused by the time-reversal symmetry breaking of the noncoplanar spin texture, this results in a large diode efficiency close to the $0-\pi$ transition of the magnetic Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic evidence for a first-order transition to the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conventional superconducting state may be replaced by another dissipationless state hosting Cooper pairs with a finite momentum, leaving thermodynamic footprints for such a phase transition. Recently, a novel type of finite momentum pairing, so-called orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, has been proposed to occur in spin-orbit coupled superconductors such as bilayer $2\mathrm{H-NbSe_{2}}$. So far, a thermodynamic demonstration, which is key for establishing this exotic phase, has been lacking. Here, we reveal a first-order quantum phase transition to the orbital FFLO state in tunneling spectroscopic measurements on multilayer $2\mathrm{H-NbSe_{2}}$. The phase transition manifests itself as a sudden enhancement of the superconducting gap at an in-plane magnetic field $B_{//}$ well below the upper critical field. Furthermore, this transition shows prominent hysteresis by sweeping $B_{//}$ back and forth and quickly disappears once the magnetic field is tilted away from the sample plane by less than one degree. We obtain a comprehensive phase diagram for the orbital FFLO state and compare it with the theoretical calculation that takes into account the rearrangement of Josephson vortices. Our work elucidates the microscopic mechanism for the emergence of the orbital FFLO state.</description>

      <title>Directly visualizing nematic superconductivity driven by the pair density wave in NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair density wave (PDW) is a distinct superconducting state characterized by a periodic modulation of its order parameter in real space. Its intricate interplay with the charge density wave (CDW) state is a continuing topic of interest in condensed matter physics. While PDW states have been discovered in cuprates and other unconventional superconductors, the understanding of diverse PDWs and their interactions with different types of CDWs remains limited. Here, utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy, we unveil the subtle correlations between PDW ground states and two distinct CDW phases -- namely, anion-centered-CDW (AC-CDW) and hollow-centered-CDW (HC-CDW) -- in 2H-NbSe$_2$. In both CDW regions, we observe coexisting PDWs with a commensurate structure that aligns with the underlying CDW phase. The superconducting gap size, $\Delta(r)$, related to the pairing order parameter is in phase with the charge density in both CDW regions. Meanwhile, the coherence peak height, $H(r)$, qualitatively reflecting the electron-pair density, exhibits a phase difference of approximately $2\pi/3$ relative to the CDW. The three-fold rotational symmetry is preserved in the HC-CDW region but is spontaneously broken in the AC-CDW region due to the PDW state, leading to the emergence of nematic superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Impurity States in Altermagnetic Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetic superconductors hold the potential for novel phenomena, including topological states, finite-momentum superconductivity, as well as promising applications in spintronics. However, an experimental demonstration of the coexistence of these two effects is still lacking. In this work, we propose potential impurities as a way to probe the distinctive properties of altermagnetic superconductors. These impurities induce spin-polarized subgap states that extend along the crystal axes, inheriting the magnetic characteristics of the bulk. When the impurities respect the bulk symmetries, they generate spin-degenerate doublets; otherwise, the degeneracy is lifted. An external magnetic field aligned with the N\'eel vector can tune the energies of the spin components of the subgap states. These components show different spatial extensions that can be measured via local probes, like scanning tunneling microscopy. For certain parameters, the impurity state can induce a local sign change on the order parameter, so-called $\pi$-transition. Lastly, we investigate the interaction between impurities, revealing a position-dependent effective coupling that facilitates the engineering of spin-dependent tunneling. This tunable coupling introduces a new approach for in-situ control of devices critical for quantum information processing and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Universal degradation of high-temperature superconductors due to impurity scattering: predicting the performance loss in fusion magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the change of performance of superconductors under neutron radiation is indispensable for designing compact fusion devices. The favorable enhancement of the critical current caused by flux pinning is separated from the degrading effect of increased scattering of the charge carriers to derive a degradation function from the expected change of the superfluid density (reducing to Homes law in the dirty limit) and the observed increase in flux creep. The degradation turned out to be a universal function of disorder, not depending on the particular tape nor the particle radiation: thermal and/or fast neutrons, as well as 1.2 MeV protons. The universal behavior enables the analysis of changes in flux pinning corrected by the adverse enhancement of scattering. A more reliable prediction of the performance change of coated conductors in a fusion reactor based on proxies for neutrons is anticipated.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Thermal Grooving Effects on Vortex Penetration in Vapor-Diffused Nb3Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Nb3Sn theoretically offers better superconducting RF cavity performance (Q0 and Eacc) to Nb at any given temperature, peak RF magnetic fields consistently fall short of the 400 mT prediction. The relatively rough topography of vapor-diffused Nb3Sn is widely conjectured to be one of the factors that limit the attainable performance of Nb3Sn-coated Nb cavities prepared via Sn vapor diffusion. Here we investigate the effect of coating duration on the topography of vapor-diffused Nb3Sn on Nb and calculate the associated magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors using atomic force microscopy topographies. It is shown that the thermally grooved grain boundaries are major defects which may contribute to a substantial decrease in the achievable accelerating field. The severity of these grooves increases with total coating duration due to the deepening of thermal grooves during the coating process.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. II: Dispersive phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied. The effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by dispersive phonons, with Eliashberg spectral function $\alpha^2 F(\omega)\geq 0$ that is $\propto\omega^2$ for small $\omega&gt;0$ and vanishes for large $\omega$. The Eliashberg function also defines the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda:= 2 \int_0^\infty\frac{\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega$. Setting $\frac{2\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}=: \lambda P^\prime(\omega)$, with $P^\prime(\omega)$ the density of a probability measure $P(d\omega)$ supported in $[0,\overline{\Omega}(P)]$ with $0&lt; \overline{\Omega}(P)$, and assuming as usual that the phase transition between normal and superconductivity coincides with the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, it is shown that $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ is a graph of a function $\Lambda(P,T)$ that is determined by a variational principle: if $(\lambda,P,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{k}(P,T)$, where $\mathfrak{k}(P,T)&gt;0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences. Given $P$, sufficient conditions on $T$ are stated under which the map $T\mapsto \lambda = \Lambda(P,T)$ is invertible. For sufficiently large $\lambda$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c$ as function of $\lambda$ and $P$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $T_c(\lambda,P)$ that converges to $T_c(\lambda,P)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,P)$. It agrees with the asymptotic form $T_c(\lambda,P) \sim C \sqrt{\langle \omega^2\rangle} \sqrt{\lambda}$ valid for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $P$, though with $C\approx 2.034 C_\infty$ where $C_\infty = 0.1827262477...$ is the sharp constant. Here, $\langle\omega^2\rangle := \int_0^\infty \omega^2 P(d\omega)$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. I: The $\gamma$-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the recent reformulation for the Eliashberg theory of superconductivity in terms of a classical interacting Bloch spin chain model, rigorous upper and lower bounds on the critical temperature $T_c$ are obtained for the $\gamma$ model -- a version of Eliashberg theory in which the effective electron-electron interaction is proportional to $(g/|\omega_n-\omega_m|)^{\gamma}$, where $\omega_n-\omega_m$ is the transferred Matsubara frequency, $g&gt;0$ a reference energy, and $\gamma&gt;0$ a parameter. The rigorous lower bounds are based on a variational principle that identifies $(T_c/g)^\gamma$ with the largest (positive) eigenvalue of an explicitly constructed compact, self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{G}(\gamma)$. These lower bounds form an increasing sequence that converges to $T_c(g,\gamma)$. The upper bound on $T_c(g,\gamma)$ is based on fixed point theory, proving linear stability of the normal state for $T$ larger than the upper bound on $T_c(g,\gamma)$.</description>

      <title>Generating Approximate Ground States of Strongly Correlated Quantum Many-Body Systems Through Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most quantum algorithms designed to generate or probe properties of the ground state of a quantum many-body system require as input an initial state with a large overlap with the desired ground state. One approach for preparing such a ground state is Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE). Recent work by [Motta, M., Sun, C., Tan, A.T.K. et al. (2020)] introduced an algorithm -- which we will refer to as Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) -- that shows how ITE can be approximated by a sequence of unitary operators, making QITE potentially implementable on early fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we provide a heuristic study of the capabilities of the QITE algorithm in approximating the ITE of lattice and molecular electronic structure Hamiltonians. We numerically study the performance of the QITE algorithm when provided with a good classical initial state for a large class of systems, some of which are of interest to industrial applications, and check if QITE is able to qualitatively replicate the ITE behavior and improve over a classical mean-field solution. The systems we consider in this work range from one- and two-dimensional lattice systems of various lattice geometries displaying short- and long-range interactions, to active spaces of molecular electronic structure Hamiltonians. In addition to the comparison of QITE and ITE, we explicitly show how imaginary time evolved fermionic Gaussian states can serve as initial states which can be efficiently computed on classical computers and efficiently implemented on quantum computers for generic spin Hamiltonians in arbitrary lattice geometries and dimensions, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Pairing transitions in a Binary Bose Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stable Bardeen-Schrieffer-Cooper (BCS) pairing state of a bosonic system has long been sought theoretically and experimentally. Here we study the BCS state of a binary Bose gas with $s$-wave intra-species repulsions and an inter-species attraction in the mean-field-stable region. We find that above the Bose-Einstein-Condensation (BEC) transtion temperature, there is a phase transtion from the normal state to the BCS state due to inter-species pairing. When the temperature decreases, another phase transtion from the BCS state to the mixture state with both atomic BEC and inter-species pairs occurs. As the temperature is further lowered, the mixuture state is taken over by the BEC state. The phase diagram of this system is presented and experimental implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Lanthanide Intercalation into Graphite Catalyzed by Na</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lanthanides ($Ln$) are notoriously difficult to intercalate into graphite. We investigated the possibility of using Na to catalyze the formation of $Ln$-intercalated graphite and successfully synthesized $Ln$C$_6$ ($Ln$ = Sm, Eu, and Yb) significantly rapidly in high yields. The synthesis process involves the formation of the reaction intermediate NaC$_x$, through the mixing of Na and C, which subsequently reacts with $Ln$ upon heating to form $Ln$C$_6$. Well-sintered $Ln$C$_6$ pellets with low residual Na concentrations ($Ln$:Na = 98:2) were fabricated by the two-step method. The pellets enabled the evaluation of $Ln$C$_6$ by powder X-ray diffraction and electrical resistivity measurements. This study highlights the versatility of the Na-catalyzed method and lays the foundation for the rapid mass production of $Ln$C$_6$, with potential applications in superconducting and rechargeable battery materials.</description>

      <title>Field-free superconducting diode effect in layered superconductor FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), where zero-resistance states appear nonreciprocally during current injection, is receiving tremendous interest in both fundamental and applied physics because the SDE is a novel manifestation of symmetry breaking and enables the creation of a novel diode without energy loss. In particular, magnetic-field-free SDEs have been extensively investigated because of their potential to serve as building blocks for superconducting circuit technology. In this letter, we report the field-free SDE in a layered superconductor, FeSe. Its underlying physics is clarified by systematic controlled experiments to be an interplay of a large thermoelectric response and geometrical asymmetry in FeSe. Our findings can pave a new avenue for the construction of novel material and device platforms utilizing SDEs.</description>

      <title>Highly tunable NbTiN Josephson junctions fabricated with focused helium ion beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a direct writing method for the fabrication of planar Josephson junctions from high quality superconducting niobium titanium nitride (NbTiN) thin films, by creating local disorder using focused He-ion beam irradiation in a helium ion microscope. We show that we can control the suppression of superconductivity in NbTiN as a function of the helium ion beam fluence, enabling us to successfully fabricate Josephson junctions with highly tunable weak links ranging from metallic to insulating phase, due to the continuous nature of the disorder-induced superconductor-insulator transition. We demonstrate the successful fabrication of both SNS and SIS type of devices, and show that we can achieve exceptionally wide range ($\sim$5 orders of magnitude) of critical current densities and junction resistances. The SNS type junctions follow closely the ideal resistively and capacitively shunted junction behavior, have high characteristic voltages up to $\sim$ 1.5\,mV and show Shapiro steps up to very high orders, while the SIS junctions also follow established theories well. The results suggest that junctions fabricated with this method from NbTiN are suitable for a wide range of applications in superconducting electronics because of the excellent mechanical, electrical and microwave properties of NbTiN. In particular, as NbTiN has previously been used to fabricate high quality factor microwave resonators, we see the method as a promising and simple way to realize superconducting qubits and other quantum devices using only a single superconducting film.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, we explore its potential charge and spin instabilities through combined model analysis and first-principles calculations. Taking into account the small charge-transfer nature of high valence nickel, a fully correlated two-cluster model identifies a lattice-coupled charge instability characterized by substantial short-range fluctuations of oxygen holes. This instability is corroborated by density-functional-theory plus $U$ calculations that also reveal a strong tendency towards concurrent antiferromagnetic ordering. The charge, spin, and associated lattice instabilities are significantly suppressed with increasing external pressure, contributing to the emergence of superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Carrier doping is found to effectively suppress these instabilities, suggesting a viable strategy to stabilize a superconducting phase under ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Post-experiment coincidence detection techniques for direct detection of two-body correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16746v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is one challenge to develop experimental techniques for direct detection of the many-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons, which exhibit a variety of unsolved mysteries. In this article, we present a post-experiment coincidence counting method and propose two post-experiment coincidence detection techniques, post-experiment coincidence angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (cARPES) and post-experiment coincidence inelastic neutron scattering (cINS). By coincidence detection of two photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes, the post-experiment coincidence detection techniques can detect directly the two-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons in particle-particle channel or two-spin channel. The post-experiment coincidence detection techniques can be implemented upon the pulse-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experimental apparatus with pulse photon or neutron source. When implemented experimentally, they will be powerful techniques to study the highly esoteric high-temperature superconductivity and the highly coveted quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Correlation-induced Fermi surface evolution and topological crystalline superconductivity in CeRh2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally noncentrosymmetric structures in crystals are attracting much attention owing to emergent phenomena associated with the sublattice degree of freedom. The newly discovered heavy fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ is considered to be an excellent realization of this class. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments recently observed low-energy spectra of electron and hole bands and characteristic Van Hove singularities, stimulating us to explore the electronic correlation effect on the band structure. In this Letter, we theoretically study the electronic state and topological superconductivity from first principles. Owing to the Coulomb repulsion $U$ of Ce 4$f$ electrons, the low-energy band structure is modified in accordance with the experimental result. We show that Fermi surfaces change significantly from a complicated three-dimensional structure to a simple two-dimensional one. Fermi surface formulas for one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants in class D indicate topological crystalline superconductivity protected by the glide symmetry in a broad region for $U$. The classification of superconducting gap structure reveals topologically protected excitation gap and node. Our findings of the correlation-induced evolution of electronic structure provide a basis to clarify the unusual phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ including superconductivity, magnetic order, and quadrupole density wave, and accelerate the search for topological superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Optical properties and electronic correlations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ bilayer nickelates under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the optical properties of La3Ni2O7 bilayer nickelates by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. Convincing agreement with recent experimental ambient-pressure spectra is achieved for U=3eV, which permits tracing the microscopic origin of the characteristic features. Simultaneous consistency with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction suggests the notion of rather moderate electronic correlations in this novel high-Tc superconductor. Oxygen vacancies form predominantly at the inner apical sites and renormalize the optical spectrum quantitatively, while the released electrons are largely accommodated by a defect state. We show that the structural transition occurring under high pressure coincides with a significant enhancement of the Drude weight and a reduction of the out-of-plane interband contribution that act as a fingerprint of the emerging hole pocket. We further calculate the optical spectra for various possible magnetic phases including spin-density waves and discuss the results in the context of experiment. Finally, we investigate the role of the 2-2 versus 1-3 layer stacking and compare the bilayer nickelate to La4Ni3O10, La3Ni2O6, and NdNiO2, unveiling general trends in the optical spectrum as a function of the formal Ni valence in Ruddlesden-Popper versus reduced Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Two-Dimensional Systems with Unconventional Rashba Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05051v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-dimensional systems with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, it is well-known that superconductivity can exhibit mixed spin-singlet and spin-triplet parity, with the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector of spin-triplet pairing aligning parallel to the $\boldsymbol{g}$-vector of Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we propose a model to describe a two-dimensional system with unconventional Rashba bands and investigate its superconducting properties. We demonstrate that the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector of spin-triplet pairing can be either parallel or perpendicular to the $\boldsymbol{g}$-vector of Rashba spin-orbit coupling, depending on the nature of the pairing interaction. We also propose a junction setup to identify the predominant pairing in such two similar pairing channels. Additionally, our model predicts the emergence of a subleading spin-singlet chiral $p$-wave topological superconducting state. Significantly, we find that such unconventional Rashba bands and superconducting pairings can be realized on the surface of certain superconducting topological materials, such as trigonal layered PtBi$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Josephson effect in a fractal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Josephson effect is a hallmark signature of the superconducting state, which, however, has been sparsely explored in non-crystalline superconducting materials. Motivated by this, we consider a Josephson junction consisting of two superconductors with a fractal metallic interlayer, which is patterned as a Sierpi\'nski carpet by removing atomic sites in a self-similar and scale-invariant manner. We here show that the fractal geometry has direct observable consequences on the Josephson effect. In particular, we demonstrate that the form of the supercurrent-magnetic field relation as the fractal generation number increases can be directly related to the self-similar fractal geometry of the normal metallic layer. Furthermore, the maxima of the corresponding diffraction pattern directly encode the self-repeating fractal structure in the course of fractal generation, implying that the corresponding magnetic length directly probes the shortest length scale in the given fractal generation. Our results should motivate future experimental efforts to verify these predictions in designer quantum materials and motivate future pursuits regarding fractal-based SQUID devices.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of anisotropic Cooper pairing in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recently discovered kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs), the superconductivity is intertwined with an unconventional charge density wave order. Its pairing symmetry remains elusive owing to the lack of direct measurement of the superconducting gap in the momentum space. In this letter, utilizing laser-based ultra-high-resolution and low-temperature angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe anisotropic Cooper pairing in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. We detect a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure with an anisotropy over 80% and the gap maximum along the V-V bond direction on a Fermi surface originated from the 3d-orbital electrons of the V kagome lattice. It is in stark contrast to the isotropic superconducting gap structure on the other Fermi surface that is occupied by Sb 5p-orbital electrons. Our observation of the anisotropic Cooper pairing in pristine CsV3Sb5 is fundamental for understanding intertwined orders in the ground state of kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Structured light and induced vorticity in superconductors I: Linearly polarized light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach to use linearly polarized light to imprint superconducting vortices. Within the framework of the generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations we demonstrate the induction of the coherent vortex pairs that are moving in phase with electormagnetic wave oscillations. The overall vorticity of the superconductor remain zero throughout the cycle. Our results uncover rich multiscale dynamics of SC vorticity and suggest new optical applications for various types of structured light. In departure from classical laser printing, the laser printing proposed here can be viewed as quantum print where we induce quantum excitations in the SC liquid.</description>

      <title>Observation of vortex stripes in UTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum vortices are fundamentally important for properties of superconductors. In conventional type-II superconductor they determine the magnetic response of the system and tend to form regular lattices. UTe$_2$ is a recently discovered heavy fermion superconductor exhibiting many anomalous macroscopic behaviors. However, the question whether it has a multicomponent order parameter remains open. Here, we study magnetic properties of UTe$_2$ by employing scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy. We find vortex behavior which is very different from that in ordinary superconductors. We imaged vortices generated by cooling in magnetic field applied along different crystalline directions. While a small out-of-plane magnetic field produces typical isolated vortices, higher field generates vortex stripe patterns which evolve with vortex density. The stripes form at different locations and along different directions in the surface plane when the vortices are crystalized along the crystalline b or c axes. The behavior is reproduced by our simulation based on an anisotropic two-component order parameter. This study shows that UTe$_2$ has a nontrivial disparity of multiple length scales, placing constraints on multicomponent superconductivity. The tendency of vortex stripe formation and their control by external field may be useful in fluxonics applications.</description>

      <title>Influence of disorder on antidot vortex Majorana states in 3D topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulator/superconductor two-dimensional heterostructures are promising candidates for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana modes. In these systems, a vortex pinned by a pre-fabricated antidot in the superconductor can host Majorana zero-energy modes (MZMs), which are exotic quasiparticles that may enable quantum information processing. However, a major challenge is to design devices that can manipulate the information encoded in these MZMs. One of the key factors is to create small and clean antidots, so the MZMs, localized in the vortex core, have a large gap to other excitations. If the antidot is too large or too disordered, the level spacing for the subgap vortex states may become smaller than temperature. In this paper, we numerically investigate the effects of disorder, chemical potential, and antidot size on the subgap vortex spectrum, using a two-dimensional effective model of the topological insulator surface. Our model allows us to simulate large system sizes with vortices up to 1.8 $\mu$m in diameter (with a 6 nm lattice constant). We also compare our disorder model with the transport data from existing experiments. We find that the spectral gap can exhibit a non-monotonic behavior as a function of disorder strength, and that it can be tuned by applying a gate voltage.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared characterization of NbTiN superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors on silicon-on-insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are widely used for detecting individual photons across various wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared range. Recently, there has been increasing interest in enhancing their sensitivity to single photons in the mid-infrared spectrum, driven by applications in quantum communication, spectroscopy and astrophysics. Here, we present our efforts to expand the spectral detection capabilities of U-shaped NbTiN-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, fabricated in a 2-wire configuration on a silicon-on-insulator substrate, into the mid-infrared range. We demonstrate saturated internal detection efficiency extending up to a wavelength of 3.5 {\mu}m for a 5 nm thick and 50 nm wide NbTiN nanowire with a dark count rate less than 10 counts per second at 0.9 K and a rapid recovery time of 4.3 ns. The detectors are engineered for integration on waveguides in a silicon-on-insulator platform for compact, multi-channel device applications.</description>
