      <title>G-KdVNet: ANN-ADM Surrogate for Geophysical KdV Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the impact of the Coriolis constant on the interpretation of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. It introduces an intelligent computing approach, viz., G-KdVNet, to approximate the KdV equation. The Adomian decomposition method (ADM) has been applied to generate the training data for G-KdVNet. When we compared it with benchmark methods, it achieved superior performance, with absolute errors of up to 0.001 for unseen data. Additionally, tabular and graphical representations have been included to offer deeper insights into the effects of the Coriolis parameter.</description>

      <title>The specification approach to equilibrium states for parabolic rational maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the specification and orbit-decomposition approach to equilibrium states for parabolic rational maps of the Riemann Sphere. Our result extends the well-known results on uniqueness of equilibrium states in this setting, notably the results of Denker, Przytycki and Urba\'nski. We extend the class of potentials from H\"older to those with the Bowen property on 'good orbits' and present an improvement on the pressure gap condition. Our pressure gap condition is sharp in the class of potentials we consider. In the family of geometric potentials, our approach gives a simple new proof of uniqueness of equilibrium states up to the phase transition that occurs at the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set. For H\"older potentials, we show that our equilibrium state has positive entropy. This shows a posteriori that our pressure gap is equivalent to the a priori stronger condition that the potential is hyperbolic and this yields strong statistical properties for the equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>The Minary Primitive of Computational Autopoiesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Minary, a computational framework designed as a candidate for the first formally provable autopoietic primitive. Minary represents interacting probabilistic events as multi-dimensional vectors and combines them via linear superposition rather than multiplicative scalar operations, thereby preserving uncertainty and enabling constructive and destructive interference in the range $[-1,1]$. A fixed set of ``perspectives'' evaluates ``semantic dimensions'' according to hidden competencies, and their interactions drive two discrete-time stochastic processes. We model this system as an iterated random affine map and use the theory of iterated random functions to prove that it converges in distribution to a unique stationary law; we moreover obtain an explicit closed form for the limiting expectation in terms of row, column, and global averages of the competency matrix. We then derive exact formulas for the mean and variance of the normalized consensus conditioned on the activation of a given semantic dimension, revealing how consensus depends on competency structure rather than raw input signals. Finally, we argue that Minary is organizationally closed yet operationally open in the sense of Maturana and Varela, and we discuss implications for building self-maintaining, distributed, and parallelizable computational systems that house a uniquely subjective notion of identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this text is to provide a linguistically accessible, but comprehensive introduction into a variety of topics in dynamical systems and its applications. Whilst preliminary knowledge of dynamical systems is useful, it is not essential and readers are only assumed to have familiarity with foundational undergraduate mathematics topics of calculus, linear algebra and rudimentary statistics. A variety of extended topics on recent publications and research activities in the field have been included in the last four chapters, which the interested reader may use as an introduction into further reading. A collection of exercises and questions both theoretical and computational are also included in this text.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov spectrum rigidity and simultaneous linearization for random Anosov diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Lyapunov spectrum rigidity for random walks of expanding maps on unit circle $\mathbb{S}^1$ and Anosov diffeomorphisms on $d$-torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. Let $\nu$ be a probability supported on the set of expanding maps on $\mathbb{S}^1$ or a neighborhood of a generic Anosov automorphisms on $\mathbb{T}^d$. If the Lyapunov spectrum of the $\nu$-stationary SRB-measure coincides with the Lyapunov spectrum of the algebraic action, then we can simultaneously linearize $\nu$ almost every system to an affine action. Moreover, we prove the positive Lyapunov exponent rigidity for random walks of irreducible positive matrices acting on $\mathbb{T}^2$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Interfaces in the Two-Dimensional Wave-Pinning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mass-conserved reaction-diffusion system known as the wave-pinning model, which serves as a minimal framework for describing cell polarity. In this model, the interplay between reaction kinetics and slow diffusion forms a sharp interface that partitions the domain into high- and low-concentration regions. We perform a detailed asymptotic analysis and derive higher-order approximation equations governing the motion of this interface. Our results show that on a fast timescale, the interface evolves via propagating front dynamics, whereas on a slow timescale, it evolves as an area-preserving mean curvature flow. Furthermore, using the derived free boundary problem, we demonstrate that on a significantly slower timescale, an interface whose endpoints lie on the domain boundary drifts along the boundary toward regions of higher curvature. In summary, our analysis reveals that the interface dynamics in the wave-pinning model exhibit a hierarchy of three distinct timescales: wave propagation on a fast timescale, curvature-driven area-preserving evolution on a slow timescale, and motion along the boundary on a significantly slower timescale.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Curve Systems are Exponentially Decaying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite global attractor conjecture for the polynomial case was recently solved by using tree lifting algorithm [1]. It remains unclear how fast the pull back of a curve by a polynomial converges to the attractor. In the paper we introduce the ideas of quick returns and barrier lakes to analyze the combinatorial models of curves. These allow us to settle the question by showing that the complexity of a curve is exponentially decreased under the iteration of the pull back by a polynomial, and therefore, the pull back of a curve is exponentially contracted to the attractor. In particular, it gives an alternative proof of the finite global attractor conjecture for the polynomial case.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory Regimes in a Game-Theoretic Model for Mosquito Population Dynamics under Breeding Site Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mosquito-borne diseases remain a major public-health threat, and the effective control of mosquito populations requires sustained household participation in removing breeding sites. While environmental drivers of mosquito oscillations have been extensively studied, the influence of spontaneous household decision-making on the dynamics of mosquito populations remains poorly understood. We introduce a game-theoretic model in which the fraction of households performing breeding site control evolves through imitation dynamics driven by perceived risks. Household behavior regulates the carrying capacity of the aquatic mosquito stage, creating a feedback between control actions and mosquito population growth. For a simplified model with constant payoffs, we characterize four locally stable equilibria, corresponding to full or no household control and the presence or absence of mosquito populations. When the perceived risk of not controlling breeding sites depends on mosquito prevalence, the system admits an additional equilibrium with partial household engagement. We derive conditions under which this equilibrium undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, yielding sustained oscillations arising solely from the interaction between mosquito abundance and household behavior. Numerical simulations and parameter explorations further describe the amplitude and phase properties of these oscillatory regimes.</description>

      <title>Identification of a Kalman filter: consistency of local solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction error and maximum likelihood methods are powerful tools for identifying linear dynamical systems and, in particular, enable the joint estimation of model parameters and the Kalman filter used for state estimation. A key limitation, however, is that these methods require solving a generally non-convex optimization problem to global optimality. This paper analyzes the statistical behavior of local minimizers in the special case where only the Kalman gain is estimated. We prove that these local solutions are statistically consistent estimates of the true Kalman gain. This follows from asymptotic unimodularity: as the dataset grows, the objective function converges to a limit with a unique local (and therefore global) minimizer. We further provide guidelines for designing the optimization problem for Kalman filter tuning and discuss extensions to the joint estimation of additional linear parameters and noise covariances. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated using three examples of increasing complexity. The main practical takeaway of this paper is that difficulties caused by local minimizers in system identification are, at least, not attributable to the tuning of the Kalman gain.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrically Weighted Dowker Persistence and Applications in Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By their nature it is difficult to differentiate chaotic dynamical systems through measurement. In recent years, work has begun on using methods of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to qualitatively type dynamical data by approximating the topology of the underlying attracting set. This comes with the additional challenges of high dimensionality incurring computational complexity along with the lack of directional information encoded in the approximated topology. Due to the latter fact, standard methods of TDA for this high dimensional dynamical data do not differentiate between periodic cycles and non-periodic cycles in the attractor. We present a framework to address both of these challenges. We begin by binning the dynamical data, and capturing the sequential information in the form of a coarse-grained weighted and directed network. We then calculate the persistent Dowker homology of the asymmetric network, encoding spatial and temporal information. Analytically, we highlight the differences in periodic and non-periodic cycles by providing a full characterization of their one-dimensional Dowker persistences. We prove how the homologies of graph wedge sums can be described in terms of the wedge component homologies. Finally, we generalize our characterization to cactus graphs with arbitrary edge weights and orientations. Our analytical results give insight into how our method captures temporal information in its asymmetry, producing a persistence framework robust to noise and sensitive to dynamical structure.</description>

      <title>Rigorous numerical computation of the Stokes multipliers for linear differential equations with single level one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a practical algorithm for computing the Stokes multipliers of a linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients at an irregular singular point of single level one. The algorithm follows a classical approach based on Borel summation and numerical ODE solving, but avoids a large amount of redundant work compared to a direct implementation. It applies to differential equations of arbitrary order, with no genericity assumption, and is suited to high-precision computations. In addition, we present an open-source implementation of this algorithm in the SageMath computer algebra system and illustrate its use with several examples. Our implementation supports arbitrary-precision computations and automatically provides rigorous error bounds. The article assumes minimal prior knowledge of the asymptotic theory of meromorphic differential equations and provides an elementary introduction to the linear Stokes phenomenon that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and asymptotic limits for Langevin interacting systems with singular forces and multiplicative noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study systems of $N$ interacting particles described by the classical and relativistic Langevin dynamics with singular forces and multiplicative noises. For the classical model, we prove the ergodicity, obtaining an exponential rate of convergence to the invariant Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, and the small-mass limit, recovering the $N$-particle interacting overdamped Langevin dynamics. For the relativistic model, we establish the ergodicity, obtaining an algebraic mixing rate of any order to the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution, and the Newtonian limit (that is when the speed of light tends to infinity), approximating a system of underdamped Langevin dynamics. The proofs rely on the construction of Lyapunov functions that account for irregular potentials and multiplicative noises.</description>

      <title>A simple rigorous integrator for semilinear parabolic PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of the dynamics generated by partial differential equations (PDEs) provide approximate, numerical solutions to initial value problems. Such simulations are ubiquitous in scientific computing, but the correctness of the results is usually not guaranteed. We propose a new method for the rigorous integration of parabolic PDEs, i.e., the derivation of rigorous and explicit error bounds between the numerically obtained approximate solution and the exact one, which is then proven to exist over the entire time interval considered. These guaranteed error bounds are obtained a posteriori, using a fixed point reformulation based on a piece-wise in time constant approximation of the linearization around the numerical solution. Our setup leads to relatively simple-to-understand estimates, which has several advantages. Most critically, it allows us to optimize various aspects of the proof, and in particular to provide an adaptive time-stepping strategy. In case the solution converges to a stable hyperbolic equilibrium, we are also able to prove this convergence, applying our rigorous integrator with a final, infinitely long timestep. We showcase the ability of our method to rigorously integrate over relatively long time intervals, and to capture non-trivial dynamics, via examples on the Swift--Hohenberg equation, the Ohta--Kawasaki equation and the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation. We expect that the simplicity and efficiency of the approach will enable generalization to a wide variety of other parabolic PDEs, as well as applications to boundary value problems.</description>

      <title>Properties of Lyapunov Subcenter Manifolds in Conservative Mechanical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-body mechanical systems have rich internal dynamics, whose solutions can be exploited as efficient control targets. Yet, solutions non-trivially depend on system parameters, obscuring feasible properties for use as target trajectories. For periodic regulation tasks in robotics applications, we investigate properties of nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) collected in Lyapunov subcenter manifolds (LSMs) of conservative mechanical systems. Using a time-symmetry of conservative mechanical systems, we show that mild non-resonance conditions guarantee LSMs to be Eigenmanifolds, in which NNMs are guaranteed to oscillate between two points of zero velocity. We also prove the existence of a unique generator, which is a connected, 1D manifold that collects these points of zero velocity for a given Eigenmanifold. Furthermore, we show that an additional spatial symmetry provides LSMs with yet stronger properties of Rosenberg manifolds. Here all brake trajectories pass through a unique equilibrium configuration, which can be favorable for control applications. These theoretical results are numerically confirmed on two mechanical systems: a double pendulum and a 5-link pendulum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an extended dynamical system on the non-negative real line with piecewise linear non-uniformly expanding local dynamics. With a uniformly distributed initial state, the distribution of successive states coincides with that of a random walk in an inhomogeneous environment. Under suitable conditions on the environment, we establish a central limit theorem and a (non-Gaussian) local limit theorem for the walk. Our approach builds on the work of Leskel\"a and Stenlund (Stochastic Process. Appl. 121(12), 2011), who analyzed a corresponding model with uniformly expanding local dynamics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of motion planning complexity for control-affine systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the complexity of the approximation of nonadmissible curves for nonlinear control-affine systems satisfying the strong H{\"o}rmander condition. Focusing on tubular approximation complexities, we provide asymptotic equivalences, with explicit constants, for all generic situations where the distribution, i.e., the linear part of the control system, is of co-rank one. Namely, we consider curves in step 2 distributions and any dimension. In the 3 dimensional case, we also consider the case of distributions with Martinet-type singularities that are crossed by the curve at isolated points.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Theory of Scalar Volterra Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims to bridge the gap between pure and applied research on scalar, linear Volterra equations by examining five major classes: integral and integro-differential equations with completely monotone kernels, such as linear viscoelastic models; equations with positive definite kernels, such as partially observed quantum systems; difference equations with discrete, positive definite kernels; a generalized class of delay differential equations; and a generalized class of fractional differential equations. We develop a general, spectral theory that provides a system of correspondences between these disparate domains. As a result, we see how 'interconversion' (operator inversion) arises as a natural, continuous involution within each class, yielding a plethora of novel formulas for analytical solutions of such equations. This spectral theory unifies and extends existing results in viscoelasticity, signal processing, and analysis, and makes progress on an open question of Abel regarding the solution of integral equations of the first kind. Finally, it reduces simple Volterra equations of all classes to pen-and-paper calculation, and offers promising applications to the numerical solution of Volterra equations more broadly.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Transfers linking Ballistic Captures to Earth-Moon Periodic Orbit Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of transfers to periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon system has regained prominence with NASA's Artemis and CNSA's Chang'e programs. This work addresses the problem of linking ballistic capture trajectories - exploiting multi-body dynamics for temporary lunar orbit insertion - with bounded periodic motion described in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). A unified framework is developed for optimizing bi-impulsive transfers to families of periodic orbits via a high-order polynomial expansion of the CR3BP dynamics. That same expansion underlies a continuous parameterization of periodic orbit families, enabling rapid targeting and analytic sensitivity. Transfers to planar periodic orbit families - such as Lyapunov L1/L2 and distant retrograde orbits (DROs) - are addressed first, followed by extension to spatial families - such as butterfly and halo L1/L2 orbits - with an emphasis towards near-rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs). Numerical results demonstrate low-{\Delta}v solutions and validate the method's adaptability for designing lunar missions. The optimized trajectories can inform an established low-energy transfer database, enriching it with detailed cost profiles that reflect both transfer feasibility and underlying dynamical relationships to specific periodic orbit families. Finally, the proposed transfers provide reliable estimates for rapid refinement, making them readily adaptable for further optimization across mission-specific needs.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity bounds in the Sliced Wasserstein distance for Schur stable autoregressive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12092v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicit calculations in dimension one show for Schur stable autoregressive processes with standard Gaussian noise that the ergodic convergence in the Wasserstein-$2$ distance is essentially given by the sum of the mean, which decays exponentially, and the standard deviation, which decays with twice the speed. This paper starts by showing new upper and lower multivariate affine transport bounds for the Wasserstein-$r$ distance for $r$ greater and equal to $1$. These bounds allow to formulate a novel sufficient (non-Gaussian) ergodic interpolation condition for the mentioned mean-variance behavior to take place in case of more general Schur stable multivariate autoregressive processes. All ergodic estimates are non-asymptotic with completely explicit constants. The main applications are precise thermalization bounds for Schur stable $\mathsf{AR}(p)$ and $\mathsf{ARMA}(p,q)$ models in Wasserstein and Sliced Wasserstein distance. In the sequel we establish with the help of coupling techniques explicit upper and lower exponential bounds for more general multivariate Schur stable autoregressive processes. This includes parallel sampling and the convergence of the empiricial means. The utility of our results in particular for the Sliced Wasserstein distance are confirmed by multivariate numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Existence proofs of traveling wave solutions on an infinite strip for the suspension bridge equation and proof of orbital stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computer-assisted approach for constructively proving the existence of traveling wave solutions of the suspension bridge equation on the infinite strip $\Omega = \mathbb{R} \times (-d_2,d_2)$. Using a meticulous Fourier analysis, we derive a quantifiable approximate inverse $\mathbb{A}$ for the Jacobian $D\mathbb{F}(\bar{u})$ of the PDE at an approximate traveling wave solution $\bar{u}$. Such approximate objects are obtained thanks to Fourier coefficients sequences and operators, arising from Fourier series expansions on a rectangle $\Omega_0 = (-d_1,d_1) \times (-d_2,d_2)$. In particular, the challenging exponential nonlinearity of the equation is tackled using a rigorous control of the aliasing error when computing related Fourier coefficients. This allows to establish a Newton-Kantorovich approach, from which the existence of a true traveling wave solution of the PDE can be proven in a vicinity of $\bar{u}$. We successfully apply such a methodology in the case of the suspension bridge equation and prove the existence of multiple traveling wave solutions on $\Omega$. Finally, given a proven solution $\tilde{u}$, a Fourier series approximation on $\Omega_0$ allows us to accurately enclose the spectrum of $D\mathbb{F}(\tilde{u})$. Such a tight control provides the number of negative eigenvalues, which in turns, allows to conclude about the orbital (in)stability of $\tilde{u}$.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part I: Modular Strict CLF Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known in the robotics literature since about 1995 that, in polar coordinates, the nonholonomic unicycle is asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback, even globally. We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.</description>
