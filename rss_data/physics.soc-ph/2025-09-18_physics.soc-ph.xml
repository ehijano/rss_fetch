      <title>An accurate mean-field equation for voter model dynamics on scale-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the emergent macroscopic behavior of dynamical systems on networks is a crucial but challenging task. One of the simplest and most effective methods to construct a reduced macroscopic model is given by mean-field theory. The resulting approximations perform well on dense and homogeneous networks but poorly on scale-free networks, which, however, are more realistic in many applications. In this paper, we introduce a modified version of the mean-field approximation for voter model dynamics on scale-free networks. This approach achieves a significantly smaller approximation error than standard methods without increasing dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Towards an Evidence-Based Approach to Climate Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence-Based Climate Policy (EBCP) is an approach to policymaking that relies on evidence to make decisions about managing climate impacts, mitigation, and adaptation. A core problem for EBCP is the lack of a clear definition of evidence, a fundamental concept to the theory. The literature often draws on evidence-based medicine (EBM), where evidence is typically empirical data from scientific research or systematic investigations and quality is arranged within an evidence hierarchy with randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis on top. However, this conception and hierarchy is insufficient for EBCP, which requires context-appropriate evidence, such as expert judgments, model-based probabilities, and scenario analysis. In EBCP what counts as evidence must be reassessed for relevance, quality and availability in the specific context. To demonstrate different types of evidence used in EBCP, this research is based on a case study on PNACC-3.</description>

      <title>Network representations reveal structured uncertainty in music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music, as a structured yet perceptually rich experience, can be modeled as a network to uncover how humans encode and process auditory information. While network-based representations of music are increasingly common, the impact of feature selection on structural properties and cognitive alignment remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated eight network models, each constructed from symbolic representations of piano compositions using distinct combinations of pitch, octave, duration, and interval, designed to be representative of existing approaches in the literature. By comparing these models through topological metrics, entropy analysis, and divergence with respect to inferred cognitive representations, we assessed both their structural and perceptual efficiency. Our findings reveal that simpler, feature-specific models better match human perception, whereas complex, multidimensional representations introduce cognitive inefficiencies. These results support the view that humans rely on modular, parallel cognitive networks--an architecture consistent with theories of predictive processing and free energy minimization. Moreover, we find that musical networks are structurally organized to guide attention toward transitions that are both uncertain and inferable. The resulting structure concentrates uncertainty in a few frequently visited nodes, creating local entropy gradients that alternate between stable and unpredictable regions, thereby enabling the expressive dynamics of tension and release that define the musical experience. These findings show that network structures make the organization of uncertainty in music observable, offering new insight into how patterned flows of expectation shape perception, and open new directions for studying how musical structures evolve across genres, cultures, and historical periods through the lens of network science.</description>

      <title>SkyNET-scape Room: An Escape Room to Explore Astroparticle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Innovative science communication is key to engaging the public with complex topics such as astroparticle physics. As part of the Italian PRIN 2022 funding initiative, we are developing SkyNET-scape Room, an interactive escape room designed to introduce participants to the main messengers of the high-energy universe, namely cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos.
  The experience is structured into three interactive stations, each focusing on a specific messenger and its detection method. Small teams of visitors will collaborate to solve puzzles and quizzes related to gamma-ray observations, neutrino detection, and cosmic-ray composition. Using a combination of audio, video, and written materials, participants will engage with real scientific concepts while working together to "escape." The ultimate goal is to spark curiosity, teamwork, and excitement for science, making astroparticle physics more accessible and engaging.
  In this contribution, we will present the design, implementation, and preliminary feedback from test sessions, emphasizing how gamification and interactive storytelling can serve as powerful tools for public engagement.</description>

      <title>Gremban Expansion for Signed Networks: Algebraic and Combinatorial Foundations for Community-Faction Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with the characterization and detection of community and faction structures in signed networks. We approach the study of these mesoscale structures through the lens of the Gremban expansion. This graph operation lifts a signed graph to a larger unsigned graph, and allows the extension of standard techniques from unsigned to signed graphs. We develop the combinatorial and algebraic properties of the Gremban expansion, with a focus on its inherent involutive symmetry. The main technical result is a bijective correspondence between symmetry-respecting cut-sets in the Gremban expansion, and regular cut-sets and frustration sets in the signed graph (i.e., the combinatorial structures that underlie communities and factions respectively). This result forms the basis for our new approach to community-faction detection in signed networks, which makes use of spectral clustering techniques that naturally respect the required symmetries. We demonstrate how this approach distinguishes the two mesoscale structures, how to generalize the approach to multi-way clustering and discuss connections to network dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Indirect reciprocity as a dynamics for weak balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A social network is often divided into many factions. People are friends within each faction, while they are enemies of the other factions, and even my enemy's enemy is not necessarily my friend. This configuration can be described in terms of a weak form of structural balance. Although weak balance explains a number of real social networks, which dynamical rule achieves it has remained relatively unexplored. In this work, we show that the answer can be found in the field of indirect reciprocity, which assumes that people assess each other's behavior and choose how to behave to others based on the assessment according to a social norm. We begin by showing that weak structural balance is equivalent to stationarity when the rule is given by a norm called `judging'. By analyzing its cluster dynamics of merging, fission, and migration induced by assessment error in complete graphs, we obtain the cluster size distribution in a steady state, which shows the coexistence of a giant cluster and smaller ones. This study suggests that indirect reciprocity can provide insight into the interplay between a norm that individuals abide by and the macroscopic group structure in society.</description>

      <title>Fast Unbiased Sampling of Networks with Given Expected Degrees and Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The configuration model is a cornerstone of statistical assessment of network structure. While the Chung-Lu model is among the most widely used configuration models, it systematically oversamples edges between large-degree nodes, leading to inaccurate statistical conclusions. Although the maximum entropy principle offers unbiased configuration models, its high computational cost has hindered widespread adoption, making the Chung-Lu model an inaccurate yet persistently practical choice. Here, we propose fast and efficient sampling algorithms for the max-entropy-based models by adapting the Miller-Hagberg algorithm. Evaluation on 103 empirical networks demonstrates 10-1000 times speedup, making theoretically rigorous configuration models practical and contributing to a more accurate understanding of network structure.</description>
