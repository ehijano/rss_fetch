      <title>First-order transition into a charge-density wave phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition into a charge-density wave phase is analyzed theoretically. We argue that, for commensurate or nearly-commensurate charge-density wave, the transition may become first order. Such a remarkable departure from the more common second-order transition scenario is associated with additional `umklapp' terms one can include in the Landau free energy expansion in the commensurate or nearly-commensurate cases. The proposed mechanisms may be relevant for certain alloys demonstrating first-order transition into charge-density wave state. It may be generalized for spin-density wave phases as well.</description>

      <title>Elastic screening of pseudo gauge fields in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice deformations in graphene couple to the low-energy electronic degrees of freedom as pseudo scalar and gauge fields. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the optical component of the displacement field, i.e., the relative motion of different sublattices, contributes at equal order as the acoustic component and effectively screens the pseudo gauge fields. In particular, we consider twisted bilayer graphene and corrugated monolayer graphene. In both cases, optical lattice displacement significantly reduce the overall magnitude of the pseudo magnetic fields. For corrugated graphene, we further show that the corresponding electronic bands are significantly modified by the screened pseudo magnetic field. Previous studies based on continuum elasticity, which ignores this effect, have therefore systematically overestimated the strength of the strain-induced pseudo magnetic field. Our results have important consequences for the interpretation of experiments and design of straintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge stability diagrams in coupled quantum dot qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict large regions of the charge stability diagram using a multi-band and multi-electron configuration interaction model of a double quantum dot system. We account for many-body interactions within each quantum dot using full configuration interaction and solve for single-particle density operators. This allows charge states to be predicted more accurately than the extensively used classical capacitance model or the single-band Hubbard model. The resulting single-particle mixed states then serve as inputs into an atomic orbital picture that allows for the explicit calculation of the underlying Hubbard model parameters by performing the appropriate integrals. This numerical approach allows for arbitrary choices of electrostatic potential and gate geometry. A common assumption when calculating charge stability diagrams from the Hubbard model is that the charge stability diagrams are periodic, but we find that the tunnel couplings for valence electrons in dots with $N=3$ electrons are significantly enhanced when compared to single-electron dots. This difference is apparent in the charge stability diagram for higher occupancy Coulomb diamonds. We also quantitatively explore how the barrier gate strength and dot pitch impact this behavior. Our work should help improve the future realistic modeling of semiconductor-dot-based quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Topological characterization of modified Kane-Mele-Rashba models via local spin Chern marker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use the local spin Chern marker (LSCM) recently introduced by Ba\`{u} and Marrazzo [Phys. Rev. B 110, 054203 (2024)] to analyze the topology of the ground-state electronic wave functions in a finite honeycomb lattice flake described by three distinct models. The models considered here are characterized by strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction, which leads to non-conservation of the spin operator, i.e., $[\mathcal{H},\hat{s}_z]\neq 0$. The three spin-orbit couplings associated with the topological aspects of the models are: 1) Standard Kane-Mele coupling, 2) Sublattice-dependent Kane-Mele coupling, and 3) In-plane ($\hat{s}_y$) polarized Kane-Mele coupling. These couplings occur in graphene grown on suitable substrates and are relevant for modeling its van der Waals heterostructures. A particular topological phase diagram characterizes each of these spin-orbit interactions, and our calculations of LSCM successfully capture its general features. We also performed a detailed analysis of the spectral properties of the energy and valence-projected spin matrix eigenvalues, which shows that both exhibit a gap that protects the marker. Our results expand the applicability of the spin Chern number method to a class of Hamiltonians with experimental relevance and may contribute to future research on the real-space topology of realistic materials.</description>

      <title>Multifractaility, topology and anomalous Hall conductivity on a 30 degrees twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $30^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer formed by two copies of Haldane model and explore evolution of its properties with varying interlayer coupling strength. Specifically, we compute the system's energy spectrum, its fractal dimensions, topological entanglement entropy, local Chern markers and anomalous Hall conductivity. We find that at weak interlayer coupling, the system remains gapped and retains topological properties of the isolated layers, but at strong interlayer coupling, the system forms a gapless multifractal state. We also establish that anomalous Hall conductivity can be used to characterize the system's topological properties in the same way as a local Chern marker.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effects in magnetic weak topological insulator films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and strong topological insulator gives rise to distinct new topological phases and various intriguing phenomena, attracting significant attention in recent years. However, magnetic effects in weak topological insulators remain largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the magnetic effect on thin films of weak topological insulators. We focus on ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic effects, which have been extensively studied in strong topological insulators, as well as the recently highlighted altermagnetic effect. We reveal that the interplay between magnetism and weak topological insulators leads to a variety of Hall effects in the absence of an external magnetic field, including the metallic quantum anomalous Hall effect without chiral edge states, the quantum anomalous Hall effect with a higher Hall conductance plateau, the quantized layer Hall effect, the metallic half-quantized valley-like Hall effect, and a quantized valley-like Hall effect. This work provides valuable insights for exploring magnetic effect on weak topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Self-induced Floquet magnons in magnetic vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving condensed matter systems with periodic electromagnetic fields can result in exotic states not found in equilibrium. Termed Floquet engineering, such periodic driving applied to electronic systems can tailor quantum effects to induce topological band structures and control spin interactions. However, Floquet engineering of magnon band structures in magnetic systems has proven challenging so far. Here, we present a class of Floquet states in a magnetic vortex that arise from nonlinear interactions between the vortex core and microwave magnons. Floquet bands emerge through the periodic oscillation of the core, which can be initiated by either driving the core directly or pumping azimuthal magnon modes. For the latter, the azimuthal modes induce core gyration through nonlinear interactions, which in turn renormalizes the magnon band structure. This represents a self-induced mechanism for Floquet band engineering and offers new avenues to study and control nonlinear magnon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Magnon spin transport in the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrPS4 for non-collinear and collinear magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the injection, transport and detection of magnon spins in the van der Waals antiferromagnet chromium thiophosphate (CrPS4). We electrically and thermally inject magnon spins by platinum contacts and examine the non-local resistance as a function of in-plane magnetic field up to 12 Tesla. We observe a large non-local resistance from both the electrically and thermally excited magnon modes above the spin-flip field where CrPS4 is in the collinear state. At 25 K for an in-plane field of ranging 5 - 12 T, we extract the magnon relaxation length ranging $200-800$ nm and a typical magnon conductivity of 1e4 Sm-1, which is one order of magnitude smaller than in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films at room temperature. Moreover, we find that the magnon conductivity is almost zero for CrPS4 in the non-collinear state. Our results open up the way to understanding the role of the antiferromagnetic magnon modes on spin injection into antiferromagnets and implementation of two-dimensional magnets for scalable magnonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Gate control of magnon spin transport in unconventional magnon transistors based on the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrPS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon based spintronic devices require the modulation of magnon spin transport for their operations. We provide a proof-of-principle of two unconventional non-local magnon transport devices in which we modulate the diffusive magnon transport of incoherent magnons in the van der Waals antiferromagnet Chromium thiophosphate, CrPS4. The non-local signals generated electrically by spin injection via the spin Hall effect (SHE) and thermally via the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) are altered by a modulator electrode. The current through the modulator increases or decreases the magnon chemical potential via the SHE and changes the magnon temperature through Joule heating. We achieve up to 25%/mA and 16%/mA modulation efficiencies for the electrically and thermally generated magnon spin transport, respectively, for CrPS4 in the collinear state at in plane fields &gt;7T at a temperature of 25K.</description>

      <title>The single ion of Vanadium in an individual Quantum Dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the basic properties of a new physical system: an individual V2+ ion embedded into an individual quantum dot. The system is realized utilizing molecular beam epitaxy and it is observed using a low-temperature polarization-resolved magneto-photoluminescence. The nature of the system is confirmed by observation of the excitonic lines split due to the interactions of a vanadium ion with carriers confined in a CdTe/ZnTe quantum dot. Observed data are explained by the numerical modeling which includes s,p-d exchange interaction, Zeeman splitting of the exciton and the ion, diamagnetic shift, and the presence of shear strain within the quantum dot. The fundamental state of vanadium exhibits a spin 1/2 making this system a textbook localized qubit.</description>

      <title>Types of Size-Dependent Melting in Fe Nanoclusters: a Molecular Dynamics Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic nanoclusters are of interest in many fields because of their size-dependent catalytic activity. This activity can, in part, be influenced by their melting properties. In this work, the melting phase transitions of $Fe_{n}$ nanoclusters with $n \leq 100$ atoms were investigated using classical many-body molecular dynamics simulations. Adding a single atom to many cluster sizes induced strong variations in melting point ($T_{melt}$), latent heat of melting ($\Delta H_{melt}$), and onset temperature of isomerization ($T_{iso}$). Clusters with size-dependent melting behavior were classified into 3 distinct cluster types: closed-shell, near-closed-shell, and far-from-closed-shell clusters. First-order-like phase transitions were observed only for cluster sizes with particularly symmetric closed shells and near-closed shells with up to a few missing or extra atoms. Near-closed-shell clusters had very low $T_{iso}$ relative to their $T_{melt}$. Far-from-closed-shell clusters exhibited second-order-like phase transitions. Variations in the melting and isomerization behavior of neighboring cluster sizes may have implications for catalytic systems such as the growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Defect Landscape Engineering to Tune Skyrmion-Antiskyrmion Systems in FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A promising architecture for next-generation, low energy spintronic devices uses skyrmions -- nanoscale whirlpools of magnetic moment -- as information carriers. Notably, schemes for racetrack memory have been proposed in which skyrmions and antiskyrmions, their antiparticle, serve as the logical bits 1 and 0. However, major challenges exist to designing skyrmion-antiskyrmion based computing. The presence of both particles in one material is often mutually exclusive such that few systems have been identified in which they coexist, and in these systems their appearance is stochastic rather than deterministic. Here, we create a tunable skyrmion-antiskyrmion system in FeGe films through ion-irradiation and annealing, and detail the structural properties of the films under these various conditions. Specifically, we irradiate epitaxial B20-phase FeGe films with 2.8 MeV Au$^{4+}$ ions, showing evidence that the amorphized regions preferentially host antiskyrmions at densities controlled by the irradiation fluence. In this work, we focus on a subsequent, systematic electron diffraction study with in-situ annealing, demonstrating the ability to recrystallize controllable fractions of the material at temperatures ranging from approximately 150$^{\circ}$ C to 250$^{\circ}$ C, enabling further tunability of skyrmion/antiskyrmion populations. We describe the crystallization kinetics using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov model, finding that growth of crystalline grains is consistent with diffusion-controlled one-to-two dimensional growth with a decreasing nucleation rate. The procedures developed here can be applied towards creation of skyrmion-antiskyrmion systems for energy-efficient, high-density data storage, spin wave emission produced by skyrmion-antiskyrmion pair annihilation, and more generally testbeds for research on skyrmion-antiskyrmion liquids and crystals.</description>

      <title>Multiferroicity, Magnetoelectricity, and Piezoelectricity in Two-Dimensional Janus VSBrI Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic materials that combine intrinsic ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity exhibit significant potential for applications in highly integrated magnetoelectric and multifunctional spintronic devices. Through first-principles calculations, we identify the Janus VSBrI monolayer as a promising multiferroic semiconductor material, possessing both ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity. Specifically, the VSBrI monolayer shows a large in-plane magnetic anisotropic energy (MAE) of 460 $\mu$eV/V, a significant intrinsic in-plane spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of 1.20 $\times$ $10^{-10}$ C/m, and a high energy barrier between two ferroelectric states of 168 eV. Our findings reveal that the energy variances among different magnetic states notably correlate with polarization, hinting at the potential for sizable magnetoelectric coupling within the VSBrI. Interestingly, we find that the stability of the ferroelectric phase can be enhanced by the application of biaxial tensile strain. The calculated in-plane piezoelectric coefficient d$_{11}$ reaches 29.01 pm/V and the out-plane piezoelectric coefficient d$_{32}$ reaches 1.60 pm/V, both of which are significantly larger than those of most known 2D materials, which is greatly desirable for practical applications in piezoelectronic devices. These intriguing properties make the Janus VSBrI monolayer a promising candidate for 2D multifunctional spintronic devices, with significant potential to advance next-generation technology and inform the design of related electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose hydrostatic pressure -- a well-established tool for tuning properties of condensed matter -- as a novel route for optimizing targets for light dark matter direct detection, specifically via phonons. Pressure dramatically affects compressible solids by boosting the speed of sound and phonon frequencies. Focusing on helium -- the most compressible solid -- our ab initio calculations illustrate how high pressure elevates helium from lacking single-phonon reach to rivaling leading candidates. Our work establishes pressure as an unexplored tuning knob for accessing lower dark matter mass regimes.</description>

      <title>Thermal density functional theory approach to quantum thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the thermodynamic properties of many-body quantum systems and their emergence from microscopic laws is a topic of great significance due to its profound fundamental implications and extensive practical applications. Recent advances in experimental techniques for controlling and preparing these systems have increased interest in this area, as they have the potential to drive the development of quantum technologies. In this study, we present a density-functional theory approach to extract detailed information about the statistics of work and the irreversible entropy associated with quantum quenches at finite temperature. Specifically, we demonstrate that these quantities can be expressed as functionals of thermal and out-of-equilibrium densities, which may serve as fundamental variables for understanding finite-temperature many-body processes. We, then, apply our method to the case of the inhomogeneous Hubbard model, showing that our density functional theory based approach can be usefully employed to unveil the distinctive roles of interaction and external potential on the thermodynamic properties of such a system.</description>

      <title>Interlayer coupling rotatable magnetic easy-axis in MnSe2 mono- and bi-layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interlayer coupling plays a critical role in tuning the electronic structures and magnetic ground states of two-dimensional materials, influenced by the number of layers, interlayer distance, and stacking order. However, its effect on the orientation of the magnetic easy axis remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that interlayer coupling can significantly alter the magnetic easy-axis orientation, as shown by the magnetic easy-axis of monolayer 1T-MnSe2 tilting 33{\deg} from the z-axis, while aligning with the z-axis in the bilayer. This change results from variations in orbital occupations near the Fermi level, particularly involving nonmetallic Se atoms. Contrary to the traditional focus on magnetic metal atoms, our findings reveal that Se orbitals play a key role in influencing the easy-axis orientation and topological Chern numbers. Furthermore, we show that the occupation of Se p-orbitals, and consequently the magnetic anisotropy, can be modulated by factors such as stacking order, charge doping, and external strain. Our results highlight the pivotal role of interlayer coupling in tuning the magnetic properties of layered materials, with important implications for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of topological 3Q state in an intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets have opened a new avenue of novel opportunities covering various interesting phases. Co1/3TaS2-an intercalated metallic vdW antiferromagnet-is one of the latest important additions to the growing list of materials due to its unique triple-Q (3Q) ground state possessing topological characteristics. Careful bulk characterisations have shown the ground state of CoxTaS2 to be a rare 3Q tetrahedral structure for x less than 1/3. The uniqueness of this ground state arises from the dense real-space Berry curvature due to scalar spin chirality, giving rise to a noticeable anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we demonstrate that we can control this topological phase via gating. Using three kinds of CoxTaS2 devices with different Co compositions, we have established that we can cover the whole 3Q topological phase with ionic gating. This work reports a rare demonstration of electrical gating control of layered antiferromagnetic metal. More importantly, our work constitutes one of the first examples of the electrical control of the scalar spin chirality using antiferromagnetic metal.</description>

Abstract: The influence of hydrogen on magnetization is of significant interest to spintronics. Understanding and controlling this phenomenon at the atomic scale, particularly in nanoscale systems, is crucial. In this study, we utilized scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with a nickelocene molecule to sense the spin of a hydrogen-loaded nanoscale Co island grown on Cu(111). Magnetic exchange maps obtained from the molecular tip revealed the presence of a hydrogen superstructure and a 90$^{\circ}$ rotation of the magnetization compared to the pristine island. \textit{Ab initio} calculations corroborate these observations, indicating that hydrogen hybridization with Co atoms on the island surface drives the spin reorientation of the island. This reorientation is further reinforced by hydrogen penetration into the island that locates at the Co/Cu interface. However, the subsurface sensitivity of the magnetic exchange maps indicate that this effect is limited. Our study provides valuable microscopic insights into the chemical control of magnetism at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Doping-Induced Enhancement of Hydrogen Evolution at MoS2 Electrodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rate theory and DFT calculations of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on MoS2 with Co, Ni and Pt impurities show the significance of dihydrogen (H2*) complex where both hydrogen atoms are interacting with the surface. Stabilization of such a complex affects the competing Volmer-Heyrovsky (direct H2 release) and Volmer-Tafel (H2* intermediate) pathways. The resulting evolution proceeds with a very small overpotential for all dopants ($\eta$ = 0.1 to 0.2 V) at 25% edge substitution, significantly reduced from the already low $\eta$ = 0.27 V for the undoped edge. At full edge substitution, Co-MoS2 remains highly active ($\eta$ = 0.18 V) while Ni- and Pt-MoS2 are deactivated ($\eta$ = 0.4 to 0.5 V) due to unfavorable interaction with H2*. Instead of the single S-vacancy, the site of intrinsic activity in the basal plane was found to be the undercoordinated central Mo-atom in threefold S-vacancy configurations, enabling hydrogen evolution with $\eta$ = 0.52 V via a H2* intermediate. The impurity atoms interact favorably with the intrinsic sulfur vacancies on the basal plane, stabilizing but simultaneously deactivating the triple vacancy configuration. The calculated shifts in overpotential are consistent with reported measurements, and the dependence on doping level may explain variations in experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference in a temporal-average-inversion-symmetric chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to implement tunable beam splitter and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain by manipulating the topological edge states adiabatically. The boson initially injected in the one end of the chain can be transferred to the two-end with a tunable proportion depends on the dynamical phases accumulated during the adiabatic evolution. We also observe Hong-Ou-Mandel interference via the tunable beam splitter ($50:50$) and achieve a spatially entangled two-particle NOON state. We demonstrate the robustness of our proposal under chiral- and time-reversal-symmetry-preserving disorder. However, the chiral symmetry is scarce for realist system. Therefore, we demonstrate Hong-Ou-Mandel interference are robust to inversion symmetric disorder breaking the chiral symmetry, highlighting the protection of inversion symmetry. More importantly, the inversion symmetry violated by static disorder can be restored for more common situations where disorder becomes time dependent, giving rise to the temporal-average-inversion-symmetry protected Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. Our approach opens a new way to study quantum effects in topological matter with potential applications.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Floquet engineering topological states from effective models towards realistic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With significant advances in classifying and cataloguing topological matter, the focus of topological physics has shifted towards quantum control, particularly the creation and manipulation of topological phases of matter. Floquet engineering, the concept of tailoring a system by periodic fields, offers a powerful tool to manipulate electronic properties of condensed systems, and even to create exotic non-equilibrium topological states that are impossibly present in equilibrium scenarios. In this perspective, we give a brief review of recent progress in theoretical investigations of Floquet engineering topological states from effective models towards realistic materials. We show that light irradiation can realize various desired topological states through the introduction of symmetry breaking, such as first- and higher-order Weyl fermions, quadrupole topological insulator with periodic driving and disorder, quantum anomalous Hall effects with a tunable Chern number, as well as beyond. Moreover, based on first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we show several realistic material candidates proposed as potential hosts for promising Floquet topological states, facilitating their verification in experiments. We believe that our perspective on Floquet engineering of topological states will advance further studies of rich exotic light-induced phenomena in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in one-dimensional quantum wires connected to superconductors with mixed singlet-triplet pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), characterized by asymmetric critical currents in a Josephson junction, has drawn considerable attention in the field of condensed matter physics. We investigate the conditions under which JDE can manifest in a one-dimensional Josephson junction composed of a spin-orbit-coupled quantum wire with an applied Zeeman field, connected between two superconductors. Our study reveals that while spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and a Zeeman field in the quantum wire are not sufficient to induce JDE when the superconductors are purely singlet, the introduction of triplet pairing in the superconductors leads to the emergence of JDE. This finding highlights the potential of JDE as a probe for triplet superconductivity. We further demonstrate that even in absence of SOC in the quantum wire, JDE can arise when the directions of the triplet pairing and the Zeeman field are non-collinear, provided the superconductors exhibit mixed singlet-triplet pairing. Additionally, we identify specific conditions under which JDE is absent, namely, when the pairing is purely triplet and the directions of the SOC and the triplet pairing are perpendicular. Our findings indicate that JDE is always accompanied by the anomalous Josephson effect. The diode effect coefficient is found to oscillate with variations in the chemical potential of the quantum wire, driven by Fabry-P\'erot interference effects. Our results suggest that quantum wires in Josephson junctions could serve as effective platforms for probing triplet superconductivity through the observation of JDE.</description>

Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in non-equilibrium quantum systems is an intriguing subject. Here, we look for a suitable platform that enables an in-depth exploration of the topic. To this end, We analyze the topological and localization properties of a dimerized one-dimensional Kitaev chain in the presence of an onsite quasiperiodic potential with its amplitude being modulated periodically in time. The topological features have been explored via computing the real-space winding numbers corresponding to both the Majorana zero and the $\pi$ energy modes. We enumerate the scenario at different driving frequencies. In particular, at some intermediate frequency regime, the phase diagram concerning the zero mode involves two distinct phase transitions, one from a topologically trivial to a non-trivial phase, and another from a topological phase to an Anderson localized phase. On the other hand, the study of the $\pi$ modes reveals the emergence of a unique topological phase, with the bulk and the edges being fully localized, which may be called as the Floquet topological Anderson phase. Furthermore, we study the localization properties of the bulk states by computing the inverse and normalized participation ratios, while the critical phase is ascertained by computing the fractal dimension. We have observed extended, critical, and localized phases at intermediate frequencies, which are further confirmed via a finite-size scaling analysis. Finally, fully extended and localized phases are respectively observed at lower and higher frequencies.</description>

Abstract: We show that interlayer charge transfer in 2D materials can be driven by an in-plane electric field, giving rise to electrical multipole generation in linear and second order of in-plane field. The linear and nonlinear effects have quantum geometric origins in the Berry curvature and quantum metric respectively, defined in extended parameter spaces characteristic of layered materials. We elucidate their symmetry characters, and demonstrate sizable dipole and quadrupole polarizations respectively in twisted bilayers and trilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. Furthermore, we show that the effect is strongly enhanced during the topological phase transition tuned by interlayer translation. The effects point to a new electric control on layer quantum degree of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform infrared magneto-spectroscopy of Landau level (LL) transitions in dual-gated bilayer graphene. At $\nu=4$ when the zeroth LL (octet) is filled, two resonances are observed indicating the opening of a gap. At $\nu=0$ when the octet is half-filled, multiple resonances disperse non-monotonically with increasing displacement field, $D$, perpendicular to the sheet, showing a phase transition at modest displacement fields from a canted anti-ferromagnet (CAFM) to the layer-polarized state, with a gap that opens linearly in $D$. When $D=0$ and $\nu$ is varied, resonances at $\pm\nu$ show an electron-hole asymmetry with multiple line splittings as the octet is progressively filled. The $\nu=4$ data show good agreement with predictions from a mean-field Hartree-Fock calculation when accounting for multiple tight-binding terms in a four-band model of bilayer graphene. However even by incorporating a valley interaction anisotropy tuned to the CAFM ground state, only partial agreement is found at $\nu=0$. Our results suggest additional physics is required to understand bilayer graphene at half-filling.</description>

      <title>Direct and indirect spin current generation and spin-orbit torques in ferromagnet/nonmagnet/ferromagnet trilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torques in ferromagnet/nonmagnet/ferromagnet trilayers are studied using a combination of symmetry analysis, circuit theory, semiclassical simulations, and first-principles calculations using the non-equilibrium Green's function method with supercell disorder averaging. We focus on unconventional processes involving the interplay between the two ferromagnetic layers, which are classified into direct and indirect mechanisms. The direct mechanism involves spin current generation by one ferromagnetic layer and its subsequent absorption by the other. In the indirect mechanism, the in-plane spin-polarized current from one ferromagnetic layer ``leaks'' into the other layer, where it is converted into an out-of-plane spin current and reabsorbed by the original layer. The direct mechanism results in a predominantly dampinglike torque, which damps the magnetization towards a certain direction $\mathbf{s}_d$. The indirect mechanism results in a predominantly fieldlike torque with respect to a generally different direction $\mathbf{s}_f$. Similar to the current-in-plane giant magnetoresistance, the indirect mechanism is only active if the thickness of the nonmagnetic spacer is smaller than or comparable to the mean-free path. Numerical calculations for a semiclassical model based on the Boltzmann equation confirm the presence of both direct and indirect mechanisms of spin current generation. First-principles calculations reveal sizeable unconventional spin-orbit torques in Co/Cu/Co, Py/Cu/Py, and Co/Pt/Co trilayers and provide strong evidence of indirect spin current generation.</description>

Abstract: The photonic spin Hall effect of light beams reflected from the surfaces of various two-dimensional hexagonal crystalline structures, considering their associated time-reversal $\mathcal{T}$ and inversion $\mathcal{I}$ symmetries, is investigated. Employing the Haldane model with tunable parameters as a generic model, we examine the longitudinal and transverse spin-separations of the reflected beam in both topological non-trivial and trivial systems. The study reveals that the sign switching of the PSHE in these materials is attributed to the non-trivial and trivial topology. By manipulating the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and external electric fields, we demonstrate topological phase transitions in buckled Xene monolayer materials through the photonic spin Hall effect. Different behaviors of the photonic spin Hall effect are observed in various topological phases within these materials. Additionally, we explore the reflected spin and valley-polarized spatial shifts in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. The photonic spin Hall effect in buckled Xene monolayer materials and transition metal dichalcogenides is highly influenced by the spin and valley degrees of freedom of charge carriers, offering a promising avenue to explore spintronics and valleytronics in these hexagonal materials. We propose that the photonic spin Hall effect in Haldane materials can serve as a metrological tool for optical parameter characterization and as a promising method for determining Chern numbers and topological phase transitions through direct optical weak measurement techniques.</description>

      <title>Sliding Dynamics of Current-Driven Skyrmion Crystal and Helix in Chiral Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The skyrmion crystal (SkX) and helix (HL) phases, present in typical chiral magnets, can each be considered as forms of density waves but with distinct topologies. The SkX exhibits gyrodynamics analogous to electrons under a magnetic field, while the HL state resembles topological trivial spin density waves. However, unlike the charge density waves, the theoretical analysis of the sliding motion of SkX and HL remains unclear, especially regarding the similarities and differences in sliding dynamics between these two spin density waves. In this work, we systematically explore the sliding dynamics of SkX and HL in chiral magnets in the limit of large current density. We demonstrate that the sliding dynamics of both SkX and HL can be unified within the same theoretical framework as density waves, despite their distinct microscopic orders. Furthermore, we highlight the significant role of gyrotropic sliding induced by impurity effects in the SkX state, underscoring the impact of nontrivial topology on the sliding motion of density waves. Our theoretical analysis shows that the effect of impurity pinning is much stronger in HL compared with SkX, i.e., $\chi^{SkX}/\chi^{HL}\sim \alpha^2$ ($\chi^{SkX}$, $\chi^{HL}$: susceptibility to the impurity potential, $\alpha$ ($\ll 1$) is the Gilbert damping). Moreover, the velocity correction is mostly in the transverse direction to the current in SkX. These results are further substantiated by realistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations.</description>

Abstract: A Josephson junction, formed between two phase-biased superconductors and a normal metal, hosts a discrete spectrum of Andreev bound states (ABS), as theoretically investigated by Kulik, and, later, by Ishii and by Bagwell. In this paper, we develop a theory for spectroscopy of Andreev bound states (ABS) in long ballistic Andreev interferometers. We specifically demonstrate that the differential conductance can directly probe the ABS spectrum, serving as an alternative to the more complex microwave spectroscopy technique. We consider three frameworks in our theoretical analysis: (i) Perturbation theory in the tunneling amplitudes, which leads to nonstandard phase-sensitive Andreev reflections coupling the supercurrent to the nonequilibrium populations in the normal region; (ii) Nonperturbative transport theory valid for all orders in tunneling and all dimensions of the device; and (iii) Physically-motivated approximations to visualize the conductance maps in the (flux, voltage) plane. We further show that our theory can capture the results of recent experiments by Penn State and Harvard groups.</description>

      <title>Phase shifts, band geometry and responses in triple-Q charge and spin density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triple-Q density waves are commonly found in various materials, such as charge density waves in transition metal dichalcogenides and spin density waves (skyrmion crystals) in B20 compounds. Compared to single-Q density waves, triple-Q density waves possess an additional internal degree of freedom-a phase shift arising from the phase of the order parameters, in addition to the translations of the density waves. In this study, we systematically investigate the significant effects stemming from both triple-Q CDW and SDW order parameters, with particular emphasis on potential phase shifts. We demonstrate that these phase shifts play a crucial role in influencing the interference effects of triple-Q density waves on electronic states. Due to such interference, the band geometry in the momentum space becomes nontrivial at the hot spots, where multiband Dirac-like fermions are induced near the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we explicitly establish that the nontrivial band geometry, combined with symmetry-breaking induced by phase shifts, leads to a variety of intriguing linear and nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of the Landau level collapse in graphene ribbons in crossed magnetic and in-plane electric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the low-energy effective theory alongside a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we explore the Landau level collapse phenomenon, uncovering previously undisclosed features. We consider both finite-width graphene ribbons and semi-infinite geometries subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field and an in-plane electric field, applied perpendicular to both zigzag and armchair edges. In the semi-infinite geometry the hole (electron)-like Landau levels collapse as the ratio of electric and magnetic fields reaches the critical value $ +(-) 1$. On the other hand, the energies of the electron (hole)-like levels remain distinct near the edge and deeply within the bulk approaching each other asymptotically for the same critical value. In the finite geometry, we show that the electron (hole)-like levels become denser and merge, forming a band.</description>

      <title>Polariton assisted incoherent to coherent excitation energy transfer between colloidal nanocrystal quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of energy transfer between two nanocrystal quantum dots placed within an optical microcavity. By adjusting the coupling strength between the cavity photon mode and the quantum dots, we have the capacity to fine-tune the effective coupling between the donor and acceptor. Introducing a nonadiabatic parameter, $\gamma$, governed by the coupling to the cavity mode, we demonstrate the system's capability to shift from the overdamped Forster regime ($\gamma \ll 1$) to an underdamped coherent regime ($\gamma \gg 1$). In the latter regime, characterized by swift energy transfer rates, the dynamics are influenced by decoherence times. To illustrate this, we study the exciton energy transfer dynamics between two closely positioned CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots with sizes and separations relevant to experimental conditions. Employing an atomistic approach, we calculate the excitonic level arrangement, exciton-phonon interactions, and transition dipole moments of the quantum dots within the microcavity. These parameters are then utilized to define a model Hamiltonian. Subsequently, we apply a generalized non-Markovian quantum Redfield equation to delineate the dynamics within the polaritonic framework.</description>

      <title>Radiation-induced dynamical formation of Floquet-Bloch bands in Dirac Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments, combing ultrafast strong-field irradiation of surfaces with time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, allow for monitoring the time-dependent charge carrier dynamics and the build-up of transient sidebands due to the radiation pulses. While these structures are reminiscent of Floquet-Bloch bands, standard Floquet theory is not applicable since it requires a strictly time-periodic driving field. To study the emergence and formation of such sidebands, i.e. to provide a link between common Floquet physics and dynamical mechanisms underlying short driving pulses, we consider a generalization of Floquet theory, the so-called $t-t^{\prime}$ formalism. This approach naturally extents Floquet theory to driving field amplitudes with a superimposed envelope shape. Motivated by experiments we study 2D Dirac Hamiltonians subject to linearly and circularly polarised light waves with a Gaussian field envelope of a few cycles. For these Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonians we study the evolution of their Floquet-Bloch spectra, accompanied by a systematic analysis of the time-dependent (sideband) transitions. We show that sideband occupation requires circularly polarized light for linear Dirac systems such as graphene, while for Dirac models with trigonal warping, describing surface states of topological insulators such as Bi$_2$ Se$_3$, both linearly and circularly polarised pulses induce sideband excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is extensive current interest about electronic topology in correlated settings. In strongly correlated systems, contours of Green's function zeros may develop in frequency-momentum space, and their role in correlated topology has increasingly been recognized. However, whether and how the zeros contribute to electronic properties is a matter of uncertainty. Here we address the issue in an exactly solvable model for Mott insulator. We show that the Green's function zeros contribute to several physically measurable correlation functions, in a way that does not run into inconsistencies. In particular, the physical properties remain robust to chemical potential variations up to the Mott gap as it should be based on general considerations. Our work sets the stage for further understandings on the rich interplay among topology, symmetry and strong correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While altermagnetic materials are characterized by a vanishing net magnetic moment, their symmetry in principle allows for the existence of an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Here we introduce a model with altermagnetism in which the emergence of an AHE is driven by interactions. This model is grounded in a modified Kane-Mele framework with antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-spin correlations. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations show that the system undergoes a finite temperature phase transition governed by a primary AFM order parameter accompanied by a secondary one of Haldane type. The emergence of both orders turns the metallic state of the system, away from half-filling, to an altermagnet with a finite anomalous Hall conductivity. A mean field ansatz corroborates these results, which pave the way into the study of correlation induced altermagnets with finite Berry curvature.</description>

      <title>Topological pairing of composite fermions via criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at the filling factor with an even denominator, 5/2, occurs despite the expectation, due to the electron statistics, that the denominator must be an odd number. It is believed that the Cooper pairing of underlying quasiparticles, composite fermions (CFs), leads to the explanation of this effect. Such a state should have a Pfaffian form of the BCS wave function (due to the absence of spin) and non-Abelian statistics of possible vortex-like excitations (due to the $p$-wave nature of the pairing). Here we expose the origin of pairing by using the effective dipole representation of the problem and show that pairing is encoded in a Hamiltonian that describes the interaction of the charge density with dipoles i.e. the current of CFs. The necessary condition for the paired state to exist is the effective dipole physics at the Fermi level as a consequence of the non-trivial topology of the ideal band in which electrons live - a Landau level (LL); the paired state is a resolution of the unstable, critical behaviour characterized by the distancing of correlation hole with respect to electron (and thus dipole) at the Fermi level due to the topology. We describe analytically this deconfined critical point, at which deconfinement of Majorana neutral fermions takes place. In the presence of large, short-range repulsive interaction inside a LL, the critical behavior may be stabilized into a regularized Fermi-liquid-like (FLL) state, like the one that characterizes the physics in the lowest LL (LLL), but in general, for an interaction with slowly decaying pseudopotentials, the system is prone to pairing.</description>

      <title>Beltrami fields, dispersive electromagnetic waves and gravitational spheromaks from chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly gives rise to certain modifications in the conserved currents. In the case of the Maxwell gauge fields there appears a new contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the chiral magnetic effect and it is widely discussed in the current literature. In the case of the gravitational field, the anomaly, as we show here, induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the possible manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and in hydrodynamics in the chiral media. We also make some comments regarding the backreaction effects in electrodynamics in the chiral media. In each of these directions we observe the systematical appearance of the Beltrami type fields. In electrodynamics or in hydrodynamics the Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector that is parallel to its own curl. We suggest a generalization of the Beltrami fields for the tensorial gravitational perturbations. The respective solutions to the gravitational equations we call gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics in the chiral media the vorticity is asymptotically a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>
