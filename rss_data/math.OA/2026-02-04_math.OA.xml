      <title>Topologically free non-Hausdorff groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study three conditions that control the behaviour of isotropy in \'etale groupoids, and their relationships under the additional assumptions of second-countability and Hausdorffness. We examine a number of examples that show these properties are distinct. Working under the assumption of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, excluding choice, we then examine an alternate characterization of topological freeness, first introduced by Anantharaman-Delaroche, in the non-Hausdorff setting. Finally, we prove an equivalence between the Baire Category Theorem and an \'etale groupoid theorem, along with similar equivalences to other weakenings of the Axiom of Choice.</description>

      <title>Base norm spaces--classical, complex, and noncommutative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of base norm spaces to the complex case, and further to the noncommutative setting relevant to `quantum convexity'. In particular, we establish the duality between complex Archimedean order unit spaces and complex base norm spaces, as well as the corresponding duality between their noncommutative counterparts. Additional topics include an exploration of natural connections with various notions of quantum convexity and regularity of noncommutative convex sets, and an analysis of how these concepts interact with complexification. We also define, as in the classical case, a class that contains and generates the noncommutative base norm spaces, but is defined by fewer axioms. We show how this may be applied to provide new and interesting examples of noncommutative base norm spaces.</description>

      <title>Regularity of compact convex sets--classical and noncommutative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical theory of regularity of embeddings of compact convex sets was developed in the 1970s, exclusively in the real case, and even there it does not appear to have been stated in its simplest form. We begin by revisiting this setting, showing that under a reasonable condition, every locally convex topological vector space $E$ that contains and is spanned by a compact convex set lying in a hyperplane not passing through the origin, is a (specific) dual Banach space equipped with the weak* topology. Second, we establish the corresponding regularity theory for convex sets in complex LCTVS's. Third, we develop a theory of regular embeddings for complex noncommutative convex sets, in the sense of Davidson and Kennedy. Finally, we use the complex theory to derive a theory of regular embeddings for real noncommutative convex sets. Interestingly, at present there appears to be no direct route to the latter.</description>

      <title>The R-Shilov boundary for a local operator space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To extend the notion of the injective envelope of a unital operator space to the locally convex case, Dosi (2014) first introduced the notion of the injective R-envelope for a unital operator space and then defined the injective R-envelope for a unital local operator space as the closure of the injective R-envelope for its bounded part. In this paper, we investigate the existence of the Shilov boundary ideal in this context, as defined by Arveson (1969). To do this, by following the conceptual frameworks underlying Hamana's constructions of the injective envelope and the C*-envelope, respectively, we define the notions of the injective R-envelope and the R-C*-envelope for a unital local operator space. Furthermore, we show that the injective R-envelope construction given by us coincides with the one given by Dosi (2014).</description>

      <title>Angles Between Intermediate Operator Subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by [2] and [5], the notions of interior and exterior angles between a pair of compatible intermediate W*-subalgebras of an inclusion of W*-algebras with a normal conditional expectation with finite probabilistic index are introduced. This is then employed effectively to define the interior angle between a pair of compatible intermediate C*-subalgebras of an inclusion of non-unital C*-algebras with a conditional expectation with finite Watatani index. It is also shown that the interior angle is stable under the minimal tensor product of unital C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>The Weyl-von Neumann theorem for antilinear skew-self-adjoint operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the Weyl-von Neumann theorem for antilinear skew-self-adjoint operators. More specifically, we prove the following:
  Let $A$ be an antilinear skew-self-adjoint operator on a separable Hilbert space $H$ whose kernel is either even dimensional or infinite dimensional. Let $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Then for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists an antilinear skew block diagonal operator $D$ and an antilinear Schatten $p$-class operator $K$ such that $A=K+D$ with $\|K\|_{p}&lt;\epsilon$.
  As a consequence of this, we prove the Weyl-von Neumann theorem for complex skew-symmetric operators:
  Let $\tau$ be a conjugation on $H$ and let $T$ be a $\tau$-skew-symmetric bounded linear operator with $\dim N(T)=\infty$ or $\dim N(T)$ is even. Let $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Then for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists a $\tau$-skew-symmetric Schatten $p$-class operator $K$, a skew-symmetric block diagonal operator $D$ and a unitary operator $U$ such that $T=K+UDU^{tr}$ and $\|K\|_{p}&lt;\epsilon$, where $U^{tr}$ is the transpose of $U$ with respect to an orthonormal basis ${\{e_n:n\in \mathbb N}\}$ such that $\tau(e_n)=e_n$ for each $n\in \mathbb N$.
  Furthermore, the above result holds even without any assumption on the dimension of $N(T)$, provided that $N(T)=N(T^*)$.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein's bound for wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $B$ be a spatial region of width $2R$ and $\Phi$ a Klein-Gordon wave packet localized in $B$ at time zero. We show the inequality $S \leq 2\pi R E$; here, $S$ is the entropy of $\Phi$ contained in a region $B$, and $E$ is the energy content of $\Phi$ within $B$. We consider a wider setting and formulate a variational problem aimed at minimizing our bound when $\Phi$ is not localized in $B$. Our inequality holds in more generality in the framework of local, Poincar\'e covariant nets of standard subspaces and is related to the Bekenstein inequality. We point out a general bound that is compatible with the recent numerical computations by Bostelmann, Cadamuro, and Minz concerning the one-particle modular Hamiltonian of a scalar massive quantum Klein-Gordon field. We also provide a version of the entropy balance and ant formulas for wave packets.</description>

      <title>Injective envelopes for locally C*-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of admissible injective envelope for a locally C*-algebra and show that each object in the category whose objects are unital Fr\'{e}chet locally C*-algebras and whose morphisms are unital admissible local completely positive maps has a unique admissible injective envelope. The concept of admissible injectivity is stronger than that of injectivity. As a consequence, we show that a unital Fr\'{e}chet locally W*-algebras is injective if and only if the C*-algebras from its Arens-Michael decomposition are injective.</description>

      <title>On the topological ranks of Banach $^*$-algebras associated with groups of subexponential growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group of subexponential growth and $\mathscr C\overset{q}{\to}G$ a Fell bundle. We show that any Banach $^*$-algebra that sits between the associated $\ell^1$-algebra $\ell^1( G\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$ and its $C^*$-envelope has the same topological stable rank and real rank as $\ell^1( G\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$. We apply this result to compute the topological stable rank and real rank of various classes of symmetrized twisted $L^p$-crossed products and show that some twisted $L^p$-crossed products have topological stable rank 1. Our results are new even in the case of (untwisted) group algebras.</description>

      <title>On the isomorphism problem for ultraproducts of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras in continuous model theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical model theory, the Keisler-Shelah theorem establishes a fundamental connection between the elementary equivalence of structures and the isomorphism of their ultrapowers. Motivated by this, one may ask whether an analogous relationship holds in the framework of continuous model theory, which naturally encompasses metric structures such as $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras. In this paper, we investigate the isomorphism problem for ultraproducts of operator algebras from a model-theoretic perspective. We prove that, assuming the negation of the continuum hypothesis, there exist two elementarily equivalent infinite-dimensional unital $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras $A$ and $B$ of size $\le \mathfrak c$ such that for all non-principal ultrafilters $\mathcal U, \mathcal V$ on $\omega$, the ultrapowers $A^{\mathcal U}$ and $B^{\mathcal V}$ are not isomorphic. This result provides a continuous analogue of certain classical theorems concerning ultraproducts and demonstrates that the model-theoretic behavior of $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras is closely related to set-theoretic principles such as the Continuum Hypothesis.</description>
