      <title>Simulations of Classical Three-Body Thermalization in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional systems, such as nanowires or electrons moving along strong magnetic field lines, have peculiar thermalization physics. The binary collision of point-like particles, typically the dominant process for reaching thermal equilibrium in higher dimensional systems, cannot thermalize a 1D system. We study how dilute classical 1D gases thermalize through three-body collisions. We consider a system of identical classical point particles with pairwise repulsive inverse power-law potential $V_{ij} \propto 1/|x_i-x_j|^n$ or the pairwise Lennard-Jones potential. Using Monte Carlo methods, we compute a collision kernel and use it in the Boltzmann equation to evolve a perturbed thermal state with temperature $T$ toward equilibrium. We explain the shape of the kernel and its dependence on the system parameters. Additionally, we implement molecular dynamics simulations of a many-body gas and show agreement with the Boltzmann evolution in the low density limit. For the inverse power-law potential, the rate of thermalization is proportional to $\rho^2 T^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{n}}$ where $\rho$ is the number density. The corresponding proportionality constant decreases with increasing $n$.</description>

      <title>Complex scaling calculation of phase shifts for positron collisions with positive ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present phase-shift calculations for positron collisions with positive ions using a complex scaling method (CSM). Based on the findings of this study [R. Suzuki, T. Myo, and K. Kat\={o}, Prog. Theor. Phys. 113, 1273 (2005).], we propose a modification of the phase shift in the CSM calculation, in which phase shifts are derived only from the complex eigenenergies of the CSM Hamiltonian. This modification is based on the fact that the contributions of high-lying complex eigenenergies can be approximated as a constant value in the case of a small collision energy, where neither target excitation nor positronium formation occurs. The proposed modification limits the contribution of the complex eigenenergies to the vicinity of the collision energy, which is also intuitively acceptable. We present a geometrical formulation of the modification and demonstrative calculations of positron scattering off positive ions. Our results agree well with those reported in the literature for the targets Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, H, He, He$^+$, and Li$^{2+}$. The phase shifts of positron scattering off a Li$^+$ ion have also been reported.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Phase Estimation</title>

Abstract: The goal of quantum metrology is to improve measurements' sensitivities by harnessing quantum resources. Metrologists often aim to maximize the quantum Fisher information, which bounds the measurement setup's sensitivity. In studies of fundamental limits on metrology, a paradigmatic setup features a qubit (spin-half system) subject to an unknown rotation. One obtains the maximal quantum Fisher information about the rotation if the spin begins in a state that maximizes the variance of the rotation-inducing operator. If the rotation axis is unknown, however, no optimal single-qubit sensor can be prepared. Inspired by simulations of closed timelike curves, we circumvent this limitation. We obtain the maximum quantum Fisher information about a rotation angle, regardless of the unknown rotation axis. To achieve this result, we initially entangle the probe qubit with an ancilla qubit. Then, we measure the pair in an entangled basis, obtaining more information about the rotation angle than any single-qubit sensor can achieve. We demonstrate this metrological advantage using a two-qubit superconducting quantum processor. Our measurement approach achieves a quantum advantage, outperforming every entanglement-free strategy.</description>

      <title>High-purity single-photon generation based on cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for generating a high-purity single photon on the basis of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme employs a four-level system including two excited states, two ground states, and two driving lasers; this structure allows the suppression of the re-excitation process due to the atomic decay, which is known to significantly degrade the single-photon purity in state-of-the-art photon sources using a three-level system. Our analysis shows that the re-excitation probability arbitrarily approaches zero without sacrificing the photon generation probability when increasing the power of the driving laser between the excited states. This advantage is achievable by using current cavity-QED technologies. Our scheme can contribute to developing distributed quantum computation or quantum communication with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Multi-junction surface ion trap for quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface ion traps with two-dimensional layouts of trapping regions are natural architectures for storing large numbers of ions and supporting the connectivity needed to implement quantum algorithms. Many of the components and operations needed to fully exploit this architecture have already been demonstrated, including operation at cryogenic temperatures with low heating, low excitation transport, and ion control and detection with integrated photonics. Here we demonstrate a trap that addresses the scaling challenge of increasing power dissipation as the RF electrode increases in size. By raising the RF electrode and removing most of the insulating dielectric layer below it we reduce both ohmic and dielectric power dissipation. We also measure heating rates across a range of motional frequencies and for different voltage sources in a trap with a raised RF electrode but solid dielectric.</description>

      <title>Generation and optimization of entanglement between giant atoms chirally coupled to spin cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a scheme for entanglement generation and optimization in giant atoms by coupling them to finite one-dimensional arrays of spins that behave as cavities. We find that high values for the concurrence can be achieved in small-sized cavities, being the generation time very short. When exciting the system by external means, optimal concurrence is obtained for very weak drivings. We also analyze the effect of disorder in these systems, showing that although the average concurrence decreases with disorder, high concurrences can still be obtained even in scenarios presenting strong disorder. This result leads us to propose an optimization procedure in which by engineering the on-site energies or hoppings in the cavity, concurrences close to 1 can be reached within an extremely short period of time.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multispecies Ion Transport in a Grid Based Surface-Electrode Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable method for the control of ion crystals in a grid-based surface electrode Paul trap and characterize it in the context of transport operations that sort and reorder multispecies crystals. By combining co-wiring of control electrodes at translationally symmetric locations in each grid site with the site-wise ability to exchange the voltages applied to two special electrodes gated by a binary input, site-dependent operations are achieved using only a fixed number of analog voltage signals and a single digital input per site. In two separate experimental systems containing nominally identical grid traps, one using $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^{+}$-$^{138}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$ crystals and the other $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$-$^{88}\mathrm{Sr}^{+}$, we demonstrate this method by characterizing the conditional intra-site crystal reorder and the conditional exchange of ions between adjacent sites on the grid. Averaged across a multi-site region of interest, we measure sub-quanta motional excitation in the axial in-phase and out-of-phase modes of the crystals following these operations at exchange rates of 2.5 kHz. These conditional transport operations display all necessary components for sorting qubits, and could be extended to implement other conditional operations involving control fields such as gates, initialization, and measurement.</description>

      <title>Excitation of the $^{229}$Th nucleus by the hole in the inner electronic shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $^{229}$Th nucleus has a long-lived isomeric state $A^*$ at 8.338(24) eV [Kraemer et al, Nature, \textbf{617}, 706 (2023)]. This state is connected to the ground state by an M1 transition. For a hydrogenlike Th ion in the $1s$ state the hyperfine structure splitting is about 0.7 eV. This means that the hyperfine interaction can mix the nuclear ground state with the isomeric state with a mixing coefficient $\beta$ about 0.03. If the electron is suddenly removed from this system, the nucleus will be left in the mixed state. The probability to find the nucleus in the isomeric state $A^*$ is equal to $\beta^2\sim 10^{-3}$. For the $2s$ state the effect is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller. An atom with a hole in the $1s$ or $2s$ shell is similar to the hydrogenlike atom, only the hole has a short lifetime $\tau$. After the hole is filled, there is a non-zero probability to find the nucleus in the $A^*$ state. Estimates of this probability are presented along with a discussion of possible experiments on Th-doped xenotime-type orthophosphate crystals and other broad band gap materials.</description>

      <title>3D surface profilometry using neutral helium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional mapping of surface structures is important in a wide range of biological, technological, healthcare and research applications, including taxonomy, microfluidics and fabrication. Neutral helium atom beams have been established as a sensitive probe of topography and have already enabled structural information to be obtained from delicate samples, where conventional probes would cause damage. Here, we demonstrate empirical reconstruction of a complete surface profile using measurements from a scanning helium microscope (SHeM), using the heliometric stereo method and a single detector instrument geometry. Results for the surface profile of tetrahedral aluminum potassium sulphate crystals demonstrate the areas of surfaces and facet orientations can be recovered to within 5% of the expected values.</description>
