      <title>A Graph Width Perspective on Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles I: Treewidth, Pathwidth, and Grid Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path or a Hamiltonian cycle with precedence constraints in the form of a partial order on the vertex set. We show that the path problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete for graphs of pathwidth 4 while the cycle problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete on graphs of pathwidth 5. We complement these results by giving polynomial-time algorithms for graphs of pathwidth 3 and treewidth 2 for Hamiltonian paths as well as pathwidth 4 and treewidth 3 for Hamiltonian cycles. Furthermore, we study the complexity of the path and cycle problems on rectangular grid graphs of bounded height. For these, we show that the path and cycle problems are $\mathsf{NP}$-complete when the height of the grid is greater or equal to 7 and 9, respectively. In the variant where we look for minimum edge-weighted Hamiltonian paths and cycles, the problems are $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for heights 5 and 6, respectively.</description>

      <title>Linear Layouts of Graphs with Priority Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear layout of a graph consists of a linear ordering of its vertices and a partition of its edges into pages such that the edges assigned to the same page obey some constraint. The two most prominent and widely studied types of linear layouts are stack and queue layouts, in which any two edges assigned to the same page are forbidden to cross and nest, respectively. The names of these two layouts derive from the fact that, when parsing the graph according to the linear vertex ordering, the edges in a single page can be stored using a single stack or queue, respectively. Recently, the concepts of stack and queue layouts have been extended by using a double-ended queue or a restricted-input queue for storing the edges of a page. We extend this line of study to edge-weighted graphs by introducing priority queue layouts, that is, the edges on each page are stored in a priority queue whose keys are the edge weights. First, we show that there are edge-weighted graphs that require a linear number of priority queues. Second, we characterize the graphs that admit a priority queue layout with a single queue, regardless of the edge-weight function, and we provide an efficient recognition algorithm. Third, we show that the number of priority queues required independently of the edge-weight function is bounded by the pathwidth of the graph, but can be arbitrarily large already for graphs of treewidth two. Finally, we prove that determining the minimum number of priority queues is NP-complete if the linear ordering of the vertices is fixed.</description>

      <title>Catching Rats in $H$-minor-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every $H$-minor-free graph that also excludes a $(k \times k)$-grid as a minor has treewidth/branchwidth bounded from above by a function $f(t,k)$ that is linear in $k$ and polynomial in $t := |V(H)|$. Such a result was proven originally by [Demaine &amp; Hajiaghayi, Combinatorica, 2008], where $f$ was indeed linear in $k$. However the dependency in $t$ in this result was non-explicit (and huge). Later, [Kawarabayashi &amp; Kobayashi, JCTB, 2020] showed that this bound can be estimated to be $f(t,k)\in 2^{\mathcal{O}(t\log t)} \cdot k$. Wood recently asked whether $f$ can be pushed further to be polynomial, while maintaining the linearity on $k$. We answer this in a particularly strong sense, by showing that the treewidth/branchwidth of $G$ is in $\mathcal{O}(gk + t^{2304}),$ where $g$ is the Euler genus of $H$. This directly yields $f(t,k)= \mathcal{O}(t^2k + t^{2304})$.
  Our methods build on techniques for branchwidth and on new bounds and insights for the Graph Minor Structure Theorem (GMST) due to [Gorsky, Seweryn &amp; Wiederrecht, 2025, arXiv:2504.02532]. In particular, we prove a variant of the GMST that ensures some helpful properties for the minor relation. We further employ our methods to provide approximation algorithms for the treewidth/branchwidth of $H$-minor-free graphs. In particular, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and every $t$-vertex graph $H$ with Euler genus $g$, we give a $(g + \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the branchwidth of $H$-minor-free graphs running in $2^{\mathsf{poly}(t) / \varepsilon} \cdot \mathsf{poly}(n)$-time. Our algorithms explicitly return either an appropriate branch-decomposition or a grid-minor certifying a negative answer.</description>

      <title>Rises for Measuring Local Distributivity in Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributivity is a well-established and extensively studied notion in lattice theory. In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore, we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive. We additionally study how join-distributivity manifests on the level of ordered sets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Learning and Compressing Monophonic Halfspaces in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract notions of convexity over the vertices of a graph, and corresponding notions of halfspaces, have recently gained attention from the machine learning community. In this work we study monophonic halfspaces, a notion of graph halfspaces defined through closure under induced paths. Our main result is a $2$-satisfiability based decomposition theorem, which allows one to represent monophonic halfspaces as a disjoint union of certain vertex subsets. Using this decomposition, we achieve efficient and (nearly) optimal algorithms for various learning problems, such as teaching, active, and online learning. Most notably, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for empirical risk minimization. Independently of the decomposition theorem, we obtain an efficient, stable, and proper sample compression scheme. This makes monophonic halfspaces efficiently learnable with proper learners and linear error rate $1/\varepsilon$ in the realizable PAC setting. Our results answer open questions from the literature, and show a stark contrast with geodesic halfspaces, for which most of the said learning problems are NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Simple Approximations for General Spanner Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a graph with n nodes and m edges, independent edge weights and lengths, and arbitrary distance demands for node pairs. The spanner problem asks for a minimum-weight subgraph that satisfies these demands via sufficiently short paths w.r.t. the edge lengths. For multiplicative alpha-spanners (where demands equal alpha times the original distances) and assuming that each edge's weight equals its length, the simple Greedy heuristic by Alth\"ofer et al. (1993) is known to yield strong solutions, both in theory and practice. To obtain guarantees in more general settings, recent approximations typically abandon this simplicity and practicality. Still, so far, there is no known non-trivial approximation algorithm for the spanner problem in its most general form. We provide two surprisingly simple approximations algorithms. In general, our Adapted Greedy achieves the first unconditional approximation ratio of m, which is non-trivial due to the independence of weights and lengths. Crucially, it maintains all size and weight guarantees Greedy is known for, i.e., in the aforementioned multiplicative alpha-spanner scenario and even for additive +beta-spanners. Further, it generalizes some of these size guarantees to derive new weight guarantees. Our second approach, Randomized Rounding, establishes a graph transformation that allows a simple rounding scheme over a standard multicommodity flow LP. It yields an O(n log n)-approximation, assuming integer lengths and polynomially bounded distance demands. The only other known approximation guarantee in this general setting requires several complex subalgorithms and analyses, yet we match it up to a factor of O(n^{1/5-eps}) using standard tools. Further, on bounded-degree graphs, we yield the first O(log n) approximation ratio for constant-bounded distance demands (beyond multiplicative 2-spanners in unit-length graphs).</description>

      <title>Factorization norms and an inverse theorem for MaxCut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that Boolean matrices with bounded $\gamma_2$-norm or bounded normalized trace norm must contain a linear-sized all-ones or all-zeros submatrix, verifying a conjecture of Hambardzumyan, Hatami, and Hatami. We also present further structural results about Boolean matrices of bounded $\gamma_2$-norm and discuss applications in communication complexity, operator theory, spectral graph theory, and extremal combinatorics.
  As a key application, we establish an inverse theorem for MaxCut. A celebrated result of Edwards states that every graph $G$ with $m$ edges has a cut of size at least $\frac{m}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{8m+1}-1}{8}$, with equality achieved by complete graphs with an odd number of vertices. To contrast this, we prove that if the MaxCut of $G$ is at most $\frac{m}{2}+O(\sqrt{m})$, then $G$ must contain a clique of size $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$.</description>

      <title>Translating between the representations of an acyclic convex geometry of bounded degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating the irreducible closed sets of a closure system given by an implicational base. In the context of Horn logic, these correspond to Horn expressions and characteristic models, respectively. To date, the complexity status of this problem is widely open, and it is further known to generalize the notorious hypergraph dualization problem, even in the context of acyclic convex geometries, i.e., closure systems admitting an acyclic implicational base. This paper studies this later class with a focus on the degree, which corresponds to the maximal number of implications in which an element occurs. We show that the problem is tractable for bounded values of this parameter, even when relaxed to the notions of premise- and conclusion-degree. Our algorithms rely on structural properties of acyclic convex geometries and involve various techniques from algorithmic enumeration such as solution graph traversal, saturation techniques, and a sequential approach leveraging from acyclicity. They are shown to perform in incremental-polynomial time for the computation of irreducible closed sets, and in polynomial time for the construction of an implicational base. Finally, we argue that our running times cannot be improved to polynomial delay using the standard framework of flashlight search.</description>

      <title>The Fagnano Triangle Patrolling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13153v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a combinatorial optimization problem that involves patrolling the edges of an acute triangle using a unit-speed agent. The goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, which is defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. This problem has roots in a centuries-old optimization problem posed by Fagnano in 1775, who sought to determine the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It is well-known that the orthic triangle, giving rise to a periodic and cyclic trajectory obeying the laws of geometric optics, is the optimal solution to Fagnano's problem. Such trajectories are known as Fagnano orbits, or more generally as billiard trajectories. We demonstrate that the orthic triangle is also an optimal solution to the patrolling problem.
  Our main contributions pertain to new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. In particular, as an artifact of our arguments, we introduce a novel 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. We prove that there exist infinitely many well-structured billiard-type optimal trajectories for this problem, including the orthic trajectory, which has the special property of minimizing the visitation time gap between any two consecutively visited edges. Complementary to that, we also examine the cost of dynamic, sub-optimal trajectories to the 1-gap patrolling optimization problem. These trajectories result from a greedy algorithm and can be implemented by a computationally primitive mobile agent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining the minimal genus of a simple finite connected graph. We present an algorithm which, for an arbitrary graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, determines the orientable genus of $G$ in $O(n(4^m/n)^{n/t})$ steps where $t$ is the girth of $G$. This algorithm avoids difficulties that many other genus algorithms have with handling bridge placements which is a well-known issue. The algorithm has a number of useful properties for practical use: it is simple to implement, it outputs the faces of an optimal embedding, and it iteratively narrows both upper and lower bounds. We illustrate the algorithm by determining the genus of the $(3,12)$ cage (which is 17); other graphs are also considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.03639v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the focused study of constant-cost randomized communication, with emphasis on its connection to graph representations. We observe that constant-cost randomized communication problems are equivalent to hereditary (i.e. closed under taking induced subgraphs) graph classes which admit constant-size adjacency sketches and probabilistic universal graphs (PUGs), which are randomized versions of the well-studied adjacency labeling schemes and induced-universal graphs. This gives a new perspective on long-standing questions about the existence of these objects, including new methods of constructing adjacency labeling schemes.
  We ask three main questions about constant-cost communication, or equivalently, constant-size PUGs: (1) Are there any natural, non-trivial problems aside from Equality and k-Hamming Distance which have constant-cost communication? We provide a number of new examples, including deciding whether two vertices have path-distance at most k in a planar graph, and showing that constant-size PUGs are preserved by the Cartesian product operation. (2) What structures of a problem explain the existence or non-existence of a constant-cost protocol? We show that in many cases a Greater-Than subproblem is such a structure. (3) Is the Equality problem complete for constant-cost randomized communication? We show that it is not: there are constant-cost problems which do not reduce to Equality.</description>

      <title>Aligning Multiple Inhomogeneous Random Graphs: Fundamental Limits of Exact Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies fundamental limits for recovering the underlying correspondence among multiple correlated graphs. In the setting of inhomogeneous random graphs, we present and analyze a matching algorithm: first partially match the graphs pairwise and then combine the partial matchings by transitivity. Our analysis yields a sufficient condition on the problem parameters to exactly match all nodes across all the graphs. In the setting of homogeneous (Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi) graphs, we show that this condition is also necessary, i.e. the algorithm works down to the information theoretic threshold. This reveals a scenario where exact matching between two graphs alone is impossible, but leveraging more than two graphs allows exact matching among all the graphs. Converse results are also given in the inhomogeneous setting and transitivity again plays a role. Along the way, we derive independent results about the k-core of inhomogeneous random graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An \textit{$(n,m)$-graph} $G$ is a graph having both arcs and edges, and its arcs (resp., edges) are labeled using one of the $n$ (resp., $m$) different symbols. An \textit{$(n,m)$-complete graph} $G$ is an $(n,m)$-graph without loops or multiple edges in its underlying graph such that identifying any pair of vertices results in a loop or parallel adjacencies with distinct labels. We show that a planar $(n,m)$-complete graph cannot have more than $3(2n+m)^2+(2n+m)+1$ vertices, for all $(n,m) \neq (0,1)$ and that the bound is tight. This positively settles a conjecture by Bensmail \textit{et al.}~[Graphs and Combinatorics 2017].</description>

      <title>Time to Rethink AI for Combinatorial Optimization: Classical Algorithms Remain Tough to Match</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This position paper argues that the machine learning community should fundamentally rethink how AI-inspired methods are developed and evaluated for combinatorial optimization (CO). We present comprehensive empirical benchmarks comparing various recent AI-inspired GPU-based methods with several classical CPU-based solvers on the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Strikingly, even on in-distribution random graphs, leading AI-inspired methods are consistently outperformed by the state-of-the-art classical solver KaMIS, and some AI-inspired methods frequently fail to surpass even the simplest degree-based greedy heuristic. To better understand the source of these failures, we introduce a novel analysis, serialization, which reveals that non-backtracking AI methods, such as LTFT (based on GFlowNets), end up reasoning similarly to the simplest degree-based greedy heuristic, and thus worse than KaMIS.
  Our findings reveal three core issues: (1) Limited benchmarks and evaluation - AI-inspired methods are often tested only on small instances with very limited inference time, which covers up issues with scalability and resource usage; (2) Intrinsic hardness and learning limits - even under ideal, in-distribution conditions, learning-based approaches lag behind classical heuristics, highlighting inherent barriers that receive little attention; and (3) Insufficient use and understanding of classical heuristics - current learning frameworks often neglect to incorporate effective classical techniques.
  Although we use MIS as a testbed, similar gaps and challenges have been reported in other combinatorial optimization problems, suggesting broader relevance for our recommendations. We propose that future research must address these issues by rigorous benchmarking, deepening understanding of learning limitations, and integrating classical heuristics into AI-inspired methods.</description>

      <title>Solving Partial Dominating Set and Related Problems Using Twin-Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18218</link>

Abstract: Partial vertex cover and partial dominating set are two well-investigated optimization problems. While they are $\rm W[1]$-hard on general graphs, they have been shown to be fixed-parameter tractable on many sparse graph classes, including nowhere-dense classes. In this paper, we demonstrate that these problems are also fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the twin-width of a graph. Indeed, we establish a more general result: every graph property that can be expressed by a logical formula of the form $\phi\equiv\exists x_1\cdots \exists x_k \sum_{\alpha \in I} \#y\,\psi_\alpha(x_1,\ldots,x_k,y)\ge t$, where $\psi_\alpha$ is a quantifier-free formula for each $\alpha \in I$, $t$ is an arbitrary number, and $\#y$ is a counting quantifier, can be evaluated in time $f(d,k)n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $d$ is the width of a contraction sequence that is part of the input. In addition to the aforementioned problems, this includes also connected partial dominating set and independent partial dominating set.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Sets for Proving Bounds on Rado Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a linear equation $\cal E$ of the form $ax + by = cz$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers, the $k$-colour Rado number $R_k({\cal E})$ is the smallest positive integer $n$, if it exists, such that every $k$-colouring of the positive integers $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ contains a monochromatic solution to $\cal E$. In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</description>
