      <title>Some applications of canonical metrics to Landau-Ginzburg models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that a given smooth del Pezzo surface or Fano threefold $X$ admits a choice of log Calabi-Yau compactified mirror toric Landau-Ginzburg model (with respect to certain fixed K\"ahler classes and Gorenstein toric degenerations). Here we consider the problem of constructing a corresponding map $\Theta$ from a domain in the complexified K\"ahler cone of $X$ to a well-defined, separated moduli space $\mathfrak{M}$ of polarised manifolds endowed with a canonical metric. We prove a complete result for del Pezzos and a partial result for some special Fano threefolds. The construction uses some fundamental results in the theory of constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics. As a consequence $\mathfrak{M}$ parametrises $K$-stable manifolds and the domain of $\Theta$ is endowed with the pullback of a Weil-Petersson form.</description>

Abstract: We extend the notions of Hochschild and cyclic homology to morphisms from algebraic spaces to algebraic stacks. Using this, we obtain generalizations to log schemes in the sense of Fontaine and Illusie of these homology theories.</description>

      <title>Topological roots of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial of plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a set of topological roots of the local Bernstein-Sato polynomial of arbitrary plane curve singularities. These roots are characterized in terms of certain divisorial valuations and the numerical data of the minimal log resolution. In particular, this set of roots strictly contains both the opposites of the jumping numbers in $(0, 1)$ and the poles of the motivic zeta function counted with multiplicity. As a consequence, we prove the multiplicity part of the Strong Monodromy Conjecture for $n = 2$.</description>

      <title>A Functorial Version of Chevalley's Theorem on Constructible Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To determine whether an $n\times n$-matrix has rank at most $r$ it suffices to check that the $(r+1)\times (r+1)$-minors have rank at most $r$. In other words, to describe the set of $n\times n$-matrices with the property of having rank at most $r$, we only need the description of the corresponding subset of $(r+1)\times (r+1)$-matrices. We will generalize this observation to a large class of subsets of tensor spaces. A description of certain subsets of a high-dimensional tensor space can always be pulled back from a description of the corresponding subset in a fixed lower-dimensional tensor space.</description>

      <title>Higher dimensional moduli spaces on Kuznetsov components of Fano threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study moduli spaces of stable objects in the Kuznetsov components of Fano threefolds. We prove a general non-emptiness criterion for moduli spaces, which applies to the cases of prime Fano threefolds of index $1$, degree $10 \leq d \leq 18$, and index $2$, degree $d \leq 4$. In the second part, we focus on cubic threefolds. We show the irreducibility of the moduli spaces, and that the general fibers of the Abel--Jacobi maps from the moduli spaces to the intermediate Jacobian are Fano varieties. When the dimension is sufficiently large, we further show that the general fibers of the Abel--Jacobi maps are stably birational equivalent to each other. As an application of our methods, we prove Conjecture A.1 in [FGLZ24] concerning the existence of Lagrangian subvarieties in moduli spaces of stable objects in the Kuznetsov components of very general cubic fourfolds.</description>

      <title>Interpolation in Weighted Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over an algebraically closed field, the $\textit{double point interpolation}$ problem asks for the vector space dimension of the projective hypersurfaces of degree $d$ singular at a given set of points. After being open for 90 years, a series of papers by J. Alexander and A. Hirschowitz in 1992--1995 settled this question in what is referred to as the Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem. In this paper we primarily use commutative algebra to lay the groundwork necessary to prove analogous statements in the $\textit{weighted projective space}$, a natural generalization of the projective space. We show the Hilbert function of general simple points in any $n$-dimensional weighted projective space exhibits the expected behavior. We give an inductive procedure for weighted projective space, similar to that originally due to A. Terracini from 1915, to demonstrate an example of a weighted projective plane where the analogue of the Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem holds without exceptions. We further adapt Terracini's lemma regarding secant varieties to give an interpolation bound for an infinite family of weighted projective planes.</description>

      <title>Self-orthogonal flags of codes and translation of flags of algebraic geometry codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flag $C_0 \subsetneq C_1 \cdots \subsetneq C_s \subsetneq {\mathbb F}_q^n $ of linear codes is said to be self-orthogonal if the duals of the codes in the flag satisfy $C_{i}^\perp=C_{s-i}$, and it is said to satisfy the isometry-dual property with respect to an isometry vector ${\bf x}$ if $C_i^\perp={\bf x} C_{s-i}$ for $i=1, \dots, s$. We characterize complete (i.e. $s=n$) flags with the isometry-dual property by means of the existence of a word with non-zero coordinates in a certain linear subspace of ${\mathbb F}_q^n$. For flags of algebraic geometry (AG) codes we prove a so-called translation property of isometry-dual flags and give a construction of complete self-orthogonal flags, providing examples of self-orthogonal flags over some maximal function fields. At the end we characterize the divisors giving the isometry-dual property and the related isometry vectors showing that for each function field there is only a finite number of isometry vectors and that they are related by cyclic repetitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the integrality conjecture for quotient stacks given by a symmetric representation of a reductive group. This result will be crucial to generalise cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory of $2$ and $3$-Calabi-Yau categories to $0$ and $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks respectively.</description>

      <title>Virtual localization revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a split torus acting on an algebraic scheme $X$ with fixed locus $Z$. Edidin and Graham showed that on localized $T$-equivariant Chow groups, (a) push-forward $i_*$ along $i : Z \to X$ is an isomorphism, and (b) when $X$ is smooth the inverse $(i_*)^{-1}$ can be described via Gysin pullback $i^!$ and cap product with $e(N)^{-1}$, the inverse of the Euler class of the normal bundle $N$. In this paper we show that (b) still holds when $X$ is a quasi-smooth derived scheme (or Deligne-Mumford stack), using virtual versions of the operations $i^!$ and $(-)\cap e(N)^{-1}$. As a corollary we prove the virtual localization formula $[X]^{vir} = i_* ([Z]^{vir} \cap e(N^{vir})^{-1})$ of Graber-Pandharipande without global resolution hypotheses and over arbitrary base fields. We include an appendix on fixed loci of group actions on (derived) stacks which should be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Complements and coregularity of Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relation between the coregularity, the index of log Calabi-Yau pairs, and the complements of Fano varieties. We show that the index of a log Calabi-Yau pair $(X,B)$ of coregularity $1$ is at most $120\lambda^2$, where $\lambda$ is the Weil index of $K_X+B$. This extends a recent result due to Filipazzi, Mauri, and Moraga. We prove that a Fano variety of absolute coregularity $0$ admits either a $1$-complement or a $2$-complement. In the case of Fano varieties of absolute coregularity $1$, we show that they admit an $N$-complement with $N$ at most 6. Applying the previous results, we prove that a klt singularity of absolute coregularity $0$ admits either a $1$-complement or $2$-complement. Furthermore, a klt singularity of absolute coregularity $1$ admits an $N$-complement with $N$ at most 6. This extends the classic classification of $A,D,E$-type klt surface singularities to arbitrary dimensions. Similar results are proved in the case of coregularity $2$. In the course of the proof, we prove a novel canonical bundle formula for pairs with bounded relative coregularity. In the case of coregularity at least $3$, we establish analogous statements under the assumption of the index conjecture and the boundedness of B-representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the question whether a real threefold X fibred into quadric surfaces over the real projective line is stably rational (over R) if the topological space X(R) is connected. We give a counterexample. When all geometric fibres are irreducible, the question is open. We investigate a family of such fibrations for which the intermediate jacobian technique is not available. We produce two independent methods which in many cases enable one to prove decomposition of the diagonal.</description>

      <title>The Manin-Peyre conjecture for smooth spherical Fano threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Manin-Peyre conjecture is established for smooth spherical Fano threefolds of semisimple rank one and type N. Together with the previously solved case T and the toric cases, this covers all types of smooth spherical Fano threefolds. The case N features a number of structural novelties; most notably, one may lose regularity of the ambient toric variety, the height conditions may contain fractional exponents, and it may be necessary to exclude a thin subset with exceptionally many rational points from the count, as otherwise Manin's conjecture in its original form would turn out to be incorrect.</description>

      <title>The conformal limit and projective structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-abelian Hodge correspondence maps a polystable $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-Higgs bundle on a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g\geq2$ to a connection which, in some cases, is the holonomy of a branched hyperbolic structure. On the other hand, Gaiotto's conformal limit maps the same bundle to a partial oper, i.e., to a connection whose holonomy is that of a branched complex projective structure compatible with $X$.
  In this article, we show how these are both instances of the same phenomenon: the family of connections appearing in the conformal limit can be understood as a family of complex projective structures, deforming the hyperbolic ones into the ones compatible with $X$.
  We also show that, when the Higgs bundle has zero Toledo invariant, this deformation is optimal, inducing a geodesic on Teichm\"uller's metric space.</description>
