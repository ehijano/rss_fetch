      <title>Neuro-Informed Adaptive Learning (NIAL) Algorithm: A Hybrid Deep Learning Approach for ECG Signal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of cardiac abnormalities using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is crucial for early diagnosis and intervention in cardiovascular diseases. Traditional deep learning models often lack adaptability to varying signal patterns. This study introduces the Neuro-Informed Adaptive Learning (NIAL) algorithm, a hybrid approach integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based attention mechanisms to enhance ECG signal classification. The algorithm dynamically adjusts learning rates based on real-time validation performance, ensuring efficient convergence. Using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB Diagnostic ECG datasets, our model achieves high classification accuracy, outperforming conventional approaches. These findings highlight the potential of NIAL in real-time cardiovascular monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>Channel impulse response peak clustering using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to process channel sounder data acquired from Channel Impulse Response (CIR) of 60GHz and 80GHz channel sounder systems, through the integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network (NN) and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN). The primary goal is to enhance and automate cluster detection within peaks from noised CIR data. The study initially compares the performance of LSTM NN and FCNN across different input sequence lengths. Notably, LSTM surpasses FCNN due to its incorporation of memory cells, which prove beneficial for handling longer series.Additionally, the paper investigates the robustness of LSTM NN through various architectural configurations. The findings suggest that robust neural networks tend to closely mimic the input function, whereas smaller neural networks are better at generalizing trends in time series data, which is desirable for anomaly detection, where function peaks are regarded as anomalies.Finally, the selected LSTM NN is compared with traditional signal filters, including Butterworth, Savitzky-Golay, Bessel/Thomson, and median filters. Visual observations indicate that the most effective methods for peak detection within channel impulse response data are either the LSTM NN or median filter, as they yield similar results.</description>

      <title>Filtered Multi-Tone Spread Spectrum with Overlapping Subbands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new form of the filter bank multi-carrier spread spectrum (FBMC-SS) waveform is presented. This new waveform modifies the filtered multi-tone spread spectrum (FMT-SS) system, and is intended to whiten the power spectral density (PSD) of the transmit signal. In the conventional FMT-SS, subcarrier bands are non-overlapping, leaving a spectral null between the adjacent subcarrier bands. To make FMT-SS more appealing for a broader set of applications than those studied in the past, we propose adding additional subcarriers centered at these nulls and thoroughly explore the impact of the added subcarriers on the system performance. This modified form of FMT-SS is referred to as overlapped FMT-SS (OFMT-SS). We explore the conditions required for maximally flattening the PSD of the synthesized OFMT-SS signal and for cancelling the interference caused by overlapping subbands. We also explore the choices of spreading gains that result in a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) for a number of different scenarios. Further reduction of the PAPR of the synthesized signal through clipping methods is also explored. Additionally, we propose methods of multi-coding for increasing the data rate of the OFMT-SS waveform, while minimally impacting its PAPR.</description>

      <title>RIS-Enabled Self-Localization with FMCW Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the upcoming vehicular networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are considered as a key enabler of user self-localization without the intervention of the access points (APs). In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of RIS-enabled self-localization with no APs. We first develop a digital signal processing (DSP) unit for estimating the geometric parameters such as the angle, distance, and velocity and for RIS-enabled self-localization. Second, we set up an experimental testbed consisting of a Texas Instrument frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar for the user and SilversIMA module for the RIS. Our results confirm the validity of the developed DSP unit and demonstrate the feasibility of RIS-enabled self-localization.</description>

      <title>Amplitude-Domain Reflection Modulation for Active RIS-Assisted Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted amplitude-domain reflection modulation (ADRM) transmission scheme, termed as ARIS-ADRM. This innovative approach leverages the additional degree of freedom (DoF) provided by the amplitude domain of the active RIS to perform index modulation (IM), thereby enhancing spectral efficiency (SE) without increasing the costs associated with additional radio frequency (RF) chains. Specifically, the ARIS-ADRM scheme transmits information bits through both the modulation symbol and the index of active RIS amplitude allocation patterns (AAPs). To evaluate the performance of the proposed ARIS-ADRM scheme, we provide an achievable rate analysis and derive a closed-form expression for the upper bound on the average bit error probability (ABEP). Furthermore, we formulate an optimization problem to construct the AAP codebook, aiming to minimize the ABEP. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves error performance under the same SE conditions compared to its benchmarks. This improvement is due to its ability to flexibly adapt the transmission rate by fully exploiting the amplitude domain DoF provided by the active RIS.</description>

      <title>In-situ Physical Adjoint Computing in multiple-scattering electromagnetic environments for wave control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling electromagnetic wave propagation in multiple scattering systems is a challenging endeavor due to the extraordinary sensitivity generated by strong multi-path contributions at any given location. Overcoming such complexity has emerged as a central research theme in recent years, motivated both by a wide range of applications -- from wireless communications and imaging to optical micromanipulations -- and by the fundamental principles underlying these efforts. Here, we show that an {\it in-situ} manipulation of the myriad scattering events, achieved through time- and energy-efficient adjoint optimization (AO) methodologies, enables {\it real time} wave-driven functionalities such as targeted channel emission, coherent perfect absorption, and camouflage. Our paradigm shift exploits the highly multi-path nature of these complex environments, where repeated wave-scattering dramatically amplifies small local AO-informed system variations. Our approach can be immediately applied to in-door wireless technologies and incorporated into diverse wave-based frameworks including imaging, power electronic and optical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limit of Angular Resolution in Partly Calibrated Arrays with Position Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider high angular resolution detection using distributed mobile platforms implemented with so-called partly calibrated arrays, where position errors between subarrays exist and the counterparts within each subarray are ideally calibrated. Since position errors between antenna arrays affect the coherent processing of measurements from these arrays, it is commonly believed that its angular resolution is influenced. A key question is whether and how much the angular resolution of partly calibrated arrays is affected by the position errors, in comparison with ideally calibrated arrays. To address this fundamental problem, we theoretically illustrate that partly calibrated arrays approximately achieve high angular resolution. Our analysis uses a special characteristic of Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) w.r.t. the source separation: When the source separation increases, the CRB first declines rapidly, then plateaus out, and the turning point is close to the angular resolution limit. This means that the turning point of CRB can be used to indicate angular resolution. We then theoretically analyze the declining and plateau phases of CRB, and explain that the turning point of CRB in partly calibrated arrays is close to the angular resolution limit of distributed arrays without errors, demonstrating high resolution ability. This work thus provides a theoretical guarantee for the high-resolution performance of distributed antenna arrays in mobile platforms.</description>

      <title>The Optimal Tradeoff Between PAPR and Ambiguity Functions for Generalized OFDM Waveform Set in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has been identified as one of the six usage scenarios for IMT-2030. Compared with communication performance, sensing performance is much more vulnerable to interference, and the received backscattered sensing signal with target information is usually too weak to be detected. It is interesting to understand the optimal tradeoff between interference rejection and signal strength improvement for the best sensing performance, but unfortunately it still remains unknown. In this paper, the trinity of auto-ambiguity function (AF), cross-AF and peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) is proposed to describe the interference and coverage related aspects for ISAC systems where multi-carrier waveform is usually assumed. We extend the existing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms in 5G to a generalized OFDM waveform set with some new members and a unified parametric representation. Then the optimal Pareto tradeoff between PAPR, auto-AF and cross-AF (i.e., the union bound) is developed for the generalized OFDM waveform set. To achieve the optimal Pareto union bound with reasonable computational complexity, we further propose a framework to optimize waveform parameters and sequences jointly. Finally, some practical design examples are provided and numerical results reveal that significant improvements can be achieved compared to the state-of-the-art 5G waveforms and sequences.</description>

      <title>PLAIN: Scalable Estimation Architecture for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned be to one of the paradigms upon which next-generation mobile networks will be built, extending localization and tracking capabilities, as well as giving birth to environment-aware wireless access. A key aspect of sensing integration is parameter estimation, which involves extracting information about the surrounding environment, such as the direction, distance, and velocity of various objects within. This is typically of a high-dimensional nature, which leads to significant computational complexity, if performed jointly across multiple sensing dimensions, such as space, frequency, and time. Additionally, due to the incorporation of sensing on top of the data transmission, the time window available for sensing is likely to be short, resulting in an estimation problem where only a single snapshot is accessible. In this work, we propose PLAIN, a tensor-based estimation architecture that flexibly scales with multiple sensing dimensions and can handle high dimensionality, limited measurement time, and super-resolution requirements. It consists of three stages: a compression stage, where the high dimensional input is converted into lower dimensionality, without sacrificing resolution; a decoupled estimation stage, where the parameters across the different dimensions are estimated in parallel with low complexity; an input-based fusion stage, where the decoupled parameters are fused together to form a paired multidimensional estimate. We investigate the performance of the architecture for different configurations and compare it against practical sequential and joint estimation baselines, as well as theoretical bounds. Our results show that PLAIN, using tools from tensor algebra, subspace-based processing, and compressed sensing, can scale flexibly with dimensionality, while operating with low complexity and maintaining super-resolution.</description>

      <title>Low-Cost Phase Precoding for Short-Reach Fiber Links with Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-cost analog phase precoding is used to compensate chromatic dispersion (CD) in fibers with intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD). In contrast to conventional precoding with an in-phase and quadrature (IQ) Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), only a single additional phase modulator (PM) is required at the transmitter. Depending on the CD, the PM generates a periodic phase modulation that is modelled by a Fourier series and optimized via a mean squared error (MSE) cost criterion. Numerical results compare achievable information rates (AIRs) for 4- and 6-PAM. With the additional PM, energy gains of up to 3 dB are achieved for moderate fiber lengths.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with the generation of theoretical correlation matrices with specific sparsity patterns, associated to graph structures. We present a novel approach based on convex optimization, offering greater flexibility compared to existing techniques, notably by controlling the mean of the entry distribution in the generated correlation matrices. This allows for the generation of correlation matrices that better represent realistic data and can be used to benchmark statistical methods for graph inference.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Aware Antenna Selection for Joint Radar and Communication in XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in dual-polarized multiplexing for joint radar and communication (JRC) systems is cross-polarization (cross-pol) leakage caused by depolarization. In conventional MIMO systems, depolarization arises solely from the channel; however, in XL-MIMO systems, non-stationary properties of the array cause additional polarization shifts at each antenna element, further degrading JRC performance. This paper introduces a channel model incorporating polarization shifts due to the propagation channel and antenna elements in the near-field. We also propose an antenna selection (AS) scheme that dynamically chooses antennas based on polarization imbalance and cross-pol leakage, enhancing spectral efficiency, symbol error rate, and radar detection probability. Simulations show that the proposed AS significantly outperforms traditional methods, providing scalable benefits for XL-MIMO JRC systems.</description>

      <title>Shape Adaptive Reconfigurable Holographic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a key solution to dynamically adjust wireless propagation by tuning the reflection coefficients of large arrays of passive elements. Reconfigurable Holographic Surfaces (RHS) build on the same foundation as RIS but extend it by employing holographic principles for finer-grained wave manipulation | that is, applying higher spatial control over the reflected signals for more precise beam steering. In this paper, we investigate shape-adaptive RHS deployments in a multi-user network. Rather than treating each RHS as a uniform reflecting surface, we propose a selective element activation strategy that dynamically adapts the spatial arrangement of deployed RHS regions to a subset of predefined shapes. In particular, we formulate a system throughput maximization problem that optimizes the shape of the selected RHS elements, active beamforming at the access point (AP), and passive beamforming at the RHS to enhance coverage and mitigate signal blockage. The resulting problem is non-convex and becomes even more challenging to solve as the number of RHS and users increases; to tackle this, we introduce an alternating optimization (AO) approach that efficiently finds near-optimal solutions irrespective of the number or spatial configuration of RHS. Numerical results demonstrate that shape adaptation enables more efficient resource distribution, enhancing the effectiveness of multi-RHS deployments as the network scales.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Line-of-Sight Propagation for Near-Field Beamfocusing in Cell-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising approach for next-generation wireless networks, enabling scalable deployments of multiple small access points (APs) to enhance coverage and service for multiple user equipments (UEs). While most existing research focuses on low-frequency bands with Rayleigh fading models, emerging 5G trends are shifting toward higher frequencies, where geometric channel models and line-of-sight (LoS) propagation become more relevant. In this work, we explore how distributed massive MIMO in the LoS regime can achieve near-field-like conditions by forming artificially large arrays through coordinated AP deployments. We investigate centralized and decentralized CF architectures, leveraging structured channel estimation (SCE) techniques that exploit the line-of-sight properties of geometric channels. Our results demonstrate that dense distributed AP deployments significantly improve system performance w.r.t. the case of a co-located array, even in highly populated UE scenarios, while SCE approaches the performance of perfect CSI.</description>

      <title>Brain Age Group Classification Based on Resting State Functional Connectivity Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigated age-related changes in functional connectivity using resting-state fMRI and explored the efficacy of traditional deep learning for classifying brain developmental stages (BDS). Functional connectivity was assessed using Seed-Based Phase Synchronization (SBPS) and Pearson correlation across 160 ROIs. Clustering was performed using t-SNE, and network topology was analyzed through graph-theoretic metrics. Adaptive learning was implemented to classify the age group by extracting bottleneck features through mobileNetV2. These deep features were embedded and classified using Random Forest and PCA. Results showed a shift in phase synchronization patterns from sensory-driven networks in youth to more distributed networks with aging. t-SNE revealed that SBPS provided the most distinct clustering of BDS. Global efficiency and participation coefficient followed an inverted U-shaped trajectory, while clustering coefficient and modularity exhibited a U-shaped pattern. MobileNet outperformed other models, achieving the highest classification accuracy for BDS. Aging was associated with reduced global integration and increased local connectivity, indicating functional network reorganization. While this study focused solely on functional connectivity from resting-state fMRI and a limited set of connectivity features, deep learning demonstrated superior classification performance, highlighting its potential for characterizing age-related brain changes.</description>

      <title>Real-time Tracking System with partially coupled sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a pull-based real-time tracking system consisting of multiple partially coupled sources and a sink. The sink monitors the sources in real-time and can request one source for an update at each time instant. The sources send updates over an unreliable wireless channel. The sources are partially coupled, and updates about one source can provide partial knowledge about other sources. We study the problem of minimizing the sum of an average distortion function and a transmission cost. Since the controller is at the sink side, the controller (sink) has only partial knowledge about the source states, and thus, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and then cast it as a belief-MDP problem. Using the relative value iteration algorithm, we solve the problem and propose a control policy. Simulation results show the proposed policy's effectiveness and superiority compared to a baseline policy.</description>

      <title>Filter-Banks for Ultra-Wideband for Communications, Sensing, and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, filter-bank multicarrier spread spectrum (FBMC-SS) has been proposed as a candidate waveform for ultra-wideband (UWB) communications, sensing, and localization. It has been noted that FBMC-SS is a perfect match to this application, leading to a trivial method of matching to the required spectral mask at different regions of the world. FBMC-SS also allows easy rejection of high-power interfering signals that may appear over different parts of the UWB spectral band. Moreover, passing the received signal through a matched filter provides precise information for sensing and localization. In this paper, we concentrate on the use of staggered multitone spread spectrum (SMT-SS) for UWB communications. SMT makes use of offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM) to transmit data symbols over overlapping subcarrier bands. This form of FBMC-SS is well-suited to UWB communications because it has good spectral efficiency and a flat power spectral density (PSD), resulting in good utilization of the UWB spectral mask.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scattering Matrix of Antenna: Moment Solution, Compression Storage and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a computation method of generalized scattering matrix (GSM) based on integral equations and the method of moments (MoM), specifically designed for antennas excited through waveguide ports. By leveraging two distinct formulations -- magnetic-type and electric-type integral equations -- we establish concise algebraic relations linking the GSM directly to the impedance matrices obtained from MoM. To address practical challenges in storing GSM data across wide frequency bands and multiple antenna scenarios, we propose a efficient compression scheme. This approach alleviates memory demands by selectively storing the dominant eigencomponents that govern scattering behavior. Numerical validation examples confirm the accuracy of our method by comparisons with full-wave simulation results. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient iterative procedure to predict antenna array performance, highlighting remarkable improvements in computational speed compared to conventional numerical methods. These results collectively demonstrate the GSM framework's strong potential for antenna-array design processes.</description>

      <title>Latency Minimization for UAV-Enabled Federated Learning: Trajectory Design and Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has become a transformative paradigm for distributed machine learning across wireless networks. However, the performance of FL is often hindered by the unreliable communication links between resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the central server. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework that employs an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile server to enhance the FL training process. By capitalizing on the UAV's mobility, we establish strong line-of-sight connections with IoT devices, thereby enhancing communication reliability and capacity. To maximize training efficiency, we formulate a latency minimization problem that jointly optimizes bandwidth allocation, computing frequencies, transmit power for both the UAV and IoT devices, and the UAV's flight trajectory. Subsequently, we analyze the required rounds of the IoT devices training and the UAV aggregation for FL convergence. Based on the convergence constraint, we transform the problem into three subproblems and develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve this problem effectively. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence and computational complexity. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme not only surpasses existing benchmark schemes in reducing latency up to 15.29%, but also achieves training efficiency that nearly matches the ideal scenario.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Generative Approaches for Wireless Channel Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular in wireless communication systems for several applications. A critical bottleneck for designing ML systems for wireless communications is the availability of realistic wireless channel datasets, which are extremely resource intensive to produce. To this end, the generation of realistic wireless channels plays a key role in the subsequent design of effective ML algorithms for wireless communication systems. Generative models have been proposed to synthesize channel matrices, but outputs produced by such methods may not correspond to geometrically viable channels and do not provide any insight into the scenario of interest. In this work, we aim to address both these issues by integrating a parametric, physics-based geometric channel (PBGC) modeling framework with generative methods. To address limitations with gradient flow through the PBGC model, a linearized reformulation is presented, which ensures smooth gradient flow during generative model training, while also capturing insights about the underlying physical environment. We evaluate our model against prior baselines by comparing the generated samples in terms of the 2-Wasserstein distance and through the utility of generated data when used for downstream compression tasks.</description>

      <title>Broadening Target Distributions for Accelerated Diffusion Models via a Novel Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13901v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accelerated diffusion models hold the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency of standard diffusion processes. Theoretically, these models have been shown to achieve faster convergence rates than the standard $\mathcal O(1/\epsilon^2)$ rate of vanilla diffusion models, where $\epsilon$ denotes the target accuracy. However, current theoretical studies have established the acceleration advantage only for restrictive target distribution classes, such as those with smoothness conditions imposed along the entire sampling path or with bounded support. In this work, we significantly broaden the target distribution classes with a new accelerated stochastic DDPM sampler. In particular, we show that it achieves accelerated performance for three broad distribution classes not considered before. Our first class relies on the smoothness condition posed only to the target density $q_0$, which is far more relaxed than the existing smoothness conditions posed to all $q_t$ along the entire sampling path. Our second class requires only a finite second moment condition, allowing for a much wider class of target distributions than the existing finite-support condition. Our third class is Gaussian mixture, for which our result establishes the first acceleration guarantee. Moreover, among accelerated DDPM type samplers, our results specialized for bounded-support distributions show an improved dependency on the data dimension $d$. Our analysis introduces a novel technique for establishing performance guarantees via constructing a tilting factor representation of the convergence error and utilizing Tweedie's formula to handle Taylor expansion terms. This new analytical framework may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Passenger hazard perception based on EEG signals for highly automated driving vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles is crucial, especially given recent accidents involving automated systems. As passengers in these vehicles, humans' sensory perception and decision-making can be integrated with autonomous systems to improve safety. This study explores neural mechanisms in passenger-vehicle interactions, leading to the development of a Passenger Cognitive Model (PCM) and the Passenger EEG Decoding Strategy (PEDS). Central to PEDS is a novel Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) that captures spatial and temporal EEG data patterns. The CRNN, combined with stacking algorithms, achieves an accuracy of $85.0\% \pm 3.18\%$. Our findings highlight the predictive power of pre-event EEG data, enhancing the detection of hazardous scenarios and offering a network-driven framework for safer autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>MUSE: A Real-Time Multi-Sensor State Estimator for Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative state estimator, MUSE (MUlti-sensor State Estimator), designed to enhance state estimation's accuracy and real-time performance in quadruped robot navigation. The proposed state estimator builds upon our previous work presented in [1]. It integrates data from a range of onboard sensors, including IMUs, encoders, cameras, and LiDARs, to deliver a comprehensive and reliable estimation of the robot's pose and motion, even in slippery scenarios. We tested MUSE on a Unitree Aliengo robot, successfully closing the locomotion control loop in difficult scenarios, including slippery and uneven terrain. Benchmarking against Pronto [2] and VILENS [3] showed 67.6% and 26.7% reductions in translational errors, respectively. Additionally, MUSE outperformed DLIO [4], a LiDAR-inertial odometry system in rotational errors and frequency, while the proprioceptive version of MUSE (P-MUSE) outperformed TSIF [5], with a 45.9% reduction in absolute trajectory error (ATE).</description>
