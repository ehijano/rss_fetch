      <title>$Z=14$ Magicity Revealed by the Mass of the Proton Dripline Nucleus $^{22}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the $B\rho$-defined isochronous mass spectrometry technique, we conducted the first mass measurement of the proton dripline nucleus $^{22}$Si. We confirm that $^{22}$Si is bound against particle emission with $S_p/S_{2p}=+1412(114)/+229(54)$ keV, fixing the proton dripline location for the Si element. By analyzing the mass differences of the neighboring $sd$-shell nuclei, we find that $^{22}$Si exhibits a doubly-magic character similar to its mirror partner $^{22}$O, and that the mirror energy difference of $^{22}$Si-$^{22}$O deviates from the predictions assuming mirror symmetry. Gamow shell-model calculations reveal that the average occupations of valence protons in $^{22}$Si are nearly identical to those of valence neutrons in $^{22}$O, supporting the $Z=14$ magicity in $^{22}$Si. The observed mirror-symmetry breaking is attributed to the extended proton distribution in $^{22}$Si arising from a small contribution of the unbound $\pi2s_{1/2}$ orbital.</description>

      <title>Improved sensitivity in the search for rare decays of Gd isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gadolinium is widely used in multiple low-background experiments, making its isotopes accessible for rare decay searches both in-situ and through radiopurity screening data. This study presents an improved search for rare alpha and double-beta decay modes in $^{152}$Gd, $^{154}$Gd, and $^{160}$Gd isotopes using ultra-low background HPGe detectors at the Boulby Underground Screening (BUGS) facility. A total exposure of 6.7 kg$\cdot$yr of natural gadolinium was achieved using gadolinium sulfate octahydrate $(\text{Gd}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 \cdot 8\text{H}_2\text{O})$ samples, originally screened for radiopurity prior to their deployment in the Super-Kamiokande neutrino experiment. Due to the detection methodology, only decays into excited states accompanied by gamma-ray emission were accessible. A Bayesian analysis incorporating prior experimental results was employed, leading to new lower half-life limits in the range of $10^{19} - 10^{21}$ years - an improvement of approximately two orders of magnitude over previous constraints. No statistically significant decay signals were observed. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of repurposing large-scale radiopurity screening campaigns for fundamental physics research.</description>

      <title>ALICE Event Display -- from the legacy ROOT-based visualization to the web-based application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) is one of the four big CERN experiments at the LHC. The area of interest is the study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma which is produced in heavy-ion collisions. The trajectories of particles created in collisions are reconstructed online and are visualized together with the detector geometry to provide proper augmentation of the presented data. This interactive visualization tool allows 3D visualization of samples taken from the collected data. Starting with LHC Run 3 (from 2022), a newly developed solution has been adopted following the creation of the new ALICE O\textsuperscript{2} Framework. In the first step the data handling part was implemented. The visualization part was developed using technologies from LHC Run 2. This paper presents the process of transition of the visualization component to the modern web based solution. The architecture of the existing ALICE LHC Run 3 online real-time visualization solution is presented. The advantages of the new approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>Towards AMS measurements of $^{91}$Nb, $^{94}$Nb and $^{93}$Mo produced in fusion environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-lived radionuclides, such as $^{91}$Nb, $^{94}$Nb and $^{93}$Mo, are expected to be produced in nuclear fusion reactors by reactions of high-energy neutrons with the structural material. Accurate predictions of waste categorization require experimental validation of simulation codes like FISPACT-II. This work explores the use of Ion-Laser InterAction Mass Spectrometry (ILIAMS) at the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator (VERA) to measure these three radionuclides by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The ILIAMS setup employs laser photodetachment to suppress their respective stable isobars: $^{91}$Zr, $^{94}$Zr and $^{94}$Mo, and $^{93}$Nb.
  For $^{91,94}$Nb measurements, the NbO$_3^-$ anion is selected, with interferences from $^{91,94}$ZrO$_{3}^-$ already suppressed just by collisions with the He buffer gas in the ion cooler. The suppression can be further enhanced by overlapping a 355$\,$nm laser with the ion beam. In that way, we reach $^{91}$Zr/$^{93}$Nb and $^{94}$Zr/$^{93}$Nb levels of $1.2\,\times\,10^{-14}$ and $1.8\,\times\,10^{-14}$, respectively, in commercial Nb$_2$O$_5$ targets. The MoO$_3^-$ anion was suppressed by a factor of 4360, leading to a $^{94}$Mo/$^{93}$Nb interference of $1.28\,\times\,10^{-10}$ in the same targets.
  For $^{93}$Mo measurements, the MoO$_2^-$ anion is selected, with interference from $^{93}$NbO$_2^-$ suppressed by 637$\,$nm photons by a factor of $5.5\,\times\,10^6$. This results in a $^{93}$Nb/$^\text{nat}$Mo level of $1.3\,\times\,10^{-13}$ in targets prepared from commercial MoO$_3$.
  These suppressions are not achieved using separation techniques based on the difference in energy loss, even in AMS facilities with terminal voltages above 8.5$\,$MV and foil stripping.</description>

      <title>Effective proton-neutron interaction in mirror nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective proton-neutron interactions, $V_{pn}$, in mirror nuclei are systematically analyzed using the ground-state atomic masses. A mirror symmetry of $V_{pn}$ is found for bound nuclei with a standard deviation of $\sigma=32$ keV. However, this mirror symmetry is apparently broken for some mirror-nuclei pairs when a proton-unbound nucleus is involved in extracting the $V_{pn}$ values. Such a mirror-symmetry breaking is attributed to the Thomas-Ehrman shift of the proton-unbound nucleus and investigated by using the Gamow shell model. It is concluded that the Thomas-Ehrman shift originates mainly from reduced Coulomb energies in the proton-unbound nuclei due to the extended radial density distribution of valence protons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present estimates for the production cross sections of exotic states ($\Lambda_c, \Sigma_c, \Xi_c, D\, \mathrm{and}\, D_s$) from secondary $\overline B + B$ annihilations in p+A reactions from $E_\mathrm{lab}=10-30A$~GeV. We focus specifically on the newly planned hadron physics program of CBM at FAIR. These estimates for the production of exotic states are based on the achievable number of $\overline B + B$ annihilations and their invariant mass distributions calculated in the UrQMD transport model.</description>

      <title>First identification of a doublet wobbling excitation mode in $^{105}$Pd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An experimental investigation of $^{105}$Pd has revealed, for the first time, the existence of two wobbling bands, both having one phonon configuration and originating from excitation which is the wobbling from the yrast band with the $h_{11/2}$ quasineutron fully aligned with the short axis, and from an excited band with the same quasineutron but with less alignment along the short axis. These observations have been drawn from the measured ratios of the inter-band and intra-band gamma transition rates. Model calculations based on the triaxial projected shell model (TPSM) approach have been performed and are found to be in good agreement with the experimental energies and relative transition probabilities. The analysis of the TPSM results provides an insight into the nature of the observed structures at a microscopic level.</description>

      <title>Influence of incomplete fusion in $^{12}$C+$^{193}$Ir at $E_{lab}$ = 64-84 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitation functions of several evaporation residues populated via complete and/or incomplete fusion in $^{12}$C+$^{193}$Ir system have been measured at energies $\approx$ 64-84 MeV, and analyzed in the framework of theoretical model code PACE4. It has been found that the $xn$ channels are predominantly populated via complete fusion; however, some of the $pxn$ channels decay via their precursor. A significant enhancement has been observed in the case of $\alpha$-emitting channels over PACE4 calculations, indicating the onset of a reaction mechanism not included in this code, e.g., incomplete fusion. For better insights into the onset and influence of incomplete fusion, the percentage fraction of incomplete fusion has been deduced and analyzed in terms of different entrance-channel parameters. The findings of the present study underline the importance of projectile energy, entrance-channel mass-asymmetry, and the Coulomb factor of interacting partners. The impact of projectile break-up on complete fusion has also been discussed in the framework of the Universal Fusion Function, where suppression of $\approx$ 12$\%$ has been observed in the fusion function. The finding of the present work reinstates that the fusion suppression is affected by the projectile $\alpha$-break-up threshold.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Medium Modifications to $^{12}$C Structure Functions in the Resonance Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from a high precision experimental study of the nuclear modification of the longitudinal ($F_L$) to transverse ($F_1$) structure function ratio for bound nucleons in the resonance region. The inclusive electron scattering cross sections were measured in Jefferson Lab Experimental Hall C on carbon and deuterium nuclei for a large range of kinematics, allowing for separations of the longitudinal and transverse structure functions to be performed at a range of four-momentum transfer values $0.5 \le Q^2 \le$ 3.75 GeV$^2$. In contrast to the significant body of measurements of the nuclear modification of the $F_2$ structure function in the deep inelastic scattering region, there is very little on $F_L$ and $R = F_L / 2xF_1$ in the region of the nucleon resonances. In this paper we present measurements of the nuclear effect on $R$ for $^{12}$C ($R_C$) relative to deuterium ($R_D$). These results indicate regions in which in $R_C&gt;R_D$, requiring that the nuclear modifications be different in all three structure functions, $F_2$, $F_1$ and $F_L$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chromodynamics Resolution of the ATOMKI Anomaly in ${\rm {^4He}}$ Nuclear Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14441v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of anomalous angular correlations in electron-positron pairs produced from excited states of $^{4}$He, $^{8}$Be and $^{12}$C nuclei have been suggested as due to the creation and subsequent decay of a new light particle of mass $\sim$17 MeV. In this work, we investigate the possibility that the source of the observed signals is a set of new excitation channels created by the 12-quark hidden-color Fock state within the ${\rm {^4He}}$ nuclear wavefunction dubbed the ``hexadiquark.'' We calculate the invariant $e^+e^-$ mass spectrum for the electromagnetic transition from a new excitation of $^{4}$He, estimating its differential and total decay width. We find that we can fit the shape of the anomalous signal with the QCD Fock state at excitation energy $\rm E^{*} = 17.9 \pm 1$ MeV and a Gaussian form factor for the electromagnetic decay. We address the physical issues with the fit parameters using properties of the hexadiquark state, in particular the three weakly repulsive $\rm 6_C$ interactions of $\rm SU(3)_C$ between diquark pairs. Experimental tests of our model are described in detail. In light of this work, we emphasize the need for independent experimental confirmation or refutation of the ATOMKI results as well as dedicated experiments to search for the proposed new excitations of ${\rm ^4He}$ and other $\alpha$-cluster nuclei.</description>

      <title>A two-body femtoscopy approach to the proton-deuteron correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proton-deuteron correlation function measured by the ALICE collaboration in high multiplicity p+p collisions shows a momentum dependence which is in contradiction with the predictions of the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz formalism of the two-body interaction. This result motivated a more sophisticated three-body description in terms of a composite deuteron. Encouraged by the good description of other deuteron observables in the context of heavy-ion collisions, we revisit this correlation function under the two-body approximation without relying on the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approximation, but using the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation by incorporating both strong and Coulomb interactions. The two-body description provides a reasonable agreement to ALICE data for natural values of the source size. Interpreting the previously assumed attractive character of the $(L,S)=(0,3/2)$ channel of the $pd$ interaction into a more-likely repulsion, the results agree better not only with the ALICE measurements but also with recent STAR data in Au+Au collisions.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star properties through parity-violating electron scattering experiments and relativistic point coupling interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity-violating electron scattering experiments on $\rm ^{48}Ca$ (CREX) and $\rm ^{208}Pb$ (PREX-2) offer valuable insight into the isovector properties of finite nuclei, providing constraints for the density dependence of the nuclear equation of state, which is crucial for understanding astrophysical phenomena. In this work, we establish functional dependencies between the properties of finite nuclei-such as weak charge form factors and neutron skin thickness-and the bulk properties of neutron stars, including tidal deformability from binary neutron star mergers and neutron star radii. The dependencies are formulated by introducing a family of $\beta$-equilibrated equations of state based on relativistic energy density functionals with point coupling interactions. The charge minus the weak form factors derived from CREX and PREX-2 measurements, combined with the observational constraints on tidal deformability from the GW170817 event, are used to constrain the symmetry energy and neutron star radii. Notably, the energy density expanded up to the fourth order in symmetry energy yields larger radii compared to calculations limited to the second order term. However, the results reveal a discrepancy between the constraints provided by the CREX and PREX-2 experiments. For a more quantitative assessment, higher precision parity-violating electron scattering data and neutron star observations are required.</description>
