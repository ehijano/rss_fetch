      <title>Detection horizon for the neutrino burst from the stellar helium flash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass stars ($M\lesssim 2\,M_\odot$) ignite helium under degenerate conditions, eventually causing a nuclear run-away -- the helium flash. The alpha-capture process on $^{14}$N produces a large amount of $^{18}$F, whose subsequent decay spawns an intense $\nu_e$ burst (with average energy of $0.38$ MeV) lasting about a day. We show that, in addition, a strong $1.7$ MeV neutrino line is generated by electron capture on $^{18}$F. Detection is hindered by large backgrounds in state-of-the-art neutrino observatories, such as JUNO. In next-generation facilities, such as the Jinping neutrino experiment, the horizon for a detection with a local significance of $3 \sigma$ would be extended to almost $3$ pc. Although helium flashes occur a few times per year in our Galaxy, there are no stellar candidates approaching the tip of the red giant branch within $10$ pc. Hence, to date, asteroseismology remains the most promising tool for probing the most energetic thermonuclear event in the life of a low-mass star.</description>

      <title>The eruptive young star IRAS 21204+4913</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of photometric, polarimetric, and spectroscopic observations are presented for the young star IRAS 21204+4913, whose visible brightness has increased by $\approx 5^{\rm m}$ since October 2025. The star's absorption spectrum in the $0.36 - 0.75 \mu$m range resembles those of A - F giants and supergiants, but it also exhibits molecular TiO bands. The brightening was accompanied by a significant increase in the degree of polarization of the stellar radiation (to $\approx 16 \%$ in the I-band), likely due to scattering by dust in an expanding circumstellar shell. The P Cygni profile of the H$\alpha$ line implies a dusty wind velocity of $\approx 300$ km/s. We believe that the outburst of IRAS 21204+4913 is caused by an increase in the accretion rate of protoplanetary disk's matter onto the young star with a mass of $\lesssim 0.5$ M$_\odot$ to $\gtrsim 3\times 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Furthermore, IRAS 21204+4913 displays several unusual features: the dependence of the width and radial velocity of absorption lines on the excitation potential, emission in the TiO molecular bands, and a comparably bright outburst that occured in 1948. Several T Tauri stars and a group of Herbig-Haro objects are found in the vicinity of the star.</description>

      <title>New Insights from Revisiting the Rotation Period of the Strongly Magnetic O Star, NGC 1624-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 1624-2 hosts the strongest surface magnetic field found on an O star thus far. When applied across several epochs of observations, the star's currently accepted rotation period (157.99 d) does not coherently characterize the variations of spectral lines of magnetospheric origin. We analyze Lomb-Scargle periodograms produced with new and archival, multi-instrument spectroscopic time series of Balmer H and He spectral lines. We find that 153.17 $\pm$ 0.42 d and 306.56 $\pm$ 1.19 d are both equally suitable periods at phasing the spectral and magnetic time series data in a manner consistent with the Oblique Rotator Model. The 306.56 d period implies a magnetic geometry for NGC 1624-2 that is quite different from the previously accepted one, for which both magnetic poles should be observed during a full rotational cycle. If this is the case, the star's magnetic South pole has yet to be observed, and additional spectropolarimetric observations should be acquired in order to confirm whether or not the south pole is in fact observable.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics, thermodynamics and fine structure of virtual erupting filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is not fully understood why some solar filaments erupt while others do not. Those that do typically undergo a slow rise followed by an acceleration phase, though this transition requires further investigation. Erupting prominences have been observed to heat up during the acceleration phase, but the origin of this heating remains unclear. Moreover, some coronal mass ejections possess additional fine structure in white-light observations beyond the classical three-part morphology. We aim to elaborate on the dynamics of erupting prominences, investigate the heating during the acceleration phase, and correlate our findings with observations. We employ the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code to solve the 2.5D MHD equations on a coronal domain extending to 300 Mm, using adaptive mesh refinement to attain high resolution. Controlled combinations of footpoint shearing and converging motions applied to an initial magnetic arcade produce erupting flux ropes with self-consistent prominence and coronal rain formation due to thermal instability. We find both non-erupting and erupting cases related to the system energization. Comparison with observations from the AIA Filament Eruption Catalog shows that the slow-rise and impulsive phases are modulated by magnetic reconnection. The transition to acceleration corresponds to an increase in the inflow Alfv\'en Mach number. Thermal conduction and compressional heating can lead to prominence evaporation. We obtain nested circular fine structure in EUV images of the ejected flux ropes, partly resulting from plasmoid interactions. We conclude that internal heating processes and magnetic reconnection play key roles in the early evolution of CMEs.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Tip of the Red Giant Branch and measuring Magellanic Cloud distances to 2% exclusively with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have calibrated the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) using our recent catalog of homogeneous, high-accuracy Globular Cluster (GC) distances. The GC distances were determined by a global joint fit to optical period-Wesenheit relations of their member RR Lyrae stars and type-II Cepheids, anchored by trigonometric parallaxes; all data taken from the ESA Gaia mission's (early) third data release (GDR3). Using I-band measurements in 48 GCs from P. Stetson's database, we determined $M_{I,0} = -3.948^{+0.037}_{-0.034}$ mag (1.6% in distance). Calibrating the TRGB using Gaia's homogeneous, space-based RP photometry of 53 GCs, we found $M_{RP,0} = -3.807^{+0.041}_{-0.035}$ mag (1.8%). The stated uncertainties include statistical and systematic effects, including the correlated nature of the GC distances. The robustness of our calibrations is demonstrated via tests against small-number statistics and analysis choices. Specifically, we found no significant metallicity effect for our sample of old, low-metallicity GCs. We measured $\sim 2\%$ distances to the Large (LMC) and Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC), $18.447^{+0.036}_{-0.042}$ mag ($48.9 \pm 0.9$ kpc) and $18.898^{+0.049}_{-0.054}$ mag ($60.2 \pm 1.4$ kpc), respectively, using a single well calibrated photometric system: RP (spectro-)photometry from GDR3. Our new TRGB distances, whose absolute scale derives from Gaia parallaxes, are fully independent of the well-known detached eclipsing binary (DEB) distances and agree with them to within the uncertainties. Combining our new TRGB and existing DEB distances, we illustrate how additional constraints may be incorporated in the Local Distance Network and obtain $H_0 = 73.52 \pm 0.80$ km/s/Mpc. Expected improvements due to the upcoming fourth Gaia data release are discussed.</description>

      <title>Coronal Non-Thermal and Doppler Plasma Flows Driven by Photospheric Flux in 28 Active Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and/or the braiding of magnetic field lines are largely thought to be responsible for heating the solar corona, both being mechanisms which are driven by the Sun's photospheric magnetic field. Recent modelling work leads us to expect that such heating mechanisms would be seen in the excess broadening (non-thermal velocity) of coronal spectral emission lines and that larger magnitudes of photospheric magnetic flux would generate more heating, but a direct connection between magnetic flux and spectral line broadening has been difficult to establish. We combine measurements of the photospheric magnetic field from SDO/HMI and non-thermal velocity in log T~6.2 coronal plasma from Hinode/EIS for 28 active regions and find a moderate correlation between the two exists in quiescent active regions, consistent with the photospheric field injecting upward Poynting flux into the solar corona and causing coronal heating. We find that no strong correlation with coronal composition makes it difficult to distinguish between MHD wave heating and magnetic field braiding heating using these diagnostics with current instrumentation.</description>

      <title>A homogeneous view of asymptotic giant branch carbon stars as seen by Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon stars on the asymptotic giant branch are major contributors to galactic dust enrichment, with gas mass-loss rates up to 1e-4 Msun/yr. We present a homogeneous spectral energy distribution analysis of the Gaia DR3 Golden Sample of carbon stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. Our dataset includes 14,747 sources with multi-band photometry from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE, combined with recent distance and extinction estimates. For a subsample of 2,494 Mira variables, we model multi-band light curves to derive accurate mean magnitudes.
  Stellar and circumstellar parameters are obtained by fitting observations with a large grid of synthetic spectra computed with the DUSTY radiative transfer code using COMARCS atmospheres. We derive effective temperature, optical depth, and gas mass-loss rate for each source. The distributions peak around Teff = 3150 K, with mass-loss rates spanning 1e-11 to 1e-4 Msun/yr and inner dust temperatures near 1000 K. We find a correlation between variability amplitude and mass-loss rate.
  This framework provides a statistically robust view of carbon stars across environments with different metallicities. Apparent environmental dependencies are influenced by luminosity distributions and selection effects rather than purely intrinsic metallicity differences. The combined Gaia and WISE selection limits the detection of both highly obscured and faint Magellanic Cloud sources, but the observed trends remain significant within the sampled populations.</description>

      <title>Inference of horizontal velocity fields from the induction equation in the solar atmosphere. I. Analytical and numerical solutions in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric observations, which rely on the Doppler effect, only provide access to the line-of-sight component of the solar plasma velocity (vz). However, many dynamic processes in the solar atmosphere involve strong horizontal motions (in the plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight: vx, vy). Existing methods for estimating horizontal velocities are generally insensitive to variations in height (the z-coordinate), providing them only on a single plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight: vx(x,y), vy(x,y). Motivated by the fact that modern analysis techniques allow us to retrieve the height dependence of vz and B, our goal is to infer also this height dependence for the horizontal velocity field in the solar atmosphere. As a first step, we present, and test a method for the two-dimensional case on the (y,z) plane so as to show that the z dependence can be successfully retrieved. The components of the two-dimensional magnetic induction equation are discretized via finite differences, leading to an overdetermined system whose solution provides vy. The method assumes that B, its time variation, as well as vz are known. This is currently possible through modern Stokes inversion techniques applied to spatially and temporally resolved spectropolarimetric observations. Using analytically prescribed values and two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the solar surface, we demonstrate that, in these idealized cases, the horizontal velocity component in a two-dimensional domain, can be successfully recovered with a mean error of about 1 %. The proposed method successfully retrieves the horizontal velocity field in the (y,z) plane, thereby establishing the foundation for future extensions to three-dimensional reconstructions of the horizontal velocity field.</description>

      <title>Morphological variations of solar granules in the presence of magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar granulation consists of dynamic convective plasma cells that rise from the solar interior to the surface. The interaction between these plasma cells and the Sun's magnetic field provides valuable insights into plasma dynamics near the solar surface and how they evolve in the presence of magnetic fields. This study analyses the morphological characteristics of solar convective cells, investigating the relationship between magnetic field properties and granule dynamics - specifically how granule area, shape, and brightness vary under different magnetic field conditions. Observations of the active region NOAA 11768 were taken with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). A segmentation algorithm was applied to continuum intensity images to identify individual granules and determine their sizes, shapes, and mean brightness. The magnetic field vector and line-of-sight velocity were derived from CRISP spectropolarimetric data to investigate their role in shaping granule properties. We find that granular area decreases systematically with increasing magnetic field strength, with the largest granules occurring in non-magnetic regions and a mean granule area of approximately 1.58 arcsec$^2$ (effective diameter of 1.42 arcseconds). Both mean continuum intensity and granule size decrease with stronger fields, confirming the suppression of convective energy transport in magnetised regions. No correlation was found between mean granule brightness and mean up-flow velocity. Highly elongated granules appear in both magnetic and non-magnetic regions, while near-circular granules are exclusive to non-magnetic areas. An alignment between granule major axes and magnetic field azimuth is observed where the horizontal field component is strong, confirming that granules are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, which inhibit the lateral expansion of convective cells.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic analysis and RHD modeling of the first Ca II H and H-epsilon flare spectra from DKIST/ViSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze decay phase observations of the GOES class C6.7 flare SOL2022-08-19T20:31 by the Visible Spectropolarimeter (ViSP) on the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). The data include the first flare-time DKIST observations of the chromospheric Ca II H 396.8 nm and H-epsilon 397.0 nm spectral lines. These diagnostics have rarely been studied together during the modern era of high-resolution solar flare observations, and never at the spectral and spatial resolution of the DKIST. We directly compare DKIST spectra to state-of-the-art RADYN+RH simulations, including one heated by a nonthermal electron beam and one by in-situ thermal conduction. While certain salient properties of the spectra such as the width of H-epsilon are reproduced, the models severely underestimate the width of Ca II H in the red wing and fail to reproduce the exact relative intensity of Ca II H to H-epsilon. The models exhibit a range of condensation electron densities spanning over an order of magnitude. Unlike the modeled lower-order Balmer-series lines, we find that the width of H-epsilon is not solely related to the condensation properties; the widths and intensities are also sensitive to the deeper flare layers. We outline possible avenues towards improvement of flare models, such as a comprehensive evaluation of flare heating mechanisms in the context of both impulsive and decay phase high-resolution data.</description>

      <title>Hot subdwarf stars from the Hamburg Quasar Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot subluminous stars (sdO/B) are evolved low mass stars originating from red giants that lost their envelope almost entirely. The multitude of observed phenomena imply that several pathways may form hot subdwarfs, most involving close binary channels. The Hamburg Quasar Survey (HQS) led to the discovery of many faint blue stars including hot subdwarf. Many of the HQS-sdB stars have been studied in detail, but analyses of the helium-rich sdOB and sdO stars are lacking. The recent development of hybrid LTE/non-LTE model spectra 2nd generation Bamberg model grids enables us to improve the spectroscopic analyses of the sdB stars as well as of the previously unstudied sdO stars allowing precise atmospheric parameters to be derived, while consistently accounting for parameter correlations and systematic uncertainties. ... We use spectral energy distributions to identify composite-colour sdB binaries and present the result of detailed spectroscopic analyses of 122 non-composite subdwarfs from the HQS to identify potential evolutionary pathways. ...Their derived mass distribution and median mass of 0.45 Msun is consistent with the canonical EHB mass. ... The helium-rich sdOB and sdO stars, are found near the helium main-sequence (He-MS). The derived mass distribution of the extremely He-rich subdwarfs is broader (0.48 to 1.05 Msun) and peaks at a median of 0.70 Msun, significantly larger than those of the hydrogen-rich stars. Intermediate He-rich subdwarfs are also He-MS stars, but of lower mass (0.55 Msun) than the extremely He-rich. This strongly supports the merger scenario for the origin of He-rich sdO stars, in which two helium white dwarfs merge following orbital decay driven by gravitational-wave emission, producing a He-rich sdO or sdOB star. From comparison to the results of similar studies we speculate that older populations produce more massive He-WD mergers.(abbreviated)</description>

      <title>The Montreal Open Clusters and Associations (MOCA) Database: A Census of Nearby Associations, Open Clusters, and Young Substellar Objects within 500 pc of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Montreal Open Clusters and Associations database (MOCAdb), a public MySQL database with a Python interface. MOCAdb provides a census of memberships for 10259 associations and open clusters within 500 pc of the Sun, with a comprehensive compilation of literature measurements such as spectral types, kinematics, rotation periods, activity indices, spectral indices, and photometry. All known substellar objects are cataloged in MOCAdb, along with 2943 public spectra, to enable the characterization of substellar association members. MOCAdb also features periodically updated calculations such as Galactic UVW space velocities. We use this compilation to construct mappings between independent association definitions, and to update the BANYAN $\Sigma$ membership classification tool, which now includes 8125 associations. The BANYAN $\Sigma$ model construction is improved to account for heterogeneous and correlated errors and to capture complex association shapes using Gaussian mixture models. Combined with Gaia DR3, this enabled us to identify 11535 yet unrecognized candidate members of young associations within 500 pc, mostly M dwarfs. Our results corroborate a recent observation that systematics up to $\approx$4 km/s remain in Gaia DR3 radial velocities for A-type stars. We present an updated census of age-calibrated exoplanets and substellar objects: 134 age-calibrated exoplanet systems (plus 121 TESS exoplanet candidates), 99 of which did not appear to have known memberships so far, and 455 substellar (L0 or later) candidate members of young associations, 196 of which appear newly recognized. We bring the total of candidate isolated planetary-mass objects to 101, 53 of which are newly recognized candidate members.</description>

      <title>Impact of rotation on the amplitude of acoustic modes in solar-like stars: Insights from hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solar-like stars, acoustic modes provide the main way of probing their internal structure and dynamics. Although these modes are expected to be ubiquitous in stars with convective envelopes, Kepler observations reveal that a significant fraction of solar-like stars show no detectable acoustic modes, particularly among rapidly rotating and magnetically active stars. Recent theoretical work by Bessila et al. (2025) has proposed that rotation tends to inhibit convective motions, thereby reducing the power available for stochastic mode excitation. Here, we test this prediction using fully compressible hydrodynamical simulations of a solar-like star. We perform a series of 2.5D simulations, which consider longitudinal symmetry, using the MUSIC code spanning rotation rates from 0 to 8 $\Omega_{\odot}$. We find a clear and systematic decline of acoustic mode amplitudes with increasing rotation rate. In the most rapidly rotating models, mode damping rates are also enhanced. The combined reduction in excitation and increase in damping with increasing rotation rate provide a physical explanation for the observed decrease in mode detectability in rapidly rotating solar-like stars. Our results demonstrate that rotation can significantly modify oscillation properties and must be accounted for when interpreting asteroseismic observations.</description>

      <title>Between Plateaus and Slopes: A Data-Driven Exploration of Spectral Diversity Across Type IIP/L Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II supernovae (SNe II) have been traditionally separated into several subgroups based on their photometric and spectroscopic properties, but whether these represent distinct progenitors or a continuous distribution remains debated. Over the past decade, growing observational evidence has suggested a possible continuity between slow- (IIP) and fast-declining (IIL) SNe. We investigate the continuity of the SNe IIP/L subclasses through a data-driven statistical analysis of spectral time series, aiming to determine whether significant correlations exist between overall spectral shapes and light-curve decline rates. We introduce a novel standardization method for SN II spectra. After empirically flattening the spectra via continuum normalization, we interpolate the resulting "feature spectra" onto a fixed grid of epochs using Gaussian Process regression. The interpolated spectra are then analyzed using Principal Component Analysis to explore correlations. We find that SNe IIP and IIL form a continuum spectroscopically, though some clustering remains. The spectral diversity is characterized mainly by two components: one continuous group with well-defined P-Cygni profiles and another with "less-regular" features likely driven by enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) interaction. Our results reveal that the spectral diversity of SNe IIP/L diminishes over time. We confirm observational correlations: steeper light-curve declines correspond to weaker spectral features, indicating that SNe IIL tend to show weaker emission and, in some cases, a lack of distinct absorption lines. These trends seemingly break down by enhanced CSM interaction that affects the P-Cygni profiles. Our data-driven method reveals underlying spectral correlations and supports a continuous distribution between IIP and IIL subtypes. This method paves the way for more refined classification algorithms.</description>

      <title>Coupled Map Lattice for Astronomical Object Formation: A Scenario for Evolution from Star to Disk, Arms, and Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new dynamic formation model of a star, a disk, arms, and companions using a coupled map lattice (CML), a complex systems approach. This CML simulates the viscoelastic and chaotic dynamics and evolution of gas clumps containing a little dust with a minimal set of one Eulerian procedure for the flow formation of gas clumps due to gravitational interaction, and one Lagrangian procedure for the collision and mixture of gas clumps due to viscoelastic advection. Despite its simplicity, this CML successfully obtains four typical astronomical objects consistent with protoplanetary disk observations: a central star, Keplerian disk, spiral arms, and even stellar, substellar, and planetary companions. All these formation processes are truly dynamic, with the central star "starring" in them, and they are not based on the conventional disk gravitational instability but on the central star gravitational instability with high-dimensional chaotic gas ejection, namely the chaotic itinerancy. Of particular note is the process in which diverse companions are formed due to the rapid density increase caused by the intersection of spiral arms. This suggests a novel companion formation scenario that should be called "arm-crossing companion formation" with a view to planet formation, which may overcome the radial drift barrier and angular momentum problem.</description>

      <title>Searching for Extragalactic Exoplanets: A Survey of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy Stream with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date no exoplanets have been detected outside the Milky Way, and their extragalactic occurrence rates are poorly constrained. Using available data from TESS we perform the first transit survey of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream using 15,176 main sequence stars identified as likely members. We calculate an upper limit of $&lt;$1.01% for hot Jupiters with radii of 1-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods of 0.6-10 days after detecting zero planets. We compare our calculated occurrence rate upper limits to the upper limits found in the Milky Way globular clusters M4 and 47 Tuc. Our 1-$\sigma$ occurrence rate upper limit of $&lt;$0.37% for the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream, for planets with radii of 1.5-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods $&lt;$10 days, is lower than the $&lt;$0.57% upper limit measured in 47 Tuc. Similarly, our 2 sigma upper limit of $&lt;$0.78% for planets with radii of 1.4-2 $_{Jup}$ and periods $&lt;$8 days is below the $&lt;$0.81% upper limit measured in M4. We predict that a future analysis of TESS data with a high detection efficiency for hot Jupiter transit depths would require $\eta_{extragalactic}$ $\geq$ 11,467 target stars to detect a planet of extragalactic origin. Therefore, we predict that a future investigation of TESS data which includes additional extragalactic stellar streams will be able to either detect the first extragalactic origin planet or provide evidence that older, lower metallicity extragalactic environments may experience a lower hot Jupiter occurrence rate than is observed for the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Barium Stars Across the Milky Way: Probing Their Origins via the GALAH Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barium stars are unusually enriched in barium ([Ba/Fe] &gt;= 1.0 dex) and not predicted by current Galactic chemical evolution models. Previous observations of barium stars have found evidence that they form through mass transfer from a companion asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star or through radiative levitation. The chemical abundance and kinematic information of barium stars may help constrain AGB stellar nucleosynthesis, binary star evolution, and internal evolutionary processes that affect surface abundances. Using ~450,000 stars from the GALactic Archaeology with Hermes (GALAH) survey, we identify nearly 3000 new barium-rich stars and separate them into hot (Teff &gt; 6000 K) and cool (Teff &lt; 6000 K) populations. Cross-matching with Gaia DR3, we find that 47.7% of our barium stars within 1 kpc have elevated re-normalized unit weight error (RUWE &gt;= 1.4), compared to 16.3% of a comparable sample of the GALAH field, suggesting multiplicity plays an important role in the formation of both populations of barium stars. A subset of hot barium stars exhibit low RUWE (RUWE &lt; 1.2) and [alpha/Fe] &lt; -0.2, supporting radiative levitation as an origin as well. We determine Galactic memberships using both kinematics and chemistry and find that barium stars exist in the thin disk, thick disk, and halo though they are slightly more prevalent at lower metallicities. Overall, we show evidence for barium stars produced by mass transfer and for those produced by radiative levitation, with both formation mechanisms occurring ubiquitously across the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>A Response to paper Critical Evaluation of Studies Alleging Evidence for Technosignatures in the POSS1-E Photographic Plates by Watters et al. (2026)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We respond to the critique by Watters et al. (2026) of the statistical analyses in Villarroel et al. (2025) and Bruehl &amp; Villarroel (2025). We argue that the critique conflates object-level validation with ensemble-level statistical inference and relies on a reduced, heterogeneously filtered subset originally constructed for a different scientific purpose. We further question whether the aggressively filtered subset used in Watters et al. (2026) demonstrates a meaningful improvement in sample purity, given the twenty-fold reduction in sample size. Our simple, visual check does not suggest that it does. The subset further lacks complete temporal information and is seriously statistically underpowered for testing the reported Earth-shadow deficit. We emphasise that the horizontal separation metric used for plate assignment and time reconstruction as in Watters et al. (2026) depends on the inclusion of the cos(Dec) factor to ensure geometric consistency. Any omission would alter plate assignment and inferred observation times. Moreover, the analyses presented in Watters et al. (2026) do not include uncertainty estimates or error propagation, limiting the interpretability of the claimed null results. We conclude that the principal findings reported in Villarroel et al. (2025) and Bruehl &amp; Villarroel (2025) are not invalidated by the analyses presented in Watters et al. (2026).</description>

      <title>Helium superluminous SN 2021bnw : an explosion of a massive star with a pre-outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) remain an intriguing topic in supernova (SN) transient astronomy. While the majority of SLSNe are shown to be explained by energy streaming from the newly born magnetar, there are others which are powered by different mechanisms. We analyse the pseudo-bolometric light curve of the nearby helium-rich SLSN 2021bnw. We built models and run hydrodynamics radiative-transfer simulations with STELLA. Our best-fit models include 15-22.5 Msun of ejecta enriched with 1.7 Msun of 56 Ni and carrying energy of 4 foe, and colliding w ith 7 Msun of circumstellar matter which match the observed light curve very well. The early data can be explained as cooling of an expanding shell with the mass of 0.5 Msun and kinetic energy of 0.7 foe. We tend to exclude a pulsational pair-instability (PPISN) origin for SLSN 2021bnw. Instead we conclude that SLSN 2021bnw was preferably a core-collapse explosion of a star with the initial mass of not less than 61 Msun aided by magnetorotational effects.</description>

      <title>Radial oscillations of pulsating neutron stars: The UCIa equation-of-state case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radial oscillations provide a clean dynamical test of the high-density stiffness of neutron-star equations of state. We study spherically symmetric pulsations of nonrotating relativistic stars built from cold, charge-neutral, $\beta$-equilibrated pure nucleonic matter described within relativistic mean-field theory. As a baseline we adopt the UCIa parameter set [Astron. Astro-phys. 689, A242 (2024)], and we implement high-density stiffening via the $\sigma$-cut scheme by adding a regulator potential $U_{\rm cut}(\sigma)$ [Phys. Rev. C 92, no.5, 052801 (2015), Phys. Rev. C 106, no.5, 055806 (2022)]. For representative choices $f_s=0$ (no cutoff) and $f_s=0.58$ (stiffened), we solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and tidal perturbation equations to obtain equilibrium sequences, mass-radius relations, and tidal deformabilities. We then derive and solve the linear general-relativistic radial pulsation equations to compute the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the fundamental and overtone modes. The $\sigma$-cutoff suppresses the growth of the scalar field at supranuclear density, increases the pressure, and shifts the maximum mass, radii, and $\Lambda_{1.4}$ accordingly, while systematically raising the radial-mode frequencies at fixed mass. Using the sign change of $\omega_0^2$ as a stability criterion, we identify stiffened models that remain radially stable up to the observed $\sim 2M_\odot$ mass scale and are consistent with current multimessenger constraints, demonstrating how radial spectra complement static EoS tests.</description>

      <title>Revisiting bright delta Scuti stars and their period-luminosity relation with TESS and Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have used NASA's TESS mission to study catalogued delta Scuti stars. We examined TESS light curves for 434 stars, including many for which few previous observations exist. We found that 62 are not delta Scuti pulsators, with most instead showing variability from binarity. For the 372 delta Scuti stars, we provide a catalogue of the period and amplitude of the dominant pulsation mode. Using Gaia DR3 parallaxes, we place the stars in the period-luminosity diagram and confirm previous findings that most stars lie on a ridge that corresponds to pulsation in the fundamental radial mode, and that many others fall on a second ridge that is a factor two shorter in period. This second ridge is seen more clearly than before, thanks to the revised periods and distances. We demonstrate the value of the period-luminosity diagram in distinguishing delta Scuti stars from short-period RR Lyrae stars, and we find several new examples of high-frequency delta Scuti stars with regular sequences of overtone modes, including XX Pyx and 29 Cyg. Finally, we revisit the sample of delta Scuti stars observed by Kepler and show that they follow a tight period-density relation, with a pulsation constant for the fundamental mode of Q = 0.0315 d.</description>

      <title>Identifying 850 delta Scuti pulsators in a narrow Gaia colour range with TESS 10-minute full-frame images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use TESS 10-minute Full Frame Images (Sectors 27-55) to study a sample of 1708 stars within 500 pc of the Sun that lie in a narrow colour range in the centre of the delta Scuti instability strip (0.29 &lt; BP-RP &lt; 0.31). Based on the Fourier amplitude spectra, we identify 848 delta Scuti stars, as well as 47 eclipsing or contact binaries. The strongest pulsation modes of some delta Scuti stars fall on the period-luminosity relation of the fundamental radial mode but many correspond to overtones that are approximately a factor of two higher in frequency. Many of the low-luminosity delta Scuti stars show a series of high-frequency modes with very regular spacings. The fraction of stars in our sample that show delta Scuti pulsations is about 70% for the brightest stars (G&lt;8), consistent with results from Kepler. However, the fraction drops to about 45% for fainter stars and we find that a single sector of TESS data only detects the lowest-amplitude delta Scuti pulsations (around 50 ppm) in stars down to about G=9. Finally, we have found four new high-frequency delta Scuti stars with very regular mode patterns, and have detected pulsations in lambda Mus that make it the fourth-brightest delta Scuti in the sky (G=3.63). Overall, these results confirm the power of TESS and Gaia for studying pulsating stars.</description>

      <title>The Single-Degenerate Channel Leads to Type Iax and Not Type Ia Supernovae due to Premature Ignition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are a critical tool for cosmology and galactic enrichment, yet the progenitor systems of normal SNe Ia remain a central puzzle. The long-debated single-degenerate (SD) channel, where a white dwarf (WD) accretes mass from a companion, faces major observational conflicts. Here, we present 3D hydrodynamic simulations that resolve these tensions by showing a fundamental dichotomy: accreting WDs predominantly ignite prematurely at sub-Chandrasekhar masses, producing low-energy, incomplete explosions consistent with Type Iax supernovae. Only WDs reaching a narrow mass threshold of 1.37 solar mass undergo complete destruction, characteristic of normal SNe Ia. This "safety valve" mechanism effectively recasts the SD channel as the main pathway to SNe Iax, not normal SNe Ia, providing a unified explanation for the observed scarcity of progenitor signatures in the latter and suggesting alternative channels dominate normal SNe Ia production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of bright, young $\delta$ Scuti stars near the zero-age main sequence using TESS light curves and Gaia DR3 data. From a sample of 2041 stars with G&lt;7 and $G_{BP}-G_{RP}$ colour in the range 0-0.6, we identified 444 $\delta$ Scuti pulsators. We measured a pulsator fraction of ~70% in the middle of the instability strip, tapering off towards the edges. A period - luminosity diagram reveals a concentration along the fundamental mode and overtone ridges. We addressed sample completeness and identified low-frequency pulsators possibly exhibiting mixed modes. Cross-matching with nearby young associations showed that 63 $\delta$ Scuti stars from our sample are association members.</description>

Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec high-cadence infrared spectroscopy of three long-period, eclipsing AM CVn binaries, Gaia14aae, SRGeJ0453, and ZTFJ1637. These systems have orbital periods of 50-62 minutes and cool donors that are undetectable in the optical. The data cover a wavelength range of 1.6-5.2 $\mu$m at resolution $R=1000-2000$. We obtained 150-200 spectra of each system over two orbits, split between the G235M and G395M gratings. All three systems show strong, double-peaked He I emission lines dominated by an accretion disk. These lines are nearly stationary but contain radial velocity (RV) variable sub-components that trace stream-disk interactions. In Gaia14aae and SRGeJ0453, we detect two Na I doublets in emission whose RVs track the irradiated face of the donor, marking the first direct detection of the donors of long-period AM CVns. No absorption lines from the donors are detected, implying that the IR excesses observed in many long-period AM CVns primarily trace disks, not donors. The He I emission profiles in all systems lack high-velocity wings and show no emission beyond $\approx 1500,\rm km,s^{-1}$. The morphology of the disk eclipses and Doppler tomograms are best reproduced by models in which the disk is truncated well outside the white dwarf and only material at $r \gtrsim 0.07,R_{\odot}$ contributes to the disk emission. We interpret this as possible evidence of magnetized white dwarf accretors. For plausible mass transfer rates, the truncation radii imply surface magnetic fields of $B = 30-100$ kG, consistent with recent constraints based on X-ray periodicity. The absence of cyclotron humps out to 5 $\mu$m rules out stronger MG-level fields. We make the data from the program publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the coronal magnetic field in the 2022-10-02 X-class flare</title>

Abstract: Solar flares are driven by release of free magnetic energy and often associated with restructurization of the magnetic field topology. Yet, observations of evolving magnetic field in the flaring volume are limited to very few cases including the 2017-09-10 X8.2 limb flare; thus, a verification of whether a similar evolution takes place in other solar flares is needed. Here we report one more, 2022-10-02, X1.1 class solar flare but seen on disk, whose microwave data permit mapping the magnetic field over the flaring source and tracking magnetic field evolution over the course of the flare. We found that the coronal magnetic field shows a prominent decay with the rate up to 10 G s$^{-1}$ in several (above) loop-top locations. The magnetic field is also confidently measured at the loop legs and the bottom part of the erupting filament. Prominent acceleration of electrons is detected where the magnetic field decays. We developed 3D models of the flare, whose magnetic field shows resemblance and also deviation from the magnetic field inferred from the microwave data. This study confirms that the coronal magnetic field decays during the rise phase of the solar flare. The amount of released magnetic energy is sufficient to support other components of the flare energy.</description>

      <title>Formation Channels of Magnetars</title>

Abstract: The formation channels of magnetars remain an open question. Although core collapse supernovae of isolated massive stars are important, binary interactions -- such as tidal interaction, common envelope evolution, and stellar mergers -- may also play a significant role in making magnetars. Understanding the relative contributions of these channels is crucial for linking magnetars to their observed properties and host environments. In this paper, we investigate potential magnetar formation channels using population synthesis simulations, considering both single-star and isolated binary system evolution. By conducting simulations with different parameters, we compare the effects of various evolution processes on magnetar formation. Additionally, we study the delay times and kick velocities across all formation channels, analyze the orbital properties and companion types of surviving magnetar binaries. We find that the majority of magnetars are observed as single objects ($\geq 90\%$), although a large fraction of them were originally in binary systems and experienced either kick disruption or merger. Surviving binaries are most likely to host main-sequence companions and exhibit different distributions of eccentricities due to different supernova mechanisms. These findings show the critical role of binary evolution in magnetar formation and provide predictions for the properties of magnetar populations that can be tested with future observations.</description>
