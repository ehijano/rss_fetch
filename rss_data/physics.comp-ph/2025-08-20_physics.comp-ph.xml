      <title>Very High-order Compact Gas-kinetic Scheme With Discontinuity Feedback Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust and efficient very high-order scheme for compressible flow simulation, addressing critical limitations of existing high-order methods. The proposed scheme combines the compact gas-kinetic scheme (CGKS) with an adaptive stencil extension reconstruction with discontinuity feedback factor (ASE-DFF), achieving significant improvements in both robustness and computational efficiency. Traditional weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes suffer from reduced robustness at higher order and require costly smoothness indicators for large stencils. Meanwhile, compact methods based on Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and Flux Reconstruction (FR) struggle with poor time-marching efficiency. In contrast, the ASE-DFF-CGKS introduces two key innovations: (1) a unified framework enabling arbitrarily high-order compact gas-kinetic scheme without sacrificing large CFL number, and (2) a discontinuity feedback factor that eliminates the need for expensive smoothness indicator calculations while essentially keeping first-order robustness near discontinuities. The scheme's advantages are demonstrated through benchmark simulations. It maintains a CFL number above 0.5 for up to 9th-order case, unlike conventional compact methods that restrict a CFL less than 0.05. Also it delivers high-resolution results for flow involving strong shock and rarefaction wave. This work provides a practically impactful solution for high-fidelity compressible flow simulation, balancing computational efficiency, high-order accuracy and robustness in challenging flow regimes.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the cascading tipping probability from the AMOC to the Amazon rainforest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Amazon rainforest and the AMOC are two key components of the Earth system and may both collapse under climate change. Due to its influence on precipitation patterns, a collapsed AMOC influences the dynamics of the Amazon rainforest. We investigate this effect using a coupled conceptual AMOC-Amazon model. The Amazon model is based on empirical hydrological data controlled by the AMOC strength. The AMOC model and its influence on the Amazon are tuned using a simulated AMOC collapse in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Since the collapse of both systems is very rare, we study it using a ``rare-event'' algorithm, which samples such events much more efficiently than direct numerical simulation. This algorithm also allows us to track many observables of interest of the coupled model. We find that in the centre of the Amazon basin an AMOC collapse is a necessary condition for the Amazon rainforest to collapse, due to its important drying effect. Moreover, we are able to quantify the importance of the AMOC in this tipping cascade by computing the conditional probability that the collapse of the Amazon rainforest follows that of the AMOC, given that the Amazon rainforest turns into a savannah within $200$ years.</description>

      <title>Towards Routine Condensed Phase Simulations with Delta-Learned Coupled Cluster Accuracy: Application to Liquid Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating liquid water to an accuracy that matches its wealth of available experimental data requires both precise electronic structure methods and reliable sampling of nuclear (quantum) motion. This is challenging because applying the electronic structure method of choice - coupled cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] - to condensed phase systems is currently limited by its computational cost and complexity. Recent tour-de-force efforts have demonstrated that this accuracy can indeed bring simulated liquid water into close agreement with experiment using machine learning potentials (MLPs). However, achieving this remains far from routine, requiring large datasets and significant computational cost. In this work, we introduce a practical approach that combines developments in MLPs with local correlation approximations to enable routine CCSD(T)-level simulations of liquid water. When combined with nuclear quantum effects, we achieve agreement to experiments for structural and transport properties. Crucially, this approach extends beyond constant volume to constant pressure simulations, allowing fundamental properties such as the density to now be predicted by MLP-based CCSD(T) models. Importantly, the approach also handles constant pressure simulations, enabling MLP-based CCSD(T) models to predict isothermal-isobaric bulk properties, such as water's density maximum in close agreement with experiment. Encompassing tests across electronic structure, datasets and MLP architecture, this work provides a practical blueprint towards routinely developing CCSD(T)-based MLPs for the condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Gold-Standard Chemical Database 138 (GSCDB138): A diverse set of accurate energy differences for assessing and developing density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GSCDB138, a rigorously curated benchmark library of 138 data sets (8383 entries) covering main-group and transition-metal reaction energies and barrier heights, non-covalent interactions, dipole moments, polarizabilities, electric-field response energies, and vibrational frequencies. Legacy data from GMTKN55 and MGCDB84 have been updated to today's best reference values; redundant, spincontaminated, or low-quality points were removed, and many new, property-focused sets were added. Testing 29 popular density-functional approximations shows the expected Jacob's-ladder hierarchy overall, yet reveals interesting exceptions: r2SCAN-D4 (meta-GGA) rivals hybrids for frequencies, and electric-field errors correlate poorly with ground-state energetics. {\omega}B97M-V and {\omega}B97X-V are the most balanced hybrid meta-GGA and hybrid GGA, respectively; B97M-V and revPBE-D4 lead the metaGGA and GGA classes. Double hybrids lower mean errors by about 25 % versus the best hybrids but demand careful frozen-core, basis-set, and multi-reference treatment. GSCDB138 offers a comprehensive, openly documented platform for stringent DFA validation and for training the next generation of non-empirical and machine-learned functionals.</description>

      <title>AI-Augmented Photon-Trapping Spectrometer-on-a-Chip on Silicon Platform with Extended Near-Infrared Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a compact, noise-resilient reconstructive spectrometer-on-a-chip that achieves high-resolution hyperspectral imaging across an extended near-infrared (NIR) range up to 1100nm. The device integrates monolithically fabricated silicon photodiodes enhanced with photon-trapping surface textures (PTST), enabling improved responsivity in the low-absorption NIR regime. Leveraging a fully connected neural network, we demonstrate accurate spectral reconstruction from only 16 uniquely engineered detectors, achieving &lt;0.05 RMSE and 8nm resolution over a wide spectral range of 640nm to 1100nm. Our system outperforms conventional spectrometers, maintaining signal-to-noise ratio above 30dB even with 40dB of added detector noise; extending functionality to longer wavelengths up to 1100nm, while the traditional spectrometers fail to perform beyond 950nm due to poor detector efficiency and noise performance. With a footprint of 0.4mm2, dynamic range of 50dB, ultrafast time response (57ps), and high photodiode gain (&gt;7000), this AI-augmented silicon spectrometer is well-suited for portable, real-time, and low-light applications in biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing. The results establish a pathway toward fully integrated, high-performance hyperspectral sensing in a CMOS-compatible platform.</description>

      <title>LAMMPS-KOKKOS: Performance Portable Molecular Dynamics Across Exascale Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its inception in 1995, LAMMPS has grown to be a world-class molecular dynamics code, with thousands of users, over one million lines of code, and multi-scale simulation capabilities. We discuss how LAMMPS has adapted to the modern heterogeneous computing landscape by integrating the Kokkos performance portability library into the existing C++ code. We investigate performance portability of simple pairwise, many-body reactive, and machine-learned force-field interatomic potentials. We present results on GPUs across different vendors and generations, and analyze performance trends, probing FLOPS throughput, memory bandwidths, cache capabilities, and thread-atomic operation performance. Finally, we demonstrate strong scaling on all current US exascale machines -- OLCF Frontier, and ALCF Aurora, and NNSA El Capitan -- for the three potentials.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Programmable Origami Metamaterials with Controlled Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Origami-inspired structures provide unprecedented opportunities for creating lightweight, deployable systems with programmable mechanical responses. However, their design remains challenging due to complex nonlinear mechanics, multistability, and the need for precise control of deployment forces. Here, we present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for both forward prediction and inverse design of conical Kresling origami (CKO) without requiring pre-collected training data. By embedding mechanical equilibrium equations directly into the learning process, the model predicts complete energy landscapes with high accuracy while minimizing non-physical artifacts. The inverse design routine specifies both target stable-state heights and separating energy barriers, enabling freeform programming of the entire energy curve. This capability is extended to hierarchical CKO assemblies, where sequential layer-by-layer deployment is achieved through programmed barrier magnitudes. Finite element simulations and experiments on physical prototypes validate the designed deployment sequences and barrier ratios, confirming the robustness of the approach. This work establishes a versatile, data-free route for programming complex mechanical energy landscapes in origami-inspired metamaterials, offering broad potential for deployable aerospace systems, morphing structures, and soft robotic actuators.</description>

      <title>Generative Super-Resolution of Turbulent Flows via Stochastic Interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capturing the intricate multiscale features of turbulent flows remains a fundamental challenge due to the limited resolution of experimental data and the computational cost of high-fidelity simulations. In many practical scenarios only coarse representations of the flows are feasible, leaving crucial fine-scale dynamics unresolved. This study addresses that limitation by leveraging generative models to perform super-resolution of velocity fields and reconstruct the unresolved scales from low-resolution conditionals. In particular, the recently formalized stochastic interpolants are employed to super-resolve a case study of two-dimensional turbulence. Key to our approach is the iterative application of stochastic interpolants over local patches of the flow field, that enables efficient reconstruction without the need to process the full domain simultaneously. The patch-wise strategy is shown to yield physically consistent super-resolved flow snapshots, and key statistical quantities -- such as the kinetic energy spectrum and the spatially averaged dissipation rate -- are accurately recovered. Moreover, compared with full-field reconstruction, the patch-wise approach produces higher-quality super-resolutions, and, in general, stochastic interpolants are observed to outperform contesting generative models across a range of metrics. These results establish stochastic interpolants as a viable tool for super-resolving turbulent flows and highlight their potential for future applications.</description>

      <title>Uniform electron benchmark for the first-principles $GW_{0}$-Eliashberg theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the numerical behavior of the Eliashberg equations for phonon-mediated superconductivity, incorporating normal-state self-energy calculations within the consistent $GW_{0}$ approximation. We account for the full wavenumber and frequency dependences of both the screened Coulomb interaction and phonon-mediated attraction. We present results for the prototypical uniform electron gas system with model Einstein phonons at temperatures of a few kelvin. At extremely low temperatures, we efficiently execute the required convolutions of Green's functions and interactions in Matsubara frequency and wavenumber using intermediate representation and Fourier convolution techniques. In particular, we elucidate the interplay between electron-phonon $\omega$-mass and $k$-mass renormalizations of the electronic self-energy in determining the normal-state effective mass, spectral weight and the superconducting transition temperature. The electron density regimes where the plasmon effect enhances or suppresses the phonon-mediated superconductivity on top of the static Coulomb effect are revealed. We compare our comprehensive Eliashberg calculation results with those from density functional theory for superconductors, where the functionals have been constructed with reference to Eliashberg theory. Our model, methods, and results provide a valuable benchmark for first-principles superconducting calculations that treat screened Coulomb interaction effects non-empirically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigation of the approximation properties, convergence, and stability of the ADER-DG method for solving an ODE system is carried out. The ADER-DG method generates a new implicit RK method, which is similar in its properties to the original ADER-DG method. The ADER-DG method has an approximation order $2N+1$ when using polynomials of degree $N$ for the numerical solution at grid nodes, and demonstrates superconvergence. The local solution obtained by the local DG predictor has an approximation order $N+1$ and has a subgrid resolution. The ADER-DG method is $A$- and $AN$-stable, $L$-stable, $B$- and $BN$-stable, and algebraically stable. Applications of the ADER-DG method demonstrated compliance with the expected theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Extraction of the self energy and Eliashberg function from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy using the \textsc{xARPES} code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique for studying anisotropic many-body interactions through the electron spectral function. Existing attempts to decompose the spectral function into non-interacting dispersions and electron-phonon, electron-electron, and electron-impurity self-energies rely on linearization of the bands and manual assignment of self-energy magnitudes. Here, we show how self-energies can be extracted consistently for curved dispersions. We extend the maximum-entropy method to Eliashberg-function extraction with Bayesian inference, optimizing the parameters describing the dispersions and the magnitudes of electron-electron and electron-impurity interactions. We compare these novel methodologies with state-of-the-art approaches on model data, then demonstrate their applicability with two high-quality experimental data sets. With the first set, we identify the phonon modes of a two-dimensional electron liquid on TiO$_2$-terminated SrTiO$_3$. With the second set, we obtain unprecedented agreement between two Eliashberg functions of Li-doped graphene extracted from separate dispersions. We release these functionalities in the novel Python code \textsc{xARPES}.</description>

      <title>OpenLB-UQ: An Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Incompressible Fluid Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial in computational fluid dynamics to assess the reliability and robustness of simulations, given the uncertainties in input parameters. OpenLB is an open-source lattice Boltzmann method library designed for efficient and extensible simulations of complex fluid dynamics on high-performance computers. In this work, we leverage the efficiency of OpenLB for large-scale flow sampling with a dedicated and integrated UQ module. To this end, we focus on non-intrusive stochastic collocation methods based on generalized polynomial chaos and Monte Carlo sampling. The OpenLB-UQ framework is extensively validated in convergence tests with respect to statistical metrics and sample efficiency using selected benchmark cases, including two-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex flows with up to four-dimensional uncertainty and a flow past a cylinder. Our results confirm the expected convergence rates and show promising scalability, demonstrating robust statistical accuracy as well as computational efficiency. OpenLB-UQ enhances the capability of the OpenLB library, offering researchers a scalable framework for UQ in incompressible fluid flow simulations and beyond.</description>

      <title>Qudit-based scalable quantum algorithm for solving the integer programming problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integer programming (IP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that is widely used to represent a diverse set of real-world problems spanning multiple fields, such as finance, engineering, logistics, and operations research. It is a hard problem to solve using classical algorithms, as its complexity increases exponentially with problem size. Most quantum algorithms for solving IP are highly resource inefficient because they encode integers into qubits. In [1], the issue of resource inefficiency was addressed by mapping integer variables to qudits. However, [1] has limited practical value due to a lack of scalability to multiple qudits to encode larger problems. In this work, by extending upon the ideas of [1], a circuit-based scalable quantum algorithm is presented using multiple interacting qudits for which we show a quantum speed-up. The quantum algorithm consists of a distillation function that efficiently separates the feasible from the infeasible regions, a phase-amplitude encoding for the cost function, and a quantum phase estimation coupled with a multi-controlled single-qubit rotation for optimization. We prove that the optimal solution has the maximum probability of being measured in our algorithm. The time complexity for the quantum algorithm is shown to be $O(d^{n/2} + m\cdot n^2\cdot \log{d} + n/\epsilon_{QPE})$ for a problem with the number of variables $n$ taking $d$ integer values, satisfying $m$ constraints with a precision of $\epsilon_{QPE}$. Compared to the classical time complexity of brute force $O(d^n)$ and the best classical exact algorithm $O((\log{n})^{3n})$, it incurs a reduction of $d^{n/2}$ in the time complexity in terms of $n$ for solving a general polynomial IP problem.</description>

      <title>RiteWeight: Randomized Iterative Trajectory Reweighting for Steady-State Distributions Without Discretization Error</title>

Abstract: A significant challenge in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is ensuring that sampled configurations converge to the equilibrium or nonequilibrium stationary distribution of interest. Lack of convergence constrains the estimation of free energies, rates, and mechanisms of complex molecular events. Here, we introduce the "Randomized ITErative trajectory reWeighting" (RiteWeight) algorithm to estimate a stationary distribution from unconverged simulation data. This method iteratively reweights trajectory segments in a self-consistent way by solving for the stationary distribution of a Markov state model (MSM), updating segment weights, and employing a new random clustering in each iteration. The iterative random clustering mitigates the phase-space discretization error inherent in existing trajectory reweighting techniques and yields quasi-continuous configuration-space distributions. We present mathematical analysis of the algorithm's fixed points as well as empirical validation using both synthetic MD Trp-cage trajectories, for which the stationary solution is exactly calculable, and standard atomistic MD Trp-cage trajectories extracted from a long reference simulation. In both test systems, we find that RiteWeight corrects flawed distributions and generates accurate observables for equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states. The results highlight the value of correcting the underlying trajectory distribution rather than using a standard MSM</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions and Chaotic Behavior of the SYK Chain Model in Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations of R\'enyi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions have indicated that the model exhibits slow thermalization when initialized in certain states. The extent to which the heavy modes -- believed to underlie this behavior -- affect other aspects of the model remains an open question. In this work, I study thermalization and scrambling of information in individual energy eigenstates of the SYK chain using exact diagonalization. I show that two-point correlation functions in finite-energy eigenstates closely match their thermal counterparts and that information scrambling occurs efficiently within these pure states. These results suggest that the slow thermalization observed in entanglement dynamics does not extend to all probes of thermalization and scrambling, even in pure states. I discuss the implications of these findings for thermal states in a potential holographic dual theory.</description>

      <title>Single attosecond XUV pulse source via light-wave controlled relativistic laser-plasma interaction: Thomson Back Scattering Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16949</link>

Abstract: Reflecting light off a mirror moving near light speed offers a powerful method for generating bright, ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet range. Several investigations show that dense relativistic electron mirrors can be created by striking a nanometre-scale foil with a high-intensity, sharp-front laser pulse, forming a single relativistic electron sheet (RES). This RES coherently reflects and upshifts a counter-propagating laser beam from the infrared to the extreme ultraviolet with efficiency exceeding incoherent scattering by over several orders of magnitude. Here we demonstrate that optimizing the drive laser waveform can reliably produce a single RES, leading to generation of isolated \emph{attosecond} pulses enhancing both intensity and temporal compression of the back reflected light in a controlled manner. Simulations reveal that tuning parameters like timing delay enables control over the amplitude, duration, and bandwidth of the resulting attosecond Thomson backscattering pulse. Together, these advances meet key experimental challenges and pave the way for compact, tunable sources of isolated attosecond pulses for probing ultrafast phenomena.</description>

      <title>Modeling wind farm noise emission and propagation: effects of flow and layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates how wind farm flow physics influence noise generation and downstream propagation through numerical simulations. The flow field is modeled using large-eddy simulations (LES), and the time-averaged output serves as input to acoustic models that predict wind turbine noise. In the first turbine row, turbulence-induced noise (TIN) and trailing edge noise (TEN) contribute equally, with TIN dominating at low frequencies and TEN at higher frequencies. Downstream, TEN decreases due to lower wind speeds, while TIN mostly persists due to increased turbulence dissipation. These effects are more pronounced in aligned wind farms, where stronger wake interactions occur, than in staggered layouts. However, staggered farms produce more noise overall because turbines operate at higher wind speeds.Additionally, wind farm flow significantly affects sound propagation downwind. The wake superposition modifies sound focusing leading to different amplification area than for an isolated turbine. For a staggered layout it particularly shows enhanced sound focusing downwind due to the position of the turbine wakes. This leads to higher sound levels and higher amplitude modulation downwind for the wind farm compared to an aligned layout. These phenomena are not captured by models based on isolated turbines. These findings underscore the importance of integrating flow and acoustic models to more accurately assess the environmental impact of wind farms.</description>
