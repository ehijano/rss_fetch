      <title>Rethinking Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta for Compression Efficiency Evaluation: Are We Calculating It Precisely and Reliably?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades, the Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta (BD) has been the metric for evaluating codec Rate-Distortion (R-D) performance. Yet, in most studies, BD is determined using just 4-5 R-D data points, could this be sufficient? As codecs and quality metrics advance, does the conventional BD estimation still hold up? Crucially, are the performance improvements of new codecs and tools genuine, or merely artifacts of estimation flaws? This paper addresses these concerns by reevaluating BD estimation. We present a novel approach employing a parameterized deep neural network to model R-D curves with high precision across various metrics, accompanied by a comprehensive R-D dataset. This approach both assesses the reliability of BD calculations and serves as a precise BD estimator. Our findings advocate for the adoption of rigorous R-D sampling and reliability metrics in future compression research to ensure the validity and reliability of results.</description>

      <title>LocoMotion: Learning Motion-Focused Video-Language Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper strives for motion-focused video-language representations. Existing methods to learn video-language representations use spatial-focused data, where identifying the objects and scene is often enough to distinguish the relevant caption. We instead propose LocoMotion to learn from motion-focused captions that describe the movement and temporal progression of local object motions. We achieve this by adding synthetic motions to videos and using the parameters of these motions to generate corresponding captions. Furthermore, we propose verb-variation paraphrasing to increase the caption variety and learn the link between primitive motions and high-level verbs. With this, we are able to learn a motion-focused video-language representation. Experiments demonstrate our approach is effective for a variety of downstream tasks, particularly when limited data is available for fine-tuning.

      <title>Test-time adaptation for image compression with distribution regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current test- or compression-time adaptation image compression (TTA-IC) approaches, which leverage both latent and decoder refinements as a two-step adaptation scheme, have potentially enhanced the rate-distortion (R-D) performance of learned image compression models on cross-domain compression tasks, \textit{e.g.,} from natural to screen content images. However, compared with the emergence of various decoder refinement variants, the latent refinement, as an inseparable ingredient, is barely tailored to cross-domain scenarios. To this end, we aim to develop an advanced latent refinement method by extending the effective hybrid latent refinement (HLR) method, which is designed for \textit{in-domain} inference improvement but shows noticeable degradation of the rate cost in \textit{cross-domain} tasks. Specifically, we first provide theoretical analyses, in a cue of marginalization approximation from in- to cross-domain scenarios, to uncover that the vanilla HLR suffers from an underlying mismatch between refined Gaussian conditional and hyperprior distributions, leading to deteriorated joint probability approximation of marginal distribution with increased rate consumption. To remedy this issue, we introduce a simple Bayesian approximation-endowed \textit{distribution regularization} to encourage learning a better joint probability approximation in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on six in- and cross-domain datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only improves the R-D performance compared with other latent refinement counterparts, but also can be flexibly integrated into existing TTA-IC methods with incremental benefits.</description>

      <title>OmnixR: Evaluating Omni-modality Language Models on Reasoning across Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce OmnixR, an evaluation suite designed to benchmark SoTA Omni-modality Language Models, such as GPT-4o and Gemini. Evaluating OLMs, which integrate multiple modalities such as text, vision, and audio, presents unique challenges. Particularly, the user message might often consist of multiple modalities, such that OLMs have to establish holistic understanding and reasoning across modalities to accomplish the task. Existing benchmarks are limited to single modality or dual-modality tasks, overlooking comprehensive multi-modal assessments of model reasoning. To address this, OmnixR offers two evaluation variants: (1)synthetic subset: a synthetic dataset generated automatically by translating text into multiple modalities--audio, images, video, and hybrids (Omnify). (2)realistic subset: a real-world dataset, manually curated and annotated by experts, for evaluating cross-modal reasoning in natural settings. OmnixR presents a unique evaluation towards assessing OLMs over a diverse mix of modalities, such as a question that involves video, audio, and text, providing a rigorous cross-modal reasoning testbed unlike any existing benchmarks. Our experiments find that all state-of-the-art OLMs struggle with OmnixR questions that require integrating information from multiple modalities to answer. Further analysis highlights differences in reasoning behavior, underscoring the challenges of omni-modal AI alignment.</description>

      <title>Beyond Coarse-Grained Matching in Video-Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12407v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-text retrieval has seen significant advancements, yet the ability of models to discern subtle differences in captions still requires verification. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for fine-grained evaluation. Our approach can be applied to existing datasets by automatically generating hard negative test captions with subtle single-word variations across nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions. We perform comprehensive experiments using four state-of-the-art models across two standard benchmarks (MSR-VTT and VATEX) and two specially curated datasets enriched with detailed descriptions (VLN-UVO and VLN-OOPS), resulting in a number of novel insights: 1) our analyses show that the current evaluation benchmarks fall short in detecting a model's ability to perceive subtle single-word differences, 2) our fine-grained evaluation highlights the difficulty models face in distinguishing such subtle variations. To enhance fine-grained understanding, we propose a new baseline that can be easily combined with current methods. Experiments on our fine-grained evaluations demonstrate that this approach enhances a model's ability to understand fine-grained differences.</description>

      <title>Embedding an Ethical Mind: Aligning Text-to-Image Synthesis via Lightweight Value Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models trained on large-scale data have enabled the generation of indistinguishable human-level images, yet they often produce harmful content misaligned with human values, e.g., social bias, and offensive content. Despite extensive research on Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge of Text-to-Image (T2I) model alignment remains largely unexplored. Addressing this problem, we propose LiVO (Lightweight Value Optimization), a novel lightweight method for aligning T2I models with human values. LiVO only optimizes a plug-and-play value encoder to integrate a specified value principle with the input prompt, allowing the control of generated images over both semantics and values. Specifically, we design a diffusion model-tailored preference optimization loss, which theoretically approximates the Bradley-Terry model used in LLM alignment but provides a more flexible trade-off between image quality and value conformity. To optimize the value encoder, we also develop a framework to automatically construct a text-image preference dataset of 86k (prompt, aligned image, violating image, value principle) samples. Without updating most model parameters and through adaptive value selection from the input prompt, LiVO significantly reduces harmful outputs and achieves faster convergence, surpassing several strong baselines and taking an initial step towards ethically aligned T2I models.</description>

      <title>Video-to-Audio Generation with Hidden Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.</description>
