      <title>White matter tract crossing and bottleneck regions in the fetal brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in using diffusion MRI to study the white matter tracts and structural connectivity of the fetal brain. Recent progress in data acquisition and processing suggests that this imaging modality has a unique role in elucidating the normal and abnormal patterns of neurodevelopment in utero. However, there have been no efforts to quantify the prevalence of crossing tracts and bottleneck regions, important issues that have been extensively researched for adult brains. In this work, we determined the brain regions with crossing tracts and bottlenecks between 23 and 36 gestational weeks. We performed probabilistic tractography on 59 fetal brain scans and extracted a set of 51 distinct white tracts, which we grouped into 10 major tract bundle groups. We analyzed the results to determine the patterns of tract crossings and bottlenecks. Our results showed that 20-25% of the white matter voxels included two or three crossing tracts. Bottlenecks were more prevalent. Between 75-80% of the voxels were characterized as bottlenecks, with more than 40% of the voxels involving four or more tracts. The results of this study highlight the challenge of fetal brain tractography and structural connectivity assessment and call for innovative image acquisition and analysis methods to mitigate these problems.</description>

      <title>Harmonic fractal transformation, 4R-regeneration and noise shaping for ultra wide-band reception in FitzHugh-Nagumo neuronal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human hearing range significantly surpasses the typical neuronal spiking frequency. Yet, neurons with their modest frequency range not only efficiently receive and process multiple orders higher frequency signals, but also demonstrate remarkable stability and adaptability to frequency variations in brain functional connectivity. Ability to process signals beyond the limitations of the receiver temporal or frequency (bandwidth) resolution is highly desirable yet requires complex design architectures. Using the FitzHugh-Nagumo model we reveal the harmonic fractal transformation of frequency and bandwidth, which enables the Nyquist rate integer (for low frequencies) and sub-integer (for high frequencies) multiplication. We also demonstrate for the first time that noise shaping can be achieved in a simple RLC-circuit without a requirement of a delay line. The discovered effect presents a novel regeneration type - 4R: re-amplifying, re-shaping, re-timing, and re-modulating and due to the fractal nature of transformation offers a remarkable regenerative efficiency. The effect is a generalization of phase locking to non-periodic encoded signals. The discovered physical mechanism explains how using neuronal functionality one can receive and process signals over an ultra-wide band (below or higher the spiking neuronal range by multiple orders) and below the noise floor.</description>
