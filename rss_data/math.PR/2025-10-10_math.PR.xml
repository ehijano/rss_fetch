      <title>Curve separation in supercritical half-space last passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study line ensembles arising naturally in symmetrized/half-space geometric last passage percolation (LPP) on the $N \times N$ square. The weights of the model are geometrically distributed with parameter $q^2$ off the diagonal and $cq$ on the diagonal, where $q \in (0,1)$ and $c \in (0, q^{-1})$. In the supercritical regime $c &gt; 1$, we show that the ensembles undergo a phase transition: the top curve separates from the rest and converges to a Brownian motion under $N^{1/2}$ fluctuations and $N$ spatial scaling, while the remaining curves converge to the Airy line ensemble under $N^{1/3}$ fluctuations and $N^{2/3}$ spatial scaling. Our analysis relies on a distributional identity between half-space LPP and the Pfaffian Schur process. The latter exhibits two key structures: (1) a Pfaffian point process, which we use to establish finite-dimensional convergence of the ensembles, and (2) a Gibbsian line ensemble, which we use to extend convergence uniformly over compact sets.</description>

      <title>From tug-of-war to Brownian Boost: explicit ODE solutions for player-funded stochastic-differential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian Boost is a one-parameter family of stochastic differential games played on the real line in which players spend at rates of their choosing in an ongoing effort to influence the drift of a randomly diffusing point particle~$X$. One or other player is rewarded, at time infinity, according to whether~$X$ tends to plus or minus infinity. Each player's net receipt is the final reward (only for the victor) minus the player's total spend. We characterise and explicitly compute the time-homogeneous Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of Brownian Boost, finding the derivatives of the players' expected payoffs to solve a pair of coupled first-order non-linear ODE. Brownian Boost is a high-noise limit of a two-dimensional family of player-funded tug-of-war games, one of which was studied in~\cite{LostPennies}. We analyse the discrete games, finding them, and Brownian Boost, to exemplify key features studied in the economics literature of tug-of-war initiated by~\cite{HarrisVickers87}: a battlefield region where players spend heavily;
  stakes that decay rapidly but asymmetrically in distance to the battlefield; and an effect of discouragement that makes equilibria fragile under asymmetric perturbation of incentive.
  Tug-of-war has a parallel mathematical literature derived from~\cite{PSSW09}, which solved the scaled fair-coin game in a Euclidean domain via the infinity Laplacian PDE. By offering an analytic solution to Brownian Boost, a game that models strategic interaction and resource allocation, we seek to build a bridge between the two tug-of-war literatures.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of Markov shifts (part I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove central limit theorems, Berry-Esseen type theorems, almost sure invariance principles, large deviations and Livsic type regularity for partial sums of the form $S_n=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f_j(...,X_{j-1},X_j,X_{j+1},...)$, where $(X_j)$ is an inhomogeneous Markov chain satisfying some mixing assumptions and $f_j$ is a sequence of sufficiently regular functions. Even though the case of non-stationary chains and time dependent functions $f_j$ is more challenging, our results seem to be new already for stationary Markov chains. They also seem to be new for non-stationary Bernoulli shifts (that is when $(X_j)$ are independent but not identically distributed). This paper is the first one in a series of two papers. In \cite{Work} we will prove local limit theorems including developing the related reduction theory in the sense of \cite{DolgHaf LLT, DS}.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous branching trees with symmetric and asymmetric offspring and their genealogies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define symmetric and asymmetric branching trees, a class of processes particularly suited for modeling genealogies of inhomogeneous populations where individuals may reproduce throughout life. In this framework, a broad class of Crump-Mode-Jagers processes can be constructed as (a)symmetric Sevast'yanov processes, which count the branches of the tree. Analogous definitions yield reduced (a)symmetric Sevast'yanov processes, which restrict attention to branches that lead to extant progeny. We characterize their laws through generating functions. The genealogy obtained by pruning away branches without extant progeny at a fixed time is shown to satisfy a branching property, which provides distributional characterizations of the genealogy.</description>

      <title>Precise convergence rate of spectral radius of product of complex Ginibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Z_1, \cdots, Z_n$ denote the eigenvalues of the product $\prod_{j=1}^{k_n} \boldsymbol{A}_j$, where $\{\boldsymbol{A}_j\}_{1 \le j \le k_n}$ are independent $n\times n$ complex Ginibre matrices. Define $\alpha = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{k_n}$. We prove that $X_n,$ a suitably rescaled version of $\max_{1 \le j \le n} |Z_j|^2,$ converges weakly as follows: to a non-trivial distribution $\Phi_\alpha$ for $\alpha \in (0, +\infty)$, to the Gumbel distribution when $\alpha = +\infty$, and to the standard normal distribution when $\alpha = 0$. This result reveals a phase transition at the boundaries of $\alpha$. Furthermore, we establish the exact rates of convergence in each regime.</description>

      <title>Sharp Non-uniqueness in Law for Stochastic Differential Equations on the Whole Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stochastic differential equation on $\mathbb{R}^d,d\geq2$: \begin{align*}
  \dif X_t&amp;=v(t,X_t)\dif t+\sqrt{2} \dif W_t. \end{align*} For any finite collection of initial probability measures $\{\mu^i_0\}_{1\leq i\leq M}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\frac{d}{p}+\frac{1}{r}&gt;1$, we construct a divergence-free drift field $v\in L_t^rL^p\cap C_tL^{d-}$ such that the associated SDE admits at least two distinct weak solutions originating from each initial measure $\mu^i_0$. This result is sharp in view of the well-known uniqueness of strong solutions for drifts in $C_tL^{d+}$, as established in \cite{KR05}. As a corollary, there exists a measurable set $A\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ with positive Lebesgue measure such that for any $x\in A$, the SDE with drift $v$ admits at least two weak solutions when with start in $x\in A$. The proof proceeds by constructing two distinct probability solutions to the associated Fokker-Planck equation via a convex integration method adapted to all of $\mathbb{R}^d$ (instead of merely the torus), together with refined heat kernel estimate.</description>

      <title>Nested superposition principle for random measures and the geometry of the Wasserstein on Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric structure of the space of random measures $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathcal{P}_p(X))$, endowed with the Wasserstein on Wasserstein metric, where $(X, d)$ is a complete separable metric space. In this setting, we prove a metric superposition principle, in the spirit of the result by S. Lisini, that will allow us to recover important geometric features of the space. When $X$ is $\mathbb{R}^d$, we study the differential structure of $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^d))$ in analogy with the simpler Wasserstein space $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$. We show that continuity equations for random measures involving the abstract concept of derivation acting on cylinder functions can be more conveniently described by suitable non-local vector fields $b:[0,T]\times \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to \mathbb{R}^d$. In this way, we can: 1) characterize the absolutely continuous curves on the Wasserstein on Wasserstein space; 2) define and characterize its tangent bundle; 3) prove a superposition principle for the solutions to the standard non-local continuity equation in terms of solutions of interacting particle systems.</description>

      <title>First order equation on random measures as superposition of weak solutions to the McKean-Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to define an evolution equation for a curve of random probability measures $(M_t)_{t\in[0,T]}\subset \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d))$ associated to a non-local drift $b:[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and a non-local diffusion term $a:[0,T]\times \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to \operatorname{Sym}_+(\mathbb{R}^{d\times d})$. Then, we show that any solution to that equation can be lifted to a superposition of solutions to a non-linear Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equation and also to a superposition of weak solutions to the McKean-Vlasov equations. Finally, we use this superposition result to show how existence and uniqueness can be transferred from the equation on random measures to the associated non-linear Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equation and to the McKean-Vlasov equation, assuming uniqueness of the linearized KFP.</description>

      <title>A coupling-based approach to f-divergences diagnostics for Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing gap exists between the theoretical analysis of Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence, which is often based on statistical divergences, and the diagnostics used in practice. We introduce the first general convergence diagnostics for Markov chain Monte Carlo based on any f-divergence, allowing users to directly monitor, among others, the Kullback--Leibler and the $\chi^2$ divergences as well as the Hellinger and the total variation distances. Our first key contribution is a coupling-based `weight harmonization' scheme that produces a direct, computable, and consistent weighting of interacting Markov chains with respect to their target distribution. The second key contribution is to show how such consistent weightings of empirical measures can be used to provide upper bounds to f-divergences in general. We prove that these bounds are guaranteed to tighten over time and converge to zero as the chains approach stationarity, providing a concrete diagnostic. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is a practical and competitive diagnostic tool.</description>

      <title>Deterministic algorithms for inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials: Shapley value of network devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose that $n$ computer devices are to be connected to a network via inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials. The Shapley value of a device quantifies how much the network's value increases due to the participation of that device. Characteristic functions of such games are naturally taken as the belief function (containment function) and Choquet capacity (hitting probability) of a random set (random network of devices).
  Traditionally, the Shapley value is either calculated as the expected marginal contribution over all possible coalitions (subnetworks), which results in exponential computational complexity, or approximated by the Monte Carlo sampling technique, where the performance is highly dependent on the stochastic sampling process.
  The purpose of this study is to design deterministic algorithms for games formulated via inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials that approximate the Shapley value in linear or quadratic time, with rigorous error analysis (Sections 3 and 4). Additionally, we provide a review of relevant literature on existing calculation methods in Remark 3.1 and Appendix I.
  A further goal is to supplement Shapley's original proof by deriving the Shapley value formula using a rigorous approach based on definite integrals and combinatorial analysis. This method explicitly highlights the roles of the Binomial Theorem and the Beta function in the proof, addressing a gap in Shapley's work (Appendix II).</description>

      <title>Minimal Denominators Lying in Subsets of the Ring of Polynomials over a Finite Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ and fixed $n,m\in \mathbb{N}$, one can study the distribution of the value of the smallest denominator $Q\in \mathcal{S}$, for which there exists $\mathbf{P}\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]^m$ such that $\frac{P}{Q}\in B(\boldsymbol{\alpha},q^{-n})$, where $Q\in \mathcal{S}$. On the other hand, one can study the discrete analogue, when $N\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ is a polynomial with $\deg(N)=n$ and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in \frac{1}{N}\mathbb{F}_q[x]^m$ as a discrete probability distribution function. We prove that for any infinite subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[x]$, for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, and for any dimension $m$, the probability distribution functions of both these random variables are equal to one another. This is significantly stronger than the real setting, where Balazard and Martin proved that these functions have asymptotically close averages, when there are no restrictions on the denominators.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Rule-Based Achlioptas Processes for Random $k$-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the "power-of-two-choices" model from random graphs, we investigate the possibility of limited choices of online clause choices that could shift the satisfiability threshold in random $k$-SAT.Here, we introduce an assignment symmetric, non-adaptive, topology-oblivious online rule called \emph{MIDDLE-HEAVY}, that prioritizes balanced sign profile clauses.Upon applying a biased $2$-SAT projection and a two-type branching process certificate, we derive closed-form expressions for the shifted thresholds $\alpha_{\textbf{SYM}}(k,\ell)$ for this algorithm.We show that minimal choices $\ell=5$ for $k=4$, $\ell=4$ for $k=5$, and $\ell=3$ for $k\ge 6$ suffice to exceed the asymptotic first-moment upper bound $\sim 2^k \ln 2$ for random $k$-SAT.Moreover, to bridge the gap with biased assignment rules used in maximum of the previous works in this context, we propose a hybrid symmetric biased rule that achieves thresholds comparable to prior work while maintaining symmetry.Our results advance the understanding of Achlioptas processes in random CSPs beyond classical graph-theoretic settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Which permutations of a probability distribution on integers minimize variance?
  Let $X$ be a random variable on a set of integers $\{x_1, \dots, x_N\}$ such that $\mathbb{P}(X_i = x_i) = p_i$, $i \in \{1,\dots,N\}$. Let $(p^{(1)}, \dots, p^{(N)})$ be the sequence $(p_1, \dots, p_N)$ ordered non-increasingly. Let $X^+$ be the random variable defined by $\mathbb{P}(X=0)=p^{(1)}$, $\mathbb{P}(X=1) = p^{(2)}$, $\mathbb{P}(X=-1)=p^{(3)}, \dots, \mathbb{P}(X=(-1)^N \lfloor \frac {N} 2 \rfloor)=p^{(N)}$. In this short note we generalize and prove the inequality $\mathrm{Var}\, X^+ \le \mathrm{Var}\, X$.</description>

      <title>Frictional martingale optimal transport and robust hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study martingale optimal transport (MOT) with state-dependent trading frictions and develop a geometric-duality framework that extends from one time-step to the multi-marginal setting. Building on the frictionless left-monotone structure (Beiglb\"ock and Juillet, Ann. Probab. 2016; Henry-Labord\`ere and Touzi, Finance Stoch. 2016; Beiglb\"ock et al, Ann. Probab. 2017), we penalize trade increments by a convex cost and prove a frictional monotonicity principle. Optimal couplings admit bi-atomic disintegrations on active components, while a trade band emerges as a no-transaction region where the identity coupling is optimal. The band is characterized in dual variables by a subgradient condition at the origin; off the band, transport moves along two monotone graphs whose endpoints solve an equal-slope system balancing continuation values and marginal trading costs.
  We establish strong duality with attainment for state-dependent frictions, a dynamic programming identity that aggregates the one time-step problem, and stability of optimal couplings and endpoints under perturbations of marginals and friction. In the vanishing-friction limit the transport maps converge to the frictionless left-curtain coupling. For linear-quadratic frictions, motivated by spread and transient impact (Almgren and Chriss, J. Risk 2001; Obizhaeva and Wang, J. Financ. Mark. 2013), we obtain explicit off-band displacements and comparative statics in liquidity parameters. Applications include model-independent pricing/superhedging of lookback, barrier, and Asian options. Overall, the results link robust superhedging duality (Beiglb\"ock et al, Finance Stoch. 2013; Dolinsky and Soner, Finance Stoch. 2014) with the fine geometry of frictional MOT, providing a unified basis for analysis, stability, and computation in multi-marginal robust pricing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quantitative variant of the classic Two Doors logic puzzle, in which the answer space is no longer binary, for example when the goal is to recover a numerical fact (such as one's true weight) rather than choose between two doors. The puzzle retains the original structure: one agent always tells the truth, the other always lies. Our central contribution is to identify a class of self-referential prompts that successfully extract the correct quantitative answer under minimal assumptions. We also explore how well does \texttt{ChatGPT} does in reasoning for this problem which is just a little bit out of distribution.</description>

      <title>Quantum variance and fluctuations for Walsh-quantized baker's maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Walsh-quantized baker's maps are models for quantum chaos on the torus. We show that for all baker's map scaling factors $D\ge2$ except for $D=4$, typically (in the sense of Haar measure on the eigenspaces, which are degenerate) the empirical distribution of the scaled matrix element fluctuations $\sqrt{N}\{\langle \varphi^{(j)}|\operatorname{Op}_{k,\ell}(a)|\varphi^{(j)}\rangle-\int_{\mathbb{T}^2}a\}_{j=1}^{N}$ for a random eigenbasis $\{\varphi^{(j)}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ is asymptotically Gaussian in the semiclassical limit $N\to\infty$, with variance given in terms of classical baker's map correlations. This determines the precise rate of convergence in the quantum ergodic theorem for these eigenbases. We obtain a version of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for these eigenstates, including a limiting complex Gaussian distribution for the off-diagonal matrix elements, with variances also given in terms of classical correlations. The presence of the classical correlations highlights that these eigenstates, while random, have microscopic correlations that differentiate them from Haar random vectors. For the single value $D=4$, the Gaussianity of the matrix element fluctuations depends on the values of the classical observable on a fractal subset of the torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a new type of fully discrete surface finite element approximation of a class of linear parabolic stochastic evolution equations with additive noise. Our discretization uses a surface finite element approximation of the noise, and is tailored for equations with noise having covariance operator defined by (negative powers of) elliptic operators, like Whittle--Mat\'ern random fields. We derive strong and pathwise convergence rates of our approximation, and verify these by numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important open question about Markov chains for preparing quantum Gibbs states is proving rapid mixing. However, rapid mixing at low temperatures has only been proven for Gibbs states with no thermally stable phases, e.g., the 2D toric code. Inspired by Swendsen-Wang dynamics, in this work we give a simple Markov chain, Code Swendsen-Wang dynamics, for preparing Gibbs states of commuting Hamiltonians. We prove rapid mixing of this chain for classes of quantum and classical Hamiltonians with thermally stable phases, including the 4D toric code, at any temperature. We conjecture its efficiency for all code Hamiltonians away from first-order phase transition points.</description>

      <title>Permutation-Invariant Spectral Learning via Dyson Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are central to generative modeling and have been adapted to graphs by diffusing adjacency matrix representations. The challenge of having up to $n!$ such representations for graphs with $n$ nodes is only partially mitigated by using permutation-equivariant learning architectures. Despite their computational efficiency, existing graph diffusion models struggle to distinguish certain graph families, unless graph data are augmented with ad hoc features. This shortcoming stems from enforcing the inductive bias within the learning architecture. In this work, we leverage random matrix theory to analytically extract the spectral properties of the diffusion process, allowing us to push the inductive bias from the architecture into the dynamics. Building on this, we introduce the Dyson Diffusion Model, which employs Dyson's Brownian Motion to capture the spectral dynamics of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the adjacency matrix while retaining all non-spectral information. We demonstrate that the Dyson Diffusion Model learns graph spectra accurately and outperforms existing graph diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Computational and statistical lower bounds for low-rank estimation under general inhomogeneous noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has generalized several results concerning the well-understood spiked Wigner matrix model of a low-rank signal matrix corrupted by additive i.i.d. Gaussian noise to the inhomogeneous case, where the noise has a variance profile. In particular, for the special case where the variance profile has a block structure, a series of results identified an effective spectral algorithm for detecting and estimating the signal, identified the threshold signal strength required for that algorithm to succeed, and proved information-theoretic lower bounds that, for some special signal distributions, match the above threshold. We complement these results by studying the computational optimality of this spectral algorithm. Namely, we show that, for a much broader range of signal distributions, whenever the spectral algorithm cannot detect a low-rank signal, then neither can any low-degree polynomial algorithm. This gives the first evidence for a computational hardness conjecture of Guionnet, Ko, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2023). With similar techniques, we also prove sharp information-theoretic lower bounds for a class of signal distributions not treated by prior work. Unlike all of the above results on inhomogeneous models, our results do not assume that the variance profile has a block structure, and suggest that the same spectral algorithm might remain optimal for quite general profiles. We include a numerical study of this claim for an example of a smoothly-varying rather than piecewise-constant profile. Our proofs involve analyzing the graph sums of a matrix, which also appear in free and traffic probability, but we require new bounds on these quantities that are tighter than existing ones for non-negative matrices, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Local explosions and extinction in continuous-state branching processes with logistic competition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study by duality methods the extinction and explosion times of continuous-state branching processes with logistic competition (LCSBPs) and identify the local time at $\infty$ of the process when it is instantaneously reflected at $\infty$. The main idea is to introduce a certain "bidual" process $V$ of the LCSBP $Z$. The latter is the Siegmund dual process of the process $U$, that was introduced in Foucart (2019), as the Laplace dual of $Z$. By using both dualities, we shall relate local explosions and the extinction of $Z$ to local extinctions and the explosion of the process $V$. The process $V$ being a one-dimensional diffusion on $[0,\infty]$, many results on diffusions can be used and transfered to $Z$. A concise study of Siegmund duality for one-dimensional diffusions and their boundaries is also provided.</description>

Abstract: We derive a covariance formula for the number of excursion or level set components of a smooth stationary Gaussian field on $\mathbb{R}^d$ contained in compact domains. We also present two applications of this formula: (1) for fields whose correlations are integrable we prove that the variance of the component count in large domains is of volume order and give an expression for the leading constant, and (2) for fields with slower decay of correlation we give an upper bound on the variance which is of optimal order if correlations are regularly varying, and improves on best-known bounds if correlations are oscillating (e.g.\ monochromatic random waves).</description>

      <title>Convergence of the pruning processes of stable Galton-Watson trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the work of Aldous and Pitman (1998), several authors have studied the pruning processes of Galton-Watson trees and their continuous analogue L\'evy trees. L\"ohr, Voisin and Winter (2015) introduced the space of bi-measure $\mathbb{R}$-trees equipped with the so-called leaf sampling weak vague topology which allows them to unify the discrete and the continuous picture by considering them as instances of the same Feller-continuous Markov process with different initial conditions. Moreover, the authors show that these so-called pruning processes converge in the Skorokhod space of c\`adl\`ag paths with values in the space of bi-measure $\mathbb{R}$-trees, whenever the initial bi-measure $\mathbb{R}$-trees converge.
  In this paper we provide an application to the above principle by verifying that a sequence of suitably rescaled critical conditioned Galton-Watson trees whose offspring distributions lie in the domain of attraction of a stable law of index $\alpha \in (1,2]$ converge to the $\alpha$-stable L\'evy-tree in the leaf-sampling weak vague topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that with large probability, the spectral radius of a large non-Hermitian random matrix with a general variance profile does not exceed the square root of the spectral radius of the variance profile matrix. A minimal moment assumption is considered and sparse variance profiles are covered. Following an approach developed recently by Bordenave, Chafa{\"i} and Garc{\'i}a-Zelada, the key theorem states the asymptotic equivalence between the reverse characteristic polynomial of the random matrix at hand and a random analytic function which depends on the variance profile matrix. The result is applied to the case of a non-Hermitian random matrix with a variance profile given by a piecewise constant or a continuous non-negative function, the inhomogeneous (centered) directed Erd\H{o}s-R{\'e}nyi model, and more.</description>

We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for $W(E)$ to intersect $F$ with positive probability and determine the essential supremum of the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection set $W(E)\cap F$ in terms of the thermal capacity of $E \times F$. This extends the previous results of Khoshnevisan and Xiao (2015) for the Brownian motion and Khoshnevisan and Shi (1999) for the Brownian sheet in the special case when $E \subset (0, \infty)^N$ is an interval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the problem of meeting times for interdependent stochastic agents: random walkers whose behaviour is stochastic but controlled by their selections from some set of allowed actions, and the inference problem of when these agents will be in the same state for the first time. We consider the case where we are epistemically uncertain about the selected actions of these agents, and show how their behaviour can be modelled using imprecise Markov chains. This allows us to use results and algorithms from the literature, to exactly compute bounds on their meeting time, which are tight with respect to our epistemic uncertainty models. We focus on the two-agent case, but discuss how it can be naturally extended to an arbitrary number of agents, and how the corresponding combinatorial explosion can be partly mitigated by exploiting symmetries inherent in the problem.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Interpolants: A Unifying Framework for Flows and Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08797v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of generative models that unifies flow-based and diffusion-based methods is introduced. These models extend the framework proposed in Albergo and Vanden-Eijnden (2023), enabling the use of a broad class of continuous-time stochastic processes called stochastic interpolants to bridge any two probability density functions exactly in finite time. These interpolants are built by combining data from the two prescribed densities with an additional latent variable that shapes the bridge in a flexible way. The time-dependent density function of the interpolant is shown to satisfy a transport equation as well as a family of forward and backward Fokker-Planck equations with tunable diffusion coefficient. Upon consideration of the time evolution of an individual sample, this viewpoint leads to both deterministic and stochastic generative models based on probability flow equations or stochastic differential equations with an adjustable level of noise. The drift coefficients entering these models are time-dependent velocity fields characterized as the unique minimizers of simple quadratic objective functions, one of which is a new objective for the score. We show that minimization of these quadratic objectives leads to control of the likelihood for generative models built upon stochastic dynamics, while likelihood control for deterministic dynamics is more stringent. We also construct estimators for the likelihood and the cross entropy of interpolant-based generative models, and we discuss connections with other methods such as score-based diffusion models, stochastic localization, probabilistic denoising, and rectifying flows. In addition, we demonstrate that stochastic interpolants recover the Schr\"odinger bridge between the two target densities when explicitly optimizing over the interpolant. Finally, algorithmic aspects are discussed and the approach is illustrated on numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new theoretical framework that exploits convolution kernels to transform a Volterra-type path-dependent (non-Markovian) stochastic process into a standard (Markovian) diffusion process. Remarkably, it is also possible to go back, i.e., the transformation is reversible. We discuss existence and path-wise regularity of solutions for our class of stochastic differential equations. In the fractional kernel case, when $H \in (0,\frac12)$, where $H$ is the Hurst coefficient, we propose a numerical simulation scheme which exhibits a remarkable strong convergence rate of order $1/2$, which constitutes a bold improvement when compared with the performance of available Euler schemes, whose strong rate of convergence is $H$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that suitable transport noises produce anomalous dissipation of both enstrophy of solutions to 2D Navier-Stokes equations and of energy of solutions to diffusion equations in all dimensions. The key ingredients are Meyers' type estimates for SPDEs with transport noise, which are combined with recent scaling limits for such SPDEs. The former enables us to establish, for the first time, uniform-in-time convergence in a space of positive smoothness for such scaling limits. Compared to previous work, one of the main novelties is that anomalous dissipation might take place even in the presence of a transport noise of arbitrarily small intensity. Physical interpretations of our results are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Entropic adapted Wasserstein distance on Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adapted Wasserstein distance is a metric for quantifying distributional uncertainty and assessing the sensitivity of stochastic optimization problems on time series data. A computationally efficient alternative to it, is provided by the entropically regularized adapted Wasserstein distance. Suffering from similar shortcomings as classical optimal transport, there are only few explicitly known solutions to those distances.
  Recently, Gunasingam--Wong provided a closed-form representation of the adapted Wasserstein distance between real-valued stochastic processes with Gaussian laws. In this paper, we extend their work in two directions, by considering multidimensional ($\mathbb{R}^d$-valued) stochastic processes with Gaussian laws and including the entropic regularization. In both settings, we provide closed-form solutions.</description>

      <title>Constrained mean-field control with singular control: Existence, stochastic maximum principle and constrained FBSDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of mean-field control (MFC) problems with singular control under general dynamic state-control-law constraints. We first propose a customized relaxed control formulation to cope with the dynamic mixed constraints and establish the existence of an optimal control using compactification argument in the proper canonical spaces to accommodate the singular control. To characterize the optimal pair of regular and singular controls, we treat the controlled McKean-Vlasov process as an infinite-dimensional equality constraint and recast the MFC problem as an optimization problem on canonical spaces with constraints on Banach space, allowing us to derive the stochastic maximum principle (SMP) and a constrained BSDE using a novel Lagrange multipliers method. Additionally, we investigate the uniqueness and the stability result of the solution to the constrained FBSDE associated to the constrained MFC problem with singular control.</description>

      <title>Conditional distributions for the nested Dirichlet process via sequential imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an array of random variables, taking values in a complete and separable metric space, that exhibits a kind of symmetry which we call row exchangeability. Given such an array, a natural model for Bayesian nonparametric inference is the nested Dirichlet process (NDP). Exactly determining posterior distributions for the NDP is infeasible, since the computations involved grow exponentially with the sample size. In this paper, we present a new approach to determining these posterior distributions that involves the use of sequential</description>

      <title>Sample complexity for entropic optimal transport with radial cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a new sample complexity result for entropy regularized optimal transport. Our bound holds for probability measures on $\mathbb R^d$ with exponential tail decay and for radial cost functions that satisfy a local Lipschitz condition. It is sharp up to logarithmic factors, and captures the intrinsic dimension of the marginal distributions through a generalized covering number of their supports. Examples that fit into our framework include subexponential and subgaussian distributions and radial cost functions $c(x,y)=|x-y|^p$ for $p\ge 2.$</description>
