      <title>The near-infrared SED of blue quasars: what drives the evolution of the dusty torus?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental ingredient in the unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is the obscuring torus, whose innermost, hottest region dominates the near infrared (NIR) emission. Characterising the change in the torus properties and its interplay with the main AGN emission is key for our understanding of AGN physics, evolution and classification. Its covering factor ($CF$) is largely responsible for the classification of AGN on the basis of the detection of broad emission lines. It is still not clear whether the torus properties evolve over time and how they relate with the accretion parameters of the nucleus. In this work, we aim at investigating the evolution of the NIR properties with the redshift ($z$) and the bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$) of the AGN. To this end, we assembled a large dataset of $\sim$36,000 Type 1 AGN between $0.5&lt;z&lt;2.9$ and $45.0&lt;\log(L_{\rm bol} / (\rm erg / s))&lt;48.0$ with UV, optical and near-infrared photometry. We produced average spectral energy distributions (SED) in different bins of the $z-L_{\rm bol}$ parameter space to estimate how the NIR SED evolves according to these parameters. We find that the NIR luminosity decreases for increasing $L_{\rm bol}$ at any redshift. At the same, time the shape of the NIR SED in our sample is consistent with a non-evolution with $z$. As a consequence, all the explored proxies for the $CF$ exhibit significant anti-correlations with $L_{\rm bol}$, but not with $z$. Additionally, the $CF$ also shows a shallower anti-correlation with the Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$), yet current systematic uncertainties, as well as the limited dynamical range, do not allow us to precisely constrain the role of the Eddington ratio. Lastly, we derived the covering factor from the ratio between the NIR and optical luminosity and we employed it to set a lower limit for the X-ray obscuration at different redshifts.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic confirmation of a dust-obscured, metal-rich dwarf galaxy at z~5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first spectroscopic confirmation of a dust-obscured dwarf galaxy, CEERS-14821.
  The analysis is performed combining JWST NIRCam broad-band photometry and NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopic data. From the detection of multiple rest-frame optical lines, we derive that CEERS-14821 is located at $z=4.883\pm0.003$. Moreover, from a secure detection of the $H_{\alpha}$ and $H_{\beta}$ we derived that the galaxy has a dust extinction ranging from Av=2.2 to Av=3.3, depending on the assumed reddening law. This value is extremely large given that we estimated a low stellar mass around log(M/Mo)=8.0-8.2. Moreover, using different metallicity tracers, we verify that the galaxy is also metal-rich, with 12+log(O/H)&gt;8.3. This is well above the expectation from both the mass-metallicity relation and the fundamental mass-metalliticy relation. CEERS-14821 is going through a burst of star formation, there are no indications of a strong contribution from an active galactic nuclei (f(AGN)&lt;0.5 with respect to the total dust luminosity). Based on the rest-frame optical images, this source has a size compatible with galaxies of similar stellar mass and redshift. Finally, with the current data, it seems that there are galaxies closely interacting with CEERS-14821.</description>

      <title>Seven wonders of Cosmic Dawn: JWST confirms a high abundance of galaxies and AGNs at z $\simeq$ 9-11 in the GLASS field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM follow-up of candidate galaxies at z=9-11 selected from deep JWST/NIRCam photometry in GLASS-JWST Early Release Science data. We spectroscopically confirm six sources with secure redshifts at z = 9.52-10.43, each showing multiple emission lines. An additional object is likely at z = 10.66, based on its Lya-break and a single emission feature, while one source is a lower redshift interloper. The sample includes the first JWST-detected candidate at z=10, GHZ1/GLASS-z10, which we confirm at z = 9.875, and the X-ray detected AGN GHZ9 confirmed at z = 10.145. Three objects in our sample, including GHZ9, have EW(CIII])&gt;20A and occupy a region compatible with AGN emission in the EW(CIII]) vs CIV/CIII] diagram. The spectroscopic sample confirms a high abundance of galaxies at z &gt; 9. We measure a number density of z=10 galaxies in the GLASS-JWST ERS field that is a factor of &gt;3 higher than other JWST-based estimates at demagnified rest-frame magnitudes of -21 &lt; Muv &lt; -19. We find that the positions of these galaxies in redshift and angular space are not consistent with all of them being part of a unique progenitor of present-day galaxy clusters. The high density of objects in the GLASS region can be explained either by clustering on large scales or by a superposition of different forming structures of which we observe only the brightest members. By considering all the spectroscopic z=10 sources in the Abell-2744 field, we identify two potential galaxy proto-clusters centered around GHZ9 and JD1, with relative separations between their members of 1-2 pMpc. The potential AGN nature of three of the sources in our sample lends support to a scenario in which the high abundance of bright sources determined by JWST surveys at cosmic dawn may be affected by AGN contribution to their UV luminosity.</description>

      <title>Tracing star formation across cosmic time at tens of parsec-scales in the lensing cluster field Abell 2744</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of 1956 individual stellar clumps at redshift 0.7&lt;z&lt;10, detected with JWST/NIRCam in 476 galaxies lensed by the galaxy cluster Abell2744. The lensed clumps present magnifications ranging between $\mu$=1.8 and $\mu$=300. We perform simultaneous size-photometry estimates in 20 JWST/NIRCam median and broad-band filters from 0.7 to 5 $\mu$m. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analyses enable us to recover the physical properties of the clumps. The majority of the clumps are spatially resolved and have effective radii in the range R_eff = 10 - 700 pc. We restrict this first study to the 1751 post-reionisation era clumps with redshift &lt;5.5. We find a significant evolution of the average clump ages, SFR, SFR surface densities and metallicity with increasing redshift, while median stellar mass and stellar mass surface densities are similar in the probed redshift range. We observe a strong correlation between the clump properties and the properties of their host galaxies, with more massive galaxies hosting more massive and older clumps. We find that clumps closer to their host galactic center are on average more massive, while their ages do not show clear sign of migration. We find that clumps at cosmic noon sample the upper-mass end of the mass function to higher masses than at z&gt;3, reflecting the rapid increase towards the peak of the cosmic star formation history. We conclude that the results achieved over the studied redshift range are in agreement with expectation of in-situ clump formation scenario from large-scale disk fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Do stars still form in molecular gas within CO-dark dwarf galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Milky Way and other main-sequence galaxies, stars form exclusively in molecular gas, which is traced by CO emission. However, low metallicity dwarf galaxies are often `CO-dark' in the sense that CO emission is not observable even at the high resolution and sensitivities of modern observing facilities. In this work we use ultra high-resolution simulations of four low-metalicity dwarf galaxies (which resolve star formation down to the scale of star-forming cores, 0.01 pc) combined with a time-dependent treatment of the chemistry of the interstellar medium, to investigate the star formation environment in this previously hidden regime. By generating synthetic observations of our models we show that the galaxies have high to extremely high dark gas fractions (0.13 to 1.00 dependent on beam size and conditions), yet despite this form stars. However, when examined on smaller scales, we find that the stars still form in regions dominated by molecular gas, it is simply that these are far smaller than the scale of the beam (1.5"). Thus, while stars in CO-dark dwarf galaxies form in small molecular cores like larger galaxies, their cloud-scale environment is very different.</description>

      <title>The evolution of [OIII]$+\rm{H}\beta$ equivalent width from $\mathbf{z\simeq3-8}$: implications for the production and escape of ionizing photons during reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying the ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_\rm{ion}$) of $z&gt;6$ star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is necessary to understand their contribution to reionization. We investigate the ionizing properties of N=289 SFGs selected at $z=6.9-7.6$ from the JWST Cycle-1 imaging programmes; PRIMER and JADES. We use BAGPIPES to consistently infer the equivalent widths of their [OIII]+$\rm{H\beta}$ emission lines ($W_\lambda$) and their physical properties. To supplement our high-redshift galaxies, we measure $W_\lambda$ photometrically for a sample of N=253 $z=3.2-3.6$ SFGs selected from the VANDELS spectroscopic survey. Comparing these samples, we find a strong apparent redshift evolution in their median $W_\lambda$, increasing from $W_\lambda =310\pm25\,\r{A}$ in VANDELS to $W_\lambda =630\pm30\,\r{A}$ in our JWST-based sample. In the JWST sample at $z&gt;7$, we find that $W_\lambda$ correlates with both stellar mass and UV luminosity, with high-mass, $M_{ UV}-$faint galaxies producing systematically weaker emission lines. Moreover, we discover a departure from the standard log-normal shape of the $W_\lambda$ distribution, characterised by a more pronounced tail at lower $W_\lambda$, consistent with increasingly bursty star formation. Using $W_\lambda$ as a proxy for $\xi_\rm{ion}$, and UV spectral slope as a proxy for LyC escape fraction ($f_\rm{esc}$), we find a minority of galaxies with high $\xi_\rm{ion}$ and $f_\rm{esc}$ (e.g., $\rm{log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz})\sim25.6$ and $f_\rm{esc}\sim0.15$). However, we find that the LyC photon budget at $z&gt;7$ is dominated by galaxies with more moderate output, close to the sample median of $\rm{log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz})\sim25.3$ and $f_\rm{esc}\sim0.05$. This is consistent with estimates for the number of LyC photons required to power reionization at $z&gt;7$, with no evidence for over or under-production.</description>

      <title>Direct High-resolution Observation of Feedback and Chemical Enrichment in the Circumgalactic Medium at Redshift 2.8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a vital role in galaxy evolution, studying the emission from CGM is challenging due to its low surface brightness and the complexities involved in interpreting resonant lines like Ly$\alpha$. The near-infrared coverage, unprecedented sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of the JWST enable us to study the optical strong lines associated with the extended Ly$\alpha$ "nebulae" at redshift 2-3. These lines serve as diagnostic tools to infer the physical conditions in the massive CGM gas reservoir of these systems. In deep medium-band images taken by the JWST, we serendipitously discover the [O III] emission from the CGM surrounding a massive interacting galaxy system at redshift z ~ 2.8, known to be embedded in a bright extended (100 kpc) Ly$\alpha$ "nebula". This is the first time that the [O III] lines are detected from a Ly$\alpha$ "nebula", and the JWST images reveal that the CGM gas actually resides in narrow (~ 2.5 kpc) filamentary structures with strong [O III] emission, tracing the same extent as the Ly$\alpha$ emission. Analysis of the [O III] suggests that the emitting CGM is fully ionized and is energetically dominated by mechanical heating. We also find that the inferred density and pressure are higher than those commonly predicted by simulations of the CGM. We conclude that the observed CGM emission originates from the gas expelled by the episodic feedback processes, cooling down and enriching the CGM, while travelling to a distance of at least 60 kpc. These observations demonstrate how fierce feedback processes shape gas distribution and properties in the CGM around massive halos. While the deep high-resolution imaging opens up a new discovery space for investigating the CGM, it also challenges numerical simulations to explain and reproduce the exquisitely complex structures revealed by the observations.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS &amp; EIGER: A merging quasar host at z=7 with an overmassive black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionising our ability to understand the host galaxies and local environments of high-z quasars. Here we obtain a comprehensive understanding of the host galaxy of the z=7.08 quasar J1120+0641 by combining NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry of the host continuum emission. Our emission line maps reveal that this quasar host is undergoing a merger with a bright companion galaxy. The quasar host and the companion have similar dynamical masses of $\sim10^{10}M_\odot$, suggesting that this is a major galaxy interaction. Through detailed quasar subtraction and SED fitting using the NIRCam data, we obtain an estimate of the host stellar mass of $M_{\ast}\simeq2.6\times10^9M_\odot$, with $M_{*}\simeq5.0\times10^9M_\odot$ for the companion galaxy. Using the H$\beta$ Balmer line we estimate a virial black hole mass of $M_{\rm{BH}}\simeq1.4\times10^9 M_\odot$. Thus, J1120+0641 has an extreme black hole - stellar mass ratio of $M_{\rm{BH}}/M_\ast\simeq0.54$, which is ~3 dex larger than expected by the local scaling relations between black hole and stellar mass. J1120+0641 is powered by an overmassive black hole with the highest reported black hole-stellar mass ratio, in a quasar host that is currently undergoing a major merger -- these new insights highlight the power of JWST for measuring and understanding these extreme first quasars.</description>

      <title>Unveiling dust, molecular gas, and high star formation efficiency in extremely UV-bright star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 2.1-3.6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analysed ALMA FIR (1.3 mm) dust continuum and CO emission of 12 starburst galaxies at $z\sim 2.1-3.6$, selected for their extreme brightness in the rest-UV with $M_{\rm UV} = -23.4$ to $-24.7$. We also analysed VLT HAWK-I $H$- and $K_{\rm s}$-band images. The galaxies are characterised by negligible dust attenuations with blue UV spectral slopes ($-2.62$ to $-1.84$), very young stellar populations of $\sim 10$ Myr, and powerful starbursts with a high mean specific star formation rate of $\rm 112~Gyr^{-1}$, placing them $\sim 1.5$~dex above the main sequence at similar redshifts and stellar masses ($M_{\rm stars} \sim (1.5-4.6)\times 10^9~M_{\odot}$). The FIR dust continuum emission revealed in 9 galaxies yields IR luminosities of $(5.9-28.3)\times 10^{11}~L_{\odot}$ and large dust masses barely produced by SNe within the 10~Myr timescale. The CO emission detected in 8 galaxies evidence large molecular gas masses with a mean molecular gas fraction of 82%. The corresponding star formation efficiencies reach $\gtrsim 40$\%, with amazingly short molecular gas depletion timescales between &lt;13 Myr and 71 Myr. These unique properties, never reported in previously studied galaxies, highlight that these galaxies are likely caught at the very beginning of their stellar mass build-up and undergo a very efficient and fast conversion of gas into stars that can only result from the gas collapse within very short free-fall times. We find that the feedback-free starburst model seems to be able to explain the formation of these galaxies. To reconcile the co-spatial FIR dust emission with the UV-bright unattenuated emission, we speculate about radiation-driven outflows which can temporarily remove dust at the location of the starburst and expel dust at large distances in line with the measured large FIR effective radii ($\rm 1.7~kpc - 5~kpc$) in comparison to very compact stellar radii.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Radiative Transfer Modeling of MgII and Ly{\alpha} Emission in Multiphase, Clumpy Galactic Environments: Application to Low-Redshift Lyman Continuum Leakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted systematic radiative transfer (RT) modeling of the Mg II doublet line profiles for 33 low-redshift Lyman continuum (LyC) leakers, and Ly$\alpha$ modeling for a subset of six objects, using a multiphase, clumpy circumgalactic medium (CGM) model. Our RT models successfully reproduced the Mg II line profiles for all 33 galaxies, revealing a necessary condition for strong LyC leakage: high maximum clump outflow velocity ($v_{\rm MgII,\,max} \gtrsim 390\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) and low total Mg II column density ($N_{\rm MgII,\,tot} \lesssim 10^{14.3}\,\rm cm^{-2}$). We found that the clump outflow velocity and total Mg II column density have the most significant impact on Mg II spectra and emphasized the need for full RT modeling to accurately extract the CGM gas properties. In addition, using archival HST COS/G160M data, we modeled Ly$\alpha$ profiles for six objects and found that their spectral properties do not fully align with the conventional LyC leakage criteria, yet no clear correlation was identified between the modeled parameters and observed LyC escape fractions. We inferred LyC escape fractions based on HI properties from Ly$\alpha$ RT modeling and found that LyC leakage is primarily governed by the number of optically thick HI clumps per sightline ($f_{\rm cl}$). Intriguingly, two galaxies with relatively low observed LyC leakage exhibited the highest RT-inferred LyC escape fractions due to their lowest $f_{\rm cl}$ values, driven by the strong blue peaks of their Ly$\alpha$ emission. Future high-resolution, spatially resolved observations are crucial for resolving this puzzle. Overall, our results support a "picket fence" geometry over a "density-bounded" scenario for the CGM, where a combination of high Mg II outflow velocities and low Mg II column densities may be correlated with the presence of more low-density HI channels that facilitate LyC escape.</description>

      <title>Spider-Webb: JWST Near Infrared Camera resolved galaxy star formation and nuclear activities in the Spiderweb protocluster at z=2.16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-infrared (NIR) emission is less affected by dust than UV and optical emission and is therefore useful for studying the properties of dust-obscured galaxies. Although rest-frame NIR observations of high-redshift galaxies have long been made using space telescopes, their structures were unresolved due to the lack of angular resolution. This letter reports the early results from the analysis of high-resolution Pa$\beta$ imaging of the Spiderweb protocluster at $z=2.16$ with the JWST Near Infrared Camera. We investigate radial profiles of Pa$\beta$ lines and rest-frame NIR continua from luminous H$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (HAEs) in the protocluster. Particularly, we compare those of 11 HAEs (N-HAEs) on the star-forming main sequence with those of 8 HAEs (X-HAEs) with X-ray AGNs. Resultant composite Pa$\beta$ line images of N-HAEs indicate significant star formation in galactic disks. In contrast, X-HAEs are dominated by point source components rather than outer star formation, as inferred from our earlier work based on multi-wavelength SED fitting. Given their higher stellar potentials suggested from their rest-frame NIR images, the different characteristics may be driven by the impact of AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength constraints on the local black hole occupation fraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fraction of dwarf galaxies hosting central, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) at low redshifts is an important observational probe of black hole seeding at high redshift. Detections of nuclear accretion signatures in dwarf galaxies provides strong evidence for the presence of these IMBHs. We develop a Bayesian model to infer the black hole occupation fraction assuming a broken power law Eddington ratio distribution function. Our approach accounts for non-detections, incompleteness, and contamination from star-forming-related emission. We apply this model to galaxies with X-ray data from the Chandra Source Catalog at distances $&lt;50$ Mpc, radio data from the VLA Sky Survey at $&lt; 50$ Mpc, and optical variability data from the Palomar Transient Factory at $z&lt;0.055$. We find a black hole occupation fraction of at least $90$ percent at stellar masses of $M_{\star}=10^8~M_{\odot}$ and at least $39$ percent at $M_{\star} = 10^7~M_{\odot}$ (95\% confidence intervals). We show the resulting black hole mass function. These constraints on the IMBH population have implications for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission and for cosmological models of black hole seeding and growth. We also constrain the extremely low luminosity end ($L_{\rm{bol}}\lesssim10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the AGN luminosity functions at $z=0$. Our AGN luminosity functions are broadly consistent with an extrapolation of the shallow slope of the AGN luminosity functions from previous work.</description>

      <title>Search for young stellar objects within 4XMM-DR13 using CatBoost and SPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying and summarizing large data sets from different sky survey projects is essential for various subsequent scientific research. By combining data from 4XMM-DR13, SDSS DR18, and CatWISE, we formed an XMM-WISE-SDSS sample that included information in the X-ray, optical, and infrared bands. By cross-matching this sample with datasets from known spectral classifications from SDSS and LAMOST, we obtained a training dataset containing stars, galaxies, quasars, and Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). Two machine learning methods, CatBoost and Self-Paced Ensemble (SPE), were used to train and construct machine learning models through training sets to classify the XMM-WISE-SDSS sample. Notably, the SPE classifier showed excellent performance in YSO classification, identifying 1102 YSO candidates from 160,545 sources, including 258 known YSOs. Then we further verify whether these candidates are YSOs by the spectra in LAMOST and the identification in the SIMBAD and VizieR dabtabases. Finally there are 412 unidentified YSO candidates. The discovery of these new YSOs is an important addition to existing YSO samples and will deepen our understanding of star formation and evolution. Moreover we provided a classification catalog for the whole XMM-WISE-SDSS sample.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis and astrophysical inference for high-$z$ JWST galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the high-$z$ Universe from JWST have revealed a new population of bright, early galaxies. A robust statistical interpretation of this data requires fast forward models that account for uncertainties in galaxy evolution and incorporate observational systematic effects. We present a probabilistic framework for population synthesis of high-$z$ galaxies and inference of their properties. Our framework is based on the semi-analytic galaxy-formation model Galacticus. To infer the astrophysical parameters governing high-$z$ galaxy evolution, we analyze JWST data from the CEERS and NGDEEP surveys and calculate the likelihood of observing individual objects in apparent magnitude--redshift space, for $z\geq8.5$ galaxy candidates. We include observational selection effects due to limited survey volume and depth, as well as photometric redshift uncertainties. We recover the posterior probability distribution for parameters describing star formation and outflow rates. We place an upper limit on the star formation timescale of $500~\mathrm{Myr}$ at a disk velocity of $50~\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$, and we infer a characteristic velocity at which the outflow mass-loading factor is $\sim 1$ of $150^{+280}_{-60}~\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$, both at $95\%$ confidence. Marginalizing over our astrophysical model, we find that galaxies in CEERS and NGDEEP data occupy halos with virial masses $10^{10\pm 0.5}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ at $8.5\leq z\leq 12$, at $95\%$ confidence. The star formation timescale preferred by our fit is relatively short compared to typical values at lower redshifts, consistent with previous findings. The modeling and analysis framework presented here can enable systematic tests of high-$z$ galaxies' dust content, initial mass functions, and star formation burstiness in the future.</description>

      <title>Scylla I: A pure-parallel, multi-wavelength imaging survey of the ULLYSES fields in the LMC and SMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scylla is a deep Hubble Space Telescope survey of the stellar populations, interstellar medium and star formation in the LMC and SMC. As a pure-parallel complement to the Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) survey, Scylla obtained 342 orbits of ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared (IR) imaging of the LMC and SMC with Wide Field Camera 3. In this paper, we describe the science objectives, observing strategy, data reduction procedure, and initial results from our photometric analysis of 96 observed fields. Although our observations were constrained by ULYSSES primary exposures, we imaged all fields in at least two filters (F475W and F814W), and 64% of fields in at least three and as many as seven WFC3 filters spanning the UV to IR. Overall, we reach average 50% completeness of $m_{\rm F225W}=26.0$, $m_{\rm F275W}=26.2$, $m_{\rm F336W}=26.9$, $m_{\rm F475W}=27.8$, $m_{\rm F814W}=25.5$, $m_{\rm F110W}=24.7$, and $m_{\rm F160W}=24.0$ Vega magnitudes in our photometric catalogs, which is faintward of the ancient main sequence turnoff in all filters. The primary science goals of Scylla include characterizing the structure and properties of dust in the MCs, as well as their spatially-resolved star formation and chemical enrichment histories. Our images and photometric catalogs, which represent the widest-area coverage of MCs with HST photometry to date, are available as a high-level science product at the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.</description>

      <title>Scylla II. The Spatially Resolved Star Formation History of the Large Magellanic Cloud Reveals an Inverted Radial Age Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proximity of the Magellanic Clouds provides the opportunity to study interacting dwarf galaxies near a massive host, and spatial trends in their stellar population properties in particular, with a unique level of detail. The Scylla pure parallel program has obtained deep (80% complete to &gt;1 mag below the ancient main sequence turnoff), homogeneous two-filter Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging sampling the inner star-forming disk of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the perfect complement to shallower, contiguous ground-based surveys. We harness this imaging together with extant archival data and fit lifetime star formation histories (SFHs) to resolved color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of 111 individual fields, using three different stellar evolutionary libraries. We validate per-field recovered distances and extinctions as well as the combined global LMC age-metallicity relation and SFH against independent estimates. We find that the present-day radial age gradient reverses from an inside-out gradient in the inner disk to an outside-in gradient beyond $\sim$2 disk scalelengths, supported by ground-based measurements. The gradients become relatively flatter at earlier lookback times, while the location of the inversion remains constant over an order of magnitude in lookback time, from $\sim$1$-$10 Gyr. This suggests at least one mechanism that predates the recent intense LMC-SMC interaction. We compare observed radial age trends to other late-type galaxies at fixed stellar mass and discuss similarities and differences in the context of potential drivers, implying strong radial migration in the LMC.</description>

      <title>Scylla III. The Outside-In Radial Age Gradient in the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Star Formation Histories of the Main Body, Wing and Outer Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proximity of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) provides the opportunity to study the impact of dwarf-dwarf interactions on their mass assembly with a unique level of detail. To this end, we analyze two-filter broadband imaging of 83 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) pointings covering 0.203 deg$^2$ towards the SMC, extending out to $\sim$3.5 kpc in projection from its optical center. Lifetime star formation histories (SFHs) fit to each pointing independently reveal an outside-in age gradient such that fields in the SMC outskirts are older on average. We measure radial gradients of the lookback time to form 90%, 75% and 50% of the cumulative stellar mass for the first time, finding $\delta$($\tau_{90}$, $\tau_{75}$, $\tau_{50}$)/$\delta$R = (0.61$^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$, 0.65$^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$, 0.82$^{+0.12}_{-0.16}$) Gyr/kpc assuming PARSEC evolutionary models and a commonly used elliptical geometry of the SMC, although our results are robust to these assumptions. The wing of the SMC deviates from this trend, forming 25\% of its cumulative mass over the most recent 3 Gyr due to a best-fit star formation rate that remains approximately constant. Our results are consistent with chemodynamical evidence of a tidally stripped SMC component in the foreground, and imply contributions to the observed SFH from multiple previous LMC-SMC interactions. We also compare our SMC SFH with results from a companion study of the LMC, finding that while the two galaxies present different internal, spatially resolved SFH trends, both the LMC and SMC have similar near-constant lifetime SFHs when viewed globally.</description>

      <title>Cloud properties in simulated galactic winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of a population of cool clouds in simulated galaxy outflows. Using data from the CGOLS isolated galaxy simulations, we generate catalogues of $\sim 10^5$ clouds. We describe the impact of two different supernova feedback models -- a centrally concentrated starburst and disk-wide distributed star formation -- on the resulting cloud population. In both cases we find that the mass distribution function $dN/dM \propto M^{-2}$, in good agreement with model predictions of turbulent fragmentation. We explore how cloud properties change with distance from the galaxy and find no qualitative distinction between the two feedback modes, although significant quantitative differences exist in attributes such as the total number of clouds, their densities, etc. We further show that both internal cloud velocities and cloud-cloud relative velocities are described well by properties of turbulent motion, despite significant bulk radial velocities. Finally, we investigate the distribution of cloud sizes in the context of recent theoretical arguments about cloud survival in winds. We find that proposed cloud survival criteria are a good predictor of cloud survival, in both the case where clouds are primarily destroyed and the case where cloud growth occurs in the outflow.</description>

      <title>The JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS): An untargeted search for H$\alpha$ emission line galaxies at $z &gt; 6$ and their physical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results of the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS). Utilising the first NIRCam narrow-band imaging at 4.7$\mu$m, over 63 arcmin$^{2}$ in the PRIMER/COSMOS field, we have identified 609 emission line galaxy candidates. From these, we robustly selected 35 H$\alpha$ star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 6.1$, with H$\alpha$ star-formation rates ($\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}$) of $\sim0.9-15\ \rm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$. Combining our unique H$\alpha$ sample with the exquisite panchromatic data in the field, we explore their physical properties and star-formation histories, and compare these to a broad-band selected sample at $z\sim 6$ to offer vital new insight into the nature of high-redshift galaxies. UV-continuum slopes ($\beta$) are considerably redder for our H$\alpha$ sample ($\langle\beta\rangle\sim-1.92$) compared to the broad-band sample ($\langle\beta\rangle\sim-2.35$). This is not due to dust attenuation as our H$\alpha$ sample is relatively dust-poor (median $A_V=0.23$); instead, we argue that the reddened slopes could be due to nebular continuum. We compared $\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}$ and the UV-continuum-derived $\rm{SFR_{UV}}$ to SED-fitted measurements averaged over canonical timescales of 10 and 100 Myr ($\rm{SFR_{10}}$ and $\rm{SFR_{100}}$). We find an increase in recent SFR for our sample of H$\alpha$ emitters, particularly at lower stellar masses ($&lt;10^9 \rm{M_{\odot}}$). We also find that $\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}$ strongly traces SFR averaged over 10 Myr timescales, whereas the UV-continuum over-predicts SFR on 100 Myr timescales at low stellar masses. These results point to our H$\alpha$ sample undergoing `bursty' star formation. Our F356W $z \sim 6$ sample show a larger scatter in $\rm{SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}}$ across all stellar masses, highlighting how narrow-band photometric selections of H$\alpha$ emitters are key to quantifying the burstiness of star-formation activity.</description>

      <title>A First-look at Spatially-resolved Infrared Supernova Remnants in M33 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first spatially-resolved infrared images of supernova remnants (SNRs) in M33 with the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST. We analyze 43 SNRs in four JWST fields: two covering central and southern M33 with separate NIRCam (F335M, F444W) and MIRI (F560W, F2100W) observations, one $\sim$5 kpc-long radial strip observed with MIRI F770W, and one covering the giant HII region NGC 604 with multiple NIRCam and MIRI broad/narrowband filters. Of the 21 SNRs in the MIRI field, we found three clear detections (i.e., identical infrared and \ha morphologies), and six partial-detections, implying a detection fraction of 43\% in these bands. In contrast, only one SNR (out of 16) is detectable in the NIRCam field. One of the SNRs, L10-080, is a potential candidate for having freshly-formed ejecta dust, based on its size and centrally-concentrated 21 \mum emission. Two SNRs near NGC 604 have strong evidence of molecular (H$_2$) emission at 4.7 \mum, making them the farthest known SNRs with visible molecular shocks. Five SNRs have F770W observations, with the smaller younger objects showing tentative signs of emission, while the older, larger ones have voids. Multi-wavelength data indicate that the clearly-detected SNRs are also among the smallest, brightest at other wavelengths (\ha, radio and X-ray), have the broadest line widths (H$\alpha$ FWHM$\sim$250-350 km/s), and the densest environments. No strong correlation with star-formation histories are seen, with the clearly-detected SNRs having both high-mass ($\sim$35 \Msun) and low-mass ($\lesssim$10 \Msun) progenitors.</description>

      <title>Expansion properties of the young supernova type Iax remnant Pa 30 revealed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered Pa 30 nebula, the putative type Iax supernova remnant associated with the historical supernova of 1181 AD, shows puzzling characteristics that make it unique among known supernova remnants. In particular, Pa 30 exhibits a complex morphology, with a unique radial and filamentary structure, and it hosts a hot stellar remnant at its center, which displays oxygen-dominated, ultra-fast winds. Because of the surviving stellar remnant and the lack of hydrogen and helium in its filaments, it has been suggested that Pa 30 is the product of a failed thermonuclear explosion in a near- or super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf, which created a sub-luminous transient, a rare sub-type of the Ia class of supernovae called type Iax. We here present a detailed study of the 3D structure and velocities of a full radial section of the remnant. The Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations, obtained with the new red channel of the Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectrograph, reveal that the ejecta are consistent with being ballistic, with velocities close to the free-expansion velocity. Additionally, we detect a large cavity inside the supernova remnant and a sharp inner edge to the filamentary structure, which coincides with the outer edge of a bright ring detected in infrared images. Finally, we detect a strong asymmetry in the amount of ejecta along the line of sight, which might hint to an asymmetric explosion. Our analysis provides strong confirmation that the explosion originated from SN 1181.</description>

      <title>Imprints of M87 Jet Precession on the Black Hole-Accretion Disk System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational constraints on the configuration of the black hole (BH)-accretion disk-jet system are crucial for addressing key questions in black hole growth, accretion disk physics, and jet formation. The recently reported jet precession in M87 provides a novel avenue to explore these long-standing issues. This precession, attributed to the accretion disk's response to the frame-dragging effect of a spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH), indicates a non-zero spin. The relatively short precession period ($\sim$11 years) implies a compact accretion disk. In contrast to the traditional view of a strictly collimated shape, the M87 jet is inferred to curve at the innermost regions connecting to the spinning BH, which explains the unexpectedly wide innermost projected jet width.</description>

      <title>Predicting metallicities and carbon abundances from Gaia XP spectra for (carbon-enhanced) metal-poor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-rich (C-rich) stars can be found at all metallicities and evolutionary stages. They are often the result of mass-transfer from a companion, but some of the most metal-poor C-rich objects are likely carrying the imprint of the metal-free First Stars from birth. In this work, we employ a neural network to predict metallicities and carbon abundances for over 10 million stars with Gaia low-resolution XP spectra, down to [Fe/H] = -3.0 and up to [C/Fe] $\approx$ +2. We identify ~2000 high-confidence bright (G&lt;16) carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0 and [C/Fe] &gt; +0.7. The majority of our C-rich candidates have [Fe/H] &gt; -2.0 and are expected to be binary mass-transfer products, supported by high barium abundances in GALAH and/or their Gaia RUWE and radial velocity variations. We confirm previous findings of an increase in C-rich stars with decreasing metallicity, adopting a definition of $3\sigma$ outliers from the [C/Fe] distribution, although our frequency appears to flatten for -3.0 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0 at a level of 6-7%. We also find that the fraction of C-rich stars is low among globular cluster stars (connected to their lower binary fraction), and that it decreases for field stars more tightly bound to the Milky Way. We interpret these last results as evidence that disrupted globular clusters contribute more in the inner Galaxy, supporting previous work. Homogeneous samples like these are key to understanding the full population properties of C-rich stars, and this is just the beginning.</description>

      <title>Unveiling two deeply embedded young protostars in the S68N Class 0 protostellar core with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The near-infrared (NIR) emission of the youngest protostars still needs to be characterized to better understand the evolution of their accretion and ejection activity. We analyze James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec 1.7 -- 5.3 $\mu$m observations of two deeply embedded sources in the S68N protostellar core in Serpens. The North Central (NC) source exhibits a highly obscured spectrum (A_K ~ 4.8 mag) that is modeled with a pre-main-sequence photosphere and a hot disk component. The photospheric parameters are consistent with a young, low-mass photosphere, as suggested by the low surface gravity, log g of 1.94 $\pm$ 0.15 cm s$^{-2}$. The hot disk suggests that accretion onto the central protostellar embryo is ongoing, although prototypical accretion-tracing emission lines HI are not detected. The South Central (SC) source, which is even more embedded (A_K ~ 8 mag; no continuum is detected shortward of 3.6 $\mu$m) appears to be driving the large-scale S68N protostellar outflow, and launches a collimated hot molecular jet detected in \Ht and CO ro-vibrational lines. Shock modeling of the \Ht (ro)vibrational lines establishes that fast $C$-type shocks ($\geq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), with high pre-shock density ($\geq$ $10^7$ cm$^{-3}$), and strong magnetic field (b ~ 3--10, where $B = b\,\times\,\sqrt{\textrm{n}_{\textrm{H}} (\textrm{cm}^{-3})}\,\mu\textrm{G}$) best match the data. The bright CO fundamental line forest suggests energetic excitation, with the contribution of non-LTE effects, ie irradiation pumping. Detected OH and CH$^{+}$ ro-vibrational lines support this hypothesis. These two Class 0 protostars seem to be in very young evolutionary stages and still have to acquire the bulk of their final stellar masses. These results demonstrate that JWST enables unprecedented diagnostics of these first stages of the protostellar evolutionary phase.</description>

      <title>Emulators for stellar profiles in binary population modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge about the internal physical structure of stars is crucial to understanding their evolution. The novel binary population synthesis code POSYDON includes a module for interpolating the stellar and binary properties of any system at the end of binary MESA evolution based on a pre-computed set of models. In this work, we present a new emulation method for predicting stellar profiles, i.e., the internal stellar structure along the radial axis, using machine learning techniques. We use principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction and fully-connected feed-forward neural networks for making predictions. We find accuracy to be comparable to that of nearest neighbor approximation, with a strong advantage in terms of memory and storage efficiency. By delivering more information about the evolution of stellar internal structure, these emulators will enable faster simulations of higher physical fidelity with large-scale simulations of binary star population synthesis possible with POSYDON and other population synthesis codes.</description>

      <title>Distance and stellar parameter estimations of solar-like stars from the LAMOST spectroscopic survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The Gaia mission has opened up a new era for the precise astrometry of stars, thus revolutionizing our understanding of the Milky Way. However, beyond a few kiloparseconds from the Sun, parallax measurements become less reliable, and even within 2 kpc, there still exist stars with large uncertainties.
  Aims. Our aim was to determine the distance and stellar parameters of 521,424 solar-like stars from LAMOST DR9; these stars lacked precise distance measurements (uncertainties higher than 20\% or even without any distance estimations) when checked with Gaia.
  Methods. We proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict the absolute magnitudes, colors, and stellar parameters (T_eff, logg, and [FeH]) directly from low-resolution spectra. For spectra with signal-to-noise ratios at g band (S/N_g) greater than 10, the model achieves a precision of 85 K for T_eff, 0.07 dex for logg, 0.06 dex for [Fe/H], 0.25 mag for M_g, and 0.03 mag for bp-rp. The estimated distances have a median fractional error of 4% with a standard deviation of 8%.
  Results: We applied the trained CNN model to 521,424 solar-like stars to derive the distance and stellar parameters. Compared with other distance estimation studies and spectroscopic surveys, the results show good consistency. Additionally, we investigated the metallicity gradients of the Milky Way from a subsample, and find a radial gradient ranging from -0.05 &lt; Delta{[Fe/H]}/Delta{R} &lt; 0.0 dex/kpc and a vertical gradient ranging from -0.26 &lt; Delta{[Fe/H]}/Delta{Z} &lt; -0.07dex/kpc
  Conclusions. We conclude that our method is effective in estimating distances and stellar parameters for solar-like stars with limited astrometric data. Our measurements are reliable for Galactic structure studies and hopefully will be useful for exoplanet researches.</description>

      <title>Evolution From Asymptotic Giant Branch to Pre-planetary Nebula: Whorled Patterns and Stellar Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipolar or multipolar lobes in pre-planetary nebulae (pPNe) often exhibit intertwined outer whorled patterns, resulting from stellar wind matter accumulation during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. These structures are likely triggered by stellar or substellar companions. We regard that CW Leonis currently stands at a critical transition moment, providing a vivid illustration of the progression from an AGB star in a binary system to a pPN. We have found that CW Leonis has shown significant enhancements in its optical and near-infrared light curves over the past two decades, with the recent Hubble Space Telescope image finally revealing the long-awaited central star. Utilizing an eccentric-orbit binary model, we can reproduce the position-angle dependence of the expansion velocity in the whorled pattern around CW Leonis, suggesting a nearly face-on orbital inclination. Its contradiction to the features in the innermost circumstellar envelope, corresponding to a nearly edge-on inclination, may imply the presence of an additional companion. Our updated theoretical framework explores the complexity of the whorled pattern. Further identifying and monitoring phase-transition candidates at the tip of the AGB will provide valuable insights into the AGB-pPN transition and the role of companions in shaping the morphological evolution of these stellar objects.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravitational Lensing by Rotating Quantum-Corrected Black Holes: Insights and Constraints from EHT Observations of M87* and Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational lensing in the strong-field limit using the rotating quantum-corrected black hole (RQCBH) with an additional parameter $\alpha$ besides mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$. We discover a decrease in the deflection angle $\alpha_D$, the photon sphere radius $x_{ps}$, and the angular position $\theta_{\infty}$. The flux ratio of the first image to all subsequent images, $r_{mag}$, decreases rapidly as $\alpha$ increases. We compare RQCBH observables with those of Kerr black holes, using Sgr A* and M87* as lenses to observe the effect of the quantum-corrected parameter $\alpha$. For Sgr A*, the angular position $\theta_\infty$ in $\in~(14.8-26.3)~\mu as$, while for M87* $\in~(11.12-19.78)~\mu as$. The angular separation $s$, for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) SgrA* and M87*, differs significantly, with values ranging $\in~(0.033-0.79)~\mu as$ for Sgr A* and $\in~(0.033-0.59)~\mu as$ for M87*. The deviations of the lensing observables $|\Delta\theta_\infty|$ and $|\Delta s|$ for RQCBH ($a=0.8,\alpha=0.4$) from Kerr black holes can reach up to $1.6~\mu as$ and $0.41~\mu as$ for Sgr A*, and $1.2~\mu as$ and $0.31~\mu as$ for M87*. The relative magnitude $r_{mag}$ $\in~(1.81-6.82)~\mu as$. We also compared the time delays between the relativistic images in the 22 SMBHs at the center of various galaxies. We found that RQCBH can be quantitatively distinguished from Kerr black holes. Interestingly, the time delay for Sgr A* and M87* can reach approximately 24.95 min and 308.15 hrs, respectively. Our analysis concludes that, within the 1$\sigma$ region, a significant portion of the parameter space agrees with the EHT results of M87* and Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Predicting photospheric UV emission from stellar evolutionary models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar ultraviolet (UV) emission serves as a crucial indicator for estimating magnetic activity and evaluating the habitability of exoplanets orbiting stars. In this paper, we present a straightforward method to derive stellar photospheric UV emission for F to M main-sequence stars. By using PARSEC models, we establish relations between near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV) magnitudes from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), NUV magnitudes from the China Space Station Telescope, and stellar effective temperatures and Gaia BP$-$RP color for different metallicities. Together with the observed sample, we find that for NUV emission, the photospheric contribution to the observed flux is less than 20% for M stars, around 10% to 70% for G stars, and ranges from 30% to 85% for G and F stars. For FUV emission, the photospheric contribution is less than $10^{-6}$ for M stars, below $10^{-4}$ for K stars, around $10^{-4}$ to 10% for G stars, and between 6% and 50% for F stars. Our work enables the simple and effective determination of stellar excess UV emission and the exploration of magnetic activity.</description>

      <title>Exploring the effect of different cosmologies on the Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal with POLAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detection of the 21-cm signal power spectrum from the Epoch of Reionization is imminent, thanks to consistent advancements from telescopes such as LOFAR, MWA, and HERA, along with the development of SKA. In light of this progress, it is crucial to expand the parameter space of simulations used to infer astrophysical properties from this signal. In this work, we explore the role of cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the matter clustering amplitude $\sigma_8$, whose values as provided by measurements at different redshifts are in tension. We run $N$-body simulations using GADGET-4, and post-process them with the reionization simulation code POLAR, that uses L-GALAXIES to include galaxy formation and evolution properties and GRIZZLY to execute 1-D radiative transfer of ionizing photons in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compare our results with the latest JWST observations and explore which astrophysical properties for different cosmologies are necessary to match the observed UV luminosity functions at redshifts $z = 10$ and 9. Additionally, we explore the impact of these parameters on the observed 21-cm signal power spectrum, focusing on the redshifts within the range of LOFAR 21-cm signal observations ($z \approx 8.5-10$). Despite differences in cosmological and astrophysical parameters, the 21-cm power spectrum at these redshifts agrees with presently observed upper limits. This suggests the need for broader physical parameter spaces for inference modeling to account for all models that agree with observations. However, we also propose stronger constraining power by using a combination of galactic and IGM observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies showed that observations of line emission from shocks in YSO jets require a substantial amount of ionization of the pre-shock matter. Photoionization from X-ray emitted close to the central source may be responsible for the initial ionization fraction. The aim of our work is to study the effect of X-ray photoionization, coming from the vicinity of the central star, on the ionization fraction inside the jet that can be advected at large distances. For this purpose we have performed axisymmetric MHD jet launching simulations including photoionization and optically thin losses using PLUTO. For typical X-ray luminosities in classical T-Tauri stars, we see that the photoionization is responsible for ionizing to 10 % -20 % the jet close to the star.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Interstellar Extinction at High Galactic Latitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A detailed map of the distribution of dust at high Galactic latitudes is essential for future cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments because the dust, while diffuse, remains a significant foreground in these regions. We develop a Bayesian model to identify a region of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram suited to constrain the single-star extinction accurately at high Galactic latitudes. Using photometry from Gaia, 2MASS and ALLWISE, and parallax from Gaia, we employ nested sampling to fit the model to the data and analyse the posterior over stellar parameters for both synthetic and real data. Charting low variations in extinction is complex due to systematic errors and degeneracies between extinction and other stellar parameters. The systematic errors can be minimised by restricting our data to a region of the HR diagram where the stellar models are most accurate. Moreover, the degeneracies can be reduced by including astrophysical priors and spectroscopic constraints. We show that accounting for the measurement error of the data and the assumed inaccuracies of the stellar models are critical in accurately recovering small variations in extinction. We compare the posterior distribution for individual stars with spectroscopic stellar parameter estimates from LAMOST and Gaia ESO and illustrate the importance of estimating extinction and effective temperature as a joint solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a wide-field study of the globular cluster systems (GCS) of the elliptical galaxy NGC 3640 and its companion NGC 3641, based on observations from Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph/Gemini using the g'r'i' filters. NGC 3640 is a shell galaxy which presents a complex morphology, which previous studies have indicated as the sign of a recent `dry' merger, although whether its nearest neighbour could have had an influence in these substructures remains an open question. In this work, we trace the spatial distribution of the globular clusters (GCs) as well as their colour distribution, finding a potential bridge of red (metal-rich) GCs that connects NGC 3640 to its less massive companion, and signs that the blue (metal-poor) GCs were spatially disturbed by the event that created the shells. While NGC 3640 presents a typical bimodal colour distribution, the GCS attributed to NGC 3641 appears unimodal, with most GCs presenting an intermediate colour in comparison to those closer to its companion.</description>

      <title>Measuring Dwarf Galaxy Intrinsic Abundance Scatter with Mid-resolution Spectroscopic Surveys: Calibrating APOGEE Abundance Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first generations of stars left their chemical fingerprints on metal-poor stars in the Milky Way and its surrounding dwarf galaxies. While instantaneous and homogeneous enrichment implies that groups of co-natal stars should have the same element abundances, small amplitudes of abundance scatter are seen at fixed [Fe/H]. Measurements of intrinsic abundance scatter have been made with small, high-resolution spectroscopic datasets where measurement uncertainty is small compared to this scatter. In this work, we present a method to use mid-resolution survey data, which has larger errors, to make this measurement. Using APOGEE DR17, we calculate the intrinsic scatter of Al, O, Mg, Si, Ti, Ni, and Mn relative to Fe for 333 metal-poor stars across 6 classical dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way, and 1604 stars across 19 globular clusters. We first calibrate the reported abundance errors in bins of signal-to-noise and [Fe/H] using a high-fidelity halo dataset. We then apply these calibrated errors to the APOGEE data, and find small amplitudes of average intrinsic abundance scatter in dwarf galaxies ranging from 0.032 - 0.14 dex with a median value of 0.043 dex. For the globular clusters, we find intrinsic scatters ranging from 0.018 - 0.21 dex, with particularly high scatter for Al and O. Our measurements of intrinsic abundance scatter place important upper limits on the intrinsic scatter in these systems, as well as constraints on their underlying star formation history and mixing, that we can look to simulations to interpret.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: An extremely nitrogen-loud and chemically stratified galaxy at $z\sim 5.55$</title>

Abstract: We report the chemical abundance pattern of GS\_3073, a galaxy at $z=5.55$ which was previously confirmed to host an overmassive active black hole, by leveraging the detection of about 40 emission lines, combining JWST/NIRSpec observations and ground-based (VLT/VIMOS) data. Based on the rest-frame UV emission lines, which trace high-density ($\sim 10^5~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) and highly ionized gas, we derived an abundance ratio of $\rm log(N/O) = 0.42^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$. At an estimated metallicity of $0.2~Z_{\odot}$, this is the most extreme nitrogen-rich object found by JWST thus far. In comparison, the relative carbon abundance derived from the rest-frame UV emission lines is $\rm log(C/O) = -0.38^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$, which is not significantly higher than those in local galaxies and stars with similar metallicities. We also found potential detection of coronal lines including [FeVII]$\lambda 6087$ and [FeXIV]$\lambda 5303$, both blended with [CaV]. We inferred a range of Fe abundances compatible with those in local stars and galaxies. Overall, the chemical abundance pattern of GS\_3073 is compatible with enrichment by super-massive stars with $M_* \gtrsim 1000~M_\odot$, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, or Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Interestingly, when using optical emission lines which trace lower density ($\sim 10^3~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) and lower ionization gas, we found a sub-solar N/O ratio. We interpret the difference in N/O derived from UV lines and optical lines as evidence for a stratified system, where the inner and denser region is both more chemically enriched and more ionized. Taking this luminous, well-studied system as a benchmark, our results suggest that nitrogen loudness in high-$z$ galaxies is confined to the central, dense, and highly ionized region of the galaxies, while the bulk of the galaxies evolves more normally.</description>

      <title>The boring history of Gaia BH3 from isolated binary evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the first observed dormant black hole (BH) with a mass of $\approx{30}$ M$_\odot$ and represents the first confirmation that such massive BHs are associated with metal-poor stars. Here, we explore the isolated binary formation channel for Gaia BH3 focusing on the old and metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way halo. We use the MIST stellar models and our open-source population synthesis code SEVN to evolve $5.6 \times 10^8$ binaries exploring 20 sets of parameters. We find that systems like Gaia BH3 form preferentially from binaries initially composed of a massive star ($40-60$ M$_\odot$) and a low mass companion ($&lt;1$ M$_\odot$) in a wide ($P&gt;10^3$ days) and eccentric orbit ($e&gt;0.6$). Such progenitor binary stars do not undergo any Roche-lobe overflow episode during their entire evolution, so that the final orbital properties of the BH-star system are determined at the core collapse of the primary star. Low natal kicks ($\lesssim$ 10~km/s) significantly favour the formation of Gaia BH3-like systems, but high velocity kicks up to $\approx 220$ km/s are also allowed. We estimate the formation efficiency for Gaia BH3-like systems in old ($t&gt;10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($Z&lt;0.01$) populations to be $\sim 4 \times 10^{-8}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$ (for our fiducial model), representing $\sim 3\%$ of the whole simulated BH-star population. We expect up to $\approx 4000$ BH-star systems in the Galactic halo formed through isolated evolution, of which $\approx 100$ are compatible with Gaia BH3-like. Given the density profile of the Galactic halo we do not expect more than one at the observed distance of Gaia BH3. Our models show that, even if it was born inside a stellar cluster, Gaia BH3 is compatible with a primordial binary star that escaped from its parent cluster without experiencing significant dynamical interactions.</description>

      <title>Prior-Informed AGN-Host Spectral Decomposition Using PyQSOFit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an improved method for decomposing the emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies using templates from principal component analysis (PCA). This approach integrates prior information from PCA with a penalized pixel fitting mechanism which improves the precision and effectiveness of the decomposition process. Specifically, we have reduced the degeneracy and over-fitting in AGN-host decomposition, particularly for those with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), where traditional methods tend to fail. By applying our method to 76,565 SDSS Data Release 16 quasars with $z&lt;0.8$, we achieve a success rate of $\approx$ 94%, thus establishing the largest host-decomposed spectral catalog of quasars to date. Our fitting results consider the impact of the host galaxy on the overestimation of the AGN luminosity and black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$). Furthermore, we obtained stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_*$) measurements for 4,137 quasars. The slope of the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relation in this subsample is generally consistent with previous quasar studies beyond the local universe. Our method provides a robust and efficient approach to disentangle the AGN and host galaxy components across a wide range of SNRs and redshifts.</description>

      <title>Dynamics around supermassive black holes: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals as gravitational-wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes and their surrounding dense stellar environments nourish a variety of astrophysical phenomena. We focus on the distribution of stellar-mass black holes around the supermassive black hole and the consequent formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). We derive a steady-state distribution, considering the effects of two-body scatterings and gravitational wave emission, and calculate the EMRI formation rate, eccentricity distribution and EMRI-to-plunge ratio. Our model predicts: (I) A stronger segregation than previously estimated at the outskirts of the sphere of influence (at $\sim0.01\rm pc$ to $2\rm pc$ for a Milky Way-like galaxy). (II) An increased EMRI-to-plunge ratio, favoring EMRIs at galaxies where stellar-mass black holes are scarce. (III) A detection of about $2\times10^3$ resolvable EMRIs, with a signal-to-noise ratio above $20$, along a $4$ year LISA mission time. (IV) A confusion noise, induced by a cosmological population of unresolved EMRIs, reducing LISA sensitivity in the $1-5\ \rm mHz$ frequency range by up to a factor of $\approx2$, relative to the instrumental noise.</description>

      <title>Simulating images of radio galaxies with diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With increasing amounts of data in astronomy, automated analysis methods have become crucial. Synthetic data are required for developing and testing such methods. Current simulations often suffer from insufficient detail or inaccurate representation of source type occurrences. To overcome those deficiencies, we implemented a deep generative model trained on observations to generate realistic radio galaxy images with full control over the flux and source morphology. We used a diffusion model, trained with continuous time steps to reduce sampling time without quality impairments. Two models were trained on two different datasets, respectively. One set was a selection of images from the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). The model is conditioned on peak flux values to preserve signal intensity information after re-scaling image pixel values. The other, smaller set was obtained from the VLA survey of Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST). In that set, every image was provided with a morphological class label the corresponding model was conditioned on. Conditioned sampling is realized with classifier-free diffusion guidance. We evaluated the quality of generated images by comparing distributions of different quantities over the real and generated data, including results from the standard source-finding algorithms. The class conditioning was evaluated by training a classifier and comparing its performance on both real and generated data. We were able to generate realistic images of high quality using 25 sampling steps, which is unprecedented in the field of radio astronomy. The generated images are visually indistinguishable from the training data and the distributions of different image metrics were replicated. The classifier performs equally well for real and generated images, indicating strong sampling control over morphological properties.</description>

      <title>Stripped helium-star and compact object binaries in coeval populations -- predictions based on detailed binary evolution models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive stars mainly form in close binaries, where their mutual interactions can profoundly alter their evolutionary paths. Evolved binaries consisting of a massive OB-type main-sequence star with a stripped helium star or a compact companion represent a crucial stage in the evolution towards double compact objects, whose mergers are (potentially) detectable via gravitational waves. The recent detection of X-ray quiet OB+black hole binaries and OB+stripped helium star binaries has set the stage for discovering more of these systems in the near future. In this work, based on 3670 detailed binary-evolution models and using empirical distributions of initial binary parameters, we compute the expected population of such evolved massive binaries in coeval stellar populations, including stars in star clusters and in galaxies with starburst activities, for ages up to 100 Myr. Our results are vividly illustrated in an animation that shows the evolution of these binaries in the color-magnitude diagram over time. We find that the number of OB+black hole binaries peaks around 10 Myr, and OB+neutron star binaries are most abundant at approximately 20 Myr. Both black holes and neutron stars can potentially be found in populations with ages up to 90 Myr. Additionally, we analyze the properties of such binaries at specific ages. We find that OB+helium stars and OB+black hole binaries are likely to be identifiable as single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Our research serves as a guide for future observational efforts to discover such binaries in young star clusters and starburst environments.</description>
