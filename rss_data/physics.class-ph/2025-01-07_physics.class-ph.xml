      <title>Nondipole interaction between two uniformly magnetized spheres and its relation to superconducting levitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytically solving the magnetostatic Maxwell equations in the bispherical coordinates, we calculate the magnetic field around two uniformly magnetized spheres oriented so that their magnetic moments are parallel to the axis passing through the centers of the spheres. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is often claimed in the literature, the magnetic interaction between such spheres is not equivalent to the interaction between two point magnetic dipoles placed in the centers of the spheres. The nonzero levitation force acting on a uniformly magnetized sphere or a point magnetic dipole above a superconducting sphere in the ideal Meissner state is a clear manifestation of the non-equivalence.</description>

      <title>A Complex Hilbert Space for Classical Electromagnetic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a complex Hilbert Space with Hermitian operators for calculations in classical electromagnetism. This approach lets us derive a variety of fundamental expressions for electromagnetism using minimal mathematics and a calculation sequence well-known for traditional quantum mechanics. The purpose of this Hilbert Space is not to calculate the expectation values of known observables, however, like in Koopman-von Neumann-Sudarshan (KvNS) mechanics (for classical point particles) and quantum mechanics (quantum waves or fields). We also demonstrate the existence of the wave commutation relationship $[\hat{x},\hat{k}]=i$, which is the never seen before classical analogue to the canonical commutator $[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i\hbar$. The difference between classical and quantum mechanics lies in the presence of $\hbar$. This is the first report of noncommutativity of observables for a classical theory. Further comparisons between electromagnetism, KvNS classical mechanics, and quantum mechanics are made. Finally, supplementing the analysis presented, we additionally demonstrate for the first time a completely relativistic version of Feynman's proof of Maxwell's equations \citep{Dyson}. Unlike what \citet{Dyson} indicated, there is no need for Galilean relativity for the proof to work. This fits parsimoniously with our usage of classical commutators for electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Distribution of regularized three-body phase-volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The micro-canonical phase-space volume for the three-body problem is a topic of intrinsic interest. Within the flux-based statistical theory, it provides a means to predict the scale of disintegration times for non-hierarchical systems. While the bare phase-volume diverges, arXiv:2205.04294 (Paper I) showed that a regularized version can be defined. Building on Paper I, which determined the regularized phase-volume for a given energy $\bar\sigma(E)$, this paper extends the analysis to its distribution over angular momentum, $\bar\sigma(E,L)$. Through analytical integrations, we reduce the problem to a 3d numerical integration, a step up in complexity from the 2d integration required for $\bar\sigma(E)$. We provide regularized phase-volume values for several mass sets across a range of $E$ and $L$, validated through an $L$-integration test. Notably, the values remain positive for all tested parameters, lending further support to the validity of the chosen regularization procedure. For high values of $L$ at fixed masses and $E$, we observe a strong suppression of $\bar\sigma(E,L)$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic moments in the Poynting theorem, Maxwell equations, Dirac equation, and QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of magnetic moments in electrodynamics is examined in this work. The effects are described in the context of conventional quantum electrodynamics expressed in terms of the electromagnetic fields or in the context of an extended Poynting theorem and extended Maxwell equations. These extensions take into account the energetics of interaction of magnetic moments with inhomogeneous magnetic fields. We show how magnetic moment effects are included in either version of electrodynamics and that these apparently different formulations can give consistent results. In either case, we express the interactions in terms of electromagnetic fields only, avoiding use of a vector potential.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Antenna Bandwidth and Quality Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After a brief history of the development of quality factor, useful expressions are derived for the robust Qz(w) quality factor that accurately determines the VSWR input-impedance fractional bandwidth of antennas for isolated resonances and a small enough bandwidth power drop. For closely spaced multiple resonances/antiresonances, a definitive formula is given for the increase in fractional bandwidth enabled by Bode-Fano matching. Methods are given for determining the conventional and complex-energy quality factors of antennas from RLC circuit models. New field-based quality factors Q(w) are derived for antennas with known fields produced by an input current I. These Q(w) are remarkably robust because they equal Qz(w) when the input impedance is available. Like Qz(w), the field-based Q(w) is independent of the choice of origin of the antenna fields and is impervious to extra lengths of transmission lines and surplus reactances. These robust field-based quality factors are used to derive new lower bounds on the quality factors (upper bounds on the bandwidths) of spherical-mode antennas that improve upon the previous Chu/Collin-Rothschild lower bounds for spherical modes. A criterion for antenna supergain is found by combining the Harrington maximum gain formula with the recently derived formula for the reactive power boundaries of antennas. Maximum gain versus minimum quality factor for spherical antennas are determined using the improved lower bounds on quality factor for different values of electrical size ka. Lastly, reduced antenna quality factors allowed by dispersive tuning overcome the traditional Chu lower bounds for lower radiation efficiencies and small enough bandwidth power drops.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of populations of weakly-coupled low-temperature-differential Stirling engines with synchronous and asynchronous transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study developed the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for populations of low-temperature-differential (LTD) Stirling engines weakly-coupled in a general class of networks to clarify the effects of synchronous and asynchronous transitions on the power and thermal efficiency. We first show that synchronous (asynchronous) transitions increase (decrease) the power and thermal efficiency of weakly-coupled LTD Stirling engines based on quasilinear response relations between formally defined thermodynamic fluxes and forces. After that, we construct a conceptual model satisfying the quasilinear response relations to give a physical interpretation of the changes in power and thermal efficiency due to synchronous and asynchronous transitions, and justify the use of this conceptual model. We then show that the conceptual model, rather than the quasilinear response relations, preserves the irreversible nature in the relative motion of the original model and thus shows more accurate results than the analysis using the quasilinear response relations. Finally, we compare the dynamics between the original and the conceptual models for two-engine systems and show that the conceptual model roughly preserves the dynamical characteristics leading up to the synchronous transitions, while some detailed dynamical structures are lost.</description>

      <title>Elastic wavepackets crossing a space-time interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between waves and evolving media challenges traditional conservation laws. We experimentally investigate the behavior of elastic wave packets crossing a moving interface that separates two media with distinct propagation properties, observing the non-conservation of wavelength and frequency. Our experimental setup employs an elastic strip whose local stretching can be dynamically altered by pulling one end at a constant velocity. By demonstrating that this dynamic configuration creates a spatio-temporal interface traveling along the strip, we confirm theoretical predictions regarding observed shifts when a wave packet crosses this interface.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Cauchy Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most theories and applications of elasticity rely on an energy function that depends on the strains from which the stresses can be derived. This is the traditional setting of Green elasticity, also known as hyper-elasticity. However, in its original form the theory of elasticity does not assume the existence of a strain-energy function. In this case, called Cauchy elasticity, stresses are directly related to the strains. Since the emergence of modern elasticity in the 1940s, research on Cauchy elasticity has been relatively limited. One possible reason is that for Cauchy materials, the net work performed by stress along a closed path in the strain space may be nonzero. Therefore, such materials may require access to both energy sources and sinks. This characteristic has led some mechanicians to question the viability of Cauchy elasticity as a physically plausible theory of elasticity. In this paper, motivated by its relevance to recent applications, such as the modeling of active solids, we revisit Cauchy elasticity in a modern form.</description>
