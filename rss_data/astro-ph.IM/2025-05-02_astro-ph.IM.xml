      <title>Convolutional Autoencoders for Data Compression and Anomaly Detection in Small Satellite Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small satellite technologies have enhanced the potential and feasibility of geodesic missions, through simplification of design and decreased costs allowing for more frequent launches. On-satellite data acquisition systems can benefit from the implementation of machine learning (ML), for better performance and greater efficiency on tasks such as image processing or feature extraction. This work presents convolutional autoencoders for implementation on the payload of small satellites, designed to achieve dual functionality of data compression for more efficient off-satellite transmission, and at-source anomaly detection to inform satellite data-taking. This capability is demonstrated for a use case of disaster monitoring using aerial image datasets of the African continent, offering avenues for both novel ML-based approaches in small satellite applications along with the expansion of space technology and artificial intelligence in Africa.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Fermi paradox via passive SETI: a general framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the extent to which a lack of observations from SETI may be used to quantify the Fermi paradox. Building on previous research, we construct a geometrical model to compute the probability of at least one detection of an extraterrestrial electromagnetic (EM) signal of galactic origin, as a function of the number $N$ of communicative civilizations. We show how this is derivable from the probability of detecting a single signal; the latter is $\approx 0.6 \delta/R$, where $\delta$ is the distance between the initial and final EM signals and $R$ is the radius of the Milky Way, for $\delta/R \ll 1$. We show how to combine this analysis with the Drake equation $N = \mathscr{N} \delta /c$, where $c$ is the speed of light; this implies, applying a simplified toy model as an example, that the probability of detecting at least one signal is $&gt;99 \%$ for $\delta / c \gtrsim 10^{2.8}$ years, given that $\mathscr{N} = 1$. Lastly, we list this toy model's significant limitations, and suggest ways to ameliorate them in more realistic future models.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired exoplanet detection in the presence of experimental imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ideal spatial demultiplexing (SPADE) is proven to be a quantum-optimal tool for exoplanet detection, i.e., asymmetric source discrimination. However, recent investigations into the related problems of separation estimation and symmetric source discrimination showed its efficiency to be limited in the presence of noise. In this work, we use analytical tools to scrutinize the practical applicability of SPADE and derive the associated optimal decision strategy for exoplanet detection in the presence of experimental imperfections. On the one hand, we find that the probability of detection of noisy SPADE has the same scaling with planet-star separation and relative brightness as conventional techniques, such as direct imaging and coronagraphs. On the other hand, we prove that, due to a superior scaling coefficient under realistic noise conditions, SPADE remains the most efficient method for practical exoplanet detection in the sub-Rayleigh regime.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Free-floating Planet Mass Function with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-floating planets comprise one of the most enigmatic populations of exoplanets in the Galaxy. Though ground-based observations point to a large abundance of these worlds, little is known about their origins and demographics. In the coming years, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey is expected to detect several hundred free-floating planets, providing the first opportunity to characterize these worlds at the population level. We present a first study of Roman's prospects for reconstructing the mass distribution of free-floating planets through population-level statistical inference. We find that depending on the true underlying mass distribution of free-floating planets in the Galaxy, Roman will be able to improve upon existing estimates of the abundance by orders of magnitudes in the largely unexplored mass range below that of Earth. When applied to Roman's observations, the methodology we present herein will be capable of discriminating between different hypothesized mass distributions at high statistical significance, opening a new window into the origins of these rogue worlds.</description>

      <title>Chromatic Effects on the PSF and Shear Measurement for the Roman Space Telescope High-Latitude Wide Area Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing (WL) is a key cosmological probe that requires precise measurement of galaxy images to infer shape distortions, or shear, and constrain cosmology. Accurate estimation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) is crucial for shear measurement, but the wavelength dependence of the PSF introduces chromatic biases that can systematically impact shear inference. We focus on biases arising from spectral energy distribution (SED) differences between stars, used for PSF modeling, and galaxies, used for shear measurement. We investigate these effects in $\textit{Roman's}$ four design reference mission WL bands (Y106, J129, H158, F184) and wide filter (W146). Using $\textit{Roman}$-like image simulations, we quantify the induced shear biases and compare them to requirements on those biases. Multiplicative biases over all galaxies hover around $\sim$0.2% in the WL bands and 2% in the wide filter, exceeding the mission requirement of $|m| &lt; 0.032\%$ and relaxed requirement of $|m| &lt; 0.1\%$. In individual redshift bins, biases can reach 0.4$\unicode{x2013}$0.9% for the WL bands and 3$\unicode{x2013}$6% for the wide filter. Additive biases remain acceptable in the WL bands but exceed systematic limits in the wide filter. We develop and test PSF-level corrections, showing that a first-order correction reduces biases within survey requirements for the WL bands; however, higher-order terms are necessary for the wide filter. Our results highlight the necessity of chromatic corrections for precision WL with $\textit{Roman}$ and provide a framework for mitigating these biases. Finally, we compare analytical color-based corrections to self-organizing maps (SOMs) and find that both methods effectively reduce biases.</description>

      <title>superB/NRPy: Scalable, Task-Based Numerical Relativity for 3G Gravitational Wave Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern gravitational-wave science demands increasingly accurate and computationally intensive numerical relativity (NR) simulations. The Python-based, open-source NRPy framework generates optimized C/C++ code for NR, including the complete NR code BlackHoles@Home (BH@H), which leverages curvilinear coordinates well-suited to many astrophysical scenarios. Historically, BH@H was limited to single-node OpenMP CPU parallelism. To address this, we introduce superB, an open-source extension to NRPy that enables automatic generation of scalable, task-based, distributed-memory Charm++ code from existing BH@H modules. The generated code partitions the structured grids used by NRPy/BH@H, managing communication between them. Its correctness is validated through bit-identical results with the standard OpenMP version on a single node and via a head-on binary black hole simulation in cylindrical-like coordinates, accurately reproducing quasi-normal modes (up to $\ell=8$). The superB/NRPy-generated code demonstrates excellent strong scaling, achieving an $\approx 45$x speedup on 64 nodes (7168 cores) compared to the original single-node OpenMP code for a large 3D vacuum test. This scalable infrastructure benefits demanding simulations and lays the groundwork for future multi-patch grid support, targeting long inspirals, extreme parameter studies, and rapid follow-ups. This infrastructure readily integrates with other NRPy/BH@H-based projects, enabling performant scaling for the general relativistic hydrodynamics code GRoovy, and facilitating future coupling with GPU acceleration via the NRPy-CUDA project.</description>

      <title>Attitude Control of Spacecraft for Autonomous Attenuation of Unknown Periodic Disturbance Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, deep space exploration, especially focusing on halo orbits, the periodic orbits of the Moon, has been widely studied. The spacecraft in halo orbits performs periodic orbital motion, which affects the attitude motion by periodic disturbances. The conventional attitude control method, PD control, is widely used, but its application to periodic disturbance attenuation is inefficient. To address these challenges, this study proposes a predictive Repetitive Control (RC) approach that addresses periodic disturbances, particularly GG torque, by exploiting the periodic nature of the system dynamics. The proposed method is also applied to the case of using a Reaction Wheel (RW) as an attitude control actuator. Despite the inherent challenges posed by RW limitations, including saturation torque and transmission delay, our predictive RC approach effectively mitigates these effects. Numerical simulations demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method in maintaining attitude control for spacecraft traversing halo orbits near the Earth-Moon $L_2$ point, validating its potential for future deep space exploration missions.</description>

      <title>Detecting Modeling Bias with Continuous Time Flow Models on Weak Lensing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for extracting rich information from nonlinear scales in current and upcoming cosmological surveys, and ensuring its robustness requires stringent validation of forward models. In this work, we recast forward model validation as an out-of-distribution (OoD) detection problem within the framework of machine learning (ML)-based simulation-based inference (SBI). We employ probability density as the metric for OoD detection, and compare various density estimation techniques, demonstrating that field-level probability density estimation via continuous time flow models (CTFM) significantly outperforms feature-level approaches that combine scattering transform (ST) or convolutional neural networks (CNN) with normalizing flows (NFs), as well as NF-based field-level estimators, as quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Our analysis shows that CTFM not only excels in detecting OoD samples but also provides a robust metric for model selection. Additionally, we verified CTFM maintains consistent efficacy across different cosmologies while mitigating the inductive biases inherent in NF architectures. Although our proof-of-concept study employs simplified forward modeling and noise settings, our framework establishes a promising pathway for identifying unknown systematics in the cosmology datasets.</description>

      <title>Joint inference for gravitational wave signals and glitches using a data-informed glitch model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave data are often contaminated by non-Gaussian noise transients, glitches, which can bias the inference of astrophysical signal parameters. Traditional approaches either subtract glitches in a pre-processing step, or a glitch model can be included from an agnostic wavelet basis (e.g. BayesWave). In this work, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to build a parameterised model of glitches. We train a normalising flow on known glitches from the Gravity Spy catalogue, constructing an informative prior on the glitch model. By incorporating this model into the Bayesian inference analysis with Bilby, we estimate glitch and signal parameters simultaneously. We demonstrate the performance of our method through bias reduction, glitch identification and Bayesian model selection on real glitches. Our results show that this approach effectively removes glitches from the data, significantly improving source parameter estimation and reducing bias.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-$C_\ell$s for spin-$s$ fields with component-wise weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generalisation of the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach for power spectrum estimation to the case of spin-$s$ fields weighted by a general positive-definite weight matrix that couples the different spin components of the field (e.g. $Q$ and $U$ maps in CMB polarisation analyses, or $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ shear components in weak lensing). Relevant use cases are, for example, data with significantly anisotropic noise properties, or situations in which different masks must be applied to the different field components. The weight matrix map is separated into a spin-0 part, which corresponds to the "mask" in the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach, and a spin-$2s$ part sourced solely by the anisotropic elements of the matrix, leading to additional coupling between angular scales and $E/B$ modes. The general expressions for the mode-coupling coefficients involving the power spectra of these anisotropic weight components are derived and validated. The generalised algorithm is as computationally efficient as the standard approach. We implement the method in the public code NaMaster.</description>

      <title>One-stop strategy to search for long-duration gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind continuous gravitational-wave (CWs) searches are a significant computational challenge due to their long duration and weak amplitude of the involved signals. To cope with such problem, the community has developed a variety of data-analysis strategies which are usually tailored to specific CW searches; this prevents their applicability across the nowadays broad landscape of potential CW source. Also, their sensitivity is typically hard to model, and thus usually requires a significant computing investment. We present fasttracks, a massively-parallel engine to evaluate detection statistics for generic CW signals using GPU computing. We demonstrate a significant increase in computational efficiency by parallelizing the brute-force evaluation of detection statistics without using any computational approximations. Also, we introduce a simple and scalable postprocessing which allows us to formulate a generic semianalytic sensitivity estimate algorithm. These proposals are tested in a minimal all-sky search in data from the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The strategies discussed here will become increasingly relevant in the coming years as long-duration signals become a standard observation of future ground-based and space-borne detectors.</description>

      <title>Sky localization of gravitational waves from eccentric binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the orbital eccentricity in compact binary mergers can be used to improve their sky localization using gravitational wave observations. Existing algorithms that conduct the localizations are not optimized for eccentric sources. We use a semi-Bayesian technique to carry out localizations of simulated sources recovered using a matched-filter search. Through these simulations, we find that if a non-negligible eccentricity is obtained during the detection, an eccentricity-optimized algorithm can significantly improve the localization areas compared to the existing methods. We also lay out the foundation for an eccentric early-warning system using the matched-filter search. The potential impact on the early-warning localization is investigated. We indicate a few possible cases of improvements while accounting for eccentricity toward any detectable eccentric neutron star binaries in the forthcoming observing scenarios of ground-based detectors. Improved localizations can be useful in effectually utilizing the capabilities of the follow-up facilities.</description>

      <title>Detection of Unresolved Strongly Lensed Supernovae with 7-Dimensional Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) are a powerful tool for exploring the realms of astronomy and cosmology. Time-delay measurements and lens modeling of glSNe can provide a robust and independent method for constraining the expansion rate of the universe. The study of unresolved glSNe light curves presents a unique opportunity for utilizing small telescopes to investigate these systems. In this work, we investigate diverse observational strategies for the initial detection of glSNe using the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT), a multitelescope system composed of twenty 50-cm telescopes. We implement different observing strategies on a subset of 5807 strong lensing systems and candidates identified within the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), as reported in various publications. Our simulations under ideal observing conditions indicate the maximum expected annual detection rates for various glSNe types (Type Ia and core-collapse (CC)) using the 7DT target observing mode in the $r$-band at a depth of 22.04 mag, as follows: 7.46 events for type Ia, 2.49 for type Ic, 0.8 for type IIb, 0.52 for type IIL, 0.78 for type IIn, 3.75 for type IIP, and 1.15 for type Ib. Furthermore, in the case of medium-band filter observations (m6000) at a depth of 20.61 in the Wide-field Time-domain Survey (WTS)program, the predicted detection rate for glSNe Ia is 2.53 $yr^{-1}$. Given targeted follow-up observations of these initially detected systems with more powerful telescopes, we can apply a model-independent approach to forecast the ability to measure $H_{0}$ using a Gaussian process from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) data and time-delay distance information derived from glSNe systems, which include both Ia and CC types. We forecast that the expected detection rate of glSNe systems can achieve a $2.7\%$ precision in estimating the $H_{0}$.</description>

      <title>Conditional Diffusion-Based Retrieval of Atmospheric CO2 from Earth Observing Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem, which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence, and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal, we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current operational state-of-the-art.</description>

Abstract: Forward modeling is often used to interpret substructures observed in protoplanetary disks. To ensure the robustness and consistency of the current forward modeling approach from the community, we conducted a systematic comparison of various hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes. Using four grid-based hydrodynamics codes (FARGO3D, Idefix, Athena++, PLUTO) and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code (Phantom), we simulated a protoplanetary disk with an embedded giant planet. We then used two radiative transfer codes (mcfost, RADMC-3D) to calculate disk temperatures and create synthetic 12CO cubes. Finally, we retrieved the location of the planet from the synthetic cubes using DISCMINER. We found strong consistency between the hydrodynamics codes, particularly in the density and velocity perturbations associated with planet-driven spirals. We also found a good agreement between the two radiative transfer codes: the disk temperature in mcfost and RADMC-3D models agrees within $\lesssim 3~\%$ everywhere in the domain. In synthetic $^{12}$CO channel maps, this results in brightness temperature differences within $\pm1.5$ K in all our models. This good agreement ensures consistent retrieval of planet's radial/azimuthal location with only a few % of scatter, with velocity perturbations varying $\lesssim 20~\%$ among the models. Notably, while the planet-opened gap is shallower in the Phantom simulation, we found that this does not impact the planet location retrieval. In summary, our results demonstrate that any combination of the tested hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes can be used to reliably model and interpret planet-driven kinematic perturbations.</description>
