      <title>Improving knowledge of the acoustic factors involved in railway noise annoyance: first results of a pilot field survey of sixty-two local residents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Railway transportation contributes to the objectives of decarbonization but also generates negative externalities, including noise. Energy noise indicators used to characterize population exposure do not adequately reflect the repetitive nature of railway noise peaks. The GENIFER pilot study aims to test a protocol designed to characterize railway noise events according to the instantaneous perceived annoyance when the train is passing, in order to improve understanding of the influence of acoustic factors on annoyance. The first phase of the survey was carried out in 2023 among 62 residents of a pilot site. An electronic device was used to collect around 5,000 ratings, ranging from 1 to 10, assessing the instantaneous annoyance induced by railway noise at passing trains. The site instrumentation included sixteen sound level meters and two video recording systems, enabling annoyance ratings to be associated with the acoustic characteristics of railway noise events. A questionnaire aimed at identifying co-determinants of long-term annoyance was also administered to participants. Feedback on the field implementation of this survey and initial results concerning acoustic measurements, instantaneous annoyance ratings and questionnaire responses will be presented.</description>

      <title>Improve Knowledge Of Acoustic Factors Involved In Railway Noise Annoyance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy noise indicators are generally used to characterize the exposure of populations to transportation noise in relation to their long-term annoyance, but they do not adequately reflect the repetitive nature of noise peaks generated by railway traffic. The GENIFER project aims to test a study protocol designed to rank railway noise events according to the instantaneous annoyance they cause to residents. This study will be carried out in a sector exposed to railway noise in the {\^I}le-de-France region and will require the recruitment of 60 volunteer local residents. It will propose the use of innovative tools for collecting information, including an electronic remote-control allowing participants to rate the annoyance they feel when trains pass by, and noise sensor instrumentation allowing the simultaneous collection of the acoustic characteristics of railway noise peaks. It also includes semi-directive interviews and a questionnaire to identify co-determinants of annoyance. The instantaneous annoyance scores collected will also be compared with those obtained from commented listening to sound samples of passing trains. In addition to assessing the acceptability of the protocol by the participants, this study aims to validate the feasibility of ranking railway noise events according to their acoustic characteristics in terms of the annoyance expressed.</description>

      <title>The Frictional Brachistochrone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, I construct an elegant frictional brachistochrone for a mass point motion of a granular material with the Coulomb frictional energy dissipation that inherently includes the evolving path curvature. The simple model reveals several striking mechanical phenomena. It is applicable to any frictional particle. With increasing friction, the particle path becomes less and less curved until a straight brachistochrone is attained in the limit of sufficiently high friction. The existence of the straight-brachistochrone is phenomenal.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Antenna Bandwidth and Quality Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After a brief history of the development of quality factor, useful expressions are derived for the robust Qz(w) quality factor that accurately determines the VSWR input-impedance fractional bandwidth of antennas for isolated resonances and a small enough bandwidth power drop. For closely spaced multiple resonances/antiresonances, a definitive formula is given for the increase in fractional bandwidth enabled by Bode-Fano tuning. Methods are given for determining the conventional and complex-energy quality factors of antennas from RLC circuit models. New field-based quality factors Q(w) are derived for antennas with known fields produced by an input current. These Q(w) are remarkably robust because they equal Qz(w) when the input impedance is available. Like Qz(w), the field-based Q(w) is independent of the choice of origin of the antenna fields and is impervious to extra lengths of transmission lines and surplus reactances. These robust field-based quality factors are used to derive new lower bounds on the quality factors (upper bounds on the bandwidths) of spherical-mode antennas that improve upon the previous Chu/CR (Collin-Rothschild) lower bounds for spherical modes. A criterion for antenna supergain is found by combining the Harrington maximum gain formula with the recently derived formula for the reactive power boundaries of antennas. Maximum gain versus minimum quality factor for spherical antennas are determined using the improved lower bounds on quality factor for different values of electrical size ka. Lastly, reduced antenna quality factors allowed by dispersive tuning overcome the traditional Chu/CR lower bounds for lower radiation efficiencies and small enough bandwidth power drops.</description>

      <title>Hagen-Poiseuille Flow Linear Stability Paradox Resolving and Viscous Dissipative Mechanism of the Turbulence Emergence in the Boundary Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1097</link>
      <description>arXiv:1007.1097v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the linear theory of hydrodynamic stability up to now there exist examples of flows for which there is full quantitative distinction, as for cylindrical Hagen-Poiseuille (HP) flow in a pipe with round section, between theory conclusions and experimental data on the threshold Reynolds number Reth. In the present work, we show that to get a conclusion of linear instability of the HP flow for finite Reynolds numbers Re, it is necessary to abandon the use of traditional 'normal' form of disturbances which assumes an opportunity of separation of variables describing disturbances variability depending on radial and longitudinal (along the pipe axis) coordinates. In the result of the absence of such variables separation, in the suggested linear theory, it is proposed to use Bubnov-Galerkin's approximation method modification that gives an opportunity to account longitudinal variability periods distinctions for different radial modes defined a priori in the result of standard Galerkin-Cantorovich's method to the equation of evolution of extremely small axially symmetric velocity field tangential component disturbances. We found that when considering even two linearly interacting radial modes for the HP flow, linear instability is possible only when there exists mentioned above conditionally periodic longitudinal along the pipe axis disturbance variability when Re_th(p) very sensitively depends on the ratio p of two longitudinal periods each of which describes longitudinal variability for its own radial mode only. Obtained for the HP flow linear instability realization minimal value Re_th=448 (when p=1.527) quantitatively agrees with the Tolmin-Shlihting waves in the boundary layer emergence, where also Re_th=420. We get quantitative agreeing of the phase velocity values of the considered disturbances with experimental data on the fronts of the turbulent 'puffs' spreading in the pipe.</description>
