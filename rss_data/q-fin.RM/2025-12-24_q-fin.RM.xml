      <title>How to choose my stochastic volatility parameters? A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the existing literature, this article presents the different ways of choosing the parameters of stochastic volatility models in general, in the context of pricing financial derivative contracts. This includes the use of stochastic volatility inside stochastic local volatility models.</description>

      <title>Pricing of wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum on-chain options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper measures price differences between Hegic option quotes on Arbitrum and a model-based benchmark built on Black--Scholes model with regime-sensitive volatility estimated via a two-regime MS-AR-(GJR)-GARCH model. Using option-level feasible GLS, we find benchmark prices exceed Hegic quotes on average, especially for call options. The price spread rises with order size, strike, maturity, and estimated volatility, and falls with trading volume. By underlying, wrapped Bitcoin options show larger and more persistent spreads, while Ethereum options are closer to the benchmark. The framework offers a data-driven analysis for monitoring and calibrating on-chain option pricing logic.</description>

      <title>Switching between states and the COVID-19 turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Aarab (2020), I examine U.S. stock return predictability across economic regimes and document evidence of time-varying expected returns across market states in the long run. The analysis introduces a state-switching specification in which the market state is proxied by the slope of the yield curve, and proposes an Aligned Economic Index built from the popular predictors of Welch and Goyal (2008) (augmented with bond and equity premium measures). The Aligned Economic Index under the state-switching model exhibits statistically and economically meaningful in-sample ($R^2 = 5.9\%$) and out-of-sample ($R^2_{\text{oos}} = 4.12\%$) predictive power across both recessions and expansions, while outperforming a range of widely used predictors. In this work, I examine the added value for professional practitioners by computing the economic gains for a mean-variance investor and find substantial added benefit of using the new index under the state switching model across all market states. The Aligned Economic Index can thus be implemented on a consistent real-time basis. These findings are crucial for both academics and practitioners as expansions are much longer-lived than recessions. Finally, I extend the empirical exercises by incorporating data through September 2020 and document sizable gains from using the Aligned Economic Index, relative to more traditional approaches, during the COVID-19 market turbulence.</description>

      <title>Modeling Bank Systemic Risk of Emerging Markets under Geopolitical Shocks: Empirical Evidence from BRICS Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing economic influence of the BRICS nations requires risk models that capture complex, long-term dynamics. This paper introduces the Bank Risk Interlinkage with Dynamic Graph and Event Simulations (BRIDGES) framework, which analyzes systemic risk based on the level of information complexity (zero-order, first-order, and second-order). BRIDGES utilizes the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance to construct a dynamic network for 551 BRICS banks based on their strategic similarity, using zero-order information such as annual balance sheet data from 2008 to 2024. It then employs first-order information, including trends in risk ratios, to detect shifts in banks' behavior. A Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), as the core of BRIDGES, is deployed to learn network evolutions and detect second-order information, such as anomalous changes in the structural relationships of the bank network. To measure the impact of anomalous changes on network stability, BRIDGES performs Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulations to assess the banking system's resilience to internal financial failure and external geopolitical shocks at the individual country level and across BRICS nations. Simulation results show that the failure of the largest institutions causes more systemic damage than the failure of the financially vulnerable or dynamically anomalous ones, driven by powerful panic effects. Compared to this "too big to fail" scenario, a geopolitical shock with correlated country-wide propagation causes more destructive systemic damage, leading to a near-total systemic collapse. It suggests that the primary threats to BRICS financial stability are second-order panic and large-scale geopolitical shocks, which traditional risk analysis models might not detect.</description>

      <title>Robust Bernoulli Mixture Models for Credit Portfolio Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents comparison results and establishes risk bounds for credit portfolios within classes of Bernoulli mixture models, assuming conditionally independent defaults that are stochastically increasing with a common risk factor. We provide simple and interpretable conditions for conditional default probabilities that imply a comparison of credit portfolio losses in convex order. In the case of threshold models, the ranking of portfolio losses is based on a pointwise comparison of the underlying copulas. Our setting includes as special case the well-known Gaussian copula model but allows for general tail dependencies, which are crucial for modeling credit portfolio risks. Moreover, our results extend the classical parameterized models, such as the industry models CreditMetrics and KMV Portfolio Manager, to a robust setting where individual parameters or the copula modeling the dependence structure can be ambiguous. A simulation study and a real data example under model uncertainty offer evidence supporting the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Cash Flow Underwriting with Bank Transaction Data: Advancing MSME Financial Inclusion in Malaysia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite accounting for 96.1% of all businesses in Malaysia, access to financing remains one of the most persistent challenges faced by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Newly established businesses are often excluded from formal credit markets as traditional underwriting approaches rely heavily on credit bureau data. This study investigates the potential of bank statement data as an alternative data source for credit assessment to promote financial inclusion in emerging markets. First, we propose a cash flow-based underwriting pipeline where we utilise bank statement data for end-to-end data extraction and machine learning credit scoring. Second, we introduce a novel dataset of 611 loan applicants from a Malaysian lending institution. Third, we develop and evaluate credit scoring models based on application information and bank transaction-derived features. Empirical results show that the use of such data boosts the performance of all models on our dataset, which can improve credit scoring for new-to-lending MSMEs. Finally, we will release the anonymised bank transaction dataset to facilitate further research on MSME financial inclusion within Malaysia's emerging economy.</description>
