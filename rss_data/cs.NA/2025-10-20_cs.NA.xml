      <title>Is simplicity still possible for a more accurate approximation to the perimeter of the ellipse? or, Using the exponential function to further improve the second Ramanujan's approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perimeter of an ellipse has no exact closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions, and numerous approximations have been proposed since the eighteenth century. Classical formulas by Fagnano, Euler, and Ramanujan, as well as modern refinements such as Cantrell and Koshy methods, aim to reduce the approximation error while maintaining computational simplicity. In this paper, we introduce a new closed-form expression that enhances Ramanujan second formula by dividing it by 1 minus a binomial of two exponential terms resulting in a very stable approximation in a range of b/a between 1 and 1/10000, or even up to a smaller ratio. The resulting approximation remains compact, requiring only four constants, and achieving a remarkable tradeoff between simplicity and accuracy. Across the full eccentricity range of b/a in [0.0001,1], our method attains a maximum relative error of approximately 0.57 ppm with respect to the exact perimeter computed via elliptic integral. Our formula is quasi-exact at the extremes, for the circle b/a=1 and for the degenerate flat ellipse b/a=0. Compared with Cantrell approximation, the proposed method reduces the maximum relative error by a factor of 25 while preserving a short and elegant expression. This makes it one of the simplest yet most accurate closed-form and single-line approximations to the ellipse perimeter currently available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Iterative solvers for partial differential equations with dissipative structure: Operator preconditioning and optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the iterative solution of large-scale problems subject to non-symmetric matrices or operators arising in discretizations of (port-)Hamiltonian partial differential equations. We consider problems governed by an operator $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{H}+\mathcal{S}$ with symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$ that is positive (semi-)definite and skew-symmetric part $\mathcal{S}$. Prior work has shown that the structure and sparsity of the associated linear system enables Krylov subspace solvers such as the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) or short recurrence variants such as Widlund's or Rapoport's method using the symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$, or an approximation of it, as preconditioner. In this work, we analyze the resulting condition numbers, which are crucial for fast convergence of these methods, for various partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in diffusion phenomena, fluid dynamics, and elasticity. We show that preconditioning with the symmetric part leads to a condition number uniform in the mesh size in case of elliptic and parabolic PDEs where $\mathcal{H}^{-1}\mathcal{S}$ is a bounded operator. Further, we employ the tailored Krylov subspace methods in optimal control by means of a condensing approach and a constraint preconditioner for the optimality system. We illustrate the results by various large-scale numerical examples and discuss efficient evaluations of the preconditioner, such as incomplete Cholesky factorization or the algebraic multigrid method.</description>

      <title>Applications of optimal error bounds for some generalized two-step iterative processes in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper~\cite{paper2}, we proposed the concept of optimal error bounds for an iterative process, which allows us to obtain the convergence result of the iterative sequence to the common fixed point of the nonexpansive mappings in Banach spaces. Moreover, we also achieve the comparison results between different iterative processes via optimal error bounds. In this paper, we continue to determine optimal error bounds for more general iterative processes which were studied by many authors, such as in~\cite{DungHieu} and references therein. From there, the convergence results are obtained and the convergence rates of these iterative processes are determined under some sufficient conditions on sequences of parameters.</description>

      <title>Parameter-related strong convergence rate and polynomial stability of a Euler's type method for time-changed stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Euler's type method with the equidistant step size is proposed for a class of time-changed stochastic differential equations driven by the multiplicative noise and the strong convergence rate that is related to the parameter of the time changing process is obtained. Such a observation of the convergence rate is significantly different from those existing results that employ methods with the random step size. The polynomial stability in the mean square sense of the numerical method is also studied, which is in line with the asymptotic behavior of the underlying equation.</description>

      <title>A multilayer level-set method for eikonal-based traveltime tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel multilayer level-set method (MLSM) for eikonal-based first-arrival traveltime tomography. Unlike classical level-set approaches that rely solely on the zero-level set, the MLSM represents multiple phases through a sequence of $i_n$-level sets ($n = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$). Near each $i_n$-level set, the function is designed to behave like a local signed-distance function, enabling a single level-set formulation to capture arbitrarily many interfaces and subregions. Within this Eulerian framework, first-arrival traveltimes are computed as viscosity solutions of the eikonal equation, and Fr\'{e}chet derivatives of the misfit are obtained via the adjoint state method. To stabilize the inversion, we incorporate several regularization strategies, including multilayer reinitialization, arc-length penalization, and Sobolev smoothing of model parameters. In addition, we introduce an illumination-based error measure to assess reconstruction quality. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed MLSM efficiently recovers complex discontinuous slowness models with multiple phases and interfaces.</description>

      <title>Determining the space dependent coefficients in space-time fractional diffusion equations via Krylov preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a time-space fractional diffusion equation with a variable coefficient and investigate the inverse problem of reconstructing the source term, after regularizing the problem with the quasiboundary value method to mitigate the ill-posedness. The equation involves a Caputo fractional derivative in the space variable and a tempered fractional derivative in the time variable, both of order in (0, 1). A finite difference approximation leads to a two-by-two block linear system of large dimensions. We conduct a spectral analysis of the associated matrix sequences, employing tools from Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) theory, and construct the preconditioner guided by the GLT analysis. Numerical experiments are reported and commented, followed by concluding remarks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-stabilization-based linear schemes for the Allen-Cahn equation with degenerate mobility: MBP and energy stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate linear first- and second-order numerical schemes for the Allen--Cahn equation with a general (possibly degenerate) mobility. Compared with existing numerical methods, our schemes employ a novel dynamic stabilization approach that guarantees unconditional preservation of the maximum bound principle (MBP) and energy stability. A key advance is that the discrete energy stability remains valid even in the presence of degenerate mobility-a property we refer to as mobility robustness. Rigorous maximum-norm error estimates are also established. In particular, for the second-order scheme, we introduce a new prediction strategy with a cut-off preprocessing procedure on the extrapolation solution, and only one linear system needs to be solved per time level. Representative numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings and performance of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Improving performance estimation of a PCM-integrated solar chimney through reduced-order based data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates a data assimilation framework based on reduced-order modeling (ROM-DA), complemented by a hybrid data-filling strategy, to reconstruct dynamic temperature fields in a phase-change-material (PCM) integrated solar chimney from limited temperature measurements. The goal is to enhance the estimation accuracy of the outlet airflow velocity. A regularized least-squares formulation is employed to estimate temperature distributions within an inclined solar chimney using RT-42 as the PCM. The methodology combines (i) a reduced-order model derived from high-fidelity finite-volume simulations of unsteady conjugate heat transfer with liquid-solid phase change and surface radiation, and (ii) three experimental datasets with 22, 135, and 203 measurement points. Missing data are reconstructed using a hybrid filling scheme based on boundary-layer and bicubic interpolations. The assimilated temperature fields are integrated into the thermally coupled forward solver to improve velocity predictions. Results show that the ROM-DA framework reconstructs the transient temperature fields in both the air and PCM domains with relative errors below 10 percent for sparse data and below 3 percent for expanded datasets. When applied to experimental measurements, the approach enhances the fidelity of temperature and velocity fields compared with the baseline model, reducing the outlet velocity RMS error by 20 percent. This represents the first application of a ROM-DA framework to a coupled multiphysics solar chimney with PCM integration, demonstrating its potential for near-real-time thermal state estimation and digital-twin development.</description>

      <title>Computing functions of $A^{-1}B$ where $A$ and $B$ are Hermitian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the numerical evaluation of the quantity $Af(A^{-1}B)$, where $A$ is Hermitian positive definite, $B$ is Hermitian, and $f$ is a function defined on the spectrum of $A^{-1}B$. We study the conditioning of the problem, and we introduce several algorithms that combine the Schur decomposition with either the matrix square root or the Cholesky factorization. We study the numerical behavior of these algorithms in floating-point arithmetic, assess their computational costs, and compare their numerical performance. Our analysis suggests that the algorithms based on the Cholesky factorization will be more accurate and efficient than those based on the matrix square root. This is confirmed by our numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>High-order temporal parametric finite element methods for simulating solid-state dewetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a class of temporally high-order parametric finite element methods for simulating solid-state dewetting of thin films in two dimensions using a sharp-interface model. The process is governed by surface diffusion and contact point migration, along with appropriate boundary conditions. By incorporating the predictor-corrector strategy and the backward differentiation formula for time discretization into the energy-stable parametric finite element method developed by Zhao et al. (2021), we successfully construct temporally high-order schemes. The resulting numerical scheme is semi-implicit, requiring the solution of a linear system at each time step. The well-posedness of the fully discretized system is established. Moreover, the method maintains the long-term mesh equidistribution property. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve the desired temporal accuracy, measured by the manifold distance, while maintaining good mesh quality throughout the evolution.</description>

      <title>A linear unconditionally structure-preserving L1 scheme for the time-fractional Allen-Cahn equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a variational phase-field model, the time-fractional Allen-Cahn (TFAC) equation enjoys the maximum bound principle (MBP) and a variational energy dissipation law. In this work, we develop and analyze linear, structure-preserving time-stepping schemes for TFAC, including first-order and $\min\{1+\alpha, 2-\alpha\}$-order L1 discretizations, together with fast implementations based on the sum-of-exponentials (SOE) technique. A central feature of the proposed linear schemes is their unconditional preservation of both the discrete MBP and the variational energy dissipation law on general temporal meshes, including graded meshes commonly used for these problems. Leveraging the MBP of the numerical solutions, we establish sharp error estimates by employing the time-fractional Gro\"nwall inequality. Finally, numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes with an adaptive time-stepping strategy.</description>

      <title>Accelerated implicitization: Robust fixed-point iterations arising from an explicit scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a general strategy for solving possibly nonlinear problems arising from implicit time discretizations as a sequence of explicit solutions. The resulting sequence may exhibit instabilities similar to those of the base explicit scheme, which can be mitigated through Anderson acceleration. The approach uses explicit fixed-point subiterations for nonlinear problems, combined with Anderson acceleration to improve convergence and computational efficiency. Its usability and scalability are verified on three nonlinear differential equations. An error analysis is presented to establish the expected properties of the proposed strategy for both time and space-time formulations. Several examples illustrate the simplicity of the implementation and reveal the influence of parameter choices. The method proves simple to implement and performs well across a range of problems, particularly when matrix assembly is expensive or a good preconditioner for the implicit system is unavailable, such as in highly convective fluid flows. This work formalizes the delay of implicit terms in time discretization, provides a concise error analysis, and enhances the approach using Anderson acceleration. The results are encouraging and well supported by existing theory, laying the groundwork for further research.</description>

      <title>Strong error analysis and first-order convergence of Milstein-type schemes for McKean-Vlasov SDEs with superlinear coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDEs), numerical approximation plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of interacting particle systems (IPS). Classical Milstein schemes provide strong convergence of order one under globally Lipschitz coefficients. Nevertheless, many MV-SDEs arising from applications possess super-linearly growing drift and diffusion terms, where classical methods may diverge and particle corruption can occur. In the present work, we aim to fill this gap by developing a unified class of Milstein-type discretizations handling both super-linear drift and diffusion coefficients. The proposed framework includes the tamed-, tanh-, and sine-Milstein methods as special cases and establishes order-one strong convergence for the associated interacting particle system under mild regularity assumptions, requiring only once differentiable coefficients. In particular, our results complement Chen et al. (Electron. J. Probab., 2025), where a taming-based Euler scheme was only tested numerically without theoretical guarantees, by providing a rigorous convergence theory within a broader Milstein-type framework. The analysis relies on discrete-time arguments and binomial-type expansions, avoiding the continuous-time It\^o approach that is standard in the literature. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the convergence behavior and support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Sparse variational regularization with oversmoothing penalty term in the scale of sequence spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a class of linear ill-posed problems with operators that map from the sequence space $ \ell_r $ ($r \ge 1$) into a Banach space and in addition satisfy a conditional stability estimate in the scale of sequence spaces $ \ell_q, \, q \ge 0 $. For the regularization of such problems in the presence of deterministic noise, we consider variational regularization with a penalty functional either of the form $ \mathcal{R} =\Vert \cdot \Vert_p^p $ for some $ p &gt; 0 $ or in form of the counting measure $\mathcal{R}_0 = \Vert \cdot \Vert_0 $. The latter case guarantees sparsity of the corresponding regularized solutions. In this framework, we present first stability and then convergence rates for suitable a priori parameter choices. The results cover the oversmoothing situation, where the desired solution does not belong to the domain of definition of the considered penalty functional. The analysis of the oversmoothing case utilizes auxiliary elements that are defined by means of hard thresholding. Such technique can also be used for post processing to guarantee sparsity.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally Stable, Variable Step DLN Methods for the Allen-Cahn Active Fluid Model: A Divergence-free Preserving Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the divergence-free mixed finite element method (FEM) for nonlinear fourth-order Allen-Cahn phase field coupled active fluid equations. By introducing an auxiliary variable $w = \Delta u$, the original fourth-order problem is converted into a system of second-order equations, thereby easing the regularity constraints imposed on standard $H^2$-comforming finite element spaces. To further refine the formulation, an additional auxiliary variable $\xi$, analogous to the pressure, is introduced, resulting in a mixed finite element scheme that preserves the divergence-free condition in $which = \Delta u$ inherited from the model. A fully discrete scheme is then established by combining the spatial approximation by the divergence-free mixed finite element method with the variable-step Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) time integrator. The boundedness of the scheme is rigorously derived under suitable regularity assumptions. Additionally, an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on the minimum dissipation criterion is carried out to enhance computational efficiency. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the method's effectiveness and accuracy in simulating complex active fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>HOQRI: Higher-order QR Iteration for Low Multilinear Rank Approximation of Large and Sparse Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new algorithm called higher-order QR iteration (HOQRI) for computing low multilinear rank approximation (LMLRA), also known as the Tucker decomposition, of large and sparse tensors. Compared to the celebrated higher-order orthogonal iterations (HOOI), HOQRI relies on a simple orthogonalization step in each iteration rather than a more sophisticated singular value decomposition step as in HOOI. More importantly, when dealing with extremely large and sparse data tensors, HOQRI completely eliminates the intermediate memory explosion by defining a new sparse tensor operation called TTMcTC (short for tensor times matrix chains times core). Furthermore, recognizing that the orthonormal constraints form a Cartesian product of Stiefel manifolds, we introduce the framework of manifold optimization and show that HOQRI guarantees convergence to the set of stationary points. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data showcase the effectiveness of HOQRI.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends our recent results on multi-dimensional discrete-velocity models to the numerical level. By adopting an operator splitting scheme and introducing a suitable discrete Lyapunov function, we derive numerical control laws that ensure the corresponding numerical solutions decay exponentially in time. To handle the stiff source term, we also use an implicit scheme for the collision part and prove the stability of the resulting schemes. The theoretical results are validated through three numerical simulations for the two-dimensional coplanar model.</description>

      <title>Optimal error estimates of the diffuse domain method for semilinear parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly discuss the convergence behavior of diffuse domain method (DDM) for solving semilinear parabolic equations with Neumann boundary condition defined in general irregular domains. We use a phasefield function to approximate the irregular domain and when the interface thickness tends to zero, the phasefield function will converge to indicator function of the original domain. With this function, we can modify the problem to another one defined on a larger rectangular domain that contains the targer physical domain. Based on the weighted Sobolev spaces, we prove that when the interface thickness parameter goes to zero, the numerical solution will converge to the exact solution. Also, we derive the corresponding optimal error estimates under the weighted L2 and H1 norms. Some numerical experiments are also carried out to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Review of Equation-Based and Data-Driven Reduced Order Models featuring a Hybrid cardiovascular application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death in the world, driving the development of patient-specific and benchmark models for blood flow analysis. This chapter provides a theoretical overview of the main categories of Reduced Order Models (ROMs), focusing on both projection-based and data-driven approaches within a classical setup. We then present a hybrid ROM tailored for simulating blood flow in a patient-specific aortic geometry. The proposed methodology integrates projection-based techniques with neural network-enhanced data-driven components, incorporating a lifting function strategy to enforce physiologically realistic outflow pressure conditions. This hybrid methodology enables a substantial reduction in computational cost while mantaining high fidelity in reconstructing both velocity and pressure fields. We compare the full- and reduced-order solutions in details and critically assess the advantages and limitations of ROMs in patient-specific cardiovascular modeling.</description>

      <title>ParaSLRF: A High Performance Rational Filter Method for Solving Large Scale Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \emph{Wang et al., A Shifted Laplace Rational Filter for Large-Scale Eigenvalue Problems}, the SLRF method was proposed to compute all eigenvalues of a symmetric definite generalized eigenvalue problem lying in an interval on the real positive axis. The current paper discusses a parallel implementation of this method, abbreviated as ParaSLRF. The parallelization consists of two levels: (1) on the highest level, the application of the rational filter to the various vectors is partitioned among groups of processors; (2) within each group, every linear system is solved in parallel.
  In ParaSLRF, the linear systems are solved by iterative methods instead of direct ones, in contrast to other rational filter methods, such as, PFEAST. Because of the specific selection of poles in ParaSLRF, the computational cost of solving the associated linear systems for each pole, is almost the same. This intrinsically leads to a better load balance between each group of resources, and reduces waiting times of processes.
  We show numerical experiments from finite element models of mechanical vibrations, and show a detailed parallel performance analysis. ParaSLRF shows the best parallel efficiency, compared to other rational filter methods based on quadrature rules for contour integration. To further improve performance, the converged eigenpairs are locked, and a good initial guess of iterative linear solver is proposed. These enhancements of ParaSLRF show good two-level strong scalability and excellent load balance in our experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a finite volume approximation scheme is used to solve a non-local macroscopic material flow model in two space dimensions, accounting for the presence of boundaries in the non-local terms. Based on a previous result for the scalar case, we extend the setting to a system of heterogeneous material on bounded domains. We prove the convergence of the approximate solutions constructed using the Roe scheme with dimensiona splitting, where the major challenge lies in the treatment of the discontinuity occurring in the flux function. Numerical tests show a good agreement with microscopic simulations.</description>

      <title>A general framework for Krylov ODE residuals with applications to randomized Krylov methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized Krylov subspace methods that employ the sketch-and-solve paradigm to substantially reduce orthogonalization cost have recently shown great promise in speeding up computations for many core linear algebra tasks (e.g., solving linear systems, eigenvalue problems and matrix equations, as well as approximating the action of matrix functions on vectors) whenever a nonsymmetric matrix is involved. An important application that requires approximating the action of matrix functions on vectors is the implementation of exponential integration schemes for ordinary differential equations. In this paper, we specifically analyze randomized Krylov methods from this point of view. In particular, we use the residual of the underlying differential equation to derive a new, reliable a posteriori error estimate that can be used to monitor convergence and decide when to stop the iteration. To do so, we first develop a very general framework for Krylov ODE residuals that unifies existing results, simplifies their derivation and allows extending the concept to a wide variety of methods beyond randomized Arnoldi (e.g., rational Krylov methods, Krylov methods using a non-standard inner product, ...). In addition, we discuss certain aspects regarding the efficient implementation of sketched Krylov methods. Numerical experiments on large-scale ODE models from real-world applications illustrate the quality of the error estimate as well as the general competitiveness of sketched Krylov methods for ODEs in comparison to other Krylov-based methods.</description>

      <title>Numerical Error Analysis of the Poisson Equation under RHS Inaccuracies in Particle-in-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations rely on accurate solutions of the electrostatic Poisson equation, yet accuracy often deteriorates near irregular Dirichlet boundaries on Cartesian meshes. While much research has addressed discretization errors on the left-hand side (LHS) of the Poisson equation, the impact of right-hand-side (RHS) inaccuracies - arising from charge density sampling near boundaries in PIC methods - remains largely unexplored. This study analyzes the numerical errors induced by underestimated RHS values at near-boundary nodes when solving the Poisson equation using embedded boundary finite difference schemes with linear and quadratic treatments. Analytical derivations in one dimension and truncation error analyses in two dimensions reveal that such RHS inaccuracies modify local truncation behavior differently: they reduce the dominant truncation error in the linear scheme but introduce a zeroth-order term in the quadratic scheme, leading to larger global errors. Numerical experiments in one-, two-, and three-dimensional domains confirm these findings. Contrary to expectations, the linear scheme yields superior overall accuracy under typical PIC-induced RHS inaccuracies. A simple RHS calibration strategy is further proposed to restore the accuracy of the quadratic scheme. These results offer new insight into the interplay between boundary-induced RHS errors and discretization accuracy in Poisson-type problems.</description>

      <title>PDE-Free Mass-Constrained Learning of Complex Systems with Hidden States: The crowd dynamics case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning framework for modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose behavior can, in principle, be described by PDEs but lack explicit models. The method extends the Equation-Free approach, enabling the data-driven reconstruction of reduced-order models (ROMs) without needing to identify governing equations. Using manifold learning, we obtain a latent space representation of system evolution from data via delayed coordinates, in accordance with Takens/Whitney's embedding theorems. Linear (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, POD) and nonlinear (Diffusion Maps, DMs) methods are employed to extract low-dimensional embeddings that capture the essential dynamics. Predictive ROMs are then learned within this latent space, and their evolution is lifted back to the original high-dimensional space by solving a pre-image problem. We show that both POD and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) lifting operators preserve mass, a key physical constraint in systems such as computational fluid dynamics and crowd dynamics. Our framework effectively reconstructs the solution operator of the underlying PDE without discovering the PDE itself, by leveraging a manifold-informed objective map that bridges multiple scales. For our illustrations, we use synthetic spatio-temporal data from the Hughes model, which couples a continuity PDE with an Eikonal equation describing optimal path selection in crowds. Results show that DM-based nonlinear embeddings outperform POD in reconstruction accuracy, producing more parsimonious and stable ROMs that remain accurate and integrable over long time horizons.</description>

      <title>A decoupled meshless Nystr\"om scheme for 2D Fredholm integral equations of the second kind with smooth kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nystr\"om method for the numerical solution of Fredholm integral equations of the second kind is generalized by decoupling the set of solution nodes from the set of quadrature nodes. The accuracy and efficiency of the new method is investigated for smooth kernels and complex 2D domains using recently developed moment-free meshless quadrature formulas on scattered nodes. Compared to the classical Nystr\"om method, our variant has a clear performance advantage, especially for narrow kernels. The decoupled Nystr\"om method requires the choice of a reconstruction scheme to approximate values at quadrature nodes from values at solution nodes. We prove that, under natural assumptions, the overall order of convergence is the minimum between that of the quadrature scheme and of the reconstruction scheme.</description>

      <title>Efficient Tensor Completion Algorithms for Highly Oscillatory Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents low-complexity tensor completion algorithms and their efficient implementation to reconstruct highly oscillatory operators discretized as $n\times n$ matrices. The underlying tensor decomposition is based on the reshaping of the input matrix and its butterfly decomposition into an order $\mathcal{O} (\log n)$ tensor. The reshaping of the input matrix into a tensor allows for representation of the butterfly decomposition as a tensor decomposition with dense tensors. This leads to efficient utilization of the existing software infrastructure for dense and sparse tensor computations. We propose two tensor completion algorithms in the butterfly format, using alternating least squares and gradient-based optimization, as well as a novel strategy that uses low-rank matrix completion to efficiently generate an initial guess for the proposed algorithms. To demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of our proposed algorithms, we perform three numerical experiments using simulated oscillatory operators in seismic applications. In these experiments, we use $\mathcal {O} (n \log n)$ observed entries in the input matrix and demonstrate an $\mathcal{O}(n\log^3 n)$ computational cost of the proposed algorithms, leading to a speedup of orders of magnitudes per iteration for large matrices compared to the low-rank matrix and quantized tensor-train completion. Moreover, the proposed butterfly completion algorithms, equipped with the novel initial guess generation strategy, achieve reconstruction errors that are smaller by an order of magnitude, enabling accurate recovery of the underlying structure compared to the state-of-the-art completion algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I propose a vertex patch smoother where local problems are solved inexactly by a nested, matrix-free p-multigrid, creating a multigrid-within-multigrid framework. A single iteration of the local solver can be evaluated with $\mathcal{O}(p^{d+1})$ operations, and the approach is applicable to non-separable problems on unstructured meshes. Numerical experiments demonstrate limited sensitivity to geometric distortion and high-contrast coefficients. When used in a global geometric multigrid solver, the method achieves robustness with respect to both polynomial degree $p$ and mesh refinement, even on heavily distorted meshes.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Constitutive Model Discovery from Sparse and Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, unsupervised constitutive model discovery has gained attention through frameworks based on the Virtual Fields Method (VFM), most prominently the EUCLID approach. However, the performance of VFM-based approaches, including EUCLID, is affected by measurement noise and data sparsity, which are unavoidable in practice. The statistical finite element method (statFEM) offers a complementary perspective by providing a Bayesian framework for assimilating noisy and sparse measurements to reconstruct the full-field displacement response, together with quantified uncertainty. While statFEM recovers displacement fields under uncertainty, it does not strictly enforce consistency with constitutive relations or aim to yield interpretable constitutive models. In this work, we couple statFEM with unsupervised constitutive model discovery in the EUCLID framework, yielding statFEM--EUCLID. The framework is demonstrated for isotropic hyperelastic materials. The results show that this integration reduces sensitivity to noise and data sparsity, while ensuring that the reconstructed fields remain consistent with both equilibrium and constitutive laws.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically well-balanced geostrophic reconstruction finite volumes numerical schemes for the 2D rotating NLSWE in spherical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of large-scale geophysical fluids is primarily governed by the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient.
  This phenomenon, known as geostrophic equilibrium, is the basis for the geostrophic model, which has proven to be extremely useful for understanding and forecasting large-scale atmospheric and oceanic dynamics.
  In the present work, we develop second- and third-order finite-volume numerical schemes applied to the 2D rotating shallow-water equations in spherical coordinates. These schemes are designed to preserve the geostrophic equilibrium in the limit as the Rossby number tends to zero.
  The final goal is to design reliable and efficient forecasting models for simulating meteotsunamis, long-wave events generated in the ocean by atmospheric pressure disturbances. These disturbances produce long waves of small amplitude that gradually amplify as they approach the coast.
  The numerical results for various analytical and real-world test cases underscore the importance of maintaining geostrophic equilibrium over time.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Optimal Control for Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of multi-agent systems to solve classical image processing tasks, such as colour quantization and segmentation. We frame the task as an optimal control problem, where the objective is to steer the multi-agent dynamics to obtain colour clusters that segment the image. To do so, we balance the total variation of the colour field and fidelity to the original image. The solution is obtained resorting to primal-dual splitting and the method of multipliers. Numerical experiments, implemented in parallel with CUDA, demonstrate the efficacy of the approach and its potential for high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient and Memory-Aware Parallel Bootstrapping using MPI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bootstrapping is a powerful statistical resampling technique for estimating the sampling distribution of an estimator. However, its computational cost becomes prohibitive for large datasets or a high number of resamples. This paper presents a theoretical analysis and design of parallel bootstrapping algorithms using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We address two key challenges: high communication overhead and memory constraints in distributed environments. We propose two novel strategies: 1) Local Statistic Aggregation, which drastically reduces communication by transmitting sufficient statistics instead of full resampled datasets, and 2) Synchronized Pseudo-Random Number Generation, which enables distributed resampling when the entire dataset cannot be stored on a single process. We develop analytical models for communication and computation complexity, comparing our methods against naive baseline approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed methods offer significant reductions in communication volume and memory usage, facilitating scalable parallel bootstrapping on large-scale systems.</description>

      <title>Practicalities of State-Dependent and Threshold Delay Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delays are ubiquitous in applied problems, but often do not arise as the simple constant discrete delays that analysts and numerical analysts like to treat. In this chapter we show how state-dependent delays arise naturally when modeling and the consequences that follow. We treat discrete state-dependent delays, and delays implicitly defined by threshold conditions. We will consider modeling, formulation as dynamical systems, linearization, and numerical techniques. For discrete state-dependent delays we show how breaking points can be tracked efficiently to preserve the order of numerical methods for simulating solutions. For threshold conditions we will discuss how a velocity ratio term arises in models, and present a heuristic linearization method that avoids Banach spaces and sun-star calculus, making the method accessible to a wider audience. We will also discuss numerical implementations of threshold and distributed delay problems which allows them to be treated numerically with standard software.</description>

      <title>Fluid-structure interaction analysis with interface control principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An interface control principle is proposed for unsteady fluid-structure in- teraction (FSI) analyses. This principle introduces a method of explicitly controlling the interface motion in the temporal direction to minimize the residual force on the interface, which is defined as the discrepancy between the fluid and structural forces. The interface model is constructed using a data-driven approach that involves sparse identification of nonlinear dy- namics with control to evaluate the residual force. The interface model is subsequently subjected to control theory in order to minimize the residual force. Following the convergence of the residual force, the interface state is controlled to be that of the original unsteady FSI system. The fluid and structural simulations can be conducted independently without communication, as the interface state information is predetermined as inputs for each system. The proposed method is applied to the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a cylinder at a Reynolds number of 150 under several reduced velocity conditions corresponding to the lock-in regime with limit-cycle oscillations. The results demonstrate that the residual force is sufficiently minimized in time, and when the residual force is close to zero, the predicted fluid force and structural displacement of the VIV show good agreement with the reference FSI simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we solve a discrete optimal transport problem in a nonuniform environment. The key challenge is to form the cost matrix, which requires finding the optimal path between two points, and for this task we formulate and solve the associated Euler-Lagrange equations. A main theoretical result of ours is to provide verifiable sufficient conditions of optimality of the solution of the Euler-Lagrange equation. We propose new algorithms to solve the problem, and illustrate our results and performance of the algorithms on several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>An Inexact General Descent Method with Applications in Differential Equation-Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many applications, gradient evaluations are inherently approximate, motivating the development of optimization methods that remain reliable under inexact first-order information. A common strategy in this context is adaptive evaluation, whereby coarse gradients are used in early iterations and refined near a minimizer. This is particularly relevant in differential equation-constrained optimization (DECO), where discrete adjoint gradients depend on iterative solvers. Motivated by DECO applications, we propose an inexact general descent framework and establish its global convergence theory under two step-size regimes. For bounded step sizes, the analysis assumes that the error tolerance in the computed gradient is proportional to its norm, whereas for diminishing step sizes, the tolerance sequence is required to be summable. The framework is implemented through inexact gradient descent and an inexact BFGS-like method, whose performance is demonstrated on a second-order ODE inverse problem and a two-dimensional Laplace inverse problem using discrete adjoint gradients with adaptive accuracy. Across these examples, adaptive inexact gradients consistently reduced optimization time relative to fixed tight tolerances, while incorporating curvature information further improved overall efficiency.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we introduce and analyze a deep learning based approximation algorithm for SPDEs. Our approach employs neural networks to approximate the solutions of SPDEs along given realizations of the driving noise process. If applied to a set of simulated noise trajectories, it yields empirical distributions of SPDE solutions, from which functionals like the mean and variance can be estimated. We test the performance of the method on stochastic heat equations with additive and multiplicative noise as well as stochastic Black-Scholes equations with multiplicative noise and Zakai equations from nonlinear filtering theory. In all cases, the proposed algorithm yields accurate results with short runtimes in up to 100 space dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Two-level MCMC Framework to Accelerate Posterior Mean Estimation with Deep Learning Surrogates for Bayesian Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian inverse problems arise in various scientific and engineering domains, and solving them can be computationally demanding. This is especially the case for problems governed by partial differential equations, where the repeated evaluation of the forward operator is extremely expensive. Recent advances in Deep Learning (DL)-based surrogate models have shown promising potential to accelerate the solution of such problems. However, despite their ability to learn from complex data, DL-based surrogate models generally cannot match the accuracy of high-fidelity numerical models, which limits their practical applicability. We propose a novel hybrid two-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that combines the strengths of DL-based surrogate models and high-fidelity numerical solvers to {compute the posterior mean of Quantities of Interest (QoI) in} Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial differential equations. The intuition is to leverage the evaluation speed of a DL-based surrogate model as the base chain, and correct its errors using a limited number of high-fidelity numerical model evaluations in a correction chain; hence its name hybrid two-level MCMC method. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we show that our approach can achieve the same accuracy as a pure numerical MCMC method while requiring only a small fraction of the computational cost. The theoretical analysis is further supported by several numerical experiments, namely a Poisson, a non-linear reaction-diffusion, and a Navier-Stokes equation. The proposed hybrid framework can be generalized to other approaches such as the ensemble Kalman filter and sequential Monte Carlo methods.</description>

Abstract: We develop a refined Frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA) for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation in the semi-classical regime, where the solution exhibits rapid oscillations as the scaled Planck constant $\varepsilon$ becomes small. Our approach utilizes an integral representation based on asymptotic analysis, offering a highly efficient computational framework for high-frequency wave function evolution. Crucially, we introduce the momentum space representation of the FGA and a regularization parameter $\delta$ to address singularities in the higher-order derivatives of the Hamiltonian flow coefficients, which are typically assumed to be second-order differentiable or smooth in conventional analysis. We rigorously prove convergence of the method to the true solution and provide numerical experiments that demonstrate its precision and robust convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Schwarz methods with PMLs for Helmholtz problems: fast convergence at high frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss parallel (additive) and sequential (multiplicative) variants of overlapping Schwarz methods for the Helmholtz equation in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with large real wavenumber and smooth variable wave speed. The radiation condition is approximated by a Cartesian perfectly-matched layer (PML). The domain-decomposition subdomains are overlapping hyperrectangles with Cartesian PMLs at their boundaries. In a recent paper ({\tt arXiv:2404.02156}), the current authors proved (for both variants) that, after a specified number of iterations -- depending on the behaviour of the geometric-optic rays -- the error is smooth and smaller than any negative power of the wavenumber $k$. For the parallel method, the specified number of iterations is less than the maximum number of subdomains, counted with their multiplicity, that a geometric-optic ray can intersect. The theory, which is given at the continuous level and makes essential use of semi-classical analysis, assumes that the overlaps of the subdomains and the widths of the PMLs are all independent of the wavenumber. In this paper we extend the results of {\tt arXiv:2404.02156} by experimentally studying the behaviour of the methods in the practically important case when both the overlap and the PML width decrease as the wavenumber increases. We find that (at least for constant wavespeed), the methods remain robust to increasing $k$, even for miminal overlap, when the PML is one wavelength wide.</description>

      <title>Invertible ResNets for Inverse Imaging Problems: Competitive Performance with Provable Regularization Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving inverse problems, particularly in image reconstruction tasks. Despite their success, these approaches often lack theoretical guarantees, which are crucial in sensitive applications such as medical imaging. Recent works by Arndt et al addressed this gap by analyzing a data-driven reconstruction method based on invertible residual networks (iResNets). They revealed that, under reasonable assumptions, this approach constitutes a convergent regularization scheme. However, the performance of the reconstruction method was only validated on academic toy problems and small-scale iResNet architectures. In this work, we address this gap by evaluating the performance of iResNets on two real-world imaging tasks: a linear blurring operator and a nonlinear diffusion operator. To do so, we compare the performance of iResNets against state-of-the-art neural networks, revealing their competitiveness at the expense of longer training times. Moreover, we numerically demonstrate the advantages of the iResNet's inherent stability and invertibility by showcasing increased robustness across various scenarios as well as interpretability of the learned operator, thereby reducing the black-box nature of the reconstruction scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hadamard product of tensor train (TT) tensors is a fundamental nonlinear operation in scientific computing and data analysis. However, due to its tendency to significantly increase TT ranks, the Hadamard product poses a major computational challenge in TT tensor-based algorithms. To address this, it is crucial to develop recompression algorithms that mitigate the effects of this rank increase. Existing recompression algorithms require an explicit representation of the Hadamard product, resulting in high computational and storage costs. In this work, we propose a Hadamard avoiding TT recompression (HaTT) algorithm, which reduces both computational complexity and storage requirements. By leveraging the structure of the Hadamard product in TT tensors and exploiting its Hadamard product-free property, the HaTT algorithm achieves significantly lower complexity compared to existing TT recompression methods. This is confirmed through both complexity analysis and numerical experiments. Furthermore, the HaTT algorithm is applied to solve the Allen--Cahn equation, achieving substantial speedup over existing TT recompression algorithms without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on Shifted CholeskyQR (SCholeskyQR) for sparse matrices. We provide a new shifted item $s$ for Shifted CholeskyQR3 (SCholeskyQR3) based on the number of non-zero elements (nnze) and the element with the largest absolute value of the input sparse $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ with $m \ge n$. We do rounding error analysis of SCholeskyQR3 with such an $s$ and show that SCholeskyQR3 is accurate in this case. Therefore, an alternative choice of $s$ can be taken for SCholeskyQR3 with the comparison between our new $s$ and the $s$ shown in the previous work when the input $X$ is sparse, improving the applicability and residual of the algorithm for the ill-conditioned cases. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantage of SCholeskyQR3 with our alternative choice of $s$ in both applicablity and accuracy over the case with the original $s$, together with the same level of efficiency. This work is also the first to build connections between sparsity and numerical algorithms with detailed rounding error analysis to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic dynamical systems are ubiquitous in physics, biology, and engineering, where both deterministic drifts and random fluctuations govern system behavior. Learning these dynamics from data is particularly challenging in high-dimensional settings with complex, correlated, or state-dependent noise. We introduce a noise-aware system identification framework that jointly recovers the deterministic drift and full noise structure directly from the trajectory data, without requiring prior assumptions on the noise model. Our method accommodates a broad class of stochastic dynamics, including colored and multiplicative noise, that scales efficiently to high-dimensional systems, and accurately reconstructs the underlying dynamics. Numerical experiments on diverse systems validate the approach and highlight its potential for data-driven modeling in complex stochastic environments.</description>

Abstract: The Random Batch Method (RBM), proposed by Jin et al. in 2020, is an efficient algorithm for simulating interacting particle systems. The uniform-in-time error estimates of the RBM without replacement have been obtained for various interacting particle systems, while the analysis of the RBM with replacement is just considered in (Cai et al., 2024) recently for the first-order systems governed by Langevin dynamics. In this work, we present the error estimate for the RBM with replacement applied to a second-order system known as the Cucker-Smale model. By introducing a crucial auxiliary system and leveraging the intrinsic characteristics of the Cucker-Smale model, we derive an estimate that is uniform in both time and particle numbers. Additionally, we provide numerical simulations to validate the analytical results.</description>

      <title>A mesh-free hybrid Chebyshev-Tucker tensor format with applications to multi-particle modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a mesh-free two-level hybrid Tucker tensor format for approximating multivariate functions, which combines the product Chebyshev interpolation with the alternating least-squares (ALS) based Tucker decomposition of the tensor of Chebyshev coefficients. This construction allows to avoid the expensive rank-structured grid-based approximation of function-related tensors on large spatial grids, while benefiting from the Tucker decomposition of the rather small core tensor of Chebyshev coefficients. Thus, we can compute the nearly optimal Tucker decomposition of the 3D function with controllable accuracy $\varepsilon &gt;0$ without discretizing the function on the full grid in the domain, but only using its values at small set of Chebyshev nodes. Finally, we can represent the function in the algebraic Tucker format with optimal $\varepsilon$-rank on an arbitrarily large 3D tensor grid in the computational domain by discretizing the Chebyshev polynomials on that grid. The rank parameters of the Tucker-ALS decomposition of the coefficient tensor can be much smaller than the polynomial degrees of the initial Chebyshev interpolant obtained via a function independent polynomial basis set. It is shown that our techniques can be gainfully applied to the long-range part of the singular electrostatic potential of multi-particle systems approximated in the range-separated tensor format. We provide error and complexity estimates and demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed techniques on challenging examples, including the multi-particle electrostatic potential for large bio-molecular systems and lattice-type compounds.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear energy-preserving model reduction with lifting transformations that quadratize the energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing model reduction techniques for high-dimensional models of conservative partial differential equations (PDEs) encounter computational bottlenecks when dealing with systems featuring non-polynomial nonlinearities. This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</description>

      <title>Mixed-precision algorithms for solving the Sylvester matrix equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the solution of the Sylvester equation $AX+XB=C$ in mixed precision. We derive a new iterative refinement scheme to solve perturbed quasi-triangular Sylvester equations; our rounding error analysis provides sufficient conditions for convergence and a bound on the attainable relative residual. We leverage this iterative scheme to solve the general Sylvester equation. The new algorithms compute the Schur decomposition of the coefficient matrices $A$ and $B$ in lower than working precision, use the low-precision Schur factors to obtain an approximate solution to the perturbed quasi-triangular equation, and iteratively refine it to obtain a working-precision solution. In order to solve the original equation to working precision, the unitary Schur factors of the coefficient matrices must be unitary to working precision, but this is not the case if the Schur decomposition is computed in low precision. We propose two effective approaches to address this: one is based on re-orthonormalization in working precision, and the other on explicit inversion of the almost-unitary factors. The two mixed-precision algorithms thus obtained are tested on various Sylvester and Lyapunov equations from the literature. Our numerical experiments show that, for both types of equations, the new algorithms are at least as accurate as existing ones. Our cost analysis, on the other hand, suggests that they would typically be faster than mono-precision alternatives if implemented on hardware that natively supports low precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, exponential Runge-Kutta methods of collocation type (ERKC) which were originally proposed in (Appl Numer Math 53:323-339, 2005) are extended to semilinear parabolic problems with time-dependent delay. Two classes of the ERKC methods are constructed and their convergence properties are analyzed. It is shown that methods with $s$ arbitrary nonconfluent collocation parameters achieve convergence of order $s$. Provided that the collocation parameters fulfill some additional conditions and the solutions of the problems exhibit sufficient temporal and spatial smoothness, we derive superconvergence results. Finally, some numerical experiments are presented to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complexes and cohomology, traditionally central to topology, have emerged as fundamental tools across applied mathematics and the sciences. This survey explores their roles in diverse areas, from partial differential equations and continuum mechanics to reformulations of the Einstein equations and network theory. Motivated by advances in compatible and structure-preserving discretisation such as Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC), we examine how differential complexes encode critical properties such as existence, uniqueness, stability and rigidity of solutions to differential equations. We demonstrate that various fundamental concepts and models in solid and fluid mechanics are essentially formulated in terms of differential complexes.</description>

      <title>Primal-dual splitting methods for phase-field surfactant model with moving contact lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surfactants have important effects on the dynamics of droplets on solid surfaces, which has inspired many industrial applications. Phase-field surfactant model with moving contact lines (PFS-MCL) has been employed to investigate the complex droplet dynamics with surfactants, while its numerical simulation remains challenging due to the coupling of gradient flows with respect to transport distances involving nonlinear and degenerate mobilities. We propose a novel structure-preserving variational scheme for PFS-MCL model with the dynamic boundary condition based on the minimizing movement scheme and optimal transport theory for Wasserstein gradient flows. The proposed scheme consists of a series of convex minimization problems and can be efficiently solved by our proposed primal-dual splitting method and its accelerated versions. By respecting the underlying PDE's variational structure with respect to the transport distance, the proposed scheme is proved to inherits the desirable properties including original energy dissipation, bound-preserving, and mass conservation. Through a suite of numerical simulations, we validate the performance of the proposed scheme and investigate the effects of surfactants on the droplet dynamics.</description>

      <title>A deep solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18297v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants. The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments are consistent with this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, time-inconsistent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>Robust and efficient pre-processing techniques for particle-based methods including dynamic boundary generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining high-quality particle distributions for stable and accurate particle-based simulations poses significant challenges, especially for complex geometries. We introduce a preprocessing technique for 2D and 3D geometries, optimized for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and other particle-based methods. Our pipeline begins with the generation of a resolution-adaptive point cloud near the geometry's surface employing a face-based neighborhood search. This point cloud forms the basis for a signed distance field, enabling efficient, localized computations near surface regions. To create an initial particle configuration, we apply a hierarchical winding number method for fast and accurate inside-outside segmentation. Particle positions are then relaxed using an SPH-inspired scheme, which also serves to pack boundary particles. This ensures full kernel support and promotes isotropic distributions while preserving the geometry interface. By leveraging the meshless nature of particle-based methods, our approach does not require connectivity information and is thus straightforward to integrate into existing particle-based frameworks. It is robust to imperfect input geometries and memory-efficient without compromising performance. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that with increasingly higher resolution, the resulting particle distribution converges to the exact geometry.</description>

Abstract: We study the approximation complexity of high-dimensional second-order elliptic PDEs with homogeneous boundary conditions on the unit hypercube, within the framework of Barron spaces. Under the assumption that the coefficients belong to suitably defined Barron spaces, we prove that the solution can be efficiently approximated by two-layer neural networks, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Our results demonstrate the expressive power of shallow networks in capturing high-dimensional PDE solutions under appropriate structural assumptions.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally positivity-preserving explicit order-one strong approximations of financial SDEs with non-Lipschitz coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in positivity-preserving approximations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with non-Lipschitz coefficients, arising from computational finance and possessing positive solutions. By leveraging a Lamperti transformation, we develop a novel, explicit, and unconditionally positivity-preserving numerical scheme for the considered financial SDEs. More precisely, an implicit term $c_{-1}Y_{n+1}^{-1}$ is incorporated in the scheme to guarantee unconditional positivity preservation, and a corrective operator is introduced in the remaining explicit terms to address the challenges posed by non-Lipschitz (possibly singular) coefficients of the transformed SDEs. By finding a unique positive root of a quadratic equation, the proposed scheme can be explicitly solved and is shown to be strongly convergent with order $1$, when used to numerically solve several well-known financial models such as the CIR process, the Heston-3/2 volatility model, the CEV process and the A\"it-Sahalia model. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Neural Approximate Inverse Preconditioners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for constructing efficient approximate inverse preconditioners for elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning the Green's function of the underlying operator with neural networks (NNs). The training process integrates four key components: an adaptive multiscale neural architecture ($\alpha$MSNN) that captures hierarchical features across near-, middle-, and far-field regimes; the use of coarse-grid anchor data to ensure physical identifiability; a multi-$\varepsilon$ staged training protocol that progressively refines the Green's function representation across spatial scales; and an overlapping domain decomposition that enables local adaptation while maintaining global consistency. Once trained, the NN-approximated Green's function is directly compressed into either a hierarchical ($\mathcal{H}$-) matrix or a sparse matrix-using only the mesh geometry and the network output. This geometric construction achieves nearly linear complexity in both setup and application while preserving the spectral properties essential for effective preconditioning. Numerical experiments on challenging elliptic PDEs demonstrate that the resulting preconditioners consistently yield fast convergence and small iteration counts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05188v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Neural Green's Operators for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01857v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a paradigm for constructing parametric neural operators that are derived from finite-dimensional representations of Green's operators, with learnable Green's functions, for linear partial differential equations (PDEs). We refer to such neural operators as Neural Green's Operators (NGOs). Our construction of NGOs preserves the linear action of Green's operators on the inhomogeneity fields, while approximating the nonlinear dependence of the Green's function on the coefficients of the PDE using neural networks that take weighted averages of such coefficients as input. This construction reduces the complexity of the problem from learning the entire solution operator and its dependence on all parameters to only learning the Green's function and its dependence on the PDE coefficients. Moreover, taking weighted averages, rather than point samples, of input functions decouples the network size from the number of sampling points, enabling efficient resolution of multiple scales in the input fields. Furthermore, we show that our explicit representation of Green's functions enables the embedding of desirable mathematical attributes in our NGO architectures, such as symmetry, spectral, and conservation properties. Through numerical benchmarks on canonical PDEs, we demonstrate that NGOs achieve comparable or superior accuracy to deep operator networks, variationally mimetic operator networks, and Fourier neural operators with similar parameter counts, while generalizing significantly better when tested on out-of-distribution data. For time-dependent PDEs, we show that NGOs can produce pointwise-accurate dynamics in an auto-regressive manner when trained on a single time step. Finally, we show that we can leverage the explicit representation of Green's functions returned by NGOs to construct effective matrix preconditioners that accelerate iterative solvers for PDEs.</description>

      <title>A highly accurate procedure for computing globally optimal Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04369v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A standard task in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the computation of localized molecular orbitals known as Wannier functions. In this manuscript, we propose a new procedure for computing Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline materials. Our approach proceeds by first performing parallel transport of the Bloch functions using numerical integration. Then a simple analytically computable correction is introduced to yield the optimally localized Wannier function. The resulting scheme is rapidly convergent and is proven to yield real-valued Wannier functions that achieve global optimality. The analysis in this manuscript can also be viewed as a proof of the existence of exponentially localized Wannier functions in one dimension. We illustrate the performance of the scheme by a number of numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: Generalized Wasserstein distances allow to quantitatively compare two continuous or atomic mass distributions with equal or different total mass. In this paper, we propose four numerical methods for the approximation of three different generalized Wasserstein distances introduced in the last years, giving some insights about their physical meaning. After that, we explore their usage in the context of the sensitivity analysis of differential models for traffic flow. The quantification of models sensitivity is obtained by computing the generalized Wasserstein distances between two (numerical) solutions corresponding to different inputs, including different boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Using Randomized Nystr\"om Preconditioners to Accelerate Variational Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based iterative reconstruction plays a key role in solving inverse problems. However, the associated minimization problems are generally large-scale, nonsmooth, and sometimes even nonconvex, which present challenges in designing efficient iterative solvers. Preconditioning methods can significantly accelerate the convergence of iterative methods. In some applications, computing preconditioners on-the-fly is beneficial. Moreover, forward models in image reconstruction are typically represented as operators, and the corresponding explicit matrices are often unavailable, which brings additional challenges in designing preconditioners. Therefore, for practical use, computing and applying preconditioners should be computationally inexpensive. This paper adapts the randomized Nystr\"om approximation to compute effective preconditioners that accelerate image reconstruction without requiring an explicit matrix for the forward model. We leverage modern GPU computational platforms to compute the preconditioner on-the-fly. Moreover, we propose efficient approaches for applying the preconditioners to problems with classical nonsmooth regularizers, i.e., wavelet, total variation, and Hessian Schatten-norm. Our numerical results on image deblurring, super-resolution with impulsive noise, and 2D computed tomography reconstruction illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed preconditioner.</description>

      <title>Convergent Complex Quasi-Newton Proximal Methods for Gradient-Driven Denoisers in Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In compressed sensing (CS) MRI, model-based methods are pivotal to achieving accurate reconstruction. One of the main challenges in model-based methods is finding an effective prior to describe the statistical distribution of the target image. Plug-and-Play (PnP) and REgularization by Denoising (RED) are two general frameworks that use denoisers as the prior. While PnP/RED methods with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based denoisers outperform classical hand-crafted priors in CS MRI, their convergence theory relies on assumptions that do not hold for practical CNNs. The recently developed gradient-driven denoisers offer a framework that bridges the gap between practical performance and theoretical guarantees. However, the numerical solvers for the associated minimization problem remain slow for CS MRI reconstruction. This paper proposes a complex quasi-Newton proximal method that achieves faster convergence than existing approaches. To address the complex domain in CS MRI, we propose a modified Hessian estimation method that guarantees Hermitian positive definiteness. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed method for nonconvex settings. Numerical experiments on both Cartesian and non-Cartesian sampling trajectories demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>The Nondecreasing Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article the notion of the nondecreasing (ND) rank of a matrix or tensor is introduced. A tensor has an ND rank of r if it can be represented as a sum of r outer products of vectors, with each vector satisfying a monotonicity constraint. It is shown that for certain poset orderings finding an ND factorization of rank $r$ is equivalent to finding a nonnegative rank-r factorization of a transformed tensor. However, not every tensor that is monotonic has a finite ND rank. Theory is developed describing the properties of the ND rank, including typical, maximum, and border ND ranks. Highlighted also are the special settings where a matrix or tensor has an ND rank of one or two. As a means of finding low ND rank approximations to a data tensor we introduce a variant of the hierarchical alternating least squares algorithm. Low ND rank factorizations are found and interpreted for two datasets concerning the weight of pigs and a mental health survey during the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

      <title>Digital Twins: McKean-Pontryagin Control for Partially Observed Physical Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal control for fully observed diffusion processes is well established and has led to numerous numerical implementations based on, for example, Bellman's principle, model free reinforcement learning, Pontryagin's maximum principle, and model predictive control. On the contrary, much fewer algorithms are available for optimal control of partially observed processes. However, this scenario is central to the digital twin paradigm where a physical twin is partially observed and control laws are derived based on a digital twin. In this paper, we contribute to this challenge by combining data assimilation in the form of the ensemble Kalman filter with the recently proposed McKean-Pontryagin approach to stochastic optimal control. We derive forward evolving mean-field evolution equations for states and co-states which simultaneously allow for an online assimilation of data as well as an online computation of control laws. The proposed methodology is therefore perfectly suited for real time applications of digital twins. We present numerical results for a controlled Lorenz-63 system and an inverted pendulum.</description>

      <title>Market-Driven Subset Selection for Budgeted Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training large language models on massive datasets is computationally expensive, yet empirical evidence suggests that substantial portions of training examples contribute minimally to final performance. Data subset selection addresses this inefficiency by identifying small, high-utility subsets under resource constraints. However, example utility is inherently multi-faceted, encompassing uncertainty, distributional rarity, and diversity signals that are heterogeneous and typically combined through ad hoc weighted sums lacking theoretical grounding. We propose a market-based framework that treats each training example as a tradeable contract and employs the Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule to aggregate multiple utility signals into coherent prices. Heterogeneous signals act as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration versus smoothing, and topic-wise normalization ensures calibrated aggregation. Token budgets are handled explicitly through a price-per-token decision rule with an interpretable length-bias parameter. We establish theoretical connections to maximum-entropy aggregation and provide utility recovery guarantees under noisy but monotone signals. On GSM8K mathematical reasoning under strict 60k-token budgets, our selector achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while exhibiting lower variance and incurring less than 0.1 GPU-hour overhead. On AGNews classification at 5-25\% retention rates, the market formulation delivers competitive accuracy with improved stability. Our framework unifies multi-signal data curation under fixed computational budgets for prompt-level reasoning and classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Frames for Phase Retrieval from Edge Vectors of Optimal Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to characterize the optimal frame for phase retrieval, defined as the frame whose condition number for phase retrieval attains its minimal value. In the context of the two-dimensional real case, we reveal the connection between optimal frames for phase retrieval and the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem, originally proposed by Reinhardt in 1922. Our work establishes that every optimal solution to the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem inherently leads to an optimal frame in ${\mathbb R}^2$. By recasting the optimal polygons problem as one concerning the discrepancy of roots of unity, we characterize all optimal polygons. Building upon this connection, we then characterize all optimal frames with $m$ vectors in ${\mathbb R}^2$ for phase retrieval when $m \geq 3$ has an odd factor. As a key corollary, we show that the harmonic frame $E_m$ is {\em not} optimal for any even integer $m \geq 4$. This finding disproves a conjecture proposed by Xia, Xu, and Xu (Math. Comp., 94(356): 2931-2960). Previous work has established that the harmonic frame $E_m \subset {\mathbb R}^2$ is indeed optimal when $m$ is an odd integer.
  Exploring the connection between phase retrieval and discrete geometry, this paper aims to illuminate advancements in phase retrieval and offer new perspectives on the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem.</description>
