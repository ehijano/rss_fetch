      <title>Dismountability in Temporal Cliques Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A temporal graph is a graph whose edges are available only at certain points in time. It is temporally connected if the nodes can reach each other by paths that traverse the edges chronologically (temporal paths). In general, temporal graphs do not always admit small subsets of edges that preserve connectivity (temporal spanners). In the case of temporal cliques, spanners of size $O(n\log n)$ are guaranteed. The original proof by Casteigts et al. [ICALP 2019] combines a number of techniques, one of which is dismountability. In a recent work, Angrick et al. [ESA 2024] simplified the proof and showed, among other things, that a one-sided version of dismountability can be used to replace the second part of the proof.
  In this paper, we revisit the dismountability principle. We characterizing the structure that a temporal clique has if it is not 1-hop dismountable, then not {1,2}-hop dismountable, and finally not {1,2,3}-hop dismountable.
  It turns out that if a clique is k-hop dismountable for any other k, then it must also be {1,2,3}-hop dismountable. Interestingly, excluding only 1-hop and 2-hop dismountability is already sufficient for reducing the spanner problem from cliques to bi-cliques. Put together with the strategy of Angrick et al., the entire $O(n \log n)$ result can now be recovered using only dismountability. An interesting by-product of our analysis is that any minimal counter-example to the existence of $4n$ spanners must satisfy the properties of non {1,2,3}-hop dismountable cliques.
  In the second part, we discuss connections between dismountability and pivotability. We show that recursively k-hop dismountable cliques are pivotable (and thus admits $2n$ spanners, whatever k). We define a family of labelings (called full-range) which force both dismountability and pivotability and that gives some evidence that large lifetimes could be exploited more generally.</description>

      <title>Spectral Sufficient Conditions for Graph Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\{K_{1,1}, K_{1,2},C_m: m\geq3\}$-factor of a graph is a spanning subgraph whose each component is an element of $\{K_{1,1}, K_{1,2},C_m: m\geq3\}$. In this paper, through the graph spectral methods, we establish the lower bound of the signless Laplacian spectral radius and the upper bound of the distance spectral radius to determine whether a graph admits a $\{K_2\}$-factor. We get a lower bound on the size (resp. the spectral radius) of $G$ to guarantee that $G$ contains a $\{K_{1,1}, K_{1,2},C_m: m\geq3\}$-factor. Then we determine an upper bound on the distance spectral radius of $G$ to ensure that $G$ has a $\{K_{1,1}, K_{1,2},C_m: m\geq3\}$-factor. Furthermore, by constructing extremal graphs, we show that the above all bounds are best possible.</description>

      <title>Representation Number of Word-Representable Split Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A split graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. The word-representability of split graphs was studied in a series of papers in the literature, and the class of word-representable split graphs was characterized through semi-transitive orientation. Nonetheless, the representation number of this class of graphs is still not known. In general, determining the representation number of a word-representable graph is an NP-complete problem. In this work, through an algorithmic procedure, we show that the representation number of the class of word-representable split graphs is at most three. Further, we characterize the class of word-representable split graphs as well as the class of split comparability graphs which have representation number exactly three.</description>

      <title>Reductions in local certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local certification is a topic originating from distributed computing, where a prover tries to convince the vertices of a graph $G$ that $G$ satisfies some property $\mathcal{P}$. To convince the vertices, the prover gives a small piece of information, called certificate, to each vertex, and the vertices then decide whether the property $\mathcal{P}$ is satisfied by just looking at their certificate and the certificates of their neighbors. When studying a property $\mathcal{P}$ in the perspective of local certification, the aim is to find the optimal size of the certificates needed to certify $\mathcal{P}$, which can be viewed a measure of the local complexity of $\mathcal{P}$.
  A certification scheme is considered to be efficient if the size of the certificates is polylogarithmic in the number of vertices. While there have been a number of meta-theorems providing efficient certification schemes for general graph classes, the proofs of the lower bounds on the size of the certificates are usually very problem-dependent.
  In this work, we introduce a notion of hardness reduction in local certification, and show that we can transfer a lower bound on the certificates for a property $\mathcal{P}$ to a lower bound for another property $\mathcal{P}'$, via a (local) hardness reduction from $\mathcal{P}$ to $\mathcal{P}'$. We then give a number of applications in which we obtain polynomial lower bounds for many classical properties using such reductions.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete classification of holographic entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic method to find all holographic entropy inequalities that have corresponding contraction maps and argue the completeness of our method. We use a triality between holographic entropy inequalities, contraction maps and partial cubes. More specifically, the validity of a holographic entropy inequality is implied by the existence of a contraction map, which we prove to be equivalent to finding an isometric embedding of a contracted graph. Thus, by virtue of the argued completeness of the contraction map proof method, the problem of finding all holographic entropy inequalities is equivalent to the problem of finding all contraction maps, which we translate to a problem of finding all image graph partial cubes. We give an algorithmic solution to this problem and characterize the complexity of our method. We also demonstrate interesting by-products, most notably, a procedure to generate candidate quantum entropy inequalities.</description>
