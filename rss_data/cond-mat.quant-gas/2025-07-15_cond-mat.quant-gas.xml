      <title>Counterflow leads to roton spectra in locally interacting superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of strongly interacting quantum fluids such as Helium II are fundamentally distinct from those of dilute, contact-interacting atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Most dramatically, superfluids with finite-range interactions can support excitations with a roton-like dispersion, exhibiting a minimum at finite wavenumber. Here we introduce a mechanism through which roton spectra can emerge in superfluids without any nonlocal interactions, instead resulting from the collective excitations of two counterflowing, zero-range interacting condensates. As our mechanism relies only on the nonlinear dynamics of classical fields, this work opens the door to the realization of roton dynamics in the broad class of physical systems governed by coupled nonlinear-Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <title>Spin-triplet pairing instability in a two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetry has been a central focus in the study of strongly correlated electron systems. In this work, we report a numerically exact study of the spin-triplet pairing in a two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, employing Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method. The model includes next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor hopping terms, and maintains spin balance. By tuning the fermion filling close to a type-II van Hove singularity (vHs) in the model, we numerically investigate the ordering tendencies of several possible pairing channels with different symmetries. Our numerical results provide clear evidence for the spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing instability approaching low temperatures, as revealed by the vertex contribution to the pairing susceptibility. This signature becomes increasingly pronounced as the interaction strength increases in the weak to intermediate regime. We further find that, near the type-II vHs, the dominant spin-spin correlations in the system are ferromagnetic, suggesting its close relation to the spin-triplet pairing instability. Our findings offer a reliable approach to realize the spin-triplet $p$-wave superfluidity in the repulsive Hubbard model, from an unbiased numerical perspective.</description>

      <title>Expansion dynamics of strongly correlated lattice bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of interacting bosons on a two-dimensional Hubbard lattice in the strongly interacting regime, taking into account the dynamics of condensate amplitude as well as the direct transport of non-condensed fluctuations. To that end we develop a selfconsistent density-matrix approach which goes beyond the standard Gutzwiller mean-field theory. Starting from the Liouville-von-Neumann equation we derive a quantum master equation for the time evolution of the system's local density matrix at each lattice site, with a dynamical bath that represents the rest of the system. We apply this method to the expansion dynamics of an initially prepared cloud of interacting bosons in an optical lattice. We observe a ballistic expansion of the condensate, as expected, followed by slow, diffusive transport of the normal bosons. We discuss, in particular, the robustness of the Mott insulator phase as well as its melting due to incoherent transport. The method should be applicable to various models of lattice bosons in the strongly correlated regime.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium magnetic dynamics of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in strongly interacting many-body systems is understanding the far-from-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we study the many-body magnetic dynamics of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model by developing a two-component extension of nonequilibrium bosonic dynamical mean-field theory. Using this numerical method, we uncover rich quantum spin dynamics via inter-species interaction quenches. A sudden ramp-up of interactions induces slow thermalization, leading to a long-lived metastable state, whereas quenching to weak interactions results in rapid thermal equilibrium, featuring a two-step relaxation behavior through distinct exponential decays. Furthermore, under periodic modulation of the inter-species interactions, emergent Floquet dynamics drives a transition from a magnetic to an unordered phase.</description>

      <title>Hollow cylindrical droplets in a very strongly dipolar condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) leads to topologically trivial compact states. Because of the long-range nonlocal dipole-dipole interaction, a strongly dipolar BEC revealed many novel phenomena. Here we show that in a strongly dipolar BEC one can have a hollow cylindrical quasi-one-dimensional metastable droplet with ring topology while the system is trapped only in the $x$-$y$ plane by a harmonic potential and a Gaussian hill potential at the center and untrapped along the polarization $z$ axis. In this numerical investigation we use the imaginary-time propagation of a mean-field model where we include the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction, suitably modified for dipolar systems. Being metastable, these droplets are weakly stable and we use real-time propagation to investigate its dynamics and establish stability.</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics of a mobile impurity injected in a one-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum impurity immersed with a finite velocity in a one-dimensional system of weakly interacting bosons is studied. We uncover and characterize different regimes of relaxation dynamics. We find that the final impurity velocity remains constant in a large interval of sufficiently big and realistic initial velocities. The underlying physical mechanism is the emission of the dispersive density shock waves that carry away the excess of the initial impurity momentum, while locally the system remains in the same stationary state. In contrast, a heavy impurity with the same coupling constant relaxes differently and the regime of constant final velocity disappears. Furthermore, a fast heavy impurity exhibits damped velocity oscillations in time before reaching a stationary state. This process is accompanied by the oscillations of the local depletion of the boson density around the impurity, until their positions coincide and they continue the motion together. Decreasing the impurity-boson coupling or increasing the strength of repulsion between bosons, the oscillations get amplified. In the case of a heavy impurity with the mass bigger than the critical one, the ground state energy as a function of momentum exhibits cusps and metastable branches. We show that they manifest themselves by a soliton emission, a considerable slowing down of the relaxation, and a change of the impurity direction of motion with respect to the initial one.</description>

      <title>Sensing the binding and unbinding of anyons at impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional charge and statistics that arise in strongly correlated two-dimensional systems such as the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect and fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Interactions between anyons can lead to emergent phenomena, such as anyon superconductivity as well as anyon condensation which allows for a hierarchical construction of quantum Hall states. In this work, we study how quasihole anyons in a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin fractional quantum Hall state can be bound together by a sufficiently strong attractive impurity potential. The competition between the repulsive interaction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction between the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers of quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating while remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes bound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states experimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton spectroscopy. While the impurities in traditional platforms such as GaAs heterostructures are typically too weak to observe the binding of anyons, the recently discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ offer a platform which may realize the strong-impurity regime.</description>

      <title>Anyon-trions in atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry and antisymmetry breaking in a ring with two potential barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fundamental setup for the realization of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and spontaneous antisymmetry breaking (SASB) in the framework of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation with the self-attractive and repulsive cubic term, respectively, on a one-dimensional ring split in two mutually symmetric boxes by delta-functional potential barriers, placed at opposite points. The system is relevant to optics and BEC. The spectrum of the linearized system is found in analytical and numerical forms. SSB and SASB are predicted by dint of the variational approximation, and studied in the numerical form. A particular stable solution, which demonstrates strong asymmetry, is found in an exact form. In the system with the attractive nonlinearity, the SSB of the symmetric ground state is initiated by the modulational instability. It creates stationary asymmetric states through a supercritical bifurcation. In the self-repulsive system, SASB makes the lowest antisymmetric excited state unstable, transforming it into an antisymmetry-breaking oscillatory mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning model for predicting the electric dipole moment of diatomic molecules using only the atomic properties of the constituent atoms. Our model can screen the entire periodic table and identify the molecules with the largest dipole moment for applications in cold molecular sciences, or find the molecule with the largest dipole moment that contains a given atom. Similarly, our model identifies useful trends that explain the dipole moment of molecules, improving our intuition in chemical physics. Finally, we condense our model into an analytical expression to predict the dipole moment in terms of atomic properties.</description>

Abstract: Strontium-88 is a versatile atomic species often used in quantum optics, precision metrology, and quantum computing. Consolidated atomic data is essential for the planning, execution, and evaluation of experiments. In this reference, we present physical and optical properties of neutral $^{88}$Sr relevant to these applications. Here we focus on experimental results and supplement these with theoretical values. We present equations to convert values and derive important parameters. Tabulated results include key parameters for commonly used transitions in $^{88}$Sr ($^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow \, ^1\mathrm{P}_1$, $^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow \, ^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2}$, and $^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2} \rightarrow \, ^3\mathrm{S}_1$). This dataset serves as an up-to-date reference for studies involving bosonic $^{88}$Sr.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $1/r$ long-range interaction, induced by laser illumination, offers a mechanism for the implementation of stable self-trapping in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in the three-dimensional free space. Using the variational approximation and numerical solutions, we find that self-trapped states in this setting , with attractive nonlocal and repulsive local interactions, resemble tightly-bound compactons. However, these are not true compactons but rather \textit{tightly self-trapped modes} (TSTMs), with small-amplitude nonvanishing tails. The structure of the self-trapped states is explained by an analytical solution for their tails. Further, we demonstrate that stable % TSTMs with embedded vorticity, exist in the same setting, with winding numbers up to $S=6$ (at least). Addressing two-TSTM interactions, we find that pairs of ground states (GSs, with $S=0$), as well as vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex pairs (with $S_1=S_2$ and $S_1=-S_2$, respectively), form stably rotating bound states. Head-on collisions between vortex TSTMs, set in slow motion by kicks, are inelastic, resulting in their merger into a GS soliton, that may either remain at the collision position or move aside, shedding the angular momentum with emitted radiation, or, alternatively, lead to the formation of a vortex that also moves aside.</description>

Abstract: We study a mobile impurity in a one-dimensional harmonically confined optical lattice interacting repulsively with a bosonic bath. The behavior of the impurity across baths with superfluid and Mott-insulator domains is examined, including its full back-action effect on the bath. We characterize the bath-impurity phase diagram and reveal the appearance of a correlated counterflow phase, which we support with an analytical model for a mobile impurity-hole pair. This phase shows an extended combined insulator domain of unity filling but no independent domain of constant density. The transition to this phase features a sudden orthogonality and the change of the shape of the impurity's profile to that of a free particle in an infinite square well. The findings of this work suggest the appearance of unconventional counterflow in trapped imbalanced atomic mixtures.</description>

      <title>Elongated vortex quantum droplets in binary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

Abstract: Stability of elongated (``slender") quantum droplets (QDs) with embedded unitary and multiple vorticity is a problem that was not solved previously. In this work, we propose a solution which relies upon the use of the spatial modulation of the inter-species scattering length in the binary Bose-Einstein condensates, in the form of a two-dimensional axisymmetric Gaussian, shaped by means of the optical Feshbach resonance. The corresponding effective nonlinear trapping potential supports completely stable elongated QDs with vorticity $S=0$ and partly stable families of elongated QDs with $S=1,2,3,4$ (other nonlinear systems do not maintain stability of vortex droplets with $\geq 2$). We systematically analyze effects of the amplitude and width of the Gaussian modulation, as well as the total number of atoms, on the shape and stability of the QDs, some effects being explained analytically. Collisions between identical QDs with $% S=1$ moving in opposite directions along the central axis leads to their merger into still more elongated breathing QDs with the same vorticity, while collisions between QDs with $S=\pm 1$ are quasi-elastic. Moving modulation profiles are able to adiabatically rotate the trapped elongated QDs. Application of a torque to the vector QD sets in the gyroscopic regime of robust precession, which realizes a macroscopic spin-orbit-coupling effect.</description>

      <title>A Counterdiabatic Route to Entanglement Steering and Dynamical Freezing in the Floquet Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Intriguingly, CD driving generates spin squeezing and its associated metrologically useful multipartite entanglement at the mid-point of every drive cycle, when the system is initially prepared in a fully x-polarized state. The CD driving induced non-ergodic dynamics is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.</description>

      <title>Resonating Kagome Dimer coverings in Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by experiments on Rydberg atom arrays, we explore the properties of uniform quantum superpositions of kagome dimer configurations and construct an efficient algorithm for experimentally producing them. We begin by considering the thin cylinder limit, where these states have simple descriptions. We then develop a matrix product representation of the states on arbitrary cylinders, which leads to a natural protocol to efficiently grow them. We explain how our approach can be adapted to other quantum computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity via layer differentiation in trilayer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in multilayer cuprates,we investigated the trilayer Hubbard model by adopting the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Focusing on the systems with hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) higher than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL are generically beneficial for global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the possibility of $d$-wave superconductivity solely hosted in the IL. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</description>
