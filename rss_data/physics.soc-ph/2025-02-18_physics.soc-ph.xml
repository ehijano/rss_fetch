      <title>Optimal ambition in business, politics and life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When should we be satisfied and when should we look for greener pastures? When is the perfect the enemy of the good? This type of question arises in many different contexts, including business, politics, resource exploitation, and our personal lives. Folk intuition suggests that people should aim for above-average results, but overreaching can lead to failure. Here, we mathematically formalize this intuition and relate it to empirical research across diverse domains. We model a search for strategies that have uncertain rewards over a fixed time period. The agent (i.e. searcher) knows the statistical distribution of rewards across strategies. At each time step, the agent either is satisfied and sticks with their current strategy or continues searching. We prove that the agent's optimal satisfaction threshold is both finite and strictly larger than the mean of available rewards. Compared to the optimal threshold, being too ambitious has a higher expected cost than being too cautious, implying that uncertainty over the reward distribution should motivate caution. The optimal satisfaction threshold becomes larger if the search time is longer, or if the reward distribution is rugged (i.e., has low autocorrelation) or left skewed. Using upward social comparison to assess the reward landscape biases agents towards never being satisfied, which decreases their expected performance substantially. We discuss how these insights can be applied empirically, using examples from entrepreneurship, economic policy, political campaigns, online dating, and college admissions.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Street Network Centrality with City Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12006v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban scaling laws reveal how cities evolve as their populations grow, yet the role of street network accessibility in this process remains underexplored. We analyze over 5,000 Brazilian cities to establish a scaling law linking average closeness centrality $\langle c_C\rangle$ -- a measure of structural accessibility in street networks-to population size N . Our results demonstrate that $\langle c_C\rangle$ decays sublinearly as $N^{-\sigma}$ ($\sigma \approx 0.38$), indicating that larger cities redistribute accessibility from cores to peripheries while maintaining navigability through hierarchical shortcuts. This scaling arises from the fractal interplay between infrastructure and population, characterized by a network dimension $d \approx 2.17$, which exceeds that of a 2D grid. The slower decline in closeness centrality ($\sigma &lt; 0.5$) reflects a trade-off: urban expansion reduces proximity but enhances connectivity through optimized path diversity, fostering economic dynamism. By integrating the Molinero &amp; Thurner model with network centrality metrics, we provide a framework to reconcile infrastructure efficiency with equitable accessibility in growing cities.</description>

      <title>Inferring contact network characteristics from epidemic data via compact mean-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling epidemics using contact networks provides a significant improvement over classical compartmental models by explicitly incorporating the network of contacts. However, while network-based models describe disease spread on a given contact structure, their potential for inferring the underlying network from epidemic data remains largely unexplored. In this work, we consider the edge-based compartmental model (EBCM), a compact and analytically tractable framework, and we integrate it within dynamical survival analysis (DSA) to infer key network properties along with parameters of the epidemic itself. Despite correlations between structural and epidemic parameters, our framework demonstrates robustness in accurately inferring contact network properties from synthetic epidemic simulations. Additionally, we apply the framework to real-world outbreaks, namely the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and the COVID-19 epidemic in Seoul, to estimate both disease parameters and network characteristics. Our results show that our framework achieves good fits to real-world epidemic data and reliable short-term forecasts. These findings highlight the potential of network-based inference approaches to uncover hidden contact structures, providing insights that can inform the design of targeted interventions and public health strategies.</description>

      <title>Explosive Growth in Large-Scale Collaboration Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the evolution of two large collaboration networks: the Microsoft Academic Graph (1800-2020) and Internet Movie Database (1900-2020), comprising $2.72 \times 10^8$ and $1.88 \times 10^6$ nodes respectively. The networks show super-linear growth, with node counts following power laws $N(t) \propto t^{\alpha}$ where $\alpha = 2.3$ increasing to $3.1$ after 1950 (MAG) and $\alpha = 1.8$ (IMDb). Node and edge processes maintain stable but noisy timescale ratios ($\tau_N/\tau_E \approx 2.8 \pm 0.3$ MAG, $2.3 \pm 0.2$ IMDb). The probability of waiting a time $t$ between successive collaborations was found to be scale-free, $P(t) \propto t^{-\gamma}$, with indices evolving from $\gamma \approx 2.3$ to $1.6$ (MAG) and $2.6$ to $2.1$ (IMDb). Academic collaboration sizes increased from $1.2$ to $5.8$ authors per paper, while entertainment collaborations remained more stable ($3.2$ to $4.5$ actors). These observations indicate that current network models might be enhanced by considering accelerating growth, coupled timescales, and environmental influence, while explaining stable local properties.</description>

      <title>Parametric Analysis of Network Evolution Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive parametric analysis of node and edge lifetimes processes in two large-scale collaboration networks: the Microsoft Academic Graph (1800-2020) and Internet Movie Database (1900-2020). Node and edge lifetimes (career and collaboration durations) follow Weibull distributions with consistent shape parameters ($k \approx 0.2$ for academic, $k \approx 0.5$ for entertainment careers) across centuries of evolution. These distributions persist despite dramatic changes in network size and structure. Edge processes show domain-specific evolution: academic collaboration durations increase over time (power-law index $1.6$ to $2.3$) while entertainment collaborations maintain more stable patterns (index $2.6$ to $2.1$). These findings indicate that while career longevity exhibits consistent patterns, collaboration dynamics appear to be influenced by domain-specific factors. The results provide new constraints for models of social network evolution, requiring incorporation of both universal lifetime distributions and domain-specific growth dynamics.</description>

      <title>Weibull Processes in Network Degree Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines degree distributions in two large collaboration networks: the Microsoft Academic Graph (1800-2020) and Internet Movie Database (1900-2020), comprising $2.72 \times 10^8$ and $1.88 \times 10^6$ nodes respectively. Statistical comparison using $\chi^2$ measures showed that Weibull distributions fit the degree distributions better than power-law or log-normal models, especially at later stages in the network evolution. The Weibull shape parameters exhibit notable stability ($k \approx 0.8$-$1.0$ for academic, $k \approx 0.9$-$1.1$ for entertainment collaborations) despite orders of magnitude growth in network size. While early-stage networks display approximate power-law scaling, mature networks develop characteristic flattening in the low-degree region that Weibull distributions appear to capture better. In the academic network, the cutoff between the flattened region and power-law tail shows a gradual increase from $5$ to $9$ edges over time, while the entertainment network maintains a distinctive degree structure that may reflect storytelling and cast-size constraints. These patterns suggest the possibility that collaboration network evolution might be influenced more by constraint-based growth than by pure preferential attachment or multiplicative processes.</description>

      <title>How opinions get more extreme in an age of information abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We live in an age of information abundance but know little about how this influences our opinions or attitudes. A common expectation is that people consulting numerous pieces of information, well balancing the different sides of an issue, will adopt a moderate attitude about the issue. We claim that this expectation is deceitful and suggest that people tend to get extreme and dogmatic about an issue when they consult abundant unbiased information. The cause for this extremization is a hardening confirmation bias -- when their attitude gets more extreme, people get more likely to ignore information that differs from their views. Our claim is based on simulations of two fundamentally different computational models: a Bounded Confidence model and an empirically calibrated Persuasive Argument model. For both models, the attitude tends to be extreme when the computational agent consults abundant unbiased information. We analyze the extremization pathways displayed in the models and discuss how our results may affect views on polarization, and on the role of online media.</description>

      <title>Percolation transition of k-frequent destinations network for urban mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban spatial interactions are a complex aggregation of routine visits and random explorations by individuals. The inherent uncertainty of these random visitations poses significant challenges to understanding urban structures and socioeconomic developments. To capture the core dynamics of urban interaction networks, we analyze the percolation structure of the $k$-most frequented destinations of intracity place-to-place flows from mobile phone data of eight major U.S. cities at a Census Block Group (CBG) level. Our study reveals a consistent percolation transition at $k^* = 130$, a critical threshold for the number of frequently visited destinations necessary to maintain a cohesive urban network. This percolation threshold proves remarkably consistent across diverse urban configurations, sizes, and geographical settings over a 48-month study period, and can largely be interpreted as the joint effect of the emergence of hubness and the level of mixing of residents. Furthermore, we examine the socioeconomic profiles of residents from different origin areas categorized by the fulfillment level of $k^*=130$ principal destinations, revealing a pronounced distinction in the origins' socioeconomic advantages. These insights offer a nuanced understanding of how urban spaces are interconnected and the determinants of travel behavior. Our findings contribute to a deeper comprehension of the structural dynamics that govern urban spatial interactions.</description>

      <title>Two halves don't make a whole: instability and idleness emerging from the co-evolution of the production and innovation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a disaggregated representation of production through an agent-based fund-flow model (NGR-ADAPT) within which inefficiencies, such as factor idleness and production instability, emerge from endogenous frictions. The model incorporates productivity dynamics (learning and depreciation) and is extended with time-saving process innovations. Specifically, we assume that workers possess inherent creativity that flourishes during idle periods. The firm, rather than laying off idle workers, is assumed to exploit this potential by involving them in the innovation process. Results show that a firm's organizational and managerial decisions, the temporal structure of the production system, the speed at which workers learn and forget, and the pace of innovation are critical factors influencing production efficiency in both the short and long run. The co-evolution of production and innovation processes emerges in our model through the two-sided effects of idleness: whereas it drives skill decay it is also a condition for creative thinking that can be leveraged for innovation. In doing so, we question the utilization of labour as an adjustment variable in a productive organisation. The paper concludes by discussing potential solutions to this issue and suggesting avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Behavior in Pre-State Societies: An Agent-Based Approach of the Aksum Civilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study intends to test the hypothesis that, contrary to traditional interpretation, the social structure of the polity of Aksum - especially in its early stages - was not characterized by a vertical hierarchy with highly centralized administrative power, and that the leaders mentioned in the few available inscriptions were predominantly ritual leaders with religious rather than coercive political authority. This hypothesis, suggested by the available archaeological evidence, is grounded in Charles Stanish's model, which posits that pre-state societies could achieve cooperative behavior without the presence of coercive authority. Using agent-based modeling applied to data inspired by the Aksum civilization, we examine the dynamics of cooperation in the presence and absence of a Public Goods Game. Results show that while cooperative behavior can emerge in the short term without coercive power, it may not be sustainable over the long term, suggesting a need for centralized authority to foster stable, complex societies. These findings provide insights into the evolutionary pathways that lead to state formation and complex social structures.</description>

      <title>Modelling hydrogen integration in energy system models: Best practices for policy insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of hydrogen in long-term energy strategies requires a broad understanding on how hydrogen is currently modelled in national energy system models. This study provides a review on hydrogen representation within selected energy system models that are tailored towards providing policy insights. The paper adopts a multi-layered review approach and selects eleven notable models for the review. The review covers hydrogen production, storage, transportation, trade, demand, modeling strategies, and hydrogen policies. The review suggests existing models would often opt for a simplified representation that can capture each stage of the hydrogen supply chain. This approach allows models to strike a balance between accuracy and preserving computational resources. The paper provides several suggestions for modeling hydrogen in national energy system models.</description>
