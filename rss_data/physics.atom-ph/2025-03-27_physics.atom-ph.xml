      <title>Microwave spectroscopy of ultracold sodium least-bound molecular states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed microwave spectroscopy of sodium least-bound molecular states, improving the precision on the knowledge of their energies at zero magnetic field by almost three orders of magnitude. Our experimental observations give us also access to states submitted to predissociation, a phenomenon where a bound molecular state can naturally decay into the continuum. Our findings are compared to numerical calculations based on the latest interpolation of sodium interaction potentials and show good agreement, with slight discrepancies in the zero-field energy of the molecular states, suggesting a need for small adjustment of the interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>An entanglement protocol to measure atomic parity violation at sub 0.1% precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a scheme to measure atomic parity violation (APV) in barium ions at &lt;0.1% precision. The scheme is based on using multi-ion entangled states to common-mode reject parity-conserving systematic shifts and selectively detect a parity-violating vector light shift. This measurement protocol eliminates the need to suppress a leading systematic by 11 orders of magnitude, as is required in the single-ion measurement scheme [N. Fortson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2383 (1993)]. Furthermore, the protocol can be combined with the use of integrated photonic waveguides in an architecture that is scalable to large ion numbers, with a proportional increase in measurement precision.</description>

      <title>Accelerated State Expansion of a Nanoparticle in a Dark Inverted Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the wave packet of a massive particle grows linearly under free dynamics, it grows exponentially in an inverted harmonic potential, offering a pathway to rapidly increase quantum fluctuations to macroscopic dimensions. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate this principle by expanding the center-of-mass thermal state of a 125nm silica nanoparticle to a position uncertainty of 43.4nm within 260 $\mu$s. This expansion, achieved using an inverted dark potential to minimize decoherence from photon recoil, represents a 952-fold increase, reaching a scale comparable to the nanoparticle's physical size. This work represents a key advancement toward preparing macroscopic quantum superpositions at unprecedented mass and length scales.</description>

      <title>Boundary Time Crystals Induced by Local Dissipation and Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative many-body system supports nontrivial quantum phases absent in equilibrium. As a prominent example, the interplay between coherent driving and collective dissipation can lead to a dynamical quantum phase that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. This so-called boundary time crystal (BTC) is fragile in the presence of local dissipation, which inevitably relaxes the system to a stationary state. In this work, we demonstrate a robust BTC that is intrinsically induced by local dissipation. We provide extensive numerical evidences to support existence of the BTC and study its behaviors in different regimes. In particular, with decreasing interaction range, we identify a transition from classical limit cycles to quantum BTCs featuring sizable spatial correlations. Our studies significantly broaden the scope of nonequilibrium phases and shed new light on experimental search for dynamical quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Highly charged isomeric qubits from antiproton annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe how the annihilation of antiprotons can be utilized to generate highly charged synthetic qubits in an ion-trap setup. We identify the qubit transitions in the hyperfine splitting of Hydrogen-like atoms composed of an isomer and a single electron in the ground state. We identify promising candidates in the isomers of Y, Nb, Rh, In, and Sb, for which the hyperfine transition lies in the infrared and whose excited state level lifetime is in the hundreds of milliseconds, which is suitable for metrology applications.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the coalescence behavior of Coulomb-Schr\"odinger atomic wave functions from an operator product expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.09023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the coalescence behavior of the atomic Schr\"odinger wave functions from the angle of an operator product expansion (OPE) within the nonrelativistic Coulomb-Schr\"odinger effective field theory. We take the electron-nucleus coalescence as an explicit example to demonstrate our formalism, where the celebrated Kato's cusp condition can be easily reproduced. An exact OPE relation is rigorously proved to all orders in perturbation theory. Our approach can be readily extended to ascertain the multi-particle coalescence behaviors of atomic wave functions, as well as to take relativistic effects into account.</description>

      <title>Quantum beating and cyclic structures in the phase-space dynamics of the Kramers-Henneberger atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase-space dynamics of the Kramers Henneberger (KH) atom solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for reduced-dimensionality models and using Wigner quasiprobability distributions. We find that, for the time-averaged KH potential, coherent superpositions of eigenstates perform a cyclic motion confined in momentum space, whose frequency is proportional to the energy difference between the two KH eigenstates. This cyclic motion is also present if the full time dependent dynamics are taken into consideration. However, there are time delays regarding the time-averaged potential, and some tail-shaped spilling of the quasiprobability flow towards higher momentum regions. These tails are signatures of ionization, indicating that, for the potential studied in this work, a small momentum spread is associated with stabilization. A comparison of the quasiprobability flow with classical phase-space constraints shows that, for the KH atom, the momentum must be bounded from above. This is a major difference from a molecule, for which the quasiprobability flow is confined in position space for small internuclear separation. Furthermore, we assess the stability of different propagation strategies and find that the most stable scenario for the full dynamics is obtained if the system is initially prepared in the KH ground state.</description>

      <title>Capturing strong correlation effects on a quantum annealer: calculation of avoided crossing in the H$_4$ molecule using the quantum annealer eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We broaden the scope of the Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (QAE) algorithm, an underexplored noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era approach for calculating atomic and molecular properties, to predict avoided crossings, where strong correlation effects are at play. For this purpose, we consider the classic example of the H$_4$ molecule in a rectangular geometry. Our results are obtained on the 5000-qubit D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 quantum computer. We benchmark our quantum annealing results with full configuration interaction (FCI) as well as with those obtained using simulated annealing. We find that we can predict avoided crossings within about 1.2% of the FCI value on real quantum hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Since the QAE algorithm provides information on the wave function as its output, we also check the quality of the computed wave function by calculating the fidelity, and find it to be 99.886%. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the QAE algorithm relative to its gate-based NISQ algorithm counterpart, the celebrated Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).</description>
