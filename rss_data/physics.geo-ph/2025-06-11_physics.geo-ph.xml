      <title>TS-PIELM: Time-Stepping Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine Facilitates Soil Consolidation Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accuracy and efficiency of the conventional physics-informed neural network (PINN) need to be improved before it can be a competitive alternative for soil consolidation analyses. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a highly accurate and efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approach, termed time-stepping physics-informed extreme learning machine (TS-PIELM). In the TS-PIELM framework the consolidation process is divided into numerous time intervals, which helps overcome the limitation of PIELM in solving differential equations with sharp gradients. To accelerate network training, the solution is approximated by a single-layer feedforward extreme learning machine (ELM), rather than using a fully connected neural network in PINN. The input layer weights of the ELM network are generated randomly and fixed during the training process. Subsequently, the output layer weights are directly computed by solving a system of linear equations, which significantly enhances the training efficiency compared to the time-consuming gradient descent method in PINN. Finally, the superior performance of TS-PIELM is demonstrated by solving three typical Terzaghi consolidation problems. Compared to PINN, results show that the computational efficiency and accuracy of the novel TS-PIELM framework are improved by more than 1000 times and 100 times for one-dimensional cases, respectively. This paper provides compelling evidence that PIML can be a powerful tool for computational geotechnics.</description>

      <title>The Roles of Low-Noise Stations, Arrays and Ocean-Bottom Seismometers in Monitoring UK Offshore Seismicity associated with Subsurface Storage of Carbon Dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective seismic monitoring of subsurface carbon dioxide storage (SCS) sites is essential for managing risks posed by induced seismicity. This is particularly challenging in offshore environments, such as the Endurance license area in the North Sea, where the UK's permanent land-based seismometer network offers limited monitoring capability due to its distance from the expected locations of seismic events. A Bayesian experimental design framework is used to assess enhancements of the network with a low-noise onshore station located at around 1~km depth in Boulby mine, the onshore North York Moors Seismic Array, an optimally-located additional on-shore monitoring site, and ocean bottom seismometers (OBS). We quantify the expected information gain about seismic source locations and introduce a practical method to incorporate signal-to-noise dependent detectability and velocity model uncertainty. We show that the Boulby station or an onshore array primarily lower the detection threshold for small-magnitude events (M=0-2), but offer limited improvement in location accuracy. An optimally-located additional land-based seismometer or local array provides little additional benefit. OBS deployments yield significant improvements in location accuracy due to their proximity to potential seismicity. Optimised networks of two to three OBS stations are effective for Endurance, while three to five OBS stations offer robust monitoring across North Sea carbon storage licence areas off England's east coast. Velocity model uncertainty remains a key limiting factor for location precision across all configurations. We conclude that deploying OBS networks is the most promising strategy for enhancing microseismic monitoring capabilities at offshore SCS sites, though potentially more expensive.</description>

      <title>Quantifying sulfur speciation in magmatic-hydrothermal fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative knowledge of sulfur speciation in the fluid phase is key to understanding sulfur degassing from magmas and its transfer along with metals by fluids across the lithosphere. Farsang and Zajacz (1) recently reported new sulfur speciation data using Raman spectroscopy measurements on aqueous H$_2$SO$_4$-NaCl(-KCl) solutions trapped as synthetic fluid inclusions in quartz at 875$^\circ$C and 2 kbar under variable redox conditions. They interpreted the data by dominant SO$_{2(aq)}$ and HS$^-$, along with subordinate H$_2$S$_{(aq)}$, whereas the di-and trisulfur radical ions, $[S_3^\bullet]^-$ and $[S_2^\bullet]^-$, reported in aqueous fluids both in nature and experiment to at least 700 $^\circ$C and 15 kbar (2-5) , were undetectable in Raman nonresonant spectra 1 . On the basis of thermochemical calculations that returned negligible HS$^-$ and large $[S_3^\bullet]^-$ concentrations at their experimental conditions, the authors claimed that the published $[S_3^\bullet]^-$ and HS$^-$ thermodynamic data were incorrect and that the major species controlling both sulfur and gold transport in hydrothermal-magmatic fluids is the HS$^-$ anion. Here I demonstrate that their conclusions stem from the use of inconsistent thermodynamic data and incorrect Raman spectra assignments. Thus, ref. 1 provides no grounds for questioning the validity of the thermodynamic properties of HS$^-$ and $[S_3^\bullet]^-$ or of their metal complexes in the fluids of the Earth's crust.</description>
