      <title>Globally and Locally Optimized Pannini Projection for High FoV Rendering of 360-degree Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To render a spherical (360 degree or omnidirectional) image on planar displays, a 2D image -- called as viewport -- must be obtained by projecting a sphere region on a plane, according to the users viewing direction and a predefined field of view (FoV). However, any sphere to plan projection introduces geometric distortions, such as object stretching and/or bending of straight lines, which intensity increases with the considered FoV. In this paper, a fully automatic content-aware projection is proposed, aiming to reduce the geometric distortions when high FoVs are used. This new projection is based on the Pannini projection, whose parameters are firstly globally optimized according to the image content, followed by a local conformality improvement of relevant viewport objects. A crowdsourcing subjective test showed that the proposed projection is the most preferred solution among the considered state-of-the-art sphere to plan projections, producing viewports with a more pleasant visual quality.</description>

      <title>Hear Me, See Me, Understand Me: Audio-Visual Autism Behavior Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel problem of audio-visual autism behavior recognition, which includes social behavior recognition, an essential aspect previously omitted in AI-assisted autism screening research. We define the task at hand as one that is audio-visual autism behavior recognition, which uses audio and visual cues, including any speech present in the audio, to recognize autism-related behaviors. To facilitate this new research direction, we collected an audio-visual autism spectrum dataset (AV-ASD), currently the largest video dataset for autism screening using a behavioral approach. It covers an extensive range of autism-associated behaviors, including those related to social communication and interaction. To pave the way for further research on this new problem, we intensively explored leveraging foundation models and multimodal large language models across different modalities. Our experiments on the AV-ASD dataset demonstrate that integrating audio, visual, and speech modalities significantly enhances the performance in autism behavior recognition. Additionally, we explored the use of a post-hoc to ad-hoc pipeline in a multimodal large language model to investigate its potential to augment the model's explanatory capability during autism behavior recognition. We will release our dataset, code, and pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>EVAN: Evolutional Video Streaming Adaptation via Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive bitrate (ABR) using conventional codecs cannot further modify the bitrate once a decision has been made, exhibiting limited adaptation capability. This may result in either overly conservative or overly aggressive bitrate selection, which could cause either inefficient utilization of the network bandwidth or frequent re-buffering, respectively. Neural representation for video (NeRV), which embeds the video content into neural network weights, allows video reconstruction with incomplete models. Specifically, the recovery of one frame can be achieved without relying on the decoding of adjacent frames. NeRV has the potential to provide high video reconstruction quality and, more importantly, pave the way for developing more flexible ABR strategies for video transmission. In this work, a new framework, named Evolutional Video streaming Adaptation via Neural representation (EVAN), which can adaptively transmit NeRV models based on soft actor-critic (SAC) reinforcement learning, is proposed. EVAN is trained with a more exploitative strategy and utilizes progressive playback to avoid re-buffering. Experiments showed that EVAN can outperform existing ABRs with 50% reduction in re-buffering and achieve nearly 20% .</description>

      <title>Multi-layer Learnable Attention Mask for Multimodal Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the Self-Attention mechanism in the Transformer model has proven to be effective in many domains, we observe that it is less effective in more diverse settings (e.g. multimodality) due to the varying granularity of each token and the high computational demands of lengthy sequences. To address the challenges, we introduce the Learnable Attention Mask (LAM), strategically designed to globally regulate attention maps and prioritize critical tokens within the sequence. Leveraging the Self-Attention module in a BERT-like transformer network, our approach adeptly captures associations between tokens. The extension of the LAM to a multi-layer version accommodates the varied information aspects embedded at each layer of the Transformer network. Comprehensive experimental validation on various datasets, such as MADv2, QVHighlights, ImageNet 1K, and MSRVTT, demonstrates the efficacy of the LAM, exemplifying its ability to enhance model performance while mitigating redundant computations. This pioneering approach presents a significant advancement in enhancing the understanding of complex scenarios, such as in movie understanding.</description>

      <title>AVFF: Audio-Visual Feature Fusion for Video Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth in deepfake video content, we require improved and generalizable methods to detect them. Most existing detection methods either use uni-modal cues or rely on supervised training to capture the dissonance between the audio and visual modalities. While the former disregards the audio-visual correspondences entirely, the latter predominantly focuses on discerning audio-visual cues within the training corpus, thereby potentially overlooking correspondences that can help detect unseen deepfakes. We present Audio-Visual Feature Fusion (AVFF), a two-stage cross-modal learning method that explicitly captures the correspondence between the audio and visual modalities for improved deepfake detection. The first stage pursues representation learning via self-supervision on real videos to capture the intrinsic audio-visual correspondences. To extract rich cross-modal representations, we use contrastive learning and autoencoding objectives, and introduce a novel audio-visual complementary masking and feature fusion strategy. The learned representations are tuned in the second stage, where deepfake classification is pursued via supervised learning on both real and fake videos. Extensive experiments and analysis suggest that our novel representation learning paradigm is highly discriminative in nature. We report 98.6% accuracy and 99.1% AUC on the FakeAVCeleb dataset, outperforming the current audio-visual state-of-the-art by 14.9% and 9.9%, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Human-Annotated Video Dataset for Training and Evaluation of 360-Degree Video Summarization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new dataset for 360-degree video summarization: the transformation of 360-degree video content to concise 2D-video summaries that can be consumed via traditional devices, such as TV sets and smartphones. The dataset includes ground-truth human-generated summaries, that can be used for training and objectively evaluating 360-degree video summarization methods. Using this dataset, we train and assess two state-of-the-art summarization methods that were originally proposed for 2D-video summarization, to serve as a baseline for future comparisons with summarization methods that are specifically tailored to 360-degree video. Finally, we present an interactive tool that was developed to facilitate the data annotation process and can assist other annotation activities that rely on video fragment selection.</description>

      <title>Exploiting LMM-based knowledge for image classification tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address image classification tasks leveraging knowledge encoded in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). More specifically, we use the MiniGPT-4 model to extract semantic descriptions for the images, in a multimodal prompting fashion. In the current literature, vision language models such as CLIP, among other approaches, are utilized as feature extractors, using only the image encoder, for solving image classification tasks. In this paper, we propose to additionally use the text encoder to obtain the text embeddings corresponding to the MiniGPT-4-generated semantic descriptions. Thus, we use both the image and text embeddings for solving the image classification task. The experimental evaluation on three datasets validates the improved classification performance achieved by exploiting LMM-based knowledge.</description>

      <title>Save It for the "Hot" Day: An LLM-Empowered Visual Analytics System for Heat Risk Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating frequency and intensity of heat-related climate events, particularly heatwaves, emphasize the pressing need for advanced heat risk management strategies. Current approaches, primarily relying on numerical models, face challenges in spatial-temporal resolution and in capturing the dynamic interplay of environmental, social, and behavioral factors affecting heat risks. This has led to difficulties in translating risk assessments into effective mitigation actions. Recognizing these problems, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the burgeoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract rich and contextual insights from news reports. We hence propose an LLM-empowered visual analytics system, Havior, that integrates the precise, data-driven insights of numerical models with nuanced news report information. This hybrid approach enables a more comprehensive assessment of heat risks and better identification, assessment, and mitigation of heat-related threats. The system incorporates novel visualization designs, such as "thermoglyph" and news glyph, enhancing intuitive understanding and analysis of heat risks. The integration of LLM-based techniques also enables advanced information retrieval and semantic knowledge extraction that can be guided by experts' analytics needs. Our case studies on two cities that faced significant heatwave events and interviews with five experts have demonstrated the usefulness of our system in providing in-depth and actionable insights for heat risk management.</description>

      <title>Not All Attention is Needed: Parameter and Computation Efficient Transfer Learning for Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter and computation efficient tuning method for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), termed Efficient Attention Skipping (EAS). Concretely, we first reveal that multi-head attentions (MHAs), the main computational overhead of MLLMs, are often redundant to downstream tasks. Based on this observation, EAS evaluates the attention redundancy and skips the less important MHAs to speed up inference. Besides, we also propose a novel propagation-of-information adapter (PIA) to serve the attention skipping of EAS and keep parameter efficiency, which can be further re-parameterized into feed-forward networks (FFNs) for zero-extra latency. To validate EAS, we apply it to a recently proposed MLLM called LaVIN and a classic VL pre-trained model called METER, and conduct extensive experiments on a set of benchmarks. The experiments show that EAS not only retains high performance and parameter efficiency, but also greatly speeds up inference speed. For instance, LaVIN-EAS can obtain 89.98\% accuracy on ScineceQA while speeding up inference by 2.2 times to LaVIN</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models with Instruction Contrastive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly adept at generating contextually detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, their application in multimodal decision-making and open-ended generation is hindered by a notable rate of hallucinations, where generated text inaccurately represents the visual contents. To address this issue, this paper introduces the Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) method, a novel approach designed to reduce hallucinations during LVLM inference. Our method is inspired by our observation that what we call disturbance instructions significantly exacerbate hallucinations in multimodal fusion modules. ICD contrasts distributions from standard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty and effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original distribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks (POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that ICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level hallucinations. Moreover, our method not only addresses hallucinations but also significantly enhances the general perception and recognition capabilities of LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Extreme Compression of Adaptive Neural Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Neural Fields are a novel paradigm for signal representation, from images and audio to 3D scenes and videos. The fundamental idea is to represent a signal as a continuous and differentiable neural network. This idea offers unprecedented benefits such as continuous resolution and memory efficiency, enabling new compression techniques. However, representing data as neural networks poses new challenges. For instance, given a 2D image as a neural network, how can we further compress such a neural image?. In this work, we present a novel analysis on compressing neural fields, with the focus on images. We also introduce Adaptive Neural Images (ANI), an efficient neural representation that enables adaptation to different inference or transmission requirements. Our proposed method allows to reduce the bits-per-pixel (bpp) of the neural image by 4x, without losing sensitive details or harming fidelity. We achieve this thanks to our successful implementation of 4-bit neural representations. Our work offers a new framework for developing compressed neural fields.</description>

      <title>Once-for-All: Controllable Generative Image Compression with Dynamic Granularity Adaption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although recent generative image compression methods have demonstrated impressive potential in optimizing the rate-distortion-perception trade-off, they still face the critical challenge of flexible rate adaption to diverse compression necessities and scenarios. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a Controllable Generative Image Compression framework, Control-GIC, the first capable of fine-grained bitrate adaption across a broad spectrum while ensuring high-fidelity and generality compression. We base Control-GIC on a VQGAN framework representing an image as a sequence of variable-length codes (i.e. VQ-indices), which can be losslessly compressed and exhibits a direct positive correlation with the bitrates. Therefore, drawing inspiration from the classical coding principle, we naturally correlate the information density of local image patches with their granular representations, to achieve dynamic adjustment of the code quantity following different granularity decisions. This implies we can flexibly determine a proper allocation of granularity for the patches to acquire desirable compression rates. We further develop a probabilistic conditional decoder that can trace back to historic encoded multi-granularity representations according to transmitted codes, and then reconstruct hierarchical granular features in the formalization of conditional probability, enabling more informative aggregation to improve reconstruction realism. Our experiments show that Control-GIC allows highly flexible and controllable bitrate adaption and even once compression on an entire dataset to fulfill constrained bitrate conditions. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance over recent state-of-the-art methods.</description>
