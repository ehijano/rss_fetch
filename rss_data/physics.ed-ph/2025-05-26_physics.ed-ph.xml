      <title>Measuring optical force with a torsion pendulum: a platform for independent student experimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the force due to radiation pressure is measured with sub-10 pN sensitivity, corresponding to less than 2 mW of optical power. The apparatus adds homemade reflectors to a commercial Cavendish balance, which consists of a torsion pendulum with a built-in capacitance position sensor. When driven by four 5 mW laser diodes, with square-wave modulation at the pendulum's natural frequency, the response is strong enough to easily discern in a short time series. The discrete Fourier transform of a longer dataset provides a more in-depth analysis, clearly showing the multiple frequency components from the square-wave driving force. The driving power was controlled by adjusting the square wave duty cycle, allowing easy automation and avoiding additional optics or filters. For a 9-hour dataset, white noise corresponding to about 2 pN was observed, enabling our most sensitive measurements. The pendulum operates in air. To minimize convective forces from differential heating and the resulting differential pressure, we use symmetrical reflectors encased in low-thermal conductivity material, namely, two glass-fronted mirrors attached back-to-back. This experiment could be used in a single lab session, allowing the optical force to be quickly and intuitively observed. It also demonstrates the power of Fourier analysis, builds student intuition about oscillator systems, and provides a compelling platform for student-driven projects.</description>

      <title>Handling Symbolic Language in Student Texts: A Comparative Study of NLP Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have facilitated the analysis of student-generated language products in learning analytics (LA), particularly through the use of NLP embedding models. Yet when it comes to science-related language, symbolic expressions such as equations and formulas introduce challenges that current embedding models struggle to address. Existing studies and applications often either overlook these challenges or remove symbolic expressions altogether, potentially leading to biased findings and diminished performance of LA applications. This study therefore explores how contemporary embedding models differ in their capability to process and interpret science-related symbolic expressions. To this end, various embedding models are evaluated using physics-specific symbolic expressions drawn from authentic student responses, with performance assessed via two approaches: similarity-based analyses and integration into a machine learning pipeline. Our findings reveal significant differences in model performance, with OpenAI's GPT-text-embedding-3-large outperforming all other examined models, though its advantage over other models was moderate rather than decisive. Beyond performance, additional factors such as cost, regulatory compliance, and model transparency are discussed as key considerations for model selection. Overall, this study underscores the importance for LA researchers and practitioners of carefully selecting NLP embedding models when working with science-related language products that include symbolic expressions.</description>
