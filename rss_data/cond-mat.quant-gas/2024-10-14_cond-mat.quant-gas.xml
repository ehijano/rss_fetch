      <title>Particle fluctuations in systems with Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle fluctuations in systems, exhibiting Bose-Einstein condensation, are reviewed in order to clarify the basic points that attract high interest and often confront misunderstanding. It is explained that the so-called ``grand canonical catastrophe", claiming the occurrence of catastrophic particle fluctuations in the condensed phase, treated by grand canonical ensemble, does not exist. What exists is the incorrect use of the grand canonical ensemble, where gauge symmetry is not broken, while the correct description of the condensed phase necessarily requires gauge symmetry breaking. The ideal Bose gas has no catastrophic condensate fluctuations, and moreover there are no condensate fluctuations at all, as soon as gauge symmetry is broken. However it does have anomalous fluctuations of uncondensed particles, which implies its instability. For interacting particles, there are no condensate fluctuations, as soon as gauge symmetry is broken, and anomalous fluctuations of uncondensed particles, when correctly calculated, do not appear. Particle fluctuations in the systems of trapped atoms are discussed. Canonical ensemble and grand canonical ensemble with broken gauge symmetry are equivalent with respect to the number of particle scaling.</description>

      <title>Observation of ergodicity breaking and quantum many-body scars in spinor gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate spinor gases driven by spin-flopping fields are excellent platforms for investigating ergodicity breaking and quantum scarring. We observe that specific initial states remain nonthermal at weak driving despite the majority of states thermalizing, which constitutes clear evidence of quantum many-body scars (QMBS). As the driving strength increases, the experimental system undergoes a smooth transition from integrable to weakly ergodicity breaking, which supports QMBS, and then to fully thermal. This is in agreement with the theoretical spectra, which predict towers of states dissolving with increasing driving strength. This work advances the study of QMBS and quantum scars with applications to, e.g., quantum information storage.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Free Localization for Benchmarking Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder-free localization (DFL) is a phenomenon as striking as it appears to be simple: a translationally invariant state evolving under a disorder-free Hamiltonian failing to thermalize. It is predicted to occur in a number of quantum systems exhibiting emergent or native \emph{local} symmetries. These include models of lattice gauge theories and, perhaps most simply, some two-component spin chains. Though well-established analytically for special soluble examples, numerical studies of generic systems have proven difficult. Moreover, the required local symmetries are a challenge for any experimental realization. Here, we show how a canonical model of DFL can be efficiently implemented on gate-based quantum computers, which relies on our efficient encoding of three-qubit gates. We show that the simultaneous observation of the absence of correlation spreading and tunable entanglement growth to a volume law provides an ideal testbed for benchmarking the capabilities of quantum computers. In particular, the availability of a soluble limit allows for a rigorous prediction of emergent localization length scales and tunable time scales for the volume law entanglement growth, which are ideal for testing capabilities of scalable quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Emergence of second-order coherence in the superradiant emission from a free-space atomic ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the second-order temporal coherence during the emission of a superradiant burst by an elongated cloud of cold Rb atoms in free space. To do so, we measure the two-times intensity correlation function $g_N^{(2)}(t_1, t_2)$ following the pulsed excitation of the cloud. By monitoring $g_N^{(2)}(t, t)$ during the burst, we observe the establishment of second-order coherence, and contrast it with the situation where the cloud is initially prepared in a steady state. We compare our findings to the predictions of the Dicke model, using an effective atom number to account for finite size effects, finding that the model reproduces the observed trend at early time. For longer times, we observe a subradiant decay, a feature that goes beyond Dicke's model. Finally, we measure the $g_N^{(2)}(t_1, t_2)$ at different times and observe the appearance of anti-correlations during the burst, that are not present when starting from a steady state.</description>

      <title>An optimal lower bound for the low density Fermi gas in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dilute Fermi gas in three dimensions interacting through a positive, radially symmetric, compactly supported and integrable potential in the thermodynamic limit. We establish a second order lower bound for the ground state energy density with an error term which is optimal in the sense that it matches the order of the next correction term conjectured by Huang-Yang in 1957.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive characterization of an apparatus for cold electromagnetic dysprosium dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the development of an advanced ultracold dysprosium apparatus, which incorporates a cold atom microscope (CAM) with a design resolution of a quarter micrometer. The CAM and the cooling and trapping regions are within the same vacuum glass vessel ensuring simple atom transport between them. We demonstrate the essential experimental steps of laser and evaporative cooling, lattice loading, transporting and precise positioning of a cloud of the bosonic isotope $^{164}$Dy at the CAM focal plane. Basic characterization of the CAM and future plans in enabling its full capacity are outlined. We also present a feasible platform for simulating complex spin models of quantum magnetism, such as the $XYZ$ model, by exploiting a set of closely spaced opposite parity levels in Dy with a large magnetic and electric dipole moment. We isolate a degenerate isospin-1/2 system, which possesses both magnetic and electric dipole-dipole coupling, containing Ising, exchange and spin-orbit terms. The last gives rise to a spin model with asymmetric tunable rates that depend on the lattice geometry.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Phases of Dipolar Gases through Quasicrystalline Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of frustration on extended supersolid states is a largely unexplored subject in the realm of cold-atom systems. In this work, we explore the impact of quasicrystalline lattices on the supersolid phases of dipolar bosons. Our findings reveal that weak quasicrystalline lattices can induce a variety of modulated phases, merging the inherent solid pattern with a quasiperiodic decoration induced by the external potential. As the lattice becomes stronger, we observe a super quasicrystal phase and a Bose glass phase. Our results, supported by a detailed discussion on experimental feasibility using dysprosium atoms and quasicrystalline optical lattice potentials, open a new avenue in the exploration of long-range interacting quantum systems in aperiodic environments. We provide a solid foundation for future experimental investigations, potentially confirming our theoretical predictions and contributing profoundly to the field of quantum gases in complex external potentials.</description>

      <title>Gauge potentials and vortices in the Fock space of a pair of periodically driven Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical study of the coupled dynamics of two species of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a double well potential where both the tunneling and the interatomic interactions are driven periodically in time. The population difference between the wells of each species gives rise to a two dimensional lattice in Fock space with dimensions given by the number of atoms in each BEC. We use a Floquet analysis to derive an effective Hamiltonian that acts in this Fock space and find that it contains an artificial gauge field. This system simulates noninteracting particles in a tight binding lattice subject to an additional harmonic potential and vector potential. When the intra-species interactions are attractive there is a critical value at which the ground state of the Floquet operator undergoes a transition from a Gaussian state to a quantized vortex state in Fock space. The transition can be quantified in terms of the angular momentum as well as the entanglement entropy of the ground state with both showing sudden jumps as the intra-species interactions become stronger. The stability of the vortex state vanishes in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Geometric Characterization of Many Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL phase geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary. We find that we can characterise the transition by comparing the thermodynamic limits of the MBQM and localization length as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. As such we find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL phase that relies only on the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured through lattice shaking or AC response measurements.</description>

      <title>Spatial Form Factor for Point Patterns: Homogeneous Poisson Point Process and Coulomb Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a spatial form factor (SFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the SFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the SFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The SFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the SFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The SFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process. We also introduce a generalization of the SFF applicable to arbitrary sets in a metric space.</description>
