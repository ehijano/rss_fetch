      <title>Super-Eddington accretion in protogalactic cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of massive black holes (BHs) exceeding $10^9\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ already at redshift $z &gt; 6$ challenges standard models of BH growth. Super-Eddington (SE) accretion has emerged as a promising mechanism to solve this issue, yet its impact on early BH evolution in tailored numerical experiments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the growth of BH seeds embedded in a gas-rich, metal-poor protogalaxy at $z \sim 15$, using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that implement a slim-disc-based SE accretion model. We explore a broad parameter space varying the initial BH mass, feedback efficiency, and spin. We find that SE accretion enables rapid growth in all cases, allowing BHs to accrete up to $10^5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ within a few $10^3$-$10^4$ years, independent of seed properties. Feedback regulates this process, both by depleting central gas and altering BH dynamics via star formation-driven potential fluctuations, yet even the strongest feedback regimes permit significantly greater growth than the Eddington-limited case. Growth stalls after less than $\sim$1 Myr due to local gas exhaustion, as no large-scale inflows are present in the adopted numerical setup. Our results show that SE accretion naturally leads to BHs that are over-massive relative to their host galaxy stellar content, consistent with JWST observations. We conclude that short, low-duty-cycle SE episodes represent a viable pathway for assembling the most massive BHs observed at early cosmic times, even starting from light seeds.</description>

      <title>The COLIBRE project: cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the COLIBRE galaxy formation model and the COLIBRE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. COLIBRE includes new models for radiative cooling, dust grains, star formation, stellar mass loss, turbulent diffusion, pre-supernova stellar feedback, supernova feedback, supermassive black holes and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The multiphase interstellar medium is explicitly modelled without a pressure floor. Hydrogen and helium are tracked in non-equilibrium, with their contributions to the free electron density included in metal-line cooling calculations. The chemical network is coupled to a dust model that tracks three grain species and two grain sizes. In addition to the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback, a subset of simulations uses black hole spin-dependent hybrid jet/thermal AGN feedback. To suppress spurious transfer of energy from dark matter to stars, dark matter is supersampled by a factor 4, yielding similar dark matter and baryonic particle masses. The subgrid feedback model is calibrated to match the observed $z \approx 0$ galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes, and black hole masses in massive galaxies. The COLIBRE suite includes three resolutions, with particle masses of $\sim 10^5$, $10^6$, and $10^7\,\text{M}_\odot$ in cubic volumes of up to 50, 200, and 400 cMpc on a side, respectively. The two largest runs use 136 billion ($5 \times 3008^3$) particles. We describe the model, assess its strengths and limitations, and present both visual impressions and quantitative results. Comparisons with various low-redshift galaxy observations generally show very good numerical convergence and excellent agreement with the data.</description>

      <title>How does feedback affect the star formation histories of galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation in galaxies is regulated by the interplay of a range of processes that shape the multiphase gas in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. Using the CAMELS suite of cosmological simulations, we study the effects of varying feedback and cosmology on the average star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies at $z\sim0$ across the IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and ASTRID galaxy formation models. We find that galaxy SFHs in all three models are sensitive to changes in stellar feedback, which affects the efficiency of baryon cycling and the rates at which central black holes grow, while effects of varying AGN feedback depend on model-dependent implementations of black hole seeding, accretion and feedback. We also find strong interaction terms that couple stellar and AGN feedback, usually by regulating the amount of gas available for the central black hole to accrete. Using a double power-law to describe the average SFHs, we derive a general set of equations relating the shape of the SFHs to physical quantities like baryon fraction and black hole mass across all three models. We find that a single set of equations (albeit with different coefficients) can describe the SFHs across all three CAMELS models, with cosmology dominating the SFH at early times, followed by halo accretion, and feedback and baryon cycling at late times. Galaxy SFHs provide a novel, complementary probe to constrain cosmology and feedback, and can connect the observational constraints from current and upcoming galaxy surveys with the physical mechanisms responsible for regulating galaxy growth and quenching.</description>

      <title>Evolution of galaxy attenuation curves driven by evolving dust mass and grain size distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impacts of the evolution of dust mass and grain size distribution within a Milky Way-like (MW-like) galaxy simulation on global attenuation curves, focusing on the optical-UV slope and the 2175 $AA$ bump. We discuss the contributions of star-dust geometry, scattering, and dust properties. Post-processing dust radiative transfer was performed using SKIRT based on the MW-like galaxy simulation. The simulation was carried out with GADGET4-OSAKA, which models the evolution of grain size distributions.
  For lower inclination angles (closer to face-on), the attenuation curve flattens over time up to t=1 Gyr, then becomes progressively steeper. This steeper slope arises from the interplay between scattering and the dust disk becoming more extended over time (changes in star-dust geometry). At higher inclination, scattering is suppressed, and the attenuation curves slightly steepen over time due to small-grain formation and the bias of observed UV light toward older stars. The bump strengthens on a timescale of ~250 Myr due to the formation of small carbonaceous grains. The bump strength is affected not only by the abundance of small grains but also by star-dust geometry. At higher $A_V$ or higher inclination, the bump weakens. These results may help interpret flatter attenuation curves and weaker bumps in high-redshift galaxies. Variations in star-dust geometry alter the amount of scattered photons escaping the galaxy, driving the anti-correlation between the slope and $A_V$. Scatter in this relation arises from differences in dust optical depth along and perpendicular to the line of sight, reflecting inclination and star-dust geometry. Additional contributions come from variations in grain size distribution and the fraction of obscured young stars.</description>

      <title>Catalogue of central stars of extragalactic planetary nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) are essential for understanding the final evolutionary stages of low- and intermediate-mass stars. However, their study in extragalactic environments remains challenging due to their intrinsic faintness and the limited availability of high-quality data. Aims. We aim to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date catalogue of extragalactic CSPNe in order to enable a more complete view of their physical properties across different galactic environments and metallicities. Methods. The catalogue was assembled using data from the most recent and reliable literature sources. Priority was given to collecting effective temperatures and luminosities that have either been directly reported or consistently derived. When available, spectral types or specific spectral features -- such as P-Cygni profiles or broad H${\alpha}$ emission lines -- were also included. This approach allowed for broader characterisation of the sample, even when accurate classifications are not available. Results. We present a new compilation of extragalactic CSPNe -- the largest to date -- comprising over 800 objects located in the Magellanic Clouds, NGC 300, NGC 5128, and fifteen other nearby galaxies. This catalogue enables, for the first time, a global comparison of CSPNe physical parameters beyond the Milky Way. Updated Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are provided featuring CSPNe from seven different galaxies, revealing trends and outliers that merit further investigation. The catalogue represents a valuable resource for future spectroscopic follow-up and for improving our understanding of post-AGB evolution in diverse galactic contexts.</description>

      <title>Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs). XXIV. 54 New Quasars and Candidate Obscured Quasars at $5.71 \le z \le 7.02$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic identification of 43 quasars and 11 candidate obscured quasars in the epoch of reionization (EoR) at $5.71 \le z \le 7.02$, along with 29 galaxies at similar redshifts. This is the 24th publication from the Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) project, which exploits the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) imaging survey to search for EoR quasars. The HSC-SSP survey has completed, and this paper is likely the final installment of major (unobscured) quasar discoveries from the SHELLQs project. In addition to the EoR objects, we identified five strong [O III] line emitters at $z &lt; 1$, 30 Galactic brown dwarfs, and 14 passive galaxies at $z \sim 2$, which contaminated our sample of photometric quasar candidates. The present paper focuses on describing the immediate outcome of the spectroscopic observations, while a statistical analysis of the full SHELLQs sample will be presented in our next publication.</description>

      <title>AGN jet evolution simulation with GADGET4-OSAKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets are powerful drivers of galaxy evolution, depositing energy and momentum into the circumgalactic and intracluster medium (CGM/ICM) and regulating gas cooling and star formation. We investigate the dynamics of jet evolution in the self-similar regime using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code Gadget4-Osaka, systematically varying jet launching schemes, artificial viscosity prescriptions, mass resolution, and jet lifetimes. Our analysis combines quantitative diagnostics of jet size and energetics with detailed morphological and thermodynamic characterizations from slice maps and phase diagrams. We find that jet lobe growth follows analytic self-similar scaling relations and converges with resolution, but is highly sensitive to the choice of artificial viscosity. While the overall jet size tracks self-similar predictions, the partitioning of thermal and kinetic energy departs significantly from the idealized picture, reflecting enhanced dissipation and mixing. These results establish robust benchmarks for SPH-based jet modeling, provide insight into the physical and numerical factors shaping jet--medium interactions, and lay the groundwork for future studies of AGN feedback in realistic galactic and cluster environments.</description>

      <title>The Bigfoot: A footprint of a Coma cluster progenitor at z=3.98</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoclusters, galaxy clusters' high redshift progenitors, hold the keys to understanding the formation and evolution of clusters and their member galaxies. However, their cosmological distances and spatial extensions (tens of Mpc) have inhibited complete mapping of their structure and constituent galaxies, which is key to robustly linking protoclusters to their descendants. Here we report the discovery of the Bigfoot, a tridimensional structure at $z = 3.98$ including 11 subgroups traced by 55 (700) spectroscopic (photometric) redshifts with JWST, extending over $15\times 37$ $\times 49{\rm{cMpc^3}}$ in the PRIMER-UDS field. Bigfoot's large-scale and mass function of member galaxies closely match constrained simulations' predictions for the progenitors of today's most massive clusters (${M_0} &gt; 10^{15} {M_{_ \odot }}$). All subgroups with ${M_{\rm{h}}} &gt; {10^{12.5}}{M_{_ \odot }}$ exhibit enhanced fractions of massive galaxies ($&gt;{10^{10.0} {M_{_ \odot }}}$) compared to lower-mass halos and the field, demonstrating the accelerated formation of massive galaxies in massive halos. The presence of this massive protocluster with a large central halo (${10^{13.0} {M_{_ \odot }}}$) in a JWST deep field bears important cosmological implication that favors high ${\sigma _8}$ of PLANCK cosmology over low-redshift probes.</description>

      <title>Global Hot Gas Excess in (U)LIRGs: Replicating Galactic Nuclei Scaling Relations between Diffuse X-ray Emission and Star Formation on Galaxy-Wide Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot ionized interstellar medium interlinks star formation and stellar feedback processes, redistributing energy, momentum, and material throughout galaxies. We use X-ray data from $Chandra$ to extract the hot gas emission from 78 of the most luminous infrared-selected galaxies in the local Universe. In the extreme star-forming environments, the intrinsic thermal X-ray luminosity of hot gas ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$) shows a significant excess over the predictions of the standard linear $L_{\rm X}$$-$SFR relation for most objects with very high star formation rates (SFRs). The contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) appears to have little impact on the global hot gas luminosity. For galaxies with SFR $\gt$ 50 ${M_{\rm \odot}}\,\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$, the Bayesian analysis gives a super-linear relation of ${\rm log}(L_{\rm 0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.34\,{\rm log}({\rm SFR}/{M_{\rm \odot}}\,{\rm yr^{-1}})+39.82$, similar to that found in the central regions of normal spiral galaxies. These results suggest a scenario in which the merger of galaxies delivers substantial amounts of gas, triggering intense star formation in both the nuclear region and the galactic disk, and ultimately enhancing the global thermal X-ray emission. The ratio of the apparent thermal luminosity in the 0.5$-$2 keV band ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm appar}$) to $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$ shows statistically significant negative correlations with the intrinsic column density ($N_{\rm H}$) and SFR. Moreover, in contrast to the luminosity ratio, SFR shows a moderate positive correlation with intrinsic $N_{\rm H}$. This suggests that the correlation between $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm appar}$/$L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$ and SFR may be driven by the underlying $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm appar}$/$L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$$-$$N_{\rm H}$ and SFR$-$$N_{\rm H}$ relations.</description>

      <title>On the internal structure of stellar streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new method for simulating stellar streams generated by globular clusters using angle-action coordinates. This method reproduces the variable mass-loss and variable frequency of the stripped stars caused by the changing tidal forces acting on the cluster as it moves along an eccentric orbit. The model incorporates realistic distributions for the stripping angle and frequency of the stream stars both along and perpendicular to the stream. The stream is simulated by generating random samples of stripped stars and integrating them forward in time in angle-frequency space. Once the free parameters are calibrated, this method can be used to simulate the internal structure of stellar streams more quickly than N-body simulations, while achieving a similar level of accuracy. We use this model to study the surface density of the stellar stream produced by the globular cluster M68 (NGC 4590). We select $291$ stars from the Gaia-DR3 catalogue along the observable section that are likely to be members of the stream. We find that the width of the stream is too large to be explained by stars stripped from the cluster alone. We simulate the stream using the present method and include the Gaia selection function and observational errors, and the process of separating the stream stars from the foreground. By comparing these results with the observed data, we estimate the age of the stream, or equivalently the cluster accretion time, to be $3.04_{-0.29}^{+5.63}$ Gyr, and the mass-loss of the cluster to be $0.496 \pm 0.030$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ arm$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Color dichotomy and gradients in the bulges and disks of EFIGI galaxies along the Hubble sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most outstanding questions in contemporary astrophysics is: What is the significance of galaxy morphology? What physical processes underlier the morphologies we observe and is a galaxy's internal structure driving its evolution (nature) or is it a sign of the external processes which drive galaxy evolution (nurture)? We aim to understand the color dichotomy and gradients in bulges and disks along the Hubble sequence. We fit S\'ersic functions to the 2D light distributions in the $g$, $r$, $i$ bands to bulges and disks of the large EFIGI sample of galaxies with high quality morphological classification. In early-type galaxies, bulges and disks have similarly red and nearly uniform colors. Disks become significantly bluer with increasing lateness of their types and bulges get slightly redder because of patchy dust. Disks have increasingly blue colors with increasing radius, whereas dust extinction and scattering leads to smaller effective radii of the bulges and lower steepness of the best-fit S\'ersic profiles in $g$ versus $i$. The impact is not uniform with Hubble type and the bulges of intermediate-type spirals (Sb-Sc) have the reddest mean colors, the largest scatter in their colors, and show the largest mean and scatter in their color gradients. Disks of the intermediate-type galaxies show the strongest color gradients. We interpret these properties of the bulges and disks of intermediate-type spirals as being due to dust extinction and scattering which we hypothesize to be an indicator of the gas content and inflow of gas. if early-type galaxies do evolve from massive spiral galaxies, typically intermediate-type spirals, these color gradients are signs of in-situ stellar growth within their bulges, likely driven by morphological structure in their disk. These results favor secular evolution (nature) as the primary driver of galaxy evolution in the local Universe.</description>

Abstract: We examined F814W and F606W images of dwarf galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope archive, which were obtained under the HST SNAP programs 17159 to 17797. Among 58 observed dwarfs located outside the Local Group, we found only a few objects that were confidently resolved into stars. We determined two new distances for the galaxies: dw1252+2215 ($5.32\pm0.20$ Mpc) and dw1234+3952 ($4.34\pm0.16$ Mpc) via the Tip of the Red Giant Branch. They turned out to be new probable dwarf satellites of the nearby luminous spiral galaxies NGC 4826 and NGC 4736, respectively. We also note that recent SNAP surveys vary in their productivity in measuring new galaxy distances by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Merger fraction in galaxy groups and clusters at z &lt; 0.2: A non-parametric morphological study with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the environmental dependence of galaxy mergers using high-resolution imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program. We focus on galaxy groups and clusters at $z &lt; 0.2$ identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a laboratory of galaxy environment. We develop a new non-parametric classification scheme that combines the Gini-$M_{20}$ statistics with the shape asymmetry parameter, enabling robust identification of mergers with both central concentration and outer morphological disturbances. Applying this method to a sample of 33,320 galaxies at $0.075 \leq z &lt; 0.2$ taken by the HSC, we identify 12,666 mergers, corresponding to a merger fraction of 38%. Our results are consistent with visual classifications from the GALAXY CRUISE project, validating the effectiveness of our method. We find that the merger fraction increases with redshift for all subsamples (field galaxies, galaxy pairs, and cluster members), and also shows a strong radial gradient within clusters, increasing toward the center. These trends suggest that merger activity is enhanced both at earlier cosmic times and in denser environments, particularly in galaxy groups. We also find tentative evidence that mergers may contribute to AGN triggering in cluster cores. Our study highlights the utility of combining non-parametric morphological diagnostics for large-scale merger identification and provides new insights into the role of environment in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Origins of Hot Halo Gas in Milky Way-Type Galaxies with SMUGGLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current galaxy formation models predict the existence of X-ray-emitting gaseous halos around Milky Way (MW)-type galaxies. To investigate properties of this coronal gas in MW-like galaxies, we analyze a suite of high-resolution simulations based on the {\it SMUGGLE} framework, and compare the results with X-ray observations of both the MW and external galaxies. We find that for subgrid models incorporating any form of stellar feedback, e.g., early feedback (including stellar winds and radiation) and/or supernova (SN) explosions, the total $0.5-2$\,keV luminosity is consistent {\it within uncertainties} with X-ray observations of the MW and with scaling relations derived for external disk galaxies. However, all models exhibit an X-ray surface brightness profile that declines too steeply beyond $\sim5$\,kpc, underpredicting the extended emission seen in recent eROSITA stacking results. Across all subgrid prescriptions, the simulated surface brightness and emission measure fall below MW observations by at least $1-2$ orders of magnitude, with the most severe discrepancy occurring in the no-feedback model. Our results suggest that (i) stellar feedback primarily shapes the innermost hot atmosphere (central $\sim5$\,kpc), with comparable contributions from early feedback and SNe to the resulting X-ray luminosity; (ii) additional mechanisms such as gravitational heating, AGN feedback, and/or Compton effects of GeV cosmic ray are necessary to generate the extended, volume-filling hot gaseous halo of MW-mass galaxies; (iii) the origins of hot corona in MW-like galaxies are partially distinct from those of the warm ($\sim10^5$\,K) gas, by combining our previous finding that the {\it SMUGGLE} model successfully reproduces the kinematics and spatial distribution of MW \ion{O}{6} absorbers \citep{2024ApJ...962...15Z}.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from absorption-line quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption Line Quasars (ALQs) generally exhibit significant outflows that may interact with the surrounding medium, resulting in radio emission. We selected a sample of 13 powerful radio-quiet (RQ) ALQs, where the UV outflow kinetic power is measurable, and detected nine of them with the Very Large Array at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz. The radio emission is mostly unresolved, indicating no emission beyond a spatial scale of ~ 1-3 kpc. In the nine detected objects, the radio spectral slope at 5.5-9.0 GHz is steep (&lt; -0.5) in five objects and is flat or inverted (&gt; -0.5) in four objects. We discuss how the steep-slope emission can be associated with the UV outflows, and how the flat-slope emission can be intrinsically steep but flattened by free-free absorption from the UV outflowing gas. However, we find no correlation between the radio luminosity and the estimated outflow kinetic power, which suggests that the outflows are not a major source of the observed radio emission. In addition, the radio loudness of these RQ ALQs is comparable to that of typical RQ quasars, implying that the UV outflows do not lead to excess radio emission. Follow-up radio observations can test the free-free absorption interpretation and can be used as a new probe for outflows in AGN.</description>

      <title>Investigating Little Red Dots with UV Excess: Are They the High-Redshift Siblings of Blue Hot DOGs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs), newly identified compact and dusty galaxies with an unexpectedly high number density observed by JWST, have an unusual "V-shaped" rest-frame UV to near-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED). A group of hyper-luminous, obscured quasars with excess blue emission, called Blue-excess Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (BHDs), also exhibit qualitatively similar SEDs to those of LRDs. They represent a rare population of galaxies hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting near the Eddington limit at redshifts z \sim 1--4. In this study, we compare their multi-wavelength SEDs to investigate whether LRDs, or a subset of them, could be high-redshift analogs of BHDs. Our analysis reveals that despite their similar "V-shape" SEDs, LRDs appear to be a different population than BHDs. The "V-shape" of BHDs appear at longer wavelengths compared to LRDs due to different selection strategies, suggesting LRDs have much less dust attenuation than typical BHDs. The bluer colors in the rest-frame infrared (continuum) emission of LRDs suggest the absence of hot dust heated by AGN accretion activities. We also argue that the blue excess in LRDs is unlikely from AGN scattered light. The compact morphologies and lower X-ray detection frequencies of LRDs suggest a distinct formation pathway from BHDs -- which are thought to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto central SMBHs following major galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>JWST Spectroscopic Insights Into the Diversity of Galaxies in the First 500 Myr: Short-Lived Snapshots Along a Common Evolutionary Pathway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature and spectroscopic diversity of early galaxies from a sample of 40 sources at z&gt;10 with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, the largest of its kind thus far. We compare the properties of strong UV line emitters, as traced by intense CIV emission, with those of more "typical" sources with weak or undetected CIV. The more typical (or "CIV-weak") sources reveal significant scatter in their CIII] line strengths, UV continuum slopes, and physical sizes, spanning CIII] equivalent widths of ~1-51 \r{A}, UV slopes of $\beta$~-1.6 to -2.6, and half-light radii of ~50-1000 pc. In contrast, CIV-strong sources generally occupy the tail of these distributions, with CIII] EWs of 16-51 \r{A}, UV slopes $\beta$&lt;-2.5, compact morphologies ($r_{50}$&lt;100 pc), and elevated star formation surface densities ($\Sigma_{SFR}$&gt;100 $M_{\odot}yr^{-1}kpc^{-2}$). Collectively these properties are consistent with concentrated starbursts that temporarily outshine the extended structure of the galaxy. Comparing average properties from composite spectra, we find the diversity of the sample is primarily driven by bursts and lulls of star formation on very short timescales (&lt;3 Myr), where strong CIV emitters are observed at the apex of these phases and sources devoid of emission lines represent periods of relative inactivity. An apparent association between strong CIV and enhanced nitrogen abundance suggests both features may be modulated by the same duty cycle and reflect a generic mode of star formation. We show that AGN are unlikely to be a significant contributor to this duty cycle based on a comparison of UV line diagnostics to photoionisation models, although some non-thermal activity cannot be fully ruled out. Our results support a unified evolutionary picture whereby transient bursts and lulls can explain the spectral diversity and early growth of bright galaxies in the first 500 Myr.</description>

      <title>A compact Keplerian-like disc and H30$\alpha$ emission towards the radio jet in the massive protostar W75N(B)-VLA3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying young, high-mass stellar objects is challenging for testing models of massive star formation due to their great distances, often kiloparsecs away. This requires extremely high-angular resolution to resolve features like accretion discs around massive protostars. Consequently, while powerful, collimated outflows are evident in massive protostars, the compact accretion discs anticipated at their centres are still proving difficult to pinpoint. This study presents ALMA continuum and molecular line observations at 1.3 mm of the massive protostar W75N(B)-VLA3. The observations achieve an angular resolution of $\sim$0.12$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$156 au). Dense gas tracers reveal a circumstellar disc of $\sim$450 au in radius surrounding VLA3, with an orientation perpendicular to its associated thermal radio jet. From the millimetre continuum, a total mass of $\approx$0.43-1.74 $M_\odot$ is estimated for the disc. The disc's velocity profile is consistent with Keplerian rotation around a protostar of $\approx$16 $M_\odot$. This adds VLA3 to the small number of massive disc-protostar-jet systems documented in the literature with a centrifugally supported disc with a radius less than 500 au. Additionally, we detected H30$\alpha$ recombination line emission towards the radio jet powered by VLA3. Despite limitations in the spatial and spectral resolution, our data reveal a very broad line, indicative of high-velocity motions, as well as a tentative velocity gradient in the jet's direction, thus favouring the H30$\alpha$ emission to originate from the radio jet. Should this interpretation be confirmed with new observations, W75N(B)-VLA3 could represent the first protostellar radio jet for which a thermal radio recombination line has been detected.</description>

      <title>A direct black hole mass measurement in a Little Red Dot at the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the redshift frontier have revealed a plethora of broad \Halpha emitters with optically red continua, named Little Red Dots (LRDs), which comprise 15-30\% of the high redshift broad line AGN population. Due to their peculiar spectral properties and X-ray weakness, modeling LRDs with standard AGN templates has proven challenging. In particular, the validity of single-epoch virial mass estimates in determining the black hole (BH) masses of LRDs has been called into question, with some models claiming that masses might be overestimated by up to 2 orders of magnitude, and other models claiming that LRDs may be entirely stellar in nature. We report the direct, dynamical BH mass measurement in a strongly lensed LRD at $z = 7.04$. The combination of lensing with deep spectroscopic data reveals a rotation curve that is inconsistent with a nuclear star cluster, yet can be well explained by Keplerian rotation around a point mass of 50 million Solar masses, consistent with virial BH mass estimates from the Balmer lines. The Keplerian rotation leaves little room for any stellar component in a host galaxy, as we conservatively infer $M_{\rm BH}/M_{*}&gt;2$. Such a ''naked'' black hole, together with its near-pristine environment, indicates that this LRD is a massive black hole seed caught in its earliest accretion phase.</description>

      <title>Detection of a white dwarf orbiting a Carbon-Oxygen depleted blue straggler in 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have employed deep far-UV observations secured with the Solar Blind Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to search for hot companions to five blue stragglers stars (BSSs) showing significant surface depletion of carbon (C) and oxygen (O), in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Such a chemical pattern has been interpreted as the chemical signature of the mass transfer formation process for the observed blue stragglers. The mass transfer origin is also expected to leave a "photometric signature" in the form of a UV-excess, as the stripped core of the donor star should be observable as a white dwarf (WD) companion orbiting the newborn BSS. We found strong evidence for the presence of a hot (T &gt; 20000 K) WD companion to one of the investigated BSS, indicating that it likely formed through mass transfer less than 12 Myr ago. This is the first simultaneous evidence of the chemical and the photometric signatures of the mass-transfer formation channel. The lack of evidence for a hot companion to the other investigated blue stragglers is consistent with the expectation that the photometric signature (as well as the chemical one) is a transient phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Pion dark matter in a $\theta$ vacuum: a thermal relic with sharp velocity-dependent self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As recently proposed, a non-vanishing topological angle may play a central role in QCD-like theories of dark matter (DM). In this work, we introduce a dark photon portal to the Standard Model in order to establish thermal equilibrium in the early Universe, and discuss the ensuing phenomenological constraints, including the stability of DM. The resulting dynamics accounts for the observed DM relic abundance and yields velocity-dependent DM self-interactions in astrophysical halos. Due to the sharp velocity dependence arising from a Breit-Wigner resonance, dedicated studies are required to assess the gravothermal evolution in detail, especially in the core-collapse regime. This is particularly timely in light of self-interacting DM interpretations of strong-lensing systems such as SDSS J0946+1006, which can be naturally explained within our framework.</description>

      <title>The fate of rotating massive stars across cosmic times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial mass and metallicity of stars both have a strong impact on their fate. Stellar axial rotation also has a strong impact on the structure and evolution of massive stars. In this study, we exploit the large grid of GENEC models, covering initial masses from 9 to 500 $M_{\odot}$ and metallicities ranging from $Z=10^{-5}$ (nearly zero) to 0.02 (supersolar), to determine the impact of rotation on their fate across cosmic times. Using the carbon-oxygen core mass and envelope composition as indicators of their fate, we predict stellar remnants, supernova engines, and spectroscopic supernova types for both rotating and non-rotating stars. We derive rates of the different supernova and remnant types considering two initial mass functions to help solve puzzles such as the absence of observed pair-instability supernovae. We find that rotation significantly alters the remnant type and supernova engine, with rotating stars favouring black hole formation at lower initial masses than their non-rotating counterparts. Additionally, we confirm the expected strong metallicity dependence of the fates with a maximum black hole mass predicted to be below 50 $M_{\odot}$ at SMC or higher metallicities. A pair-instability mass gap is predicted between about 90 and 150 $M_{\odot}$, with the most massive black holes below the gap found at the lowest metallicities. Considering the fate of massive single stars has far-reaching consequences across many different fields within astrophysics, and understanding the impact of rotation and metallicity will improve our understanding of how massive stars end their lives, and their impact on the universe.</description>

      <title>Identifying massive black hole binaries via light curve variability in optical time-domain surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) often display periodic variations in their emitted radiation, providing a distinctive signature for their identification. In this work, we explore the MBHBs identification via optical variability studies by simulating the observations of the LSST survey. To this end, we generate a population of MBHBs using the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model, focusing on systems with observed orbital periods $\leq$ 5 years. This ensures that at least two complete cycles of emission can be observed within the 10-year mission of LSST. To construct mock optical light curves, we first calculate the MBHB average magnitudes in each LSST filter by constructing a self-consistent SED that accounts for the binary accretion history and the emission from a circumbinary disc and mini-discs. We then add variability modulations by using six 3D hydrodynamic simulations of accreting MBHBs with different eccentricities and mass ratios as templates. To make the light curves realistic, we mimic the LSST observation patterns and cadence, and we include stochastic variability and LSST photometric errors. Our results show from $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-1}$ MBHBs per square degree, with light curves that are potentially detectable by LSST. These systems are mainly low-redshift ($z\lesssim1.5$), massive ($\gtrsim10^{7}\, M_{\odot}$), equal-mass (${\sim} 0.8$), relatively eccentric (${\sim}0.6$), and with modulation periods of around $3.5$ years. Using periodogram analysis, we find that LSST variability studies have a higher success rate ($&gt;$50%) for systems with high eccentricities ($e&gt;$0.6). Additionally, at fixed eccentricity, detections tend to favour systems with more unequal mass ratios. The false alarm probability shows similar trends. Circular binaries systematically feature high values ($\gtrsim 10^{-1}$). Eccentric systems have low-FAP tails, down to $\sim10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Astrophotometric search for massive stars in the Milky way. Confronting Random Forest predictions with available spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: Massive stars play a significant role in different branches of astronomy, from shaping the processes of star and planet formation to influencing the evolution and chemical enrichment of the distant universe. Despite their high astrophysical significance, these objects are rare and difficult to detect. With Gaia's advent, we now possess extensive kinematic and photometric data for a significant portion of the Galaxy that can unveil, among others, new populations of massive star candidates. In order to produce bonafide bright (G magnitude $&lt;$ 12) massive star candidate lists (threshold set to spectral type B2 or earlier but slight changes in this threshold also explored) in the Milky Way subject to be followed up by future massive spectroscopic surveys, we have developed a Gaia DR3 plus literature data based methodology. We trained a Balanced Random Forest (BRF) with the spectral types from the compilation by Skiff et al. (2014) as labels. Our approach yields a completeness of $\sim80\%$ and a purity ranging from $0.51 \pm 0.02$ for probabilities between 0.6 and 0.7, up to $0.85 \pm 0.05$ for the 0.9-1.0 range. To externally validate our methodology, we searched for and analyzed archival spectra of moderate to high probability (p $&gt;$ 0.6) candidates that are not contained in our catalog of labels. Our independent spectral validation confirms the expected performance of the BRF, spectroscopically classifying 300 stars as B3 or earlier (due to observational constraints imposed in the B0-3 range), including 107 new stars. Based on the most conservative yields of our methodology, our candidate list could increase the number of bright massive stars by $\sim$50\%. As a byproduct, we developed an automatic methodology for spectral typing optimized for LAMOST spectra, based on line detection and characterization guiding a decision path.</description>

      <title>Hyper Suprime-Cam Y3 results: photo-$z$ bias calibration with lensing shear ratios and cosmological constraints from cosmic shea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an independent calibration of the photometric redshift (photo-$z$) distributions for source galaxies in the HSC-Y3 weak lensing survey using small-scale galaxy-galaxy lensing. By measuring the tangential shear around spectroscopic lens galaxies from GAMA, SDSS, and DESI, divided into fifteen narrow redshift bins, we compute shear ratios that are sensitive to the mean redshift of source galaxies. Using a blinded analysis, we derive constraints on the photo-$z$ bias parameters in source bins 2, 3 and 4, achieving signal-to-noise ratios of 59, 75, and 62, respectively. Our constraints for $\Delta z_2$, $\Delta z_3$ and $\Delta z_4$ are consistent with those from HSC-Y3 cosmic shear modeling. We observe a mild shift in the $\Delta z_3$-$\Delta z_4$ plane due to the heterogeneous depth of the lens sample, which disappears when using only DESI-DR1 lenses. Combining shear-ratio measurements with cosmic shear data, we obtain joint constraints on cosmological parameters: $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.286_{-0.074}^{+0.038}$ and $S_8 = 0.760_{-0.145}^{+0.044}$, consistent with cosmic shear-only results. This work demonstrates the utility of small-scale lensing as an independent probe for calibrating photometric redshift bias in weak lensing cosmology.</description>

      <title>Inferring local quasar IGM damping wing constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wings towards quasars are a highly sensitive probe of the neutral hydrogen (HI) content in the foreground intergalactic medium (IGM), not only constraining the global timing of reionization but also the \textit{local} ionization topology near the quasar. Near-optimal extraction of this information is possible with the help of two recently introduced reionization model-independent summary statistics of the HI distribution in the IGM \textit{before} the quasar started shining, complemented with the quasar's lifetime encoding the effect of its ionizing radiation as a third parameter. We introduce a fully Bayesian JAX-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference framework that allows us to jointly reconstruct the quasar's unknown continuum and constrain these local damping wing statistics. We put forward a probabilistic framework that allows us to tie these local constraints to any specific reionization model and obtain model-dependent constraints on the global timing of reionization. We demonstrate that we are able to constrain the (Lorentzian-weighted) HI column density in front of the quasar to a precision of $0.69_{-0.30}^{+0.06}\,\mathrm{dex}$ and its original distance to the first neutral patch before the quasar started shining to $31.4_{-28.1}^{+10.7}\,\mathrm{cMpc}$ (if a noticeable damping wing is present in the spectrum), extracting hitherto unused local information from the IGM damping wing imprint. Once tied to a specific reionization model, we find that the statistical fidelity of our constraints on the global IGM neutral fraction and the lifetime of the quasar improves, while retaining the same precision as achieved by pipelines that infer these parameters directly.</description>

      <title>First constraints on the local ionization topology in front of two quasars at z ~ 7.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thus far, Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wings towards quasars have been used to probe the \textit{global} ionization state of the foreground intergalactic medium (IGM). A new parameterization has demonstrated that the damping wing signature also carries \textit{local} information about the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) in front of the quasar before it started shining. Leveraging a recently introduced Bayesian \texttt{JAX}-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference framework, we derive constraints on the Lorentzian-weighted HI column density $N_\mathrm{HI}^\mathrm{DW}$, the quasar's distance $r_\mathrm{patch}$ to the first neutral patch and its lifetime $t_\mathrm{Q}$ based on JWST/NIRSpec spectra of the two $z \sim 7.5$ quasars J1007+2115 and J1342+0928. After folding in model-dependent topology information, we find that J1007+2115 (and J1342+0928) is most likely to reside in a $\langle x_\mathrm{HI} \rangle = 0.32_{-0.20}^{+0.22}$ ($0.58_{-0.23}^{+0.23}$) neutral IGM while shining for a remarkably short lifetime of $\log_{10} t_\mathrm{Q} /\mathrm{yr} = 4.14_{-0.18}^{+0.74}$ (an intermediate lifetime of $5.64_{-0.43}^{+0.25}$) along a sightline with $\log_{10} N_\mathrm{HI}^\mathrm{DW} /\mathrm{cm}^{-2} = 19.70_{-0.86}^{+0.35}$ ($20.24_{-0.22}^{+0.25}$) and $r_\mathrm{patch} = 28.9_{-14.4}^{+54.0} \,\mathrm{cMpc}$ ($10.9_{-5.9}^{+5.6} \,\mathrm{cMpc}$). In light of the potential presence of local absorbers in the foreground of J1342+0928 as has been recently suggested, we also demonstrate how the Lorentzian-weighted column density $N_\mathrm{HI}^\mathrm{DW}$ provides a natural means for quantifying their contribution to the observed damping wing signal.</description>

      <title>Lopsided and Bulging Distribution of Satellites around Paired Halos. I. Observational Measurements and Comparison with Halo-based Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the angular distribution of satellite galaxies in and around pairs of galaxy groups in SDSS and compare the results with the satellite distribution in pairs of dark matter halos by constructing mock catalogs that account for the same selection effects as the observational sample. We find that the angular distribution of satellites in both SDSS and the mock catalog exhibits a pronounced tendency towards lopsidedness, with satellites preferentially located between the two central galaxies. Additionally, there is a significant bulging distribution characterized by a higher concentration of satellites along the line connecting the two centrals compared to those found perpendicular to it. The lopsided and bulging distributions strengthen as pair separation and halo mass increase. The mock catalog successfully reproduces the observational results across all cases considered. We find that the lopsided and bulging distribution of satellites can largely be explained by overlapping two randomly selected halos matched in mass to the actual halo pairs, along with their surrounding satellite distribution, provided that the alignment between the orientations of the halos and the line connecting the halo pairs is taken into account. This suggests that the angular distribution of satellites is a natural consequence of the formation and evolution of large-scale structure in a $\Lambda$CDM universe, eliminating the need to introduce other physical origins.</description>

      <title>Universal Density and Velocity Distributions of Dark Matter around Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution of dark matter at the galactic center, crucial for indirect searches, remains uncertain. In particular, in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of a galaxy where indirect signals may be stronger, the density of a dark matter spike may undergo redistribution. Here we calculate the density surrounding Schwarzschild black holes that originate from diverse initial dark halos and estimate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. By employing a series of Hernquist and power-law initial dark halos, we obtain a fitting formula between dark matter spikes and black hole masses. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is utilized to approximate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. As an application, taking into account dark matter self-annihilation, we assess the relic densities of dark matter spikes around black holes. We find that the relic spikes for s-wave annihilation are higher than p-wave annihilation, and the relic densities obtained for p-wave annihilation depend on the velocity distribution, varying significantly with distance. The findings shall further provide useful insights for multi-messenger dark matter detections in the future.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Early Release Observations -- Interplay between dwarf galaxies and their globular clusters in the Perseus galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of globular clusters (GCs) of dwarf galaxies in the Perseus galaxy cluster to explore the relationship between dwarf galaxy properties and their GCs. Our focus is on GC numbers ($N_{\rm GC}$) and GC half-number radii ($R_{\rm GC}$) around dwarf galaxies, and their relations with host galaxy stellar masses ($M_*$), central surface brightnesses ($\mu_0$), and effective radii ($R_{\rm e}$). Interestingly, we find that at a given stellar mass, $R_{\rm GC}$ is almost independent of the host galaxy $\mu_0$ and $R_{\rm e}$, while $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}$ depends on $\mu_0$ and $R_{\rm e}$; lower surface brightness and diffuse dwarf galaxies show $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}\approx 1$ while higher surface brightness and compact dwarf galaxies show $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}\approx 1.5$-$2$. This means that for dwarf galaxies of similar stellar mass, the GCs have a similar median extent; however, their distribution is different from the field stars of their host. Additionally, low surface brightness and diffuse dwarf galaxies on average have a higher $N_{\rm GC}$ than high surface brightness and compact dwarf galaxies at any given stellar mass. We also find that UDGs (ultra-diffuse galaxies) and non-UDGs have similar $R_{\rm GC}$, while UDGs have smaller $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}$ (typically less than 1) and 3-4 times higher $N_{\rm GC}$ than non-UDGs. Examining nucleated and not-nucleated dwarf galaxies, we find that for $M_*&gt;10^8M_{\odot}$, nucleated dwarf galaxies seem to have smaller $R_{\rm GC}$ and $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}$, with no significant differences between their $N_{\rm GC}$, except at $M_*&lt;10^8M_{\odot}$ where the nucleated dwarf galaxies tend to have a higher $N_{\rm GC}$. Lastly, we explore the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) of dwarf galaxies and conclude that the Perseus cluster dwarf galaxies follow the expected SHMR at $z=0$ extrapolated down to $M_*=10^6M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Euclid and Roman with JWST Could Reveal Quasars at up to $z \sim$ 15</title>

Abstract: Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found at the centers of most galaxies today, over 300 have now been discovered at $z &gt;$ 6, including UHZ1 at $z = 10.1$ and GHZ9 at $z =$ 10.4. They are thought to form when 10$^4$ - 10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$ primordial stars die as direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) at $z \sim$ 20 - 25. While studies have shown that DCBHs should be visible at birth at $z \gtrsim$ 20 in the near infrared (NIR) to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), none have considered SMBH detections at later stages growth down to $z \sim$ 6 - 7. Here, we present continuum NIR luminosities for a BH like ULAS J1120+0641, a $1.35 \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ quasar at $z =$ 7.1, from a cosmological simulation for Euclid, the Roman Space Telescope (RST) and JWST bands from $z =$ 6 - 15. We find that Euclid and RST could detect such BHs, including others like UHZ1 and GHZ9, at much earlier stages of evolution, out to $z \sim$ 14 - 15, and that their redshifts could be confirmed spectroscopically with JWST. Synergies between these three telescopes could thus reveal the numbers of SMBHs at much higher redshifts and discriminate between their evolution pathways because Euclid and RST can capture large numbers of them in wide-field surveys for further study by JWST.</description>

      <title>Blowing Star Formation Away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- IV. Serendipitous discovery of a $z\sim2.9$ star-forming galaxy lensed by the galactic bulge of CGCG 012-070 using JWST NIRSpec</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06696v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of a gravitationally lensed galaxy by the nearby spiral galaxy CGCG 012-070 ($z = 0.048$) using Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The lensed galaxy is identified through the flux distributions of emission lines in the rest-frame optical, consistent with a source located at a redshift of $z\sim2.89$. The system is detected in [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$ emission lines, exhibiting line ratios typical of a star-forming galaxy. The emission-line flux distributions reveal three distinct components, which are modeled using an elliptical power-law (EPL) mass profile for the lens galaxy. This model provides a good characterization of the source and reveals a disturbed star-forming morphology consistent with those of galaxies at cosmic noon. This serendipitous discovery of a rare low-redshift strong lens highlights the critical role of IFU observations in expanding the lens census and advancing our understanding of galaxy mass profiles and evolution.</description>

      <title>A dual AGN at z = 5.4 associated with a Lyman-alpha Nebula in the Center of a Cosmic Filament</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictions from current theories and simulations suggest that dual AGN systems are exceedingly rare at high redshifts. The intense radiation and powerful outflows from AGNs regulate star formation, heat the interstellar medium, and drive massive gas outflows that shape the host galaxy and its surroundings. One manifestation of AGN feedback is the creation of extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. However, identifying these systems at high-$z$ is challenging. Here, we report a remarkable dual AGN candidate at $z \sim 5.4$ using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec, with a separation of $\sim1.7$ arcseconds ($\sim10.4$ pkpc). This is one of the highest spectroscopically confirmed redshift dual AGNs discovered. Photometric SED fitting shows excellent agreement with AGN templates, strongly suggesting a rare dual AGN system. BPT diagrams and high ionisation lines further support the presence of AGNs. VLT/MUSE observations reveal strong extended Ly$\alpha$ emission, extending to $&gt;22$ kpc, making it one of the most extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae at $z \sim 6$. This provides observational evidence of anisotropic AGN-driven photoionization or shocks. The high Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction also indicates an AGN outflow. This dual AGN candidate is also associated with a well-defined overdensity, potentially at the center of a $z \sim 5.4$ protocluster or filamentary structure node. Further analysis indicates the fraction of dual AGNs is significantly higher than theoretically expected at high redshifts. This discovery provides a new opportunity to study dual AGN interactions and their impact on the circumgalactic medium and cosmic structure evolution.</description>

      <title>HI gas in the rejuvenated radio galaxy PKS 2014-55</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new high-spectral-resolution MeerKAT observations of $\mathrm{HI}$ absorption against the central region of the restarted, giant, X-shaped radio galaxy PKS2014-55, which exhibits morphological evidence of three distinct cycles of activity. We report a wide component $(\mathrm{FWHM}=38 \pm 7~\mathrm{kms^{-1}})$ redshifted to $96 \pm 50~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$, a deep narrow detection $(\mathrm{FWHM}=19 \pm 6~\mathrm{kms^{-1}})$ redshifted to $160 \pm 40~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$, and a shallow component $(\mathrm{FWHM}=22 \pm 6~\mathrm{kms^{-1}})$ redshifted to $240 \pm 40~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$. One of the three components exceeds the typical rotational velocity of $100~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$, suggesting complex kinematics of the inflowing gas. These $\mathrm{HI}$ observations support the correlation between the occurrence of $\mathrm{HI}$ absorption and the rejuvenation of radio activity.</description>

      <title>An analytical model for the dispersion measure of Fast Radio Burst host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is sensitive to the electron distribution in the Universe, making it a promising probe of cosmology and astrophysical processes such as baryonic feedback. However, cosmological analyses of FRBs require knowledge of the contribution to the observed DM coming from the FRB host. The size and distribution of this contribution is still uncertain, thus significantly limiting current cosmological FRB analyses. In this study, we extend the baryonification (BCM) approach to derive a physically-motivated, analytic model for predicting the host contribution to FRB DMs. By focusing on the statistical properties of FRB host DMs, we find that our simple model is able to reproduce the probability distribution function (PDF) of host halo DMs measured from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamic simulations, as well as their mass- and redshift dependence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model allows for self-consistent predictions of the host DM PDF and the matter power spectrum suppression due to baryonic effects, as observed in these simulations, making it promising for modelling host-DM-related systematics in FRB analyses. In general, we find that the shape of the host DM PDF is determined by the interplay between the FRB and gas distributions in halos. Our findings indicate that more compact FRB profiles require shallower gas profiles (and vice versa) in order to match the observed DM distributions in hydrodynamic simulations. Furthermore, the analytic model presented here shows that the shape of the host DM PDF is highly sensitive to the parameters of the BCM. This suggests that this observable could be used as an interesting test bed for baryonic processes, complementing other probes due to its sensitivity to feedback on galactic scales. We further discuss the main limitations of our analysis, and point out potential avenues for future work.</description>

      <title>47 Tuc in Rubin Data Preview 1: Exploring Early LSST Data and Science Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present analyses of the early data from Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1 (DP1) for the globular cluster 47 Tuc field. The DP1 dataset for 47 Tuc includes four nights of observations from the Rubin Commissioning Camera (LSSTComCam), covering multiple bands ($ugriy$). We address challenges of crowding in the inner region of the cluster and toward the SMC in DP1, and demonstrate improved star-galaxy separation by fitting fifth-degree polynomials to the stellar loci in color-color diagrams and applying multi-dimensional sigma clipping. We compile a catalog of 3,576 probable 47 Tuc member stars selected via a combination of isochrone, Gaia proper-motion, and color-color space matched filtering. We explore the sources of photometric scatter in the 47 Tuc color-color sequence, evaluating contributions from various potential sources, including differential extinction within the cluster. Finally, of the 72 well-characterized variables in the field, we recover five known variable stars, including three RR Lyrae and two eclipsing binaries, in the coadd-based object catalog, and identify 62 in the difference image-based object catalog. Although the DP1 lightcurves have sparse temporal sampling, they appear to follow the patterns of densely-sampled literature lightcurves well. Despite some data limitations for crowded-field stellar analysis, DP1 demonstrates the promising scientific potential for future LSST data releases.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal emission in the central starburst region of M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffuse non-thermal (NT) emission from the central starburst (CSB) of M82 has been measured at radio, X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Far-infrared (FIR), radio, and X-ray emission maps are mutually consistent, with radio and X-ray emissions spectrally similar - suggesting the latter to be Compton/FIR radiation. We present our analysis of 16.3 years of Fermi-LAT measurements, which - combined with newly-published VERITAS data - constitute the deepest, most extensive currently available gamma-ray dataset on M82. We model the NT radio to gamma-ray emission of the CSB as due to relativistic particles (CR). Key features of our models are the identification of the &gt;50 GeV emission as pionic and the use of X-ray and radio emission to calibrate the CRe spectrum. This enables determination of the zero-point and slope of the CRp (and secondary CRe) spectrum, and meaningful estimates of the energy densities of CR and magnetic fields. We consider all relevant radiative processes involving CR, and use published detailed descriptions of the soft radiation fields in the CSB region - the most important of which is the FIR field, modeled as a graybody. Our SED modeling indicates that 1) the &gt;10 GeV emission is mostly pionic, 2) the 0.1 &lt; E/GeV &lt; 10 emission is a combination of pionic and Compton/starlight (and subdominant NT bremss), 3) the &lt;0.1 GeV gamma-ray emission is leptonic, and 4) the radio spectrum arises from primary and secondary CRe synchrotron at comparable levels: the corresponding CRe populations are described by a PL and a curved spectrum, respectively. Averaged over the FIR graybody models, the CRp spectral index and energy density are 2.3 and 385 eV/cm3 (for n(H) = 200 1/cm3), the primary-CRe and CRp maximum energies are 30 GeV and 7 TeV, and the magnetic field is B = 120 uG. The derived CR and B energy densities are in equipartition.</description>

      <title>Indirect searches for realistic sub-GeV Dark Matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indirect searches for Dark Matter (DM) particles with mass in the MeV -- GeV scale have received significant attention lately. Pair-annihilations of such DM particles in the Galaxy can give rise to (at the same time) MeV to GeV $\gamma$-rays via prompt emission, sub-GeV $e^\pm$ in cosmic-rays, as well as a broad photon spectrum ranging from $X$-rays to soft $\gamma$-rays, produced by the DM induced $e^\pm$ via inverse Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation processes (collectively called `secondary emissions'). We focus on two representative realistic sub-GeV DM models, namely, the vector-portal kinetic-mixing model and the higgs-portal model, and perform a detailed study of the indirect detection constraints from existing $X$-rays, $\gamma$-rays and cosmic-ray observations, based on all of the above-mentioned signals. We also estimate the future prospects from the upcoming MeV photon telescope COSI, including all possible types of prompt and secondary emission signals. We compare our results with the constraints and (or) projections from cosmological and terrestrial observations. We find that, for both the sub-GeV DM models, the current observations constrain the annihilation cross-section at the level of $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim 10^{-27} {\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$, or lower for some specific mass ranges or under optimistic assumptions. Moreover, new unconstrained DM parameter space can be probed at the upcoming instruments like COSI, thanks to the inclusion of secondary photons which in many cases provide the dominant signal.</description>

      <title>JWST detection of a carbon dioxide dominated gas coma surrounding interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System, and only the second to display a clear coma. Infrared spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides the opportunity to measure its coma composition and determine the primary activity drivers. We report the first results from our JWST NIRSpec campaign for 3I/ATLAS, at an inbound heliocentric distance of $r_H=3.32$ au. The spectral images (spanning 0.6-5.3 $\mu$m) reveal a CO2 dominated coma, with enhanced outgassing in the sunward direction, and the presence of H2O, CO, OCS, water ice and dust. The coma CO2/H2O mixing ratio of $8.0\pm1.0$ is among the highest ever observed in a comet, and is 4.4-sigma above the trend as a function of heliocentric distance for long-period and Jupiter-family comets (excluding the outlier C/2016 R2). Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO2 ice line in its parent protoplanetary disk. A low coma H2O gas abundance may also be implied, for example, due to inhibited heat penetration into the nucleus, which could suppress the H2O sublimation rate relative to CO2 and CO.</description>
