      <title>Clickers in the '60s at a TYC?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At an AAPT conference years ago, a person noticed my badge, exclaiming "I always wanted to work at Foothill College!" They told me that in the 1960s, Foothill had a lecture hall where students as a class could give immediate feedback to their instructors via buttons at their seats, a forerunner to modern clicker systems. Intrigued, I later did a quick Google search and discovered that Foothill had an EDEX system in a 240-person lecture hall, which featured multiple-choice buttons at each seat that were networked to a computer at the instructor's section. This fact got tucked away, and I didn't think about it again until a recent hiring interview when a candidate from an R1 commented how TYCs were at the forefront of innovations in teaching. I remembered the EDEX system, and it reignited my curiosity.</description>

      <title>Construction of a Small-Scale Vacuum Generation System and Using It as an Educational Device to Demonstrate Features of the Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a vacuum generation system composed of a reciprocating compressor (3 tons of refrigeration) with an inverted-function that is ready to be hooked flexibly to a gas-tight container to create an evacuated enclosed atmosphere, without strict limitation of the size of that container. The evacuated container (or vacuum chamber) can serve in different purposes such as educational demonstration of the vacuum properties, extraction of perfumes from herbal resources, and preserving food. We tested the device and found it can reach a vacuum level of 26 inches of mercury in an environment with an atmospheric pressure of 28.5 inches of mercury. We compared the performance of our vacuum device to a rotary-vane vacuum pump of 1/4 horsepowers and found that the vacuum pump reaches a set test vacuum level of 25 inches of mercury before the compressor. We then demonstrated experimentally some features of the vacuum using the inverted compressor or the vane vacuum pump. These experiments serve some topics in physics for school students as well as two core subjects of mechanical engineering, namely fluid mechanics and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Teaching Reform and Exploration on Object-Oriented Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problems in our teaching on object-oriented programming are analyzed, and the basic ideas, causes and methods of the reform are discussed on the curriculum, theoretical teaching and practical classes. Our practice shows that these reforms can improve students' understanding of object-oriented to enhance students' practical ability and innovative ability.</description>

      <title>Performance of ChatGPT on tasks involving physics visual representations: the case of the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence-based chatbots are increasingly influencing physics education due to their ability to interpret and respond to textual and visual inputs. This study evaluates the performance of two large multimodal model-based chatbots, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4o on the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA), a conceptual physics inventory rich in visual representations such as vector fields, circuit diagrams, and graphs. Quantitative analysis shows that ChatGPT-4o outperforms both ChatGPT-4 and a large sample of university students, and demonstrates improvements in ChatGPT-4o's vision interpretation ability over its predecessor ChatGPT-4. However, qualitative analysis of ChatGPT-4o's responses reveals persistent challenges. We identified three types of difficulties in the chatbot's responses to tasks on BEMA: (1) difficulties with visual interpretation, (2) difficulties in providing correct physics laws or rules, and (3) difficulties with spatial coordination and application of physics representations. Spatial reasoning tasks, particularly those requiring the use of the right-hand rule, proved especially problematic. These findings highlight that the most broadly used large multimodal model-based chatbot, ChatGPT-4o, still exhibits significant difficulties in engaging with physics tasks involving visual representations. While the chatbot shows potential for educational applications, including personalized tutoring and accessibility support for students who are blind or have low vision, its limitations necessitate caution. On the other hand, our findings can also be leveraged to design assessments that are difficult for chatbots to solve.</description>

      <title>Pisarenko's Formula for the Thermopower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermopower $\alpha$ (also known as the Seebeck coefficient) is one of the most fundamental material characteristics for understanding charge carrier transport in thermoelectric materials. Here, we revisit the Pisarenko formula for the thermopower, which was traditionally considered valid only for non-degenerate semiconductors. We demonstrate that regardless of the dominating scattering mechanism, the Pisarenko formula describes accurately enough the relationship between thermopower $\alpha$ and charge carrier concentration $n$ beyond the non-degenerate limit. Moreover, the Pisarenko formula provides a simple thermopower-conductivity relation, $\alpha = \pm \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}}{e} (b - \ln \sigma)$, valid for materials with $\alpha &gt; 90$ $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ when acoustic phonon scattering is predominant. This offers an alternative way to analyze electron transport when Hall measurements are difficult or inaccessible. Additionally, we show how the Pisarenko formula can be used to estimate the maximum power factor of a thermoelectric material from the weighted mobility of a single, not necessarily optimized, sample at any given temperature.</description>
