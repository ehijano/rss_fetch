      <title>Traveling waves for SIR model on two-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the existence of traveling wave solutions for a SIR model on two-dimensional lattice. The existence of traveling waves is established within the framework of upper and lower solutions and the Schauder fixed-point theorem. Moreover, we construct a Lyapunov functional to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the traveling wave solutions. This is a challenging task due to the two-dimensional lattice structure.</description>

      <title>Passive Vibration-Driven Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a concept of passive, vibration-driven locomotion, in which a mechanical system achieves horizontal self-propulsion by resonantly harvesting energy from vertical environmental excitations (e.g. ambient vibrations of underwater pipelines), without a direct propulsive actuation. The system consists of a capsule containing an internal pendulum attached to its base mounted on a vertically vibrating substrate. The underlying locomotion mechanism relies on resonant energy transfer from the vertically vibrating substrate to the internal oscillatory element. Under appropriate forcing conditions and in the presence of asymmetric dissipative interactions, this internal oscillator induces a net unidirectional motion of the capsule. The analysis focuses on regimes of progressive motion arising in the vicinity of parametric resonances. Two asymptotic limits are considered: small-amplitude parametric excitation leading to a (2:1) resonant oscillatory motion of the pendulum, and large-amplitude excitation leading to a (1:1) resonant unidirectional rotational motion of the pendulum. Given the asymmetry of the dissipative force acting on the capsule, both resonant regimes result in a progressive motion of the capsule system. To identify optimal locomotion regimes in both cases, we employ tailored asymptotic approaches based on multi-scale expansions and direct averaging analysis. The resulting slow-flow and averaged-flow models reveal the full bifurcation structure of steady-state solutions associated with forward capsule motion for both low- and high- amplitude excitations. Analytical predictions are shown to be in good agreement with direct numerical simulations of the full capsule-pendulum system.</description>

      <title>Cantor sets in higher dimensions II: Optimal dimension constraint for stable intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a pair of compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \in \mathbb{N}$) can be separated by small deformations if the sum of their Hausdorff dimensions is less than $d$. In this paper, we demonstrate that this dimension constraint is optimal for regular Cantor sets. Specifically, for any prescribed Hausdorff dimensions whose sum is greater than $d$, we construct classes of pairs of regular Cantor sets that exhibit $C^{1+\alpha}$-stable intersections.
  Our method is geometrically flexible, enabling the construction of examples with arbitrarily small thickness in both projectively hyperbolic and nearly conformal regimes. These results also extend to the complex setting for holomorphic Cantor sets in $\mathbb{C}^d$. The proof relies on the ``covering criterion" for stable intersection introduced in the first part of this series \cite{NZ1}, which generalizes the ``recurrent compact set criterion" of Moreira-Yoccoz to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Martin Boundary and the Nonlinear Multiplicative Stochastic Heat Equation in Weak Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16126v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear multiplicative stochastic heat equation on Dirichlet spaces with white in time noise under weak disorder. We show that positive invariant random fields with uniformly bounded second moments are in one-to-one correspondence with bounded positive harmonic functions. The proof combines a remote past pullback construction with a uniqueness argument that applies a contraction inspired by chaos expansion. As a consequence, the space of invariant measures inherits geometric structure from the Martin Boundary. We further establish a small-noise Gaussian fluctuation result within each harmonic sector and show that the long-time behavior of solutions is completely determined by the Martin boundary data of the initial condition. These results reveal a direct connection between stochastic PDE dynamics and boundary theory in potential analysis.</description>

      <title>Autonomous and non-autonomous fixed-time leader-follower consensus for second-order multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of consensus tracking with fixed-time convergence, for leader-follower multi-agent systems with double-integrator dynamics, where only a subset of followers has access to the state of the leader. The control scheme is divided into two steps. The first one is dedicated to the estimation of the leader state by each follower in a distributed way and in a fixed-time. Then, based on the estimate of the leader state, each follower computes its control law to track the leader in a fixed-time. In this paper, two control strategies are investigated and compared to solve the two mentioned steps. The first one is an autonomous protocol which ensures a fixed-time convergence for the observer and for the controller parts where the Upper Bound of the Settling-Time (UBST) is set a priory by the user. Then, the previous strategy is redesigned using time-varying gains to obtain a non-autonomous protocol. This enables to obtain less conservative estimates of the UBST while guaranteeing that the time-varying gains remain bounded. Some numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed consensus protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lie theory of non-commutative integrability is used to reconstruct some integrable systems of ordinary differential equations in three dimensional Eucledian space. The Darboux-Brioschi-Halphen system is an example of the Lie integrable system associated with the simple Lie algebra sl(2,R). Other examples are related with solvable three dimensional real Lie algebras of Bianchi B class.</description>

      <title>Comet-type periodic motions and their out-of-plane bifurcations in the Earth-Moon CR3BP: a computational symplectic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comet-type periodic orbits of the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) are periodic solutions that are generated from very large retrograde and direct circular Keplerian motions around the common center of mass of the primaries. In this paper we first provide an analytical proof of the existence of comet-type periodic orbits by using the classical Poincar\'e continuation method. Within this analytical approach, we also determine their Conley-Zehnder index, defined as a Maslov index using a crossing form. Then, by applying a standard corrector-predictor technique, we explore numerically the two families of comet orbits within the Earth-Moon CR3BP. We compute their stability indices, identify vertical self-resonant orbits up to multiplicity six, investigate the vertically bifurcated periodic solutions and discuss their orbital characteristics. Our main results we illustrate in form of bifurcation graphs, based on symplectic invariants, which provide a topological overview of the connections of the bifurcated branches, including bridge families.</description>

      <title>Cantor sets in higher dimension I: Criterion for stable intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometry of dynamically defined Cantor sets in arbitrary dimensions, introducing a criterion for $\mathcal{C}^{1+\alpha}$ stable intersections of such Cantor sets, under a mild bunching condition. This condition is naturally satisfied for perturbations of conformal Cantor sets and, in particular, always holds in dimension one. Our work extends the celebrated recurrent compact set criterion of Moreira and Yoccoz for stable intersection of Cantor sets in the real line to higher-dimensional spaces. Based on this criterion, we develop a method for constructing explicit examples of stably intersecting Cantor sets in any dimension. This construction operates in the most fragile and critical regimes, where the Hausdorff dimension of one of the Cantor sets is arbitrarily small and both Cantor sets are nearly homothetical. All results and examples are provided in both real and complex settings.</description>

      <title>Generalized $u$-Gibbs measures for $C^\infty$ diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for every $C^\infty$ diffeomorphism of a closed Riemannian manifold, if there exists a positive volume set of points which admit some expansion with a positive Lyapunov exponent (in a weak sense) then there exists an invariant probability measure with a disintegration by absolutely continuous conditionals on smoothly embedded disks subordinated to unstable leaves. As an application, we prove a strong version of the Viana conjecture in any dimension.
  Our methods include developing a quantitative approach to high-dimensional Yomdin theory which allows to control the geometry of disks, and introducing a notion of ``measured disks" in order to provide a disintegration by absolutely continuous conditionals. In particular, we provide also a new proof for the case of surfaces (a previous result by the second author) proving directly the absolute continuity of conditionals rather than mere entropy estimates.</description>

      <title>Weighted Birkhoff Averages Accelerate Data-Driven Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many data-driven algorithms in dynamical systems rely on ergodic averages that converge painfully slowly. One simple idea changes this: taper the ends. Weighted Birkhoff averages can converge much faster (sometimes superpolynomially, even exponentially) and can be incorporated seamlessly into existing methods. We demonstrate this with five weighted algorithms: weighted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (wtDMD), weighted Extended DMD (wtEDMD), weighted Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (wtSINDy), weighted spectral measure estimation, and weighted diffusion forecasting. Across examples ranging from fluid flows to El Ni\~no data, the message is clear: weighting costs nothing, is easy to implement, and often delivers markedly better results from the same data.</description>

Abstract: The space of parametric b-measures endowed with appropriate topologies is introduced to define a new class of generalized ODEs given by parametric b-measures. This framework offers a new approach for dealing with precompact families of Carath\'eodory ODEs using nonautonomous dynamical systems techniques. An application to the study of the dynamics of the fast variables of a slow-fast system of ODEs, where the fast motion is determined by a Carath\'eodory vector field with equicontinuous $m$-bounds and bounded $l$-bounds, is given.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the connectedness of the fibers of integrable systems that extend complexity one $T$-spaces with proper moment maps, assuming that every tall singular point is non-degenerate. Our main result states that if there are no tall singular points with a hyperbolic block and connected $T$-stabilizer, then each fiber is connected. Moreover, we prove that the above condition is necessary if either some reduced space is simply connected or the moment map for the integrable system is generic in a natural sense.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we contribute to the study of the dynamics induced by the conjugation action on the space of subgroups of Baumslag-Solitar groups BS(m,n), via the mixing properties of elements asymptotically produced by suitable random walks on the group. In an acylindrically hyperbolic context, the authors of [HMO] demonstrated strong mixing situations, namely topological mu-mixing, a strengthening of high topological transitivity. Regarding non-metabelian and non-unimodular BS(m,n), we exhibit here a radically different situation on each of the pieces except one of the partition introduced in [CGLMS22] (although it is highly topologically transitive on each piece). On the other hand, when BS(m,n) is unimodular, we demonstrate the topological mu-mixing character on each of the pieces.</description>

      <title>Finite-size induced random switching of chimeras in a deterministic two-population Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-population Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for interacting populations of phase oscillators exhibits chimera states whereby one population is synchronised, and the other is desynchronised. Which of the two populations is synchronised depends on the initial conditions. We show that this deterministic model exhibits random switches of their chimera states, alternating between which of the two populations is synchronised and which is not. We show that these random switches are induced by the finite size of the network. We provide numerical evidence that the switches are governed by a Poisson process and that the time between switches grows exponentially with the system size, rendering switches unobservable for all practical purposes in sufficiently large networks. We develop a reduced stochastic model for the synchronised population, based on a central limit theorem controlling the collective effect of the desynchronised population on the synchronised one, and show that this stochastic model well reproduces the statistical behaviour of the full deterministic model. We further determine critical fluctuation sizes capable of inducing switches and provide estimates for the mean switching times from an associated Kramers problem.</description>

      <title>Learning Gradient Flow: Using Equation Discovery to Accelerate Engineering Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of data-driven equation discovery for dynamical systems to model and forecast continuous-time dynamics of unconstrained optimization problems. To avoid expensive evaluations of the objective function and its gradient, we leverage trajectory data on the optimization variables to learn the continuous-time dynamics associated with gradient descent, Newton's method, and ADAM optimization. The discovered gradient flows are then solved as a surrogate for the original optimization problem. To this end, we introduce the Learned Gradient Flow (LGF) optimizer, which is equipped to build surrogate models of variable polynomial order in full- or reduced-dimensional spaces at user-defined intervals in the optimization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on several standard problems from engineering mechanics and scientific machine learning, including two inverse problems, structural topology optimization, and two forward solves with different discretizations. Our results suggest that the learned gradient flows can significantly expedite convergence by capturing critical features of the optimization trajectory while avoiding expensive evaluations of the objective and its gradient.</description>
