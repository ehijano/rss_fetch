      <title>Managing Comprehensive Research Instrument Descriptions within a Scholarly Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In research, measuring instruments play a crucial role in producing the data that underpin scientific discoveries. Information about instruments is essential in data interpretation and, thus, knowledge production. However, if at all available and accessible, such information is scattered across numerous data sources. Relating the relevant details, e.g. instrument specifications or calibrations, with associated research assets (data, but also operating infrastructures) is challenging. Moreover, understanding the (possible) use of instruments is essential for researchers in experiment design and execution. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG) based approach for representing, publishing, and using information, extracted from various data sources, about instruments and associated scholarly artefacts. The resulting KG serves as a foundation for exploring and gaining a deeper understanding of the use and role of instruments in research, discovering relations between instruments and associated artefacts (articles and datasets), and opens the possibility to quantify the impact of instruments in research.</description>

      <title>Freshness, Persistence and Success of Scientific Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Team science dominates scientific knowledge production, but what makes academic teams successful? Using temporal data on 25.2 million publications and 31.8 million authors, we propose a novel network-driven approach to identify and study the success of persistent teams. Challenging the idea that persistence alone drives success, we find that team freshness - new collaborations built on prior experience - is key to success. High impact research tends to emerge early in a team's lifespan. Analyzing complex team overlap, we find that teams open to new collaborative ties consistently produce better science. Specifically, team re-combinations that introduce new freshness impulses sustain success, while persistence impulses from experienced teams are linked to earlier impact. Together, freshness and persistence shape team success across collaboration stages.</description>
