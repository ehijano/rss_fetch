      <title>Flux rope modeling of the 2022 Sep 5 CME observed by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter from 0.07 to 0.69 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As both Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) reach heliocentric distances closer to the Sun, they present an exciting opportunity to study the structure of CMEs in the inner heliosphere. We present an analysis of the global flux rope structure of the 2022 September 5 CME event that impacted PSP at a heliocentric distance of only 0.07 au and SolO at 0.69 au. We compare in situ measurements at PSP and SolO to determine global and local expansion measures, finding a good agreement between magnetic field relationships with heliocentric distance, but significant differences with respect to flux rope size. We use PSP/WISPR images as input to the ELEvoHI model, providing a direct link between remote and in situ observations; we find a large discrepancy between the resulting modeled arrival times, suggesting that the underlying model assumptions may not be suitable when using data obtained close to the Sun, where the drag regime is markedly different in comparison to larger heliocentric distances. Finally, we fit the SolO/MAG and PSP/FIELDS data independently with the 3DCORE model and find that many parameters are consistent between spacecraft, however, challenges are apparent when reconstructing a global 3D structure that aligns with arrival times at PSP and Solar Orbiter, likely due to the large radial and longitudinal separations between spacecraft. From our model results, it is clear the solar wind background speed and drag regime strongly affects the modeled expansion and propagation of CMEs and needs to be taken into consideration.</description>

      <title>A New Monte-Carlo Model for the Space Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Monte Carlo (MC) method to simulate the evolution of the low-earth orbit environment, enhancing the MIT Orbital Capacity Analysis Tool (MOCAT). In recent decades, numerous space environment models have been developed by government agencies and research groups to understand and predict the dynamics of space debris. Our MC approach advances this by simulating the trajectories of space objects and modeling their interactions, such as collisions and explosions. This aids in analyzing the trends of space-object and debris populations. A key innovation of our method is the computational efficiency in orbit propagation, which is crucial for handling potentially large numbers of objects over centuries. We present validation results against the IADC (Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee) study and explore various scenarios, including ones without future launches and those involving the launch of proposed megaconstellations with over 80,000 active payloads. With the improvement in computational efficiencies provided by this work, we can run these new scenarios that predict millions of trackable objects over a 200-year period. The previous state-of-the-art was 400,000 objects over the same period of time. Notably, while fewer megaconstellations are planned for altitudes above 800 km, even minimal failures in post-mission disposal or collision avoidance maneuvers can significantly impact orbital debris accumulation.</description>

      <title>The Alfv\'en Transition Zone observed by the Parker Solar Probe in Young Solar Wind -- Global Properties and Model Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from subAlfv\'enic to superAlfv\'enic flow in the solar atmosphere is examined by means of Parker Solar Probe (PSP) measurements during solar encounters 8 to 14. Around 220 subAlfv\'enic periods with a duration $\ge$ 10 minutes are identified. The distribution of their durations, heliocentric distances, and Alfv\'en Mach number are analyzed and compared with a global magnetohydrodynamic model of the solar corona and wind, which includes turbulence effects. The results are consistent with a patchy and fragmented morphology, and suggestive of a turbulent Alfv\'en zone within which the transition from subAlfv\'enic to superAlfv\'enic flow occurs over an extended range of helioradii. These results inform and establish context for detailed analyses of subAlfv\'enic coronal plasma that are expected to emerge from PSP's final mission phase, as well as for NASA's planned PUNCH mission.</description>

      <title>Cannibals in PARADISE: The effect of merging interplanetary shocks on solar energetic particle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events are associated with shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The merging of two CMEs (so-called Cannibalistic CMEs) and the interaction of their associated shocks, has been linked to some of the most powerful solar storms ever recorded. Multiple studies have focused on the observational aspects of these SEP events, yet only a handful have focused on modeling similar CME-CME interactions in the heliosphere using advanced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. This work presents, to our knowledge, the first modeling results of a fully time-dependent 3D simulation that captures both the interaction of two CMEs and its effect on the acceleration and transport of SEPs. This is achieved by using an MHD model for the solar wind and CME propagation together with an integrated SEP model. We perform different simulations and compare the behavior of the energetic protons in three different solar wind environments, where a combination of two SEP-accelerating CMEs are modeled. We find that particle acceleration is significantly affected by the presence of both CMEs in the simulation. Initially, less efficient acceleration results in lower energy particles. However, as the CMEs converge and their shocks eventually merge, particle acceleration is significantly enhanced through multiple acceleration processes between CME-driven shocks, resulting in higher particle intensities and energy levels.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Work Function on Dust Charging and Dynamics on the Airless Celestial Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The charged dust on the surface of airless celestial bodies, such as the moon and asteroids, is a threat to space missions. Further research on the charged dust will contribute to the success of space missions. In this paper, we study the charging and dynamics of dust particles with different work functions. By integrating the photoelectron energy distribution function over four illuminated areas with different work functions, we evaluated the photoelectron concentration in these four areas. At each area, using the photoelectron concentration, we solve the dust charging and dynamics equations with two different gravitational acceleration values. The results reveal that the dust with a larger work function can reach higher equilibrium states. These states include dominant photoelectron-related charging currents, charge numbers, and levitation heights. We suggest that the equilibrium states all hold a clear inverse relationship with the work functions of dust particles when the solar zenith angle varies from 0 to 90 degrees, displaying consistent trends under different gravitational accelerations. We also find that dust particles seem unable to stably levitate at a critical solar zenith angle. The value of this critical SZA follows the same rule subjected to the work function.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Three-dimensional Simulation of Surface Charging on Rotating Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface charging phenomenon of asteroids, mainly resulting from solar wind plasma and solar radiation, has been studied extensively. However, the influence of asteroid's rotation on surface charging has yet to be fully understood. Here neural network is established to replace numerical integration, improving the efficiency of dynamic three-dimensional simulation. We implement simulation of rotating asteroids and surrounding plasma environment under different conditions, including quiet solar wind and solar storms, various minerals on asteroid's surface also be considered. Results show that under typical solar wind, the maximum and minimum potential of asteroids will gradually decrease with their increasing periods, especially when solar wind is obliquely incident. For asteroid has period longer than one week, this decreasing trend will become extremely slow. During solar storm passing, solar wind plasma changes sharply, the susceptibility of asteroid's surface potential to rotation is greatly pronounced. Minerals on surface also count, plagioclase is the most sensitive mineral among those we explored, while ilmenite seems indifferent to changes in rotation periods. Understanding the surface charging of asteroid under various rotation periods or angles, is crucial for further research into solar wind plasma and asteroid's surface dust motion, providing a reference for safe landing exploration of asteroids.</description>
