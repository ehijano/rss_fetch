      <title>Market Beliefs about Open vs. Closed AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Market expectations about AI's economic impact may influence interest rates. Previous work has shown that US bond yields decline around the release of a sample of mostly proprietary AI models (Andrews and Farboodi 2025). I extend this analysis to include also open weight AI models that can be freely used and modified. I find long-term bond yields shift in opposite directions following the introduction of open versus closed models. Patterns are similar for treasuries, corporate bonds, and TIPS. This suggests that the movement of bond yields around AI models may be a function of not only technological advances but also factors such as licensing. The different movements suggest that markets may anticipate openness to have important economic implications.</description>

      <title>Cryptocurrencies and Interest Rates: Inferring Yield Curves in a Bondless Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In traditional financial markets, yield curves are widely available for countries (and, by extension, currencies), financial institutions, and large corporates. These curves are used to calibrate stochastic interest rate models, discount future cash flows, and price financial products. Yield curves, however, can be readily computed only because of the current size and structure of bond markets. In cryptocurrency markets, where fixed-rate lending and bonds are almost nonexistent as of early 2025, the yield curve associated with each currency must be estimated by other means. In this paper, we show how mathematical tools can be used to construct yield curves for cryptocurrencies by leveraging data from the highly developed markets for cryptocurrency derivatives.</description>
