      <title>Computing the determinant of links through Fourier-Hadamard transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method to compute the determinant of a link using Fourier-Hadamard transforms of Boolean functions. We also investigate the determinant of centrally symmetric links (a special class of strong achiral links). In particular, we show that the determinant of a centrally symmetric link with an even number of components is equals zero.</description>

      <title>Uniform Length Estimates for Trajectories on Flat Cone Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study trajectories on flat cone surfaces. We prove that on any area-one flat cone surface, the length of any trajectory $\gamma$ is bounded below by $b_1\sqrt{\iota(\gamma,\gamma)} - b_2$, where $\iota(\gamma,\gamma)$ is the self-intersection number of $\gamma$, and the coefficients $b_1$ and $b_2$ depend solely on the flat metric of the surface.
  Moreover, these coefficients $b_1$ and $b_2$ are uniform in restriction to convex flat cone spheres with a curvature gap bounded below and a number of singularities bounded above. This follows from a careful study of degenerations of flat structures in the corresponding moduli spaces. We even construct explicit values. Combining this result with the upper bound from arXiv:2308.08940, we conclude that any regular closed geodesic $\gamma$ satisfies
  $$c_1\sqrt{\iota(\gamma,\gamma)} \leq |\gamma| \leq a_1\sqrt{\iota(\gamma,\gamma)},$$ where $a_1$ and $c_1$ are explicit and uniform for any such flat sphere.
  Finally, we use these bounds to address some counting problems on convex flat cone spheres and convex polygonal billiards, deducing uniform bounds on counting functions over the corresponding moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Euler class one conjecture for fillable contact structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, it is proved that every oriented closed hyperbolic $3$--manifold $N$ admits some finite cover $M$ with the following property. There exists some even lattice point $w$ on the boundary of the dual Thurston norm unit ball of $M$, such that $w$ is not the real Euler class of any weakly symplectically fillable contact structure on $M$. In particular, $w$ is not the real Euler class of any transversely oriented, taut foliation on $M$. This supplies new counter-examples to Thurston's Euler class one conjecture.</description>

      <title>Lorenz links, T-links, Minimal Braids, Positive braids with a full twist, and Geometric Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorenz links and T-links are equivalent families of links by Birman and Kofman. Lorenz links are periodic orbits of the Lorenz system. T-links are links given by certain positive braids. Birman, Williams, and Franks proved that every Lorenz link has a positive braid with at least one full twist as a minimal braid. In this paper we study the geometric types of the Lorenz links from their minimal braid perspective. First, we compute their minimal braids explicitly in terms of the parameters of the T-links. We conclude that they are in equivalence with a family of links, called V-links, similar to a result of Birman and Kofman. Furthermore, we find an explicit relation to obtain an element of one of these families from the other. Then, we study conditions on positive braids with at least one full twist to find their geometric type. Finally, we apply these conditions on V-links to find new and generalize some families of satellite and hyperbolic T-links.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz fibrations with infinitely many sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Arakelov--Parshin rigidity theorem implies that a holomorphic Lefschetz fibration $\pi: M \to S^2$ of genus $g \geq 2$ admits only finitely many holomorphic sections $\sigma:S^2 \to M$. We show that an analogous finiteness theorem does not hold for smooth or for symplectic Lefschetz fibrations. We prove a general criterion for a symplectic Lefschetz fibration to admit infinitely many homologically distinct sections and give many examples satisfying such assumptions. Furthermore, we provide examples that show that finiteness is not necessarily recovered by considering a coarser count of sections up to the action of the (smooth) automorphism group of a Lefschetz fibration.</description>

      <title>On the boundary criterion for relative cubulation: multi-ended parabolics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we clarify that the boundary criterion for relative cubulation of the first author and Groves works even when the peripheral subgroups are not one-ended. Specifically, if the boundary criterion is satisfied for a relatively hyperbolic group, we show that, up to taking a refined peripheral structure, the group admits a relatively geometric action on a CAT(0) cube complex. We anticipate that this refinement will be useful for constructing new relative cubulations in a variety of settings.</description>

Abstract: Leveled spatial graphs are studied regarding other spatial graph properties, including being free or paneled. New graph invariants are defined for an abstract graph permitting a leveled embedding: the level number and the hamiltonian level number for hamiltonian graphs. The level numbers for complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs are obtained.</description>

      <title>Generating the liftable mapping class groups of regular cyclic covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$ be the mapping class group of the closed orientable surface of genus $g \geq 1$, and let $\mathrm{LMod}_{p}(X)$ be the liftable mapping class group associated with a finite-sheeted branched cover $p:S \to X$, where $X$ is a hyperbolic surface. For $k \geq 2$, let $p_k: S_{k(g-1)+1} \to S_g$ be the standard $k$-sheeted regular cyclic cover. In this paper, we show that $\{\mathrm{LMod}_{p_k}(S_g)\}_{k \geq 2}$ forms an infinite family of self-normalizing subgroups in $\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$, which are also maximal when $k$ is prime. Furthermore, we derive explicit finite generating sets for $\mathrm{LMod}_{p_k}(S_g)$ for $g \geq 3$ and $k \geq 2$, and $\mathrm{LMod}_{p_2}(S_2)$. For $g \geq 2$, as an application of our main result, we also derive a generating set for $\mathrm{LMod}_{p_2}(S_g) \cap C_{\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)}(\iota)$, where $C_{\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)}(\iota)$ is the centralizer of the hyperelliptic involution $\iota \in \mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the infinite ladder surface, and let $q_g : \mathcal{L} \to S_g$ be the standard infinite-sheeted cover induced by $\langle h^{g-1} \rangle$ where $h$ is the standard handle shift on $\mathcal{L}$. As a final application, we derive a finite generating set for $\mathrm{LMod}_{q_g}(S_g)$ for $g \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>JSJ decompositions of knot exteriors, Dehn surgery and the $L$-space conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06815v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we apply slope detection techniques to study properties of toroidal $3$-manifolds obtained by performing Dehn surgeries on satellite knots in the context of the $L$-space conjecture. We show that if $K$ is an $L$-space knot or admits an irreducible rational surgery with non-left-orderable fundamental group, then the JSJ graph of its exterior is a rooted interval. Consequently, any rational surgery on a composite knot has a left-orderable fundamental group. This is the left-orderable counterpart of Krcatovich's result on the primeness of $L$-space knots, which we reprove using our methods. Analogous results on the existence of co-orientable taut foliations are proved when the knot has a fibred companion. Our results suggest a new approach to establishing the counterpart of Krcatovich's result for surgeries with co-orientable taut foliations, on which partial results have been achieved by Delman and Roberts. Finally, we prove results on left-orderable $p/q$-surgeries on knots with $p$ small.</description>

Abstract: This paper uses the renowned Kechris-Pestov-Todor\v{c}evi\'{c} machinery to show that (big) mapping class groups are not extremely amenable unless the underlying surface is a sphere or a once-punctured sphere, or equivalently when the mapping class group is trivial. The same techniques also show that the pure mapping class groups, as well as compactly supported mapping class groups, of a surface with genus at least one can never be extremely amenable.</description>

      <title>Maps between Boundaries of Relatively Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: F. Paulin proved that if the Gromov boundaries of two hyperbolic groups are quasi-M\"obius equivalence, then those two hyperbolic groups are quasi-isometric to each other. This article aims to extend Paulin's results to relatively hyperbolic groups by introducing the notion of `relative quasi-M\"obius maps' between Bowditch boundaries of relatively hyperbolic groups. A coarsely cusp-preserving quasi-isometry between two relatively hyperbolic groups induces a homeomorphism between their Bowditch boundaries. We will show that the induced homeomorphism is relative quasi-M\"{o}bius and linearly distorts the exit points of bi-infinite geodesics to combinatorial horoballs. Conversely, we will show that if a homeomorphism between Bowditch boundaries of two relatively hyperbolic groups, preserving parabolic endpoints, is either relative quasi-M\"{o}bius or distorts the exit points of bi-infinite geodesics to combinatorial horoballs linearly, then that homeomorphism induces a coarsely cusp-preserving quasi-isometry between the relatively hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The volume conjecture relates the quantum invariant and the hyperbolic geometry. Bonahon-Wong-Yang introduced a new version of the volume conjecture by using the intertwiners between two isomorphic irreducible representations of the skein algebra. The intertwiners are built from surface diffeomorphisms; they formulated the volume conjecture when diffeomorphisms are pseudo-Anosov. In this paper, we explicitly calculate all the intertwiners for the closed torus using an algebraic embedding from the skein algebra of the closed torus to a quantum torus, and show the limit superior related to the trace of these intertwiners is zero. Moreover, we consider the periodic diffeomorphisms for surfaces with negative Euler characteristic, and conjecture the corresponding limit is zero because the simplicial volume of the mapping tori for periodic diffeomorphisms is zero. For the once punctured torus, we make precise calculations for intertwiners and prove our conjecture.</description>

This answers Brumfiel's question on the equivalence.

      <description>arXiv:2402.12471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosymplectic and normal almost contact structures are analogues of symplectic and complex structures that can be defined on 3-manifolds. Their existence imposes strong topological constraints. Generalized geometry offers a natural common generalization of these two structures: $B_3$-generalized complex structures. We prove that any closed orientable 3-manifold admits such a structure, which can be chosen to be stable, that is, generically cosymplectic up to generalized diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Linear Singer-Hopf conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $X$ is a closed $2n$-dimensional aspherical manifold, i.e., the universal cover of $X$ is contractible, then the Singer-Hopf conjecture predicts that $(-1)^n\chi(X)\geq 0$. We prove this conjecture when $X$ is a complex projective manifold whose fundamental group admits an almost faithful linear representation over any field. In fact, we prove a much stronger statement that if $X$ is a complex projective manifold with large fundamental group and $\pi_1(X)$ admits an almost faithful linear representation, then $\chi(X, {P})\geq 0$ for any perverse sheaf ${P}$ on $X$.
  To prove the main result, we introduce a vanishing cycle functor of multivalued one-forms. Then using techniques from non-abelian Hodge theories in both archimedean and non-archimedean settings, we deduce the desired positivity from the geometry of pure and mixed period maps.</description>
