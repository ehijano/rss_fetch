      <title>DynamicAdaptiveClimb: Adaptive Cache Replacement with Dynamic Resizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient cache management is critical for optimizing the system performance, and numerous caching mechanisms have been proposed, each exploring various insertion and eviction strategies. In this paper, we present AdaptiveClimb and its extension, DynamicAdaptiveClimb, two novel cache replacement policies that leverage lightweight, cache adaptation to outperform traditional approaches. Unlike classic Least Recently Used (LRU) and Incremental Rank Progress (CLIMB) policies, AdaptiveClimb dynamically adjusts the promotion distance (jump) of the cached objects based on recent hit and miss patterns, requiring only a single tunable parameter and no per-item statistics. This enables rapid adaptation to changing access distributions while maintaining low overhead. Building on this foundation, DynamicAdaptiveClimb further enhances adaptability by automatically tuning the cache size in response to workload demands. Our comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of real-world traces, including 1067 traces from 6 different datasets, demonstrates that DynamicAdaptiveClimb consistently achieves substantial speedups and higher hit ratios compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, our approach achieves up to a 29% improvement in hit ratio and a substantial reduction in miss penalties compared to the FIFO baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the next-best contenders, AdaptiveClimb and SIEVE [43], by approximately 10% to 15%, especially in environments characterized by fluctuating working set sizes. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in delivering efficient performance, making it well-suited for modern, dynamic caching environments.</description>

      <title>MigGPT: Harnessing Large Language Models for Automated Migration of Out-of-Tree Linux Kernel Patches Across Versions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09474v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-tree kernel patches are essential for adapting the Linux kernel to new hardware or enabling specific functionalities. Maintaining and updating these patches across different kernel versions demands significant effort from experienced engineers. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across various domains, suggesting their potential for automating out-of-tree kernel patch migration. However, our findings reveal that LLMs, while promising, struggle with incomplete code context understanding and inaccurate migration point identification. In this work, we propose MigGPT, a framework that employs a novel code fingerprint structure to retain code snippet information and incorporates three meticulously designed modules to improve the migration accuracy and efficiency of out-of-tree kernel patches. Furthermore, we establish a robust benchmark using real-world out-of-tree kernel patch projects to evaluate LLM capabilities. Evaluations show that MigGPT significantly outperforms the direct application of vanilla LLMs, achieving an average completion rate of 74.07 for migration tasks.</description>
