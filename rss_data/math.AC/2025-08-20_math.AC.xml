      <title>Some results on the ideal-based cozero-divisor graph of a commutative ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let R be a commutative ring with identity and I be an ideal of R. The cozero-divisor graph with respect to I, denoted by $\Gamma''_I(R)$, is the graph of R with vertices {x \in R -I :xR +I \not=R} and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $x \not \in yR+I$ and $y \not \in xR+I$.In this paper, we obtained some results on $\Gamma''_I(R)$.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of the line graphs associated with the essential graphs of commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a finite commutative ring with unity $1 \neq 0.$ An ideal of $A$ is said to be essential if it has a non-zero intersection with every non-zero ideal of $A.$ The essential graph of $A$ is a simple undirected graph whose vertex set consists of all non-zero zero-divisors of $A.$ Two different vertices $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge precisely when the ideal formed by the annihilator of their product $uv$ is essential in $A.$ This paper examines the minimal embeddings of the line graph of the essential graph of $A$ into orientable surfaces as well as non-orientable surfaces. Our results include a complete classification of finite commutative rings for which the line graphs of their essential graphs is planar, outerplanar or have genus or crosscap number at most two. We also characterize all such non-local rings for which the line graph of their zero-divisor graph is outerplanar.</description>

      <title>The separating variety for matrix invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field $k$, and let $V$ be a vector space on which $G$ acts linearly. The separating variety $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is the subvariety of $V^2$ consisting of pairs of points indistinguishable by invariant polynomials in $k[V]^G$. Its geometry places restrictions on the existence of small separating sets, i.e. sets of invariants which distinguish the same points as the full algebra of invariants. The purpose of this article is to study the separating variety in the important special case where $G=\mathrm{GL}_p(\mathbb{C})$ acts on the set $V$ of $n$-tuples of $p \times p$ matrices by simultaneous conjugation. We define a purely combinatorial poset, $\mathcal{P}_{p,n}$, whose maximal elements are in 1-1 correspondence with the irreducible components of $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$. We show that $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is a variety of dimension $(n+1)p^2-1$, and determine its subdimension for all $n$ and $p$. In particular we show the subdimension is $(n+1)p^2-p$ if $n \geq 3$, or $n \geq 2$ and $p \geq 4$. In the case $n \geq 3$, we give a formula for the number of components of given codimension in $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$. We give explicit decompositions of $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ for all $n$ where $p=2,3$ or $4$. Our results in particular show that when $n\geq 2$ and $p\geq 4$, or $n\geq 3$ and $p=3$, $\mathbb{C}[V]^G$ does not contain a polynomial or hypersurface separating set. It was proven in arXiv:2202.05717 that the same is true if $n \geq 4$ and $p=2$. The author made a conjecture in arXiv:2211.17088 generalising the Skronowski-Weyman theorem for representations of quivers. The results of this paper prove that conjecture in two important special cases: for the quiver with one vertex and an arbitrary number, $n$, of loops, and for the quiver with two vertices and $n$ arrows between them.</description>

      <title>Elasticity of Orders with Prime Conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17957v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be an order in a number field whose conductor ideal $P := (R:\overline{R})$ is prime in the ring of integers $\overline{R}$. In this paper, we explore the factorization properties of such orders. Most notably, we give a complete characterization of the elasticity of $R$ in terms of its class group. We conclude with an application to the computation of class groups of certain orders.</description>

      <title>Fedder-type criterion for quasi-$F^e$-splitting and quasi-$F$-regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09015v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quasi-$F^e$-split and quasi-$F$-regular singularities, which generalize Yobuko's quasi-$F$-splitting. We establish Fedder type criteria that characterize these properties for hypersurfaces. These criteria offer explicit tools for computation and verification. As an application, we construct a counterexample to the inversion of adjunction for quasi-$F$-regularity and compute the quasi-$F$-split threshold of the cone over the ordinary cusp.</description>

      <title>Anick's conjecture for polyhedral products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that localised away from a finite set of primes, the loop space of a moment-angle complex is homotopy equivalent to a product of loops on spheres. This verifies a conjecture of Anick for such spaces. We also develop a method to reduce the study of the loops of more general polyhedral products to that of the loops on a moment-angle complex. As a consequence, we give $p$-local loop space decompositions of quasitoric manifolds, certain toric orbifolds and a wide family of polyhedral products. We also describe the additive structure of loop homology of simply connected polyhedral products in terms of polynomials studied by Backelin and Berglund.</description>
