      <title>On Riedtmann's well-behaved functors and applications to composites of irreducible morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey, we summarize some results in the literature involving the mesh category, which is a combinatorial representation of the category of modules over a finite-dimensional associative algebra. We discuss Riedtmann's well-behaved functors, which compare the mesh category with the module category, and discuss how the properties of these functors can be applied to study the problem of composing irreducible morphisms, which is the problem of deciding when the composition of n irreducible morphisms is non-zero and lies on the (n+1)-th power of the radical.</description>

      <title>A special class of prime ideals for infinite symmetric group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify an interesting special class of prime ideals in the finitary infinite symmetric group algebra. We show that the set of such ideals carries a semiring structure. Over the complex numbers, we establish a connection with spherical representations of (the Gelfand pair corresponding to) the infinite symmetric group. In positive characteristic, we investigate a close connection with the structure theory of symmetric tensor categories.</description>

      <title>On universal deformation rings and stable homogeneous tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{k}$ be a field of any characteristic and let $\Lambda$ be a finite dimensional $\mathbf{k}$-algebra. We prove that if $V$ is a finite dimensional right $\Lambda$-module that lies in the mouth of a stable homogeneous tube $\mathfrak{T}$ of the Auslander-Reiten quiver $\Lambda$ with $\underline{\mathrm{End}}_\Lambda(V)$ a division ring, then $V$ has a versal deformation ring $R(\Lambda,V)$ isomorphic to $\mathbf{k}[\![t]\!]$. As consequence we obtain that if $\mathbf{k}$ is algebraically closed, $\Lambda$ is a symmetric special biserial $\mathbf{k}$-algebra and $V$ is a band $\Lambda$-module with $\underline{\mathrm{End}}_\Lambda(V) \cong \mathbf{k}$ that lies in the mouth of its homogeneous tube, then $R(\Lambda,V)$ is universal and isomorphic to $\mathbf{k}[\![t]\!]$.</description>

      <title>Representations of the group of two-diagonal triangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a Lie group, $g = Lie(G)$ - its Lie algebra, $g*$ - the dual vector space and $\widehat G$ - the set of equivalence classes of unitary irreducible representations of $G$. The orbit method [1] establishes a correspondence between points of $\widehat G$ and $G$-orbits in $g*$. For many Lie groups it gives the answers to all major problems of representation theory in terms of coadjoint orbits. Formally, the notions and statements of the orbit method make sense when $G$ is infinite-dimensional Lie group, or an algebraic group over a topological field or ring $K$, whose additive group is self dual (e.g., $p$-adic or finite). In this paper, we introduce the big family of finite groups $G_n$, for which the orbit method works perfectly well. Namely, let $N_n(K)$ be the algebraic group of upper unitriangular $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ matrices with entries from $K$, and $F_q$ be the finite field with $q$ elements. We define $G_n$ as the quotient of of the group $N_{n+1}(F_q)$ over its second commutator subgroup.</description>

      <title>Branching rule on winding subalgebras of affine Kac-Moody algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by using the Lakshmibai-Seshadri paths, we give the branching rule for representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras to their winding subalgebras. As a corollary, we can describe branching multiplicities in the language of paths. An analog of Steinberg's formula for branching multiplicities is also given.</description>

      <title>Non-tempered Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for Archimedean general linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local non-tempered Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture suggests that, for a pair of irreducible Arthur type representations of two successive general linear groups, they have a non-zero Rankin-Selberg period if and only if they are "relevant". In this paper, we prove the "period implies relevance" direction of this conjecture for general linear groups over Archimedean local fields. Our proof is based on a previous result of Gourevitch-Sayag-Karshon on the annihilator varieties of distinguished representations. Combining with a recent result of P. Boisseau on the direction "relevance implies period'', this conjecture for general linear groups over Archimedean local fields is settled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will describe a combinatorial object to list the orbits in the ${\mathbb Z}$-graded Lie algebra, their Jordan bloc decomposition, their dimension, their dimension, the partial order and the equivariant local system (up to isomorphism) for four infinite families: two are for the symplectic groups and two are for the special orthogonal groups. These orbits and equivariant local systems appear in the study of perverse sheaves arising from graded Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>On the structure of Schur algebras $S(p, 2p)$ in odd characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homological properties of Schur algebras $S(p, 2p)$ over a field $k$ of positive characteristic $p$, focusing on their interplay with the representation theory of quotients of group algebras of symmetric groups via Schur-Weyl duality. Schur-Weyl duality establishes that the centraliser algebra, $\Lambda(p, 2p)$, of the tensor space $(k^p)^{\otimes 2p}$ (as a module over $S(p, 2p)$) is a quotient of the group algebra of the symmetric group. In this paper, we prove that Schur-Weyl duality between $S(p, 2p)$ and $\Lambda(p, 2p)$ is an instance of an Auslander-type correspondence.
  We compute the global dimension of Schur algebras $S(p, 2p)$ and their relative dominant dimension with respect to the tensor space $(k^p)^{\otimes 2p}$. In particular, we show that the pair $(S(p, 2p), (k^p)^{\otimes 2p})$ forms a relative $4(p-1)$-Auslander pair in the sense of Cruz and Psaroudakis, thereby connecting Schur algebras with higher homological algebra. Moreover, we determine the Hemmer-Nakano dimension associated with the quasi-hereditary cover of $\Lambda(p, 2p)$ that arises from Schur-Weyl duality. As an application, we show that the direct sum of some Young modules over $\Lambda(p, 2p)$ is a full tilting module when $p&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras: Finiteness and tameness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras are studied from the perspective of representation types. We establish that (like other representation types) the notions of $E$-finiteness and $E$-tameness are invariant under mutations of quivers with potentials. Consequently, we prove that, except for a few cases, a finite-dimensional Jacobian algebra $\mathcal{J}(Q,W)$ is $E$-tame if and only if it is $\operatorname{g}$-tame, if and only if it is representation-tame, and this holds precisely when $Q$ is of finite mutation type. Moreover, our results on laminations on marked surfaces lead to the classification of finite-dimensional $E$-finite Jacobian algebras. Consequently, we show that a finite-dimensional Jacobian algebra $\mathcal{J}(Q,W)$ is $E$-finite if and only if it is $\operatorname{g}$-finite, if and only if it is representation-finite, and this holds exactly when $Q$ is of Dynkin type. Furthermore, we provide an application of this result in the theory of cluster algebras. More precisely, the converse of Reading's theorem is established: if the $\operatorname{g}$-fan of the cluster algebra associated with a connected quiver $Q$ is complete, then $Q$ must be of Dynkin type.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions to the Klein--Gordon Equation via Reduction Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduction algebras (also known as generalized Mickelsson algebras, Zhelobenko algebras, or transvector algebras) are well-studied associative algebras appearing in the representation theory of Lie algebras. In the 1990s, Zhelobenko noted that reduction algebras have a connection to field equations from physics, whereas Howe's study of dual pairs in the 1980s signifes that the link originated even earlier. In this paper, we revisit the simplest case of a scalar field, working in arbitrary spacetime dimension $n\ge 3$, and in arbitrary flat metric $\eta_{ab}$. We recall that the field equations specialize to the homogeneous Laplace equation and the (massless) Klein--Gordon equation for appropriate metrics; correspondingly, there is a representation of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ (technically, $\mathfrak{sp}_2$) by differential operators and an associated reduction algebra. The reduction algebra contains raising operators, which provide a means to construct bosonic states $|a_1a_2\cdots a_\ell\rangle$ as certain degree $\ell$ polynomials solving the relevant field equation. We give an explicit formula for these solutions and prove that they span the polynomial part of the solution space. We also give a complete presentation of the reduction algebra and compute the inner product between the bosonic states in terms of the rational dynamical R-matrix.</description>

      <title>Germ expansion for SL(2) in arbitrary characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a local field of characteristic $p$ and $G$ be a connected reductive group over $F$. Recall that Shalika's germ expansion of orbital integrals of regular semi-simple elements near the identity, when it exists, is a sum indexed by the set of unipotent conjugacy classes in $G(F)$. Observe that if $G=SL(2)$ this set is always compact; it is finite if $p\ne2$ while it is uncountable if $p= 2$. As a consequence, Shalika's germ expansion for elliptic elements does not make sense if $p=2$. On the other hand the endoscopic expansion of elliptic orbital integrals always exists and yields a germ expansion equivalent if $p\ne2$ (up to a Fourier transform) to Shalika's germ expansion but is new if $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum cluster algebras and representations of shifted quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new quantization $K_t(\mathcal{O}^{sh}_{\mathbb{Z}})$ of the Grothendieck ring of the category $\mathcal{O}^{sh}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ of representations of shifted quantum affine algebras (of simply-laced type). We establish that our quantization is compatible with the quantum Grothendieck ring $K_t(\mathcal{O}^{\mathfrak{b},+}_{\mathbb{Z}})$ for the quantum Borel affine algebra, namely that there is a natural embedding $K_t(\mathcal{O}^{\mathfrak{b},+}_{\mathbb{Z}})\hookrightarrow K_t(\mathcal{O}^{sh}_{\mathbb{Z}})$. Our construction is partially based on the cluster algebra structure on the classical Grothendieck ring discovered by Geiss-Hernandez-Leclerc. As first applications, we formulate a quantum analogue of $QQ$-systems (that we make completely explicit in type $A_1$). We also prove that the quantum oscillator algebra is isomorphic to a localization of a subalgebra of our quantum Grothendieck ring and that it is also isomorphic to the Berenstein-Zelevinsky's quantum double Bruhat cell $\mathbb{C}_t[SL_2^{w_0,w_0}]$.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of the Lie superalgebra D(2,1;a)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every parabolic subgroup $P$ of a Lie supergroup $G$, the homogeneous superspace $G/P$ carries a $G$-invariant supergeometry. We address the question whether $\mathfrak{g}=\text{Lie}(G)$ is the maximal supersymmetry of this supergeometry in the case of the exceptional Lie superalgebra $D(2,1;a)$. For each choice of parabolic $\mathfrak{p}\subset\mathfrak{g}$, we consider the corresponding negatively graded Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak{m}\subset\mathfrak{g}$, and compute its Tanaka--Weisfeiler prolongations, with reduction of the structure group when required, thus realizing $D(2,1;a)$ via symmetries of supergeometries.
  This gives 6 inequivalent supergeometries: one of these is a vector superdistribution, two are given by cone fields of supervarieties, and the remaining three are higher order structure reductions (a novel feature). We describe those supergeometries and realize $D(2,1;a)$ supersymmetry explicitly in each case.</description>

      <title>Lie algebra homology with coefficients tensor products of the adjoint representation in relative polynomial degree 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The homology of free Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor products of the adjoint representation working over Q contains important information on the homological properties of polynomial outer functors on free groups. The latter category was introduced in joint work with Vespa, motivated by the study of higher Hochschild homology of wedges of circles.
  There is a splitting of this homology by polynomial degree (for polynomiality with respect to the generators of the free Lie algebra) and one can consider the polynomial degree relative to the number of tensor factors in the coefficients. It suffices to consider the Lie algebra homology in homological degree one; this vanishes in relative degree 0 and is readily calculated in relative degree 1.
  This paper calculates the homology in relative degree 2, which presents interesting features. This confirms a conjecture of Gadish and Hainaut.</description>

      <title>Generic infinite generation, fixed-point-poor representations and compact-element abundance in disconnected Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semidirect product $\mathbb{G}=\mathbb{L}\rtimes \mathbb{K}$ attached to a compact-group action on a connected, simply-connected solvable Lie group has a dense set of compact elements precisely when the $s\in \mathbb{K}$ operating on $\mathbb{L}$ fixed-point-freely constitute a dense set. This (along with a number of alternative equivalent characterizations) extends the Wu's analogous result for connected Lie $\mathbb{K}$, and also provides ample supplies of examples of almost-connected Lie groups $\mathbb{G}$ which do not have dense sets of compact elements, even though their identity components $\mathbb{G}_0$ do. This corrects prior literature on the subject, claiming the property equivalent for $\mathbb{G}$ and $\mathbb{G}_0$.
  In a related discussion we characterize those connected Lie groups $\mathbb{G}$ with large sets of $d$-tuples generating dense subgroups $\Gamma\le \mathbb{G}$ for which the derived subgroup $\Gamma^{(1)}$ fails to be finitely-generated: $\mathbb{G}$ must either be non-trivial topologically perfect or have non-nilpotent maximal solvable quotient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit formulas for the Frobenius-Hecke traces of the etale cohomology of certain strata of Kottwitz varieties (which are certain compact unitary type Shimura varieties considered by Kottwitz), in terms of automorphic representations and certain explicit polynomials. We obtain our results using the trace formula, representations of general linear groups over p-adic fields, and a truncation of the formula of Kottwitz for the number of points on Shimura varieties over finite fields.</description>

      <title>A Derived Decomposition for Equivariant $D$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:1705.04297v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the adjoint equivariant derived category of $D$-modules on a reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ carries an orthogonal decomposition in to blocks indexed by cuspidal data (in the sense of Lusztig). Each block admits a monadic description in terms a certain monad related to the homology of Steinberg varieties; this monad carries a filtration (the Mackey filtration) whose associated graded functor is given by the action of the relative Weyl group. Furthermore, we show that the Mackey filtration is generally non-split and thus the Springer-theoretic description of the entire equivariant derived category of $D$-modules appears to be substantially more subtle than either the case of the abelian category in earlier work of the author, or the derived category of nilpotent orbital sheaves in work of Rider and Russell. One notable feature of this setting is that the parabolic induction and restriction functors depend on the choice of parabolic subgroup containing a given Levi factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be a connected reductive group, P its parabolic subgroup. We consider the parabolic semi-infinite category of sheaves on the affine Grassmanian of G and construct the parabolic version of the semi-infinite IC-sheaf of each orbit. We establish some of its properties and relate it to sheaves on the Drinfeld compactification of the moduli stack Bun_P of P-torsors on a curve. We also relate the parabolic semi-infinite IC-sheaf with the dual baby Verma object on the spectral side.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an interpretation of the existing reduction process for extriangulated categories in general. This process allows us to obtain a new category which, for well-known cases, admits a triangulated structure. We will show that in general this new category is extriangulated but not necessarily triangulated.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brauer configuration algebras I: definitions and examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11468v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2017, Green and Schroll introduced a generalization of Brauer graph algebras which they call Brauer configuration algebras. In the present paper, we further generalize Brauer configuration algebras to fractional Brauer configuration algebras by generalizing Brauer configurations to fractional Brauer configurations. The fractional Brauer configuration algebras are locally bounded but neither finite-dimensional nor symmetric in general. We show that if the fractional Brauer configuration is of type S (resp. of type MS), then the corresponding fractional Brauer configuration algebra is a locally bounded Frobenius algebra (resp. a locally bounded special multiserial Frobenius algebra). Moreover, we show that over an algebraically closed field, the class of finite-dimensional indecomposable representation-finite fractional Brauer configuration algebras in type S coincides with the class of basic indecomposable finite-dimensional standard representation-finite self-injective algebras.</description>

      <title>The Representation Type of the Descent Algebras of Type $\mathbb{A}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06471v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the representation type of the descent algebras of type $\A$ in the positive characteristic case. The algebras have finite representation type only for a few small degrees; otherwise, they are wild. Our main reduction method relies on a surjective algebra homomorphism from a descent algebra of type $\A$ to another of lower degree. For small degree cases, we employ techniques from the representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras.</description>

      <title>Singular support for G-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a reductive group $G$, we introduce a notion of singular support for cocomplete dualizable DG-categories equipped with a strong $G$-action. This is done by considering the singular support of the sheaves of matrix coefficients arising from the action. We focus particularly on dualizable $G$-categories whose singular support lies in the nilpotent cone of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ and refer to these as nilpotent $G$-categories. For such categories, we give a characterization of the singular support in terms of the vanishing of its generalized Whittaker models.
  We study parabolic induction and restriction functors of nilpotent $G$-categories and show that they interact with singular support in a desired way.
  We prove that if an orbit is maximal in the singular support of a nilpotent $G$-category $\mathcal{C}$, the Hochschild homology of the generalized Whittaker model of $\mathcal{C}$ coincides with the microstalk of the character sheaf of $\mathcal{C}$ at that orbit. This should be considered a categorified analogue of a result of Moeglin-Waldspurger that the dimension of the generalized Whittaker model of a smooth admissible representation of a reductive group over a non-Archimedean local field of characteristic zero coincides with the Fourier coefficient in the wave-front set of that orbit.
  As a consequence, we give another proof of a theorem of Bezrukavnikov-Losev, classifying finite-dimensional modules for $W$-algebras with fixed regular central character. More precisely, we realize the (rationalized) Grothendieck group of this category as a certain subrepresentation of the Springer representation. Along the way, we show that the Springer action of the Weyl group on the twisted Grothendieck--Springer sheaves is the categorical trace of the wall crossing functors, extending an observation of Zhu for integral central characters.</description>

      <title>Lusztig sheaves and integrable highest weight modules in symmetrizable cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper continues the work of [10] and [6]. For any symmetrizable generalized Cartan Matrix $C$ and the corresponding quantum group $\mathbf{U}$, we consider the associated quiver $Q$ with an admissible automorphism $a$. We construct the category $\widetilde{\mathcal{Q}/\mathcal{N}}$ of the localization of Lusztig sheaves for the quiver with the automorphism of corresponding framed quiver and 2-framed quiver. Their Grothendieck groups give realizations of integrable highest weight module $L(\lambda)$ and the tensor product of integrable highest weights $\mathbf{U}-$module $L(\lambda_1)\otimes L(\lambda_2)$, and modulo the traceless ones Lusztig sheaves provide the (signed) canonical basis of $L(\lambda)$ and $L(\lambda_1)\otimes L(\lambda_2)$. As an application, the symmetrizable crystal structures on Nakajima's quiver/tensor product varieties and Lusztig's nilpotent varieties of preprojective algebras are deduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a covering theory for the fractional Brauer configurations and connect it with the coverings of the associated quivers with relations in the sense of Mart\'inez-Villa and De La Pe\~na. Among the results, we show the following: (1) The universal cover of any fractional Brauer configuration is simply connected and in type MS we construct explicitly the universal cover of fractional Brauer configurations; (2) The fundamental group of a fractional Brauer configuration $E$ in type S is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the of the associated quiver with relations $(Q_E,I_E)$; (3) A (regular) covering of fractional Brauer configurations induces a (Galois) covering of the associated fractional Brauer configuration categories; (4) Set up an analogy of Van Kampen theorem to calculate the fundamental group of any connected Brauer configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the integral category O of shifted affine quantum groups of symmetric and non symmetric types. To do so we compute the K-theoretic analog of the Coulomb branches with symmetrizers introduced by Nakajima and Weekes. This yields an equivalence of the category O with a module category over a new type of quiver Hecke algebras. At the decategorified level, this establishes a connection between the Grothendieck group of O and a finite-dimensional module over a simple Lie algebra of unfolded symmetric type. We compute this module in certain cases and give a combinatorial rule for its crystal.</description>

      <title>Classification of coadjoint orbits for the maximal unipotent subgroup in the simple group of type F_4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let N be the maximal unipotent subgroup in the simple algebraic group of type {\Phi}. It naturally acts on the space dual to the Lie algebra n of N, and this action is called coadjoint. Such orbits play the key role in the orbit method of A.A. Kirillov. In this work, we classify the orbits of this action in the case of {\Phi} = F_4 in terms of supports of canonical forms. This means that we will present a set S of linear forms such that for any coadjoint orbit there exists a unique form from S belonging to that orbit. The set of canonical forms will be explicitly described in terms of supports.</description>

      <title>Web bases in degree two from hourglass plabic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Webs give a diagrammatic calculus for spaces of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$-tensor invariants, but intrinsic characterizations of web bases are only known in certain cases. Recently, we introduced hourglass plabic graphs to give the first such $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$-web bases. Separately, Fraser introduced a web basis for Pl\"{u}cker degree two representations of arbitrary $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$. Here, we show that Fraser's basis agrees with that predicted by the hourglass plabic graph framework and give an intrinsic characterization of the resulting webs. A further compelling feature with many applications is that our bases exhibit rotation-invariance. Together with the results of our earlier paper, this implies that hourglass plabic graphs give a uniform description of all known rotation-invariant $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$-web bases. Moreover, this provides a single combinatorial model simultaneously generalizing the Tamari lattice, the alternating sign matrix lattice, and the lattice of plane partitions. As a part of our argument, we develop properties of square faces in arbitrary hourglass plabic graphs, a key step in our program towards general $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$-web bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce abelian $n$-truncated DG-categories as an $n$-dimensional analogue of abelian categories in the setting of DG-categories. When $n=1$, this recovers ordinary abelian categories, and when $n=\infty$, it corresponds to stable DG-categories. This notion serves as a DG-categorical analogue of abelian $(n,1)$-categories in the context of $(n,1)$-categories. We show that the homotopy categories of abelian $n$-truncated DG-categories acquire the structure of extriangulated and pretriangulated categories. Furthermore, we develop a general theory of abelian $n$-truncated DG-categories, including the analogues of the existence epi-mono factorizations of morphisms, as in classical abelian categories.</description>

      <title>What is a double star-product?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double Poisson brackets, introduced by M. Van den Bergh in 2004, are noncommutative analogs of the usual Poisson brackets in the sense of the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle: they induce Poisson structures on the space of $N$-dimensional representations $\operatorname{Rep}_N(A)$ of an associative algebra $A$ for any $N$. The problem of deformation quantization of double Poisson brackets was raised by D. Calaque in 2010, and had remained open since then.
  In this paper, we address this problem by answering the question in the title. We present a structure on $A$ that induces a star-product under the representation functor and, therefore, according to the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle, can be viewed as an analog of star-products in noncommutative geometry. We also provide an explicit example for $A=\Bbbk\langle x_1,\ldots,x_d\rangle$ and prove a double formality theorem in this case. Along the way, we invert the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle by introducing a notion of double algebra over an arbitrary operad.</description>

      <title>Ordered set partition posets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lattice of partitions of a set and its d-divisible generalization have been much studied for their combinatorial, topological, and representation-theoretic properties. An ordered set partition is a set partition where the subsets are listed in a specific order. Ordered set partitions appear in combinatorics, number theory, permutation polytopes, and the study of coinvariant algebras. The ordered set partitions of {1,\ldots,n} can be partially ordered by refinement and then a unique minimal element attached, resulting in a lattice Omega_n. This lattice has appeared while studying other combinatorial objects, but not as the central focus. The purpose of this paper is to provide the first comprehensive look at Omega_n. In particular, we show that it admits a recursive atom ordering, and study the action of the symmetric group S_n on associated homology groups, looking in particular at the multiplicity of the trivial representation. We also consider the related posets where every block has size either divisible by some fixed d at least 2 or congruent to 1 modulo d. Open problems and avenues for future research are scattered throughout.</description>
