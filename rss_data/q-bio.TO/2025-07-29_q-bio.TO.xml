      <title>A Mini Review on Tumor Organoid-on-a-Chip Technologies in Personalized Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tumor organoid-on-a-chip platforms represent a cutting-edge fusion of patient-derived organoids with microfluidic technologies, offering unprecedented capabilities for personalized cancer research. These systems overcome limitations of conventional models by enabling precise control over the tumor microenvironment, including nutrient gradients, fluid flow, and immune interactions. Tumor organoids recapitulate patient-specific tumor heterogeneity and genetic landscapes, while microfluidic chips provide dynamic perfusion and mechanical stimuli, enhancing physiological relevance. Together, they facilitate advanced applications such as high-throughput drug screening, immunotherapy testing, and metastasis modeling, showing superior predictive power for clinical outcomes. Despite challenges in standardization, scalability, and integration of complex tumor components, ongoing advances in hydrogel engineering, automation, and artificial intelligence are poised to accelerate their clinical translation. This review highlights current technologies, applications, and future directions of tumor organoid-on-a-chip systems, emphasizing their transformative potential in precision oncology.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised risk factor identification across cancer types and data modalities via explainable artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Risk stratification is a key tool in clinical decision-making, yet current approaches often fail to translate sophisticated survival analysis into actionable clinical criteria. We present a novel method for unsupervised machine learning that directly optimizes for survival heterogeneity across patient clusters through a differentiable adaptation of the multivariate logrank statistic. Unlike most existing methods that rely on proxy metrics, our approach represents novel methodology for training any neural network architecture on any data modality to identify prognostically distinct patient groups. We thoroughly evaluate the method in simulation experiments and demonstrate its utility in practice by applying it to two distinct cancer types: analyzing laboratory parameters from multiple myeloma patients and computed tomography images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, identifying prognostically distinct patient subgroups with significantly different survival outcomes in both cases. Post-hoc explainability analyses uncover clinically meaningful features determining the group assignments which align well with established risk factors and thus lend strong weight to the methods utility. This pan-cancer, model-agnostic approach represents a valuable advancement in clinical risk stratification, enabling the discovery of novel prognostic signatures across diverse data types while providing interpretable results that promise to complement treatment personalization and clinical decision-making in oncology and beyond.</description>
