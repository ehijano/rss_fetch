      <title>Relating interfacial Rossby wave interaction in shear flows with Feynman's two-state coupled quantum system model for the Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we show how Feynman's simplified model for the Josephson junction, as a macroscopic two-state coupled quantum system, has a one-to-one correspondence with the stable dynamics of two interfacial Rossby waves in piecewise linear shear flows. The conservation of electric charge and energy of the superconducting electron gas layers become respectively equivalent to the conservation of wave action and pseudoenergy of the Rossby waves. Quantum-like tunneling is enabled via action-at-a-distance between the two Rossby waves. Furthermore, the quantum-like phenomena of avoided crossing between eigenstates, described by the Klein-Gordon equation, is obtained as well in the classical shear flow system. In the latter, it results from the inherent difference in pseudoenergy between the in-phase and anti-phased normal modes of the interfacial waves. This provides an intuitive physical meaning to the role of the wavefunction's phase in the quantum system. A partial analog to the quantum collapse of the wavefunction is also obtained due to the existence of a separatrix between "normal mode regions of influence" on the phase plane, describing the system's dynamics. As for two-state quantum bits (qubits), the two-Rossby wave system solutions can be represented on a Bloch sphere, where the Hadamard gate transforms the two normal modes/eigenstates into an intuitive computational basis in which only one interface is occupied by a Rossby wave. Yet, it is a classical system which lacks exact analogs to collapse and entanglement, thus cannot be used for quantum computation, even in principle.</description>

      <title>Point-Charge Models and Averages for Electromagnetic Quantities Considered in Two Relativistic Inertial Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic quantities at a spacetime point have tensor Lorentz transformations between relatively-moving inertial frames. However, since the Lorentz transformation of time between inertial frames depends upon both the time and space coordinates, averages of electrodynamic quantities at a single time will in general depend upon the inertial frame, and will differ between inertial frames. Here we illustrate how the use of continuous charge and current distributions rather than point-charge distributions can lead to physically mystifying and even inaccurate results for electromagnetic quantities and physical phenomena. The discrepancy noted between the average electric field values in different inertial frames is particularly striking because it is first order in the relative velocity between the frames.</description>

      <title>On non-monochromatic plane-wave solutions of Maxwell's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.06510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In electrodynamics courses and textbooks the properties of plane electromagnetic waves in both conducting and non-conducting media are typically studied from the point of view of the prototype case of a monochromatic plane wave. In this article the more general, non-monochromatic case is examined, which better exploits the independence of the Maxwell equations and offers new insights in the study of electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically accurate and locking-free finite element implementation of first order shear deformation theory for plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A formulation of the asymptotically exact first-order shear deformation theory for linear-elastic homogeneous plates in the rescaled coordinates and rotation angles is considered. This allows the development of its asymptotically accurate and shear-locking-free finite element implementation. As applications, numerical simulations are performed for circular and rectangular plates, showing complete agreement between the analytical solution and the numerical solutions based on two-dimensional theory and three-dimensional elasticity theory.</description>
