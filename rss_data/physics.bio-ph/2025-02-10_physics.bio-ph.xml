      <title>Frustration In Physiology And Molecular Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecules provide the ultimate language in terms of which physiology and pathology must be understood. Myriads of proteins participate in elaborate networks of interactions and perform chemical activities coordinating the life of cells. To perform these often amazing tasks, proteins must move and we must think of them as dynamic ensembles of three dimensional structures formed first by folding the polypeptide chains so as to minimize the conflicts between the interactions of their constituent amino acids. It is apparent however that, even when completely folded, not all conflicting interactions have been resolved so the structure remains "locally frustrated". Over the last decades it has become clearer that this local frustration is not just a random accident but plays an essential part of the inner workings of protein molecules. We will review here the physical origins of the frustration concept and review evidence that local frustration is important for protein physiology, protein-protein recognition, catalysis and allostery. Also, we highlight examples showing how alterations in the local frustration patterns can be linked to distinct pathologies. Finally we explore the extensions of the impact of frustration in higher order levels of organization of systems including gene regulatory networks and the neural networks of the brain.</description>

      <title>Unified description of viscous, viscoelastic, or elastic thin active films on substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is frequent for active or living entities to find themselves embedded in a surrounding medium. Resulting composite systems are usually classified as either active fluids or active solids. Yet, in reality, particularly in the biological context, a broad spectrum of viscoelasticity exists in between these two limits. There, both viscous and elastic properties are combined. To bridge the gap between active fluids and active solids, we here systematically derive a unified continuum-theoretical framework. It covers viscous, viscoelastic, and elastic active materials. Our continuum equations are obtained by coarse-graining a discrete, agent-based microscopic dynamic description. In our subsequent analysis, we mainly focus on thin active films on supporting substrates. Strength of activity and degree of elasticity are used as control parameters that control the overall behavior. We concentrate on the analysis of transitions between spatially uniform analytical solutions of collective migration. These include isotropic and polar, orientationally ordered states. A stationary polar solution of persistent directed collective motion is observed for rather fluid-like systems. It corresponds to the ubiquitous swarming state observed in various kinds of dry and wet active matter. With increasing elasticity, persistent motion in one direction is prevented by elastic anchoring and restoring forces. As a consequence, rotations of the spatially uniform migration direction and associated flow occur. Our unified description allows to continuously tune the material behavior from viscous, via viscoelastic, to elastic active behavior by variation of a single parameter. Therefore, it allows in the future to investigate the time evolution of complex systems and biomaterials such as biofilms within one framework.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>

Abstract: Understanding the emergence and evolution of information handling is essential for unraveling the origins of life. Traditional genetic-first and metabolism-first models fall short in explaining how instructional information control systems naturally arise from molecular dynamics. To address this gap, we adopt an information-first approach, integrating Hofmeyr's (F, A)-systems -- an extension of Rosen's (M, R)-systems -- with temporal parametrization and multiscale causality. These models, which embody closure to efficient causation while remaining open to formal causation, provide a robust framework for primitive autopoiesis, anticipation, and adaptation. We establish a formal equivalence between extended (F, A)-systems and communicating X-machines, resolving self-referential challenges and demonstrating the hypercomputational nature of life processes. Our stepwise model traces the evolution of information handling from simple reaction networks that recognize regular languages to self-replicating chemical systems with memory and anticipatory capabilities. This transition from analog to digital architectures enhances evolutionary robustness and aligns with experimental evidence suggesting that chemical computation does not require life-specific chemistry. Furthermore, we incorporate open-ended evolutionary dynamics driven by computational undecidability and irreducibility, reinforcing the necessity of unconventional computing frameworks. This computational enactivist perspective provides a cohesive theoretical basis for a recently proposed trialectic between autopoiesis, anticipation and adaptation in order to solve the problem of relevance. By highlighting the critical role of hypercomputational processes in life's emergence and evolution, our framework offers new insights into the fundamental principles underlying biological information processing.</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Heterogeneity and Product Detachment in Templated Polymer Copying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Templated copolymerization, in which information stored in the sequence of a heteropolymer template is copied into another polymer product, is the mechanism behind all known methods of genetic information transfer. A key aspect of templated copolymerization is the eventual detachment of the product from the template. A second key feature of natural biochemical systems is that the template-binding free energies of both correctly-matched and incorrect monomers are heterogeneous. Previous work has considered the thermodynamic consequences of detachment, and the consequences of heterogeniety for polymerisation speed and accuracy, but the interplay of both separation and heterogeniety remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate a minimal model of templated copying that simultaneously incorporates both detachment from behind the leading edge of the growing copy and heterogeneous interactions. We first extend existing coarse-graining methods for models of polymerisation to allow for heterogeneous interactions. We then show that heterogeneous copying systems with explicit detachment do not exhibit the subdiffusive behaviour observed in the absence of detachment when near equilibrium. Next, we show that heterogeneity in correct monomer interactions tends to result in slower, less accurate copying, while heterogeneity in incorrect monomer interactions tends to result in faster, more accurate copying, due to an increased roughness in the free energy landscape of either correct or incorrect monomer pairs. Finally, we show that heterogeneity can improve on known thermodynamic efficiencies of homogeneous copying, but these increased thermodynamic efficiencies do not always translate to increased efficiencies of information transfer.</description>

      <title>A Mereological Approach to Higher-Order Structure in Complex Systems: from Macro to Micro with M\"obius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14423v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relating macroscopic observables to microscopic interactions is a central challenge in the study of complex systems. While current approaches often focus on pairwise interactions, a complete understanding requires going beyond these to capture the full range of possible interactions. We present a unified mathematical formalism, based on the M\"obius inversion theorem, that reveals how different decompositions of a system into parts lead to different, but equally valid, microscopic theories. By providing an exact bridge between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions, this framework demonstrates that many existing notions of interaction, from epistasis in genetics and many-body couplings in physics, to synergy in game theory and artificial intelligence, naturally and uniquely arise from particular choices of system decomposition, or mereology. By revealing the common mathematical structure underlying seemingly disparate phenomena, our work highlights how the choice of decomposition fundamentally determines the nature of the resulting interactions. We discuss how this unifying perspective can facilitate the transfer of insights across domains, guide the selection of appropriate system decompositions, and enable the search for new notions of interaction. To illustrate the latter in practice, we decompose the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and show that our method correctly identifies which variables are responsible for the divergence. In addition, we use Rota's Galois connection theorem to describe coarse-grainings of mereologies, and efficiently derive the renormalised couplings of a 1D Ising model. Our results suggest that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a powerful and practical lens for understanding the emergence of complex behaviour from the interplay of microscopic parts, with applications across a wide range of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Spatial Correlation Unifies Nonequilibrium Response Theory for Arbitrary Markov Jump Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is a fundamental challenge in physics, particularly for non-equilibrium and non-stationary processes. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides a complete framework for near-equilibrium systems, and various bounds are recently reported for specific non-equilibrium regimes. Here, we present an exact response equality for arbitrary Markov processes that decompose system response into spatial correlations of local dynamical events. This decomposition reveals that response properties are encoded in correlations between transitions and dwelling times across the network, providing a natural generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to generic non-equilibrium processes. Our theory unifies existing response bounds, extends them to time-dependent processes, and reveals fundamental monotonicity properties of the tightness of multi-parameter response inequalities. Beyond its theoretical significance, this framework enables efficient numerical evaluation of response properties from sampling unperturbed trajectory, offering significant advantages over traditional finite-difference approaches for estimating response properties of complex networks and biological systems far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Enhancing kidney quality assessment: Power Doppler during normothermic machine perfusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objectives: Marginal donor kidneys are increasingly used for transplantation to overcome organ shortage. This study aims to investigate the additional value of Power Doppler (PD) imaging in kidney quality assessment during normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). Methods: Porcine kidneys (n=22) retrieved from a local slaughterhouse underwent 2 hours of NMP. Based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) and oxygen consumption (VO2), the kidneys were classified as functional (n=7) and non-functional (n=15) kidneys. PD imaging was performed at 30, 60, and 120 minutes, and PD metrics, including vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization flow index (VFI) were calculated. Renal blood flow (RBF), CrCl, and VO2 were measured at the same time points during NMP. The metrics were compared utilizing correlation analysis. Results: FI and VFI moderately correlated with CrCl (r=0.537, p&lt;0.0001; r=0.536, p&lt;0.0001, respectively), while VI strongly correlated with VO2 (r=0.839, p&lt;0.0001). At 120 minutes, PD metrics demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing functional from non-functional kidneys, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.943 for VI, 0.924 for FI, and 0.943 for VFI. Cutoff values of 17% for VI, 50 a.u. for FI, and 9 a.u. for VFI provided 100% specificity and 73% sensitivity to identify non-functional kidneys, with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 82%. Baseline kidney biopsies showed moderate acute tubular necrosis in both groups with no significant differences. Conclusions: PD metrics strongly correlate with renal viability and effectively differentiate functional from non-functional kidneys. PD imaging can be a valuable alternative to RBF during NMP for kidney assessment.</description>
