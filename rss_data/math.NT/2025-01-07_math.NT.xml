      <title>Learning Fricke signs from Maass form Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a data-scientific investigation of Maass forms. We find that averaging the Fourier coefficients of Maass forms with the same Fricke sign reveals patterns analogous to the recently discovered "murmuration" phenomenon, and that these patterns become more pronounced when parity is incorporated as an additional feature. Approximately 43% of the forms in our dataset have an unknown Fricke sign. For the remaining forms, we employ Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to machine learn their Fricke sign, achieving 96% (resp. 94%) accuracy for forms with even (resp. odd) parity. We apply the trained LDA model to forms with unknown Fricke signs to make predictions. The average values based on the predicted Fricke signs are computed and compared to those for forms with known signs to verify the reasonableness of the predictions. Additionally, a subset of these predictions is evaluated against heuristic guesses provided by Hejhal's algorithm, showing a match approximately 95% of the time. We also use neural networks to obtain results comparable to those from the LDA model.</description>

      <title>A uniform bound on the smallest surjective prime of an elliptic curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve without complex multiplication. A well-known theorem of Serre asserts that the $\ell$-adic Galois representation $\rho_{E,\ell^\infty}$ is surjective for all but finitely many prime numbers $\ell$. Considerable work has gone into bounding the largest possible nonsurjective prime; a uniform bound of $37$ has been proposed but is yet unproven. We consider an opposing direction, proving that the smallest prime $\ell$ such that $\rho_{E,\ell^\infty}$ is surjective is at most $7$. Moreover, we completely classify all elliptic curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$ for which the smallest surjective prime is exactly $7$.</description>

      <title>$q$-analogues of sums of consecutive powers of natural numbers and extended Carlitz $q$-Bernoulli numbers and polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a specific class of $q$-polynomial sequences that serve as a $q$-analogue of the classical Appell sequences. This framework offers an elegant approach to revisiting classical results by Carlitz and, more interestingly, to establishing an important extension of the Carlitz $q$-Bernoulli polynomials and numbers. In addition, we establish explicit series representations for our extended Carlitz $q$-Bernoulli numbers and express them in terms of $q$-Stirling numbers of the second kind. This leads to a novel formula that explicitly connects the Carlitz $q$-Bernoulli numbers with the $q$-Stirling numbers of the second kind.</description>

      <title>Local data of elliptic curves under quadratic twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be the field of fractions of a complete discrete valuation ring with a perfect residue field. In this article, we investigate how the Tamagawa number of $E/K$ changes under quadratic twist. To accomplish this, we introduce the notion of a normal model for $E/K$, which is a Weierstrass model satisfying certain conditions that lead one to easily infer the local data of $E/K$. Our main results provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the Weierstrass coefficients of a normal model of $E/K$ to determine the local data of a quadratic twist $E^{d}/K$. We note that when the residue field has characteristic $2$, we only consider the special case $K=\mathbb{Q}_{2}$. In this setting, we also determine the minimal discriminant valuation and conductor exponent of $E$ and $E^d$ from further conditions on the coefficients of a normal model for $E$.</description>

      <title>The generalized Lelong numbers and intersection theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex manifold of dimension $k,$ and $(V,\omega)$ be a K\"ahler submanifold of dimension $l$ in $X,$ and $B\Subset V$ be a domain with $\mathcal{C}^2$-smooth boundary. Let $T$ be a positive plurisubharmonic current on $X$ such that $T$ satisfies a reasonable approximation condition on $X$ and near $\partial B.$ In our previous work we introduce the concept of the generalized Lelong numbers $\nu_j(T,B)\in\mathbb{R}$ of $T$ along $B$ for $0\leq j\leq l.$ When $l=0,$ $V=B$ is a single point $x,$ $\nu_0(T,B)$ is none other than the classical Lelong number of $T$ at $x.$
  This article has five purposes: Firstly, we formulate the notion of the generalized Lelong number of $T$ associated to every closed smooth $(j,j)$-form on $V.$ This concept extends the previous notion of the generalized Lelong numbers. We also establish their basic properties. Secondly, we define the horizontal dimension $\hbar$ of such a current $T$ along $B.$ Next, we characterize $\hbar$ in terms of the generalized Lelong numbers. We also establish a Siu's upper-semicontinuity type theorem for the generalized Lelong numbers. In their above-mentioned context, Dinh and Sibony introduced some cohomology classes which may be regarded as their analogues of the classical Lelong numbers. Our third objective is to generalize their notion to the broader context where $T$ is (merely) positive pluriharmonic. Moreover, we also establish a formula relating Dinh-Sibony classes and the generalized Lelong numbers. Fourthly, we obtain an effective sufficient condition for defining the intersection of $m$ positive closed currents in the sense of Dinh-Sibony's theory of tangent currents on a compact K\"ahler manifold. Finally, we establish an effective sufficient condition for the continuity of the above intersection.</description>

Abstract: Let $A\subseteq [N]$ be such that for any pair of distinct subsets $B,C\subset A$, the products $\prod_{b\in B}b$ and $\prod_{c\in C}c$ are distinct. We prove that $|A|\leq \pi(N)+\pi(N^{1/2})+o(\pi(N^{1/2}))$, where $\pi$ is the prime counting function, answering a question of Erd\H{o}s.</description>

      <title>Motivic correlators, cluster varieties and Zagier's conjecture on zeta(F,4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.08585v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Zagier's conjecture on the value at s=4 of the Dedekind zeta-function of a number field F. For any field F, we define a map from the appropriate pieces of algebraic K-theory of F to the cohomology of the weight 4 polylogarithmic motivic complex. When F is the function field of a complex variety, composing this map with the regulator map on the polylogarithmic complex to the Deligne cohomology, we get a rational multiple of Beilinson's regulator. This plus Borel's theorem implies Zagier's conjecture. Another application is a formula expressing the value at s=4 of the L-function of an elliptic curve E over Q via generalized Eisenstein-Kronecker series. We get a strong evidence for the part of Freeness Conjecture describing the weight four part of the motivic Lie coalgebra of F via higher Bloch groups. Our main tools are motivic correlators and a new link of cluster varieties to polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>New representations for all sporadic Ap\'ery-like sequences, with applications to congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.11839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find new representations, in terms of constant terms of powers of Laurent polynomials, for all the 15 sporadic Ap{\'e}ry-like sequences discovered by Zagier, Almkvist-Zudilin and Cooper.
  The new representations lead to binomial expressions for the sequences, which, as opposed to previous expressions, do not involve powers of 3 or 8. We use these to establish the supercongruence $B_{np^k} \equiv B_{np^{k-1}} \bmod p^{2k}$ for all primes $p \ge 3$ and integers $n,k \ge 1$, where $B_n$ is a sequence discovered by Zagier, known as Sequence $\mathbf{B}$.
  Additionally, for 14 of the 15 sequences, the Newton polytopes of the Laurent polynomials contain the origin as their only interior integral point. This property allows us to prove that these sequences satisfy a strong form of the Lucas congruences, extending work of Malik and Straub. Moreover, we obtain lower bounds on the $p$-adic valuation of these sequences via recent work of Delaygue.</description>

      <title>Mertens' Third Theorem for Number Fields: A New Proof, Cram\'er's Inequality, Oscillations, and Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.02166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first result of our article is another proof of Mertens' third theorem in the number field setting, which generalises a method of Hardy. The second result concerns the sign of the error term in Mertens' third theorem. Diamond and Pintz showed that the error term in the classical case changes sign infinitely often and in our article, we establish this result for number fields assuming a reasonable technical condition. In order to do so, we needed to prove Cram\'er's inequality for number fields, which is interesting in its own right. Lamzouri built upon Diamond and Pintz's work to prove the existence of the logarithmic density of the set of real numbers $x \ge 2$ such that the error term in Mertens' third theorem is positive, so the third result of our article generalises Lamzouri's results for number fields. We also include numerical investigations for the number fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})$, building upon similar work done by Rubinstein and Sarnak in the classical case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming a modular version of Schanuel's conjecture and the modular Zilber-Pink conjecture, we show that the existence of generic solutions of certain families of equations involving the modular $j$ function can be reduced to the problem of finding a Zariski dense set of solutions. By imposing some conditions on the field of definition of the variety, we are also able to obtain unconditional versions of this result.</description>

Abstract: Poincare-type series, such as Selberg's, are known to produce automorphic functions, in the hyperbolic half-plane, the decompositions of which into eigenfunctions (genuine or generalized) of the automorphic Laplacian contain all modular forms of nonholomorphic type. We introduce a one-parameter family of explicit automorphic measures supported by discrete unions of congruent lines with the same property, except for one value of the real parameter, for which they miss exactly the Eisenstein series associated to non-trivial zeros of zeta, and the Hecke eigenforms the $L$-functions associated to which vanish as $\frac{1}{2}$. The Grand Riemann Hypothesis, a special case of which needs being analyzed, is disproved</description>

      <title>The Least Common Multiple of Polynomial Values over Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04164v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cilleruelo conjectured that for an irreducible polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ of degree $d \geq 2$ one has $$\log\left[\mathrm{lcm}(f(1),f(2),\ldots f(N))\right]\sim(d-1)N\log N$$ as $N \to \infty$. He proved it in the case $d=2$ but it remains open for every polynomial with $d&gt;2$. We investigate the function field analogue of the problem by considering polynomials over the ring $\mathbb F_q[T]$. We state an analog of Cilleruelo's conjecture in this setting: denoting by $$L_f(n) := \mathrm{lcm} \left(f\left(Q\right)\ : \ Q \in \mathbb F_q[T]\mbox{ monic},\, \mathrm{deg}\,Q = n\right)$$ we conjecture that \begin{equation}\label{eq:conjffabs}\mathrm{deg}\, L_f(n) \sim c_f \left(d-1\right) nq^n,\ n \to \infty\end{equation} ($c_f$ is an explicit constant dependent only on $f$, typically $c_f=1$). We give both upper and lower bounds for $L_f(n)$ and show that the conjectured asymptotic holds for a class of ``special" polynomials, initially considered by Leumi in this context, which includes all quadratic polynomials and many other examples as well. We fully classify these special polynomials. We also show that $\mathrm{deg}\, L_f(n) \sim \mathrm{deg}\,\mathrm{rad}\left(L_f(n)\right)$ (in other words the corresponding LCM is close to being squarefree), which is not known over $\mathbb Z$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first half of the paper, we lay down a classical approach to the study of Saito-Kurokawa (SK) lifts of (Hecke congruence) square-free level, including the allied new-oldform theory. Our treatment of this relies on a novel idea of computing ranks of certain matrices whose entries are $L^2$-norms of eigenforms. For computing the $L^2$ norms we work with the Hecke algebra of $\mathrm{GSp}(2)$.
  In the second half, we formulate precise conjectures on the $L^\infty$ size of the space of SK lifts of square-free level, measured by the supremum of its Bergman kernel, and prove bounds towards them using the results from the first half. Here we rely on counting points on lattices, and on the geometric side of the Bergman kernels of spaces of Jacobi forms underlying the SK lifts. Along the way, we prove a non-trivial bound for the sup-norm of a Jacobi newform of square-free level and also discuss about their size on average.</description>

      <title>Mass equidistribution for Poincar\'e series of large index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01414v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P_{k,m}$ denote the Poincar\'e series of weight $k$ and index $m$ for the full modular group $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, and let $\{P_{k,m}\}$ be a sequence of Poincar\'e series for which $m(k)$ satisfies $m(k) / k \rightarrow\infty$ and $m(k) \ll k^{\frac{3}{2} - \epsilon}$. We prove that the $L^2$ mass of such a sequence equidistributes on $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathbb{H}$ with respect to the hyperbolic measure as $k$ goes to infinity. As a consequence, we deduce that the zeros of such a sequence $\{P_{k,m}\}$ become uniformly distributed in $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathbb{H}$ with respect to the hyperbolic measure.</description>

      <title>On the central ball in a translation invariant involutive field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The iterated composition of two operators, both of which are involutions and translation invariant, partitions the set of lattice points in the plane into an infinite sequence of discrete parabolas. Each such parabola contains an associated stairway-like path connecting certain points on it, induced by the alternating application of the aforementioned operators. Any two lattice points in the plane can be connected by paths along the square grid composed of steps either on these stairways or towards taxicab neighbors. This leads to the notion of the parabolic-taxicab distance between two lattice points, obtained as the minimum number of steps of this kind needed to reach one point from the other.
  In this paper, we describe patterns generated by points on paths of bounded parabolic-taxicab length and provide a complete description of the balls centered at the origin. In particular, we prove an earlier conjecture on the area of these balls.</description>

Abstract: We provide a new arithmetic characterization for the sequence of coefficients of algebraic power series $f(t)$ having the property that the differential equation $y'(t) = f(t) y(t)$ has algebraic solutions only. This extends a recent result by Delaygue and Rivoal, and also provides a new and shorter proof of an algebraicity result predicted by Golyshev.</description>

      <title>The Fourier transform of planar convex bodies and discrepancy over intervals of rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the Fourier transform of the characteristic function of planar convex bodies averaged over affine transformations. We establish lower and upper bounds on the latter quantities in terms of the geometric properties of the bodies in consideration. The second matter of study is the affine quadratic discrepancy of planar convex bodies, and we present sharp results on its asymptotic behaviour. In particular, averages over intervals of rotations are considered, addressing an open question of Bilyk and Mastrianni.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16000v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A valuation ring defined as an ultraproduct with respect to a particular algebraic nonprincipal ultrafilter on $\mathbb{P}$ provides a natural setting to exhibit an infinite set of primes $q$ relative to which a non-perfect-power integer $m &gt; 1$ is a primitive root of unity $(\!\!\!\!\mod q)$. This application of ultraproducts demonstrates their potential in addressing foundational problems in number theory requiring verification of denumerable conforming sets.</description>

      <title>On certain correlations into the Divisor Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed irrational $\theta&gt;0$ with a prescribed irrationality measure function, we study the correlation $\int_1^X \Delta(x) \Delta(\theta x) \, dx$, where $\Delta$ is the Dirichlet Delta Function from the Divisor Problem. It is known that when $\theta$ has a finite irrationality measure, a decorrelation is achieved, which is expressed in terms of this measure. A strong decorrelation occurs for every positive irrational number, except possibly for the Liouville numbers. We show that for irrationals with a prescribed irrationality measure function $\psi$, a decorrelation can be obtained in terms of $\psi^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: For a prime $\ell$, let $h_\ell(K)$ denote the $\ell$-part of the class number of the number field $K$. We investigate upper bounds for $h_\ell(K)$ when $K$ is quadratic or cubic, particularly in the case in which the discriminant of $K$ is smooth.

      <title>The local converse theorem for odd special orthogonal and symplectic groups in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09004v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic different from $2$ and $G$ be either an odd special orthogonal group ${\rm SO}_{2r+1}(F)$ or a symplectic group ${\rm Sp}_{2r}(F)$. In this paper, we establish the local converse theorem for $G$. Namely, for given two irreducible admissible generic representations of $G$ with the same central character, if they have the same local gamma factors twisted by irreducible supercuspidal representations of ${\rm GL}_n(F)$ for all $1 \leq n \leq r$ with the same additive character, these representations are isomorphic. Using the theory of Cogdell, Shahidi, and Tsai on partial Bessel functions and the classification of irreducible generic representations, we break the barrier on the rank of twists $1 \leq n \leq 2r-1$ in the work of Jiang and Soudry, and extend the result of Q. Zhang, which was achieved for all supercuspidal representations in characteristic $0$.</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be a complete valuation ring of mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ with algebraically closed fraction field $K$ and residue field $k$. Let $X/R$ be a smooth projective morphism. We show that if $X_k$ is stably rational, then $H^3(X_K, \mathbb Z_p)$ is torsion-free. The proof uses integral $p$-adic Hodge theory of Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze and the study of differential forms in positive characteristic. We then apply this result to study the Noether problem for finite $p$-groups.</description>

Our results generalize and improve a recent theorem of T. Koga [J. Fourier Anal. Appl. 27 (2021), Article No. 18]. As an application, we give a quick Tauberian proof of Blackwell's renewal theorem.</description>

      <title>$p$-curvature of periodic pencils of flat connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2401.00636 we introduced the notion of a periodic pencil of flat connections on a smooth variety $X$. Namely, a pencil is a linear family of flat connections $\nabla(s_1,...,s_n)=d-\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^ns_jB_{ij}dx_i,$ where $\lbrace x_i\rbrace$ are coordinates on $X$ and $B_{ij}: X\to {\rm Mat}_N$ are matrix-valued regular functions. A pencil is periodic if it is generically invariant under the shifts $s_j\mapsto s_j+1$ up to isomorphism. In this paper we show that in characteristic $p&gt;0$, the $p$-curvature operators $\lbrace C_i,1\le i\le r\rbrace$ of a periodic pencil $\nabla$ are isospectral to the commuting endomorphisms $C_i^*:=\sum_{j=1}^n (s_j-s_j^p)B_{ij}^{(1)}$, where $B_{ij}^{(1)}$ is the Frobenius twist of $B_{ij}$. Using the results of arXiv:2401.00636, this allows us to compute the eigenvalues of the $p$-curvature for many important examples of pencils of flat connections, including Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ), Casimir, and Dunkl connections, their confluent limits, and equivariant quantum connections for conical symplectic resolutions with finitely many torus fixed points. In particular, for rational values of parameters these eigenvalues are zero, so the connections are globally nilpotent. We also show that every periodic pencil has regular singularites and its residues have rational eigenvalues for rational values of parameters. In particular, this holds for the aforementioned quantum connections if they have rational coefficients. Also we generalize these results to irregular pencils (KZ, Casimir, Dunkl, and Toda), and relate them in the Dunkl case to representations of rational Cherednik algebras. Finally, we extend our main result to pseudo-pencils and discuss the generalization to difference equations.</description>
