      <title>Study of the deuterons emission time in pp collisions at the LHC via kaon-deuteron correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The femtoscopy correlation between positively charged kaons and deuterons measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV at the LHC with the ALICE experiment is employed to determine the upper limit for the time delay of the deuteron emission with respect to all other hadrons. Two scenarios are considered: the first assumes that deuterons form following the decays of short-lived strong resonances, while the second assumes that deuteron production occurs simultaneously with all other primary hadrons. For both scenarios, an additional delay time can be introduced using the CECA source model and its upper limit can be extracted by fitting the femtoscopy correlation. Two models are considered for the strong K$^+$d final state interaction. For the scenario where deuterons production is affected by baryonic resonances the upper limit of the time delay is 2.25 fm/c, while for the primary production scenario the upper limit is 4.75 fm/c. These results support the hypothesis of an early formation of the deuteron as an extended, weakly bound composite object in ultra-relativistic proton-proton collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>YSO implantation detector for beta-delayed neutron spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A segmented-scintillator-based implantation detector was developed to study the energy distribution of beta-delayed neutrons emitted from exotic isotopes. The detector comprises a 34 $\times$ 34 YSO scintillator coupled to an 8 $\times$ 8 Position-Sensitive Photo-Multiplier Tube (PSPMT) via a tapered light guide. The detector was used at RIBF, RIKEN, for time-of-flight-based neutron spectroscopy measurement in the $^{78}$Ni region. The detector provides the position and timing resolution necessary for ion-beta correlations and ToF measurements. The detector provides a high $\sim$ 80 $\%$ beta-detection efficiency and a sub-nanosecond timing resolution. This contribution discusses the details of the design, operation, implementation, and analysis developed to obtain neutron time-of-flight spectrum and the analysis methods in the context of neutron-rich nuclei in the $^{78}$Ni region.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of overlap integrals for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an effective-field-theory approach, the rate for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei depends on a set of effective operators mediating the lepton-flavor-violating interaction at a high scale, renormalization group corrections that describe the evolution to lower scales, and hadronic and nuclear matrix elements that turn quark-level interactions into hadronic ones and then embed the latter into nuclear responses. In particular, combining information from $\mu\to e\gamma$, $\mu\to 3e$, and $\mu\to e $ conversion in nuclei, it becomes possible to disentangle different underlying sources of lepton flavor violation. However, to assess the discriminatory power it is critical that uncertainties at each step of the analysis be controlled and fully quantified. In this regard, nuclear response functions related to the coupling to neutrons are notoriously problematic, since they are not directly constrained by experiment. We address these shortcomings by combining ab initio calculations with a recently improved determination of charge distributions from electron scattering by exploiting strong correlations among charge, point-proton, and point-neutron radii and densities. We present overlap integrals for $^{27}$Al, $^{48}$Ca, and $^{48}$Ti including full covariance matrices, allowing, for the first time, for a comprehensive consideration of nuclear structure uncertainties in the interpretation of $\mu\to e$ experiments.</description>

      <title>Photon vortex generation from nonlinear Compton scattering in Feynman approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, we show calculation of nonlinear Compton scattering with circularly polarized photons in a cylindrical coordinate using Feynman diagram to calculate photon vortex generation in intermediate states considering conservation of angular momentum. We take two different vortex wave functions based on Bessel function for the emitted photon and the electron after emission of the photon, which are the eigenstate of z component of the total angular momentum (zTAM) when a particle propagates along z axis. The result shows that when an electron absorbs N photons a photon vortex with a zTAM = N is predominantly radiated, but there are still very small contributions of photons with a zTAM = (N-1) and (N +1) due to the spin flip of the initial electron. This means even when an electron absorbs only a single photon, the electron may emit a photon vortex of a zTAM of 2 h-bar. However, the numerical calculations show that the contribution of the spin flip is four orders of magnitude smaller than that of the dominant radiation. We also discuss the circular polarization for the generated photon vortices.</description>

      <title>Simulation Tool Development and Sensitivity Analysis of 160Gd Double Beta Decay Search by the PIKACHU Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta decay (0v2b) has been investigated as a physical process that can provide evidence for the Majorana nature of neutrinos. The theoretical predictions of the 0v2b rate are subject to significant uncertainty, primarily due to nuclear matrix elements (NME). To reduce this uncertainty, experimental measurements of the half-lives of two-neutrino double beta decay (2v2b) in various nuclei are essential as a benchmark for NME calculations. The PIKACHU (Pure Inorganic scintillator experiment in KAmioka for CHallenging Underground sciences) project searches for the previously unobserved 2v2b decay of 160Gd, employing Ce-doped Gd3Ga3Al2O12 (GAGG) single crystals. In the Phase 1 experiment, we aim to improve the current lower limit on the 2v2b half-life of 160Gd by a prior study using a Ce-doped Gd2SiO5 (GSO) crystal. Ultimately, in Phase 2, the project seeks to achieve a sensitivity surpassing the theoretical prediction of 7.4 x 10^20 years, enabling the potential discovery of the 160Gd 2v2b decay. In this paper, we describe the development of background models based on GEANT4 simulations. The modeled backgrounds are contributions from uranium and thorium decay chains, 40K present in GAGG, and 40K gamma-rays from outside of GAGG. Additionally, we developed models for both 2v2b and 0v2b decay by implementing the theoretical kinematics of two-electron emission in double beta decay in the GEANT4 simulation. As a result, our background models successfully reproduced the measured background spectrum through fitting. By generating pseudo background spectra expected in Phase 1 and analyzing them with the combined background and 2v2b models, we evaluated the 2v2b sensitivity of Phase 1 to be 2.78 x 10^19 years (90% C.L.). This paper presents the development of these simulation models and the expected sensitivities for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 based on the pseudo data analyses.</description>

      <title>Excited cluster states: A new source for proton number fluctuations in the high baryon density regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the contribution of the decay products of excited nuclear cluster states to the event-by-event fluctuations of protons in the energy range from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2-5$~GeV within the statistical model. We find that the inclusion of the excited nuclear clusters yields corrections to all cumulant ratios, ranging from 1\% for ratio of second to first-order cumulant to 100\% for the sixth to second order cumulant towards the lowest inspected energy. As expected the contribution of excited cluster states is most important at low energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}&lt;3.5$~GeV and becomes negligible at higher collision energies. Especially in light of the expected ultra-high precision data from CBM at FAIR, this new contribution is important to allow for a quantitative comparison with (potentially later available) lattice QCD or effective model results.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard, Tsallis, and q-dual statistics from transverse momentum spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold collisions at RHIC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold (Au+Au) collisions across various centrality classes at center-of-mass energies per nucleon pair, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, ranging from 7.7 to 200 GeV, as measured by the STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The analysis employs standard (Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac), Tsallis, and q-dual statistics to fit the same $p_T$ spectra and derive distinct effective temperatures: $T_{\text{Standard}}$, $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$, and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$. In most instances, there exists an approximately linear relationship or positive correlation between $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, as well as between $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, when considering $T_{\text{Standard}}$ as a baseline. However, while both $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ increase from semi-central to central Au+Au collisions at 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV, where QGP is expected, changes in $T_{\text{Standard}}$ occur more gradually. This work suggests that $T_{\text{Standard}}$ is better suited for characterizing phase transitions between hadronic matter and QGP compared to $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ or $T_{\text{q-dual}}$, primarily due to the considerations related to entropy index in the Tsallis and q-dual statistics.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Nuclear Shape Phase Transition in Ultra-Relativistic $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe Collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shape phase transition for certain isotope or isotone chains, associated with the quantum phase transition of finite nuclei, is an intriguing phenomenon in nuclear physics. A notable case is the Xe isotope chain, where the structure transits from a $\gamma$-soft rotor to a spherical vibrator, with the second-order shape phase transition occurring in the vicinity of $^{128-130}$Xe. In this letter, we focus on investigating the $\gamma$-soft deformation of $^{129}$Xe associated with the second-order shape phase transition by constructing novel correlators for ultra-relativistic $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe collisions. In particular, our iEBE-VISHNU model calculations show that the $v_2^2-[p_T]$ correlation $\rho_{2}$ and the mean transverse momentum fluctuation $\Gamma_{p_T}$, which were previously interpreted as the evidence for the rigid triaxial deformation of $^{129}$Xe, can also be well explained by the $\gamma$-soft deformation of $^{129}$Xe. We also propose two novel correlators $\rho_{4,2}$ and $\rho_{2,4}$, which carry non-trivial higher-order correlations and show unique capabilities to distinguish between the $\gamma$-soft and the rigid triaxial deformation of $^{129}$Xe in $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe collisions at the LHC. The present study also provides a novel way to explore the second-order shape phase transition of finite nuclei with ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions.</description>
