      <title>Proper Rainbow Saturation Numbers for Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We say that an edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is proper if every pair of incident edges receive distinct colors, and is rainbow if no two edges of $G$ receive the same color. Furthermore, given a fixed graph $F$, we say that $G$ is rainbow $F$-saturated if $G$ admits a proper edge-coloring which does not contain any rainbow subgraph isomorphic to $F$, but the addition of any edge to $G$ makes such an edge-coloring impossible. The maximum number of edges in a rainbow $F$-saturated graph is the rainbow Tur\'an number, whose study was initiated in 2007 by Keevash, Mubayi, Sudakov, and Verstra\"ete. Recently, Bushaw, Johnston, and Rombach introduced study of a corresponding saturation problem, asking for the minimum number of edges in a rainbow $F$-saturated graph. We term this minimum the proper rainbow saturation number of $F$, denoted $\mathrm{sat}^*(n,F)$. We asymptotically determine $\mathrm{sat}^*(n,C_4)$, answering a question of Bushaw, Johnston, and Rombach. We also exhibit constructions which establish upper bounds for $\mathrm{sat}^*(n,C_5)$ and $\mathrm{sat}^*(n,C_6)$.</description>

      <title>On three domination-based identification problems in block graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.09537v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems of determining the minimum-sized \emph{identifying}, \emph{locating-dominating} and \emph{open locating-dominating codes} of an input graph are special search problems that are challenging from both theoretical and computational viewpoints. In these problems, one selects a dominating set $C$ of a graph $G$ such that the vertices of a chosen subset of $V(G)$ (i.e. either $V(G)\setminus C$ or $V(G)$ itself) are uniquely determined by their neighborhoods in $C$. A typical line of attack for these problems is to determine tight bounds for the minimum codes in various graphs classes. In this work, we present tight lower and upper bounds for all three types of codes for \emph{block graphs} (i.e. diamond-free chordal graphs). Our bounds are in terms of the number of maximal cliques (or \emph{blocks}) of a block graph and the order of the graph. Two of our upper bounds verify conjectures from the literature - with one of them being now proven for block graphs in this article. As for the lower bounds, we prove them to be linear in terms of both the number of blocks and the order of the block graph. We provide examples of families of block graphs whose minimum codes attain these bounds, thus showing each bound to be tight.</description>
