      <title>Hybrid Galam--Bass Model for Technology Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a hybrid model that combines the Galam model of opinion dynamics with the Bass diffusion model used in technology adoption on Barabasi-Albert complex networks. The main idea is to advance a version of the Bass model that can suitably describe an opinion formation context while introducing irreversible transitions from group B (opponents) to group A (supporters). Moreover, we extend the model to take into account the presence of a charismatic competitor, which fosters conversion back to the old technology. The approach is different from the introduction of a mean field due to the interactions driven by the network structure. Additionally, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy to quantify the system's unpredictability and information loss over time. The results show an increase in the regularity of the trajectories as the preferential attachment parameter increases.</description>

      <title>When Heterogeneity Drives Hysteresis: Anticonformity in the Multistate q-Voter Model on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discontinuous phase transitions are closely linked to tipping points, critical mass effects, and hysteresis, phenomena that have been confirmed empirically and recognized as highly important in social systems. The multistate $q$-voter model, an agent-based approach to simulate discrete decision-making and opinion dynamics, is particularly relevant in this context. Previous studies of the $q$-voter model with anticonformity on complete graphs uncovered a counterintuitive result. Changing the model formulation from the annealed (homogeneous agents with varying behavior) to quenched (heterogeneous agents with fixed behavior) produces discontinuous phase transitions. This is contrary to the common expectation that quenched heterogeneity smooths transitions. To test whether this effect is merely a mean-field artifact, we extend the analysis to random graphs. Using pair approximation and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the phenomenon persists beyond the complete graph, specifically on random graphs and Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks. The novelty of our work is twofold: (i) we demonstrate for the first time that replacing the annealed with the quenched approach can change the type of phase transitions from continuous to discontinuous not only on complete graphs but also on sparser networks, and (ii) we provide pair-approximation results for the multistate $q$-voter model with competing conformity and anticonformity mechanisms, covering both quenched and annealed cases, which had previously been studied only in binary models.</description>

      <title>From lines to networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world networks, ranging from subway systems to polymer structures and fungal mycelia, do not form by the incremental addition of individual nodes but instead grow through the successive extension and intersection of lines or filaments. Yet most existing models for spatial network formation focus on node-based growth, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of systems built from spatially extended components. Here we introduce a minimal model for spatial networks, rooted in the iterative growth and intersection of lines-a mechanism inspired by diverse systems including transportation networks, fungal hyphae, and vascular structures. Unlike classical approaches, our model constructs networks by sequentially adding lines across a domain populated with randomly distributed points. Each line grows greedily to maximize local coverage, while subject to angular continuity and the requirement to intersect existing structures. This emphasis on extended, interacting elements governed by local optimization and geometric constraints leads to the spontaneous emergence of a core-and-branches architecture. The resulting networks display a range of non-trivial scaling behaviors: the number of intersections grows subquadratically; Flory exponents and fractal dimensions emerge consistent with empirical observations; and spatial scaling exponents depend on the heterogeneity of the underlying point distribution, aligning with measurements from subway systems. Our model thus captures key organizational features observed across diverse real-world networks, establishing a universal paradigm that goes beyond node-based approaches and demonstrates how the growth of spatially extended elements can shape the large-scale architecture of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Understanding the importance of SHAPE to the UK research ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The UK has a long-established reputation for excellence in research across a broad range of fields, but in recent years, there has been greater emphasis on STEM investment and greater recognition of the UK's success in STEM. This paper examines the relative strengths of SHAPE disciplines and demonstrates that the UK's SHAPE research portfolio outperforms the UK's STEM research, for each international benchmark considered in this work. It is argued that SHAPE research is becoming increasingly important as a partner to STEM as the widespread use of technology creates societal challenges. It is also argued that the strength of UK SHAPE is the basis of a strategic advantage for UK research.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Responsible Innovation efforts in Canada and the world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global landscape for quantum technologies (QTs) is rapidly changing, and proper understanding of their impact and subsequent regulations need to match this pace. A Responsible Innovation (RI) approach and guiding principles have been proposed to accompany this development. We examine practical efforts globally and in Canada, from industry to research to governments, and analyze the current status of quantum technological advances under the RI framework. We analyze and compare what is being done internationally, identify gaps in the Canadian strategy, propose initiatives to fill those gaps, and highlight areas where Canada is leading or where more work is needed.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the network geometry of green bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the green bond market amid increasing emphasis on sustainable development, understanding its structural properties and potential systemic risks has become essential. This study applies Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Hierarchical Tree (HT) methods introduced by Mantegna, which gives a minimum spanning tree of bonds whose mutual distance corresponds to the correlation coefficient of the synchronous time evolution of the difference of the logarithm of their monthly price. Our analysis reveals that green bonds exhibit tighter ultrametric distances on average compared to stocks and conventional bonds, indicating a highly interconnected market structure. We also identify strong sectorial clustering, with green bonds in the utilities sector emerging as the most central nodes by average total betweenness centrality, suggesting their critical role in potential risk propagation. These findings highlight both the opportunities and vulnerabilities inherent in the green bond market, offering insights for investors and policymakers on monitoring concentration, enhancing transparency, and mitigating systemic risks as the market continues to evolve.</description>
