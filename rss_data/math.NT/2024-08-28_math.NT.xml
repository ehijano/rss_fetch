      <title>On characterization of prime divisors of the index of a quadrinomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\theta$ be an algebraic integer and $f(x)=x^{n}+ax^{n-1}+bx+c$ be the minimal polynomial of $\theta$ over the rationals. Let $K=\mathbb{Q}(\theta)$ be a number field and $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ be the ring of integers of $K.$ In this article, we characterize all the prime divisors of the discriminant of $f(x)$ which do not divide the index of $f(x).$ As a fascinating corollary, we deduce necessary and sufficient conditions for the monogenity of the field $K=\mathbb{Q}(\theta),$ where $\theta$ is associated with certain quadrinomials.</description>

      <title>Period patterns, entry points, and orders in the Lucas sequences: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is twofold: (1) extend theory on certain statistics in the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences modulo $m$ to the Lucas sequences $U := \left(U_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$ and $V := \left(V_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$, and (2) apply some of this theory to a novel graphical approach of $U$ and $V$ modulo $m$. Upon placing the cycle of repeating sequence terms in a circle, several fascinating patterns which would otherwise be overlooked emerge. We generalize a wealth of known Fibonacci and Lucas statistical identities to the $U$ and $V$ settings using primary sources such as Lucas in 1878, Carmichael in 1913, Wall in 1960, and Vinson in 1963, amongst others. We use many of these generalized identities to form the theoretical basis for our graphical results. Based on the order of $m$, defined as $\omega(m) := \frac{\pi(m)}{e(m)}$, where $\pi(m)$ is the period of $m$ and $e(m)$ is the entry point of $m$, we describe behaviors shared by $U$ and $V$ with parameters $q = \pm 1$. In particular, we exhibit some tantalizing examples in the following three sequence pairs: Fibonacci and Lucas, Pell and associated Pell, and balancing and Lucas-balancing.</description>

      <title>Unicritical polynomials over $abc$-fields: from uniform boundedness to dynamical Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a function field or a number field over which the $abc$ conjecture holds, and let $\phi(x)=x^d+c \in K[x]$ be a unicritical polynomial of degree $d\geq2$ not divisible by the characteristic of $K$. We completely classify all portraits of $K$-rational preperiodic points for such $\phi$ for all sufficiently large degrees $d$. More precisely, we prove that, up to accounting for the natural action of $d$th roots of unity on the preperiodic points for $\phi$, there are exactly thirteen such portraits up to isomorphism. In particular, for all such global fields $K$, it follows from our results together with earlier work of Doyle-Poonen and Looper that the number of $K$-rational preperiodic points for $\phi$ is uniformly bounded, independent of $d$. That is, there is a constant $B(K)$ depending only on $K$ such that $$\big|\text{PrePer}(x^d+c,K)\big|\leq B(K)$$ for all $d\geq2$ and all $c\in K$. Moreover, we apply this work to construct many irreducible polynomials with large dynamical Galois groups in semigroups generated by sets of unicritical polynomials under composition.</description>

      <title>The fourth moment of truncated Eisenstein series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We asymptotically evaluate the fourth moment of truncated Eisenstein series with large Laplacian eigenvalue. With suitable normalization our main term equals 3, which coincides with the fourth moment of a standard normal random variable, as predicted by the Random Wave Conjecture. This is the first time that the fourth moment in this conjecture has been verified for Eiseinstein series. Our paper builds upon the authors' previous work in which the fourth moment of Eisenstein series was established with a regularized integral. That however was an alternative set-up, yielding an asymptotic main term different from 3, and as such did not address the Random Wave Conjecture as originally framed.</description>

      <title>Expression of Farhi's integral in terms of known mathematical constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an interesting article entitled ``A curious formula related to the Euler Gamma function'', Bakir Farhi posed the open question of whether it was possible to obtain an expression of $$ \boldsymbol{\eta}=2\int_0^1\log\Gamma(x)\,\cdot\sin(2\pi x)\,\mathrm{d}x=0.7687478924\dots $$ in terms of the known mathematical constants as $\pi$, $\log\pi$, $\log 2$, $\Gamma(1/4)$, $e$, etc. In the present work, we show that $$ \boldsymbol{\eta}=\frac{1}{\pi}\left[\gamma+\log(2\pi)\right], $$ where $\gamma$ is the usual Euler-Mascheroni constant, and provide two different proofs, the first one involving the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant, and the second one based on the Malmst\'en integral representation of $\log\Gamma(x)$.</description>

      <title>Unions of intervals in codes based on powers of sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every integer $d \ge 2$ there exists a dense collection of subsets of $[n]^d$ such that no two of them have a symmetric difference that may be written as the $d$th power of a union of at most $\lfloor d/2 \rfloor$ intervals. This provides a limitation on reasonable tightenings of a question of Alon from 2023 and of a conjecture of Gowers from 2009, and investigates a direction analogous to that of recent works of Conlon, Kam\v{c}ev, Leader, R\"aty and Spiegel on intervals in the Hales-Jewett theorem.</description>

Abstract: We classify the sum-free subsets of ${\mathbb F}_3^n$ whose density exceeds $\frac16$. This yields a resolution of Vsevolod Lev's periodicity conjecture, which asserts that if a sum-free subset ${A\subseteq {\mathbb F}_3^n}$ is maximal with respect to inclusion and aperiodic (in the sense that there is no non-zero vector $v$ satisfying $A+v=A$), then $|A|\le \frac12(3^{n-1}+1)$ -- a bound known to be optimal if $n\ne 2$, while for $n=2$ there are no such sets.</description>

      <title>On $2$-superirreducible polynomials over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate $k$-superirreducible polynomials, by which we mean irreducible polynomials that remain irreducible under any polynomial substitution of positive degree at most $k$. Let $\mathbb F$ be a finite field of characteristic $p$. We show that no $2$-superirreducible polynomials exist in $\mathbb F[t]$ when $p=2$ and that no such polynomials of odd degree exist when $p$ is odd. We address the remaining case in which $p$ is odd and the polynomials have even degree by giving an explicit formula for the number of monic 2-superirreducible polynomials having even degree $d$. This formula is analogous to that given by Gauss for the number of monic irreducible polynomials of given degree over a finite field. We discuss the associated asymptotic behaviour when either the degree of the polynomial or the size of the finite field tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Control Theorems for Hilbert Modular Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an exact control theorem, in the sense of Hida theory, for the ordinary part of the middle degree \'etale cohomology of certain Hilbert modular varieties, after localizing at a suitable maximal ideal of the Hecke algebra. Our method of proof builds upon the techniques introduced by Loeffler-Rockwood-Zerbes; another important ingredient in our proof is the recent work of Caraiani-Tamiozzo on the vanishing of the \'etale cohomology of Hilbert modular varieties with torsion coefficients outside the middle degree. This work will be used in forthcoming work of the author to show that the Asai-Flach Euler system corresponding to a quadratic Hilbert modular form varies in Hida families.</description>

      <title>On a generalization of Watson's trigonometric sum (on Dowker's sum of order one half)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the finite trigonometric sum $\sum a_l\csc\big(\pi l/n\big)$, where $a_l$ are equal to $\cos(2\pi l \nu/n)$ and where the summation index $l$ and the discrete parameter $\nu$ both run through $1$ to $n-1$. This sum is a generalization of Watson's trigonometric sum, which has been extensively studied in a series of previous papers, and also may be regarded as the so-called Dowker sum of order one half. It occurs in various problems in mathematics, physics and engineering, and plays an important role in some number-theoretic problems. In the paper, we obtain several integral and series representations for the above-mentioned sum, investigate its properties, derive various, including asymptotic, expansions for it, and deduce very accurate upper and lower bounds for it (both bounds are asymptotically vanishing). In addition, we obtain two relatively simple approximate formulae containing only several terms, which are also very accurate and can be particularly appreciated in applications. Finally, we also derive several advanced summation formulae for the digamma functions, which relate the gamma and the digamma functions, the investigated sum, as well as the product of a sequence of cosecants $\prod\big(\csc(\pi l/n)\big)^{\csc(\pi l/n)}$</description>

      <title>Locally analytic vectors and decompletion in mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $p$-adic Hodge theory and the $p$-adic Langlands program, Banach spaces with $\mathbb{Q}_p$-coefficients and $p$-adic Lie group actions are central. Studying the subrepresentation of $\Gamma$-locally analytic vectors, $W^{\mathrm{la}}$, is useful because $W^{\mathrm{la}}$ can be analyzed via the Lie algebra $\mathrm{Lie}(\Gamma)$, which simplifies the action of $\Gamma$. Additionally, $W^{\mathrm{la}}$ often behaves as a decompletion of $W$, making it closer to an algebraic or geometric object.
  This article introduces a notion of locally analytic vectors for $W$ in a mixed characteristic setting, specifically for $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Tate algebras. This generalization encompasses the classical definition and also specializes to super-H\"older vectors in characteristic $p$. Using binomial expansions instead of Taylor series, this new definition bridges locally analytic vectors in characteristic $0$ and $p$.
  Our main theorem shows that under certain conditions, the map $W \mapsto W^{\mathrm{la}}$ acts as a descent, and the derived locally analytic vectors $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{la}}^i(W)$ vanish for $i \geq 1$. This result extends Theorem C of \cite{Po24}, providing new tools for propagating information about locally analytic vectors from characteristic $0$ to characteristic $p$.
  We provide three applications: a new proof of Berger-Rozensztajn's main result using characteristic $0$ methods, the introduction of an integral multivariable ring $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}_{\mathrm{LT}}^{\dagger,\mathrm{la}}$ in the Lubin-Tate setting, and a novel interpretation of the classical Cohen ring ${\mathbf{A}}_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$ from the theory of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules in terms of locally analytic vectors.</description>

      <title>Mass formula for non-ordinary curves in one dimensional families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is about one dimensional families of cyclic covers of the projective line in positive characteristic. For each such family, we study the mass formula for the number of non-ordinary curves in the family. We prove two equations for the mass formula: the first relies on tautological intersection theory; and the second relies on the $a$-numbers of non-ordinary curves in the family. Our results generalize the Eichler--Deuring mass formula for supersingular elliptic curves; they also generalize some theorems of Ibukiyama, Katsura, and Oort about supersingular curves of genus $2$ that have an automorphism of order $3$ or order $4$. We determine the mass formula in many new cases, including linearized families of hyperelliptic curves of every genus and all families of cyclic covers of the projective line branched at four points.

      <description>arXiv:2312.14649v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the image of the Hodge-Tate logarithm map (in any cohomological degree), defined by Heuer, in the case of smooth Stein varieties. Heuer, motivated by the computations for the affine space of any dimension, raised the question whether this image is always equal to the group of closed differential forms. We show that it indeed always contains such forms but the quotient can be non-trivial: it contains a slightly mysterious $Z_p$-module that maps, via the Bloch-Kato exponential map, to integral classes in the pro-\'etale cohomology. This quotient is already non-trivial for open unit discs of dimension strictly greater than $1$.</description>
