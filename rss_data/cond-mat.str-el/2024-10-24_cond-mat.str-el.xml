      <title>Topological excitations at time vortices in periodically driven systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional periodically driven systems of fermions with particle-hole symmetry. Such systems support non-trivial topological phases, including ones that cannot be realized in equilibrium. We show that a space-time defect in the driving Hamiltonian, dubbed a ``time vortex,'' can bind $\pi$ Majorana modes. A time vortex is a point in space around which the phase lag of the Hamiltonian changes by a multiple of $2\pi$. We demonstrate this behavior on a periodically driven version of Kitaev's honeycomb spin model, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes and time vortices can realize any combination of $0$ and $\pi$ Majorana modes. We show that a time vortex can be created using Clifford gates, simplifying its realization in near-term quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Duality defect in a deformed transverse-field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.</description>

      <title>Rare-Earth Chalcogenides: An Inspiring Playground For Exploring Frustrated Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare-earth chalcogenide $ARECh_{2}$ family ($A =$ alkali metal or monovalent ions, $RE =$ rare earth, $Ch =$ chalcogen) has emerged as a paradigmatic platform for studying frustrated magnetism on a triangular lattice. The family members exhibit a variety of ground states, from quantum spin liquid to exotic ordered phases, providing fascinating insight into quantum magnetism. Their simple crystal structure and chemical tunability enable systematic exploration of competing interactions in quantum magnets. Recent neutron scattering and thermodynamic studies have revealed rich phase diagrams and unusual excitations, refining theoretical models of frustrated systems. This review provides a succinct introduction to $ARECh_{2}$ research. It summarizes key findings on crystal structures, single-ion physics, magnetic Hamiltonians, ground states, and low-energy excitations. By highlighting current developments and open questions, we aim to catalyze further exploration and deeper physical understanding on this frontier of quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Fragile spin liquid in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent appearance of the trillium lattice in the search for materials hosting spin liquids, we study the ground state of the classical Heisenberg model on its linegraph, the trilline lattice. We find that this network realises the recently proposed notion of a fragile spin liquid in three dimensions. Additionally, we analyze the Ising case and argue for a possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase in the corresponding quantum dimer model. Like the well-known $U(1)$ spin liquids, the classical phase hosts moment fractionalisation evidenced in the diluted lattice, but unlike these, it exhibits exponential decay both in spin correlations and interactions between fractionalised moments. This provides the first instance of a purely short-range correlated classical Heisenberg spin liquid in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Connecting High-Field and High-Pressure Superconductivity in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of multiple superconducting phases induced by either pressure or magnetic field is one of the most striking features of superconductivity of UTe$_2$, among the many unusual superconducting properties of this system. Here we report thermodynamic measurements of the superconducting phase diagram combining pressure and magnetic fields up to 30 T. We show that the ambient pressure, high-field, superconducting phase evolves continuously with pressure to join the high-pressure, zero-field superconducting phase. This proves that these two phases are one and the same, and must have the same order parameter.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum slinky motion in resonant extended Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model under the resonant condition, where a series of quantum slinky oscillations occur in a two-site system for boson numbers $n\in \lbrack 2,\infty )$. In the strong interaction limit, it can be shown that the quantum slinky motions become the dominant channels for boson propagation, which are described by a set of effective non-interacting Hamiltonians. They are sets of generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains with an $n$-site unit cell, referred to as trimerization, tetramerization, and pentamerization, etc., possessing non-trivial Zak phases. The corresponding edge states are demonstrated by the $n$-boson bound states at the ends of the chains. We also investigate the dynamic detection of edge boson clusters through an analysis of quench dynamics. Numerical results indicate that stable edge oscillations clearly manifest the interaction-induced topological features within the extended Bose-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Transverse thermoelectric conversion in the mixed-dimensional semimetal WSi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with axis-dependent conduction polarity are known as $p\times n$-type or goniopolar conductors that can be used for transverse thermoelectric devices, allowing the longitudinal thermal current to be converted into the transverse electrical current. Here, we performed experimental and computational studies on the transport properties of WSi$_2$ single crystals, in which such axis-dependent conduction polarity of the thermopower and the Hall coefficient have recently been reported, and demonstrated the transverse thermoelectric effect by applying the temperature gradient in a 45$^{\circ}$ rotated direction from the crystallographic axis. We have observed strongly sample-dependent transport properties, which have also been observed in previous studies, and together with first-principles calculations we show that such sample-dependent transport properties originate from the band-dependent scattering rates of carriers. The calculated band-resolved Peltier conductivity shows that the mixed-dimensional electronic structure consisting of a quasi-one-dimensional electron Fermi surface and a quasi-two-dimensional hole surface is a key property for the axis-dependent conduction polarity. The directly obtained transverse thermoelectric figure of merit is comparable to that of the anomalous Nernst materials, implying that the present material is a potential candidate for transverse thermoelectric conversion.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Evolution Speed as Indicator of Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In studying the time evolution of isolated many-body quantum systems, a key focus is determining whether the system undergoes relaxation and reaches a steady state at a given point in time. Traditional approaches often rely on specific local operators or a detailed understanding of the stationary state. In this letter, we introduce an alternative method that assesses relaxation directly from the time-dependent state by focusing on the evolution speed of the subsystem. The proposed indicator evaluates the rate of change in the reduced density matrix of the subsystem over time. We demonstrate that in systems reaching relaxation, as the overall system size increases, the evolution speed of sufficiently small yet still finite-sized subsystems notably diminishes. This leads to small fluctuations in the expectation values of operators, which is also consistent with the predictions made by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We apply this approach across various models, including the chaotic Ising chain, XXZ chains with and without many-body localization, and the transverse field Ising chain. Our results confirm the robustness and accuracy of subsystem evolution speed as a reliable indicator for relaxation.</description>

      <title>Disordered charge density waves in the kagome metal FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe has prompted interest in the interplay between kagome physics, CDW, and magnetism. However, a crucial aspect for understanding these emergent phenomena-the precise CDW structure-remains ambiguous. Recent studies have assumed uniformly distributed Ge dimers, but this assumption is problematic. The predicted band structure based on this model exhibits an abrupt disappearance of a Ge-$p$ band in the Fermi surface, contradicting experimental observations from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In this study, we propose that a CDW phase with disordered Ge dimers can reconcile theoretical predictions with ARPES results. This model reproduces the observed CDW gaps while preserving the Ge-$p$ band. Depending on experimental conditions, Ge dimers can be randomly distributed or exhibit phase separation from pristine regions. Our findings reveal the crucial role of Ge dimer disorder in the FeGe CDW and suggest potential implications of this disorder for other properties, such as magnetism and transport, in this system.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Non-linear Response by Manipulating the Dirac Point in the (111) LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tunable spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is an important feature for future spin-based devices. In the presence of a magnetic field, SOI induces an asymmetry in the energy bands, which can produce non-linear transport effects ($V\sim I^2$). Here, we focus on such effects to study the role of SOI in the (111) LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. This system is a convenient platform for understanding the role of SOI since it exhibits a single-band Hall-response through the entire gate-voltage range studied. We report a pronounced rise in the non-linear resistance at a critical in-plane field $H_{cr}$. This rise disappears with a small out-of-plane field. We explain these results by considering the location of the Dirac point formed at the crossing of the spin-split energy bands. An in-plane magnetic field pushes this point outside of the Fermi surface, and consequently changes the symmetry of the Fermi contours and intensifies the non-linear transport. An out-of-plane magnetic field opens a gap at the Dirac point, thereby significantly diminishing the non-linear effects. We propose that magnetoresistance effects previously reported in interfaces with SOI could be comprehended within our suggested scenario.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the moir\'e band structures and possible even denominator fractional quantum Hall state in small angle twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, using combined large-scale local basis density functional theory calculation and continuum model exact diagonalization. Via large-scale first principles calculations at $\theta=1.89^{\circ}$, we find a sequence of $C=1$(Chern number in K valley)moir\'e Chern bands, in analogy to Landau levels. By constructing the continuum model with multiple Chern bands, we undertake band-projected exact diagonalization using unscreened Coulomb repulsion to identify possible non-Abelian states near twist angle $\theta=1.89^{\circ}$ at the half filling of second moir\'e band.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlations and nonequilibrium sum rules in photodoped Hubbard ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using matrix product state techniques we study the nonequilibrium dynamical response of the half-filled Hubbard ladder when subject to an optical pump. Optical pumping offers a way of producing and manipulating new strongly correlated phenomena by suppressing existing magnetic correlations. The ladder allows the effects of pump directionality to be investigated, and compared to a single chain it has strong spin-charge coupling and a fully gapped excitation spectrum, promising different nonequilibrium physics. We compute time-dependent correlations, including the nonequilibrium dynamical structure factors for spin and charge. By deriving a combined spin-charge sum rule that applies both in and out-of-equilibrium, we show that spectral weight is pumped directly from the antiferromagnetic spin response into a low energy $\omega\sim 0$ charge response below the Mott gap. The transfer of weight is pump direction dependent: pumping directed along the legs disrupts magnetic correlations more than pumping in the rung direction, even if the post pump energy density is similar. The charge correlation length is dramatically enhanced by the pump, whilst the spin correlations are most strongly suppressed at nearest and next-nearest neighbour spacings. After the pump the system is in a nonthermal correlated metallic state, with gapless charge excitations and approximately equal spin and charge correlation lengths, emphasising the importance of treating these degrees of freedom on an equal footing in nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving for Periodically Driven Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02728v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have emerged as a useful technique to engineer the properties of quantum systems, and are in the process of being developed into a standard toolbox for quantum simulation. An outstanding challenge that leaves this toolbox incomplete is the manipulation of the states dressed by strong periodic drives. The state-of-the-art in Floquet control is the adiabatic change of parameters. Yet, this requires long protocols conflicting with the limited coherence times in experiments. To achieve fast control of nonequilibrium quantum matter, we generalize the notion of variational counterdiabatic driving away from equilibrium focusing on Floquet systems. We derive a nonperturbative variational principle to find local approximations to the adiabatic gauge potential for the effective Floquet Hamiltonian. It enables transitionless driving of Floquet eigenstates far away from the adiabatic regime. We discuss applications to two-level, Floquet band, and interacting periodically driven models. The developed technique allows us to capture nonperturbative photon resonances and obtain high-fidelity protocols that respect experimental limitations like the locality of the accessible control terms.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford and parallelizable fault-tolerant logical gates on constant and almost-constant rate homological quantum LDPC codes via higher symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parallel fault-tolerant quantum computing for families of homological quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes defined on 3-manifolds with constant or almost-constant encoding rate. We derive generic formula for a transversal $T$ gate of color codes on general 3-manifolds, which acts as collective non-Clifford logical CCZ gates on any triplet of logical qubits with their logical-$X$ membranes having a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ triple intersection at a single point. The triple intersection number is a topological invariant, which also arises in the path integral of the emergent higher symmetry operator in a topological quantum field theory: the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory. Moreover, the transversal $S$ gate of the color code corresponds to a higher-form symmetry supported on a codimension-1 submanifold, giving rise to exponentially many addressable and parallelizable logical CZ gates. We have developed a generic formalism to compute the triple intersection invariants for 3-manifolds and also study the scaling of the Betti number and systoles with volume for various 3-manifolds, which translates to the encoding rate and distance. We further develop three types of LDPC codes supporting such logical gates: (1) A quasi-hyperbolic code from the product of 2D hyperbolic surface and a circle, with almost-constant rate $k/n=O(1/\log(n))$ and $O(\log(n))$ distance; (2) A homological fibre bundle code with $O(1/\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ rate and $O(\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ distance; (3) A specific family of 3D hyperbolic codes: the Torelli mapping torus code, constructed from mapping tori of a pseudo-Anosov element in the Torelli subgroup, which has constant rate while the distance scaling is currently unknown. We then show a generic constant-overhead scheme for applying a parallelizable universal gate set with the aid of logical-$X$ measurements.</description>

      <title>From Chaos to Integrability in Double Scaled SYK via a Chord Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic phase transitions between integrable and chaotic dynamics. We do so by analyzing models that interpolate between the chaotic double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and the integrable $p$-spin systems, in a limit where they are described by chord diagrams. We develop a path integral formalism by coarse graining over the diagrams, which we use to argue that the system has two distinct phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic system, and the other to the integrable. They are separated by a line of first order transition that ends at some finite temperature.</description>

      <title>A Path Integral for Chord Diagrams and Chaotic-Integrable Transitions in Double Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transitions from chaotic to integrable Hamiltonians in the double scaled SYK and $p$-spin systems. The dynamics of our models is described by chord diagrams with two species. We begin by developing a path integral formalism of coarse graining chord diagrams with a single species of chords, which has the same equations of motion as the bi-local ($G\Sigma$) Liouville action, yet appears otherwise to be different and in particular well defined. We then develop a similar formalism for two types of chords, allowing us to study different types of deformations of double scaled SYK and in particular a deformation by an integrable Hamiltonian. The system has two distinct thermodynamic phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic SYK Hamiltonian, the other is continuously connected to the integrable Hamiltonian, separated at low temperature by a first order phase transition. We also analyze the phase diagram for generic deformations, which in some cases includes a zero-temperature phase transition.</description>

      <title>Coalescing hardcore-boson condensate states with nonzero momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), as an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, support coalescing states to be alternative stable state beyond the ground state. In this work, we explore the influence of non-Hermitian impurities on the dynamic formation of condensate states in one-, two-, and three-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard systems with strong on-site interaction. Based on the solution for the hardcore limit, we show exactly that condensate modes with off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) can exist when certain system parameters satisfy specific matching conditions. Under open boundary conditions, the condensate states become coalescing states when the non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric boundary gives rise to the EPs. The fundamental mechanism behind this phenomenon is uncovered through analyzing the scattering dynamics of many-particle wavepackets at the non-Hermitian boundaries. The EP dynamics facilitate the dynamic generation of condensate states with non-zero momentum. To further substantiate the theoretical findings, numerical simulations are conducted. This study not only unveils the potential condensation of interacting bosons but also offers an approach for the engineering of condensate states.</description>

      <title>Magic angle of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: Optimizing correlation-driven superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding of unconventional superconductivity is crucial for engineering materials with specific order parameters or elevated superconducting transition temperatures. However, for many materials, the pairing mechanism and symmetry of the order parameter remain unclear: reliable and efficient methods of predicting the order parameter and its response to tuning parameters are lacking. Here, we investigate the response of superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ to structural distortions via the random phase approximation (RPA) and functional renormalization group (FRG), starting from realistic models of the electronic structure. Our results suggest that RPA misses the interplay of competing fluctuation channels. FRG reproduces key experimental findings. We predict a magic octahedral rotation angle, maximizing the superconducting $T_c$ and a dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing symmetry. To enable experimental verification, we provide calculations of the phase-referenced Bogoliubov Quasiparticle Interference imaging. Our work demonstrates a designer approach to tuning unconventional superconductivity with relevance and applicability for a wide range of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>BMach: a Bayesian machine for optimizing Hubbard U parameters in DFT+U with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately determining the effective Hubbard parameter $(U_{eff})$ in Density Functional Theory plus U (DFT+U) remains a significant challenge, often relying on empirical methods or linear response theory, which frequently fail to predict accurate material properties. This study introduces BMach, an advanced Bayesian optimization algorithm that refines $U_{eff}$ by incorporating electronic properties, such as band gaps and eigenvalues, alongside structural properties like lattice parameters. Implemented within the Quantum Espresso platform, BMach demonstrates superior accuracy and reduced computational cost compared to traditional methods. The BMach-optimized $U_{eff}$ values yield electronic properties that align closely with experimental and high-level theoretical results, providing a robust framework for high-throughput materials discovery and detailed electronic property characterization across diverse material systems.</description>

      <title>Compilation of Trotter-Based Time Evolution for Partially Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving practical quantum speedup with limited resources is a crucial challenge in both academic and industrial communities. To address this, a partially fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture called ``space-time efficient analog rotation quantum computing architecture (STAR architecture)'' has been recently proposed. This architecture focuses on minimizing resource requirements while maximizing the precision of non-Clifford gates, essential for universal quantum computation. However, non-deterministic processes such as the repeat-until-success (RUS) protocol and state injection can introduce significant computational overhead. Therefore, optimizing the logical circuit to minimize this overhead by using efficient fault-tolerant operations is essential. This paper presents an efficient method for simulating the time evolution of the 2D Hubbard model Hamiltonian, a promising application of the STAR architecture. We present two techniques, parallel injection protocol and adaptive injection region updating, to reduce unnecessary time overhead specific to our architecture. By integrating these with the existing fSWAP technique, we develop an efficient Trotter-based time evolution operation for the 2D Hubbard model. Our analysis reveals an acceleration of over 10 times compared to naive serial compilation. This optimized compilation enables us to estimate the computational resources required for quantum phase estimation of the 2D Hubbard model. For devices with a physical error rate of $p_{\rm phys} = 10^{-4}$, we estimate that approximately $6.5 \times 10^4$ physical qubits are required to achieve faster ground state energy estimation of the $8\times8$ Hubbard model compared to classical computation.</description>

      <title>Magnetization Plateaus by the Field-Induced Partitioning of Spin Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To search for a conceptual picture describing the magnetization plateau phenomenon, we surveyed the crystal structures and the spin lattices of those magnets exhibiting plateaus in their magnetization vs. magnetic field curves by probing the three questions: (a) why only certain magnets exhibit magnetization plateaus, (b) why there occur several different types of magnetization plateaus, and (c) what controls the widths of magnetization plateaus. We show that the answers to these questions lie in how the magnets under field absorb Zeeman energy hence changing their magnetic structures. The magnetic structure of a magnet insulator is commonly described in terms of its spin lattice, which requires the determination of the spin exchanges nonnegligible strengths between the magnetic ions. Our work strongly suggests that a magnet under magnetic field partitions its spin lattice into antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic fragments by breaking its weak magnetic bonds. Our supposition of the field-induced partitioning of spin lattice into magnetic fragments is supported by the anisotropic magnetization plateaus of Ising magnets and by the highly anisotropic width of the 1/3-magnetization plateau in azurite. The answers to the three questions (a) - (c) emerge naturally by analyzing how these fragments are formed under magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scars as remnants of stable many-body periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a weak ergodicity-breaking phenomenon that defies the common scenario of thermalization in closed quantum systems. They are often regarded as a many-body analog of quantum scars (QS) -- a single-particle phenomenon in quantum chaos -- due to their superficial similarities. However, unlike QS, a clear connection between QMBS and classical chaos has remained elusive. It has nevertheless been speculated that in an appropriate semiclassical limit, QMBS should have a correspondence to weakly unstable periodic orbits. In this paper, I present a counterexample to this conjecture by studying a bosonic model with a large number of flavors. The dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) suggest that QMBS do not display chaotic behavior in the semiclassical limit. In contrast, chaotic dynamics are expected for initial states not associated with QMBS. Interestingly, the anomalous OTOC dynamics persist even under weak perturbations that eliminate the scarred eigenstates, suggesting a certain robustness in the phenomenon.</description>
