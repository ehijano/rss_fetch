      <title>Finslerian Wormholes in squared trace gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormholes in squared-trace extended gravity within the framework of Finsler-Randers geometry equipped with the Barthel connection. The Einstein-Hilbert action is modified by terms involving the trace of the energy-momentum tensor and its square, generating effective anisotropies through matter-curvature coupling. The resulting field equations are studied under barotropic equations of state with exponential and power-law shape functions. Finslerian anisotropy introduces novel pressure dynamics that enable the classical energy conditions to be satisfied in specific parameter domains. Our analysis shows that the Barthel connection significantly extends the parameter space for non-exotic, physically viable wormholes compared to purely Riemannian models. These findings suggest that Finslerian modifications provide a powerful mechanism for realizing realistic wormhole structures, offering new perspectives on anisotropic and geometrically enriched space-time configurations in extended gravity.</description>

      <title>The curious case of parabolic encounters: gravitational waves with linear &amp; non-linear memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The memory effect is known to introduce a permanent displacement in the gravitational wave (GW) detectors after the passage of a GW signal. While the linear memory adheres to the source properties, the non-linear memory is a secondary effect sourced by the GW itself. In the present work, we discuss GW signals with both these kinds of memory effects, while focusing on the parabolic limit of an encounter. This special case is theoretically intriguing and emerges as a limiting situation for both eccentric and hyperbolic events. However, in this paper, we argue that a simple extrapolation of memory calculations for eccentric or hyperbolic cases to the parabolic case may lead to incorrect estimations. Therefore, we treat the parabola as a special case and use an intrinsic parameterization, with which we calculate gravitational wave signals and their energy spectrum via an effective field theory formalism. Unlike the hyperbolic case, which is known to have linear memory, we notice that parabolic encounters bring out new features in the zero frequency limit (ZFL). Our work highlights some of the key challenges and salient aspects of these encounters, and paves the way to study such binary evolution with nonzero memory.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal modes ratios as agnostic test of general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we provide a novel test of general relativity based on ringdown analysis. The test is performed on agnostic models, where the postmerger signal is fitted with a superposition of damped sinusoids. If at least two modes are detected, one has to compute the ratio of the frequencies and of the damping times and compare them against the predictions of general relativity. By considering ratios, the dependency on the black hole's mass is scaled away. Most notably, we find that the ratios vary very little with the spin, the real part depends mostly on the angular momentum of the mode $\ell$ and the imaginary part depends mostly on the overtone number $n$: different combinations create specific mode islands. We provide a qualitative explanation of these islands through a semi-analytical argument. We discuss the application of the method to future detectors. Finally, we show that ratios in alternative theories of gravity or between different field content drastically differ from those of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Testing Quantum Gravity with Gravitational Waves from the ringdown of binary Black Holes coalescences: A New Frontier in Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves emitted during the merging phase of compact binary coalescing objects has opened a new field of investigation in fundamental physics. It is now possible to test the predictions of General Relativity with unprecedented precision in the strong gravitational field regime. These initial observations therefore call for further research, as the detection of gravitational waves emitted by coalescing black holes may allow the investigation of the properties of spacetime near the event horizon, also providing valuable information on the structure of these objects. This also opens the possibility of testing predictions from quantum gravity models regarding the presumed quantized structure of black holes, related to the quantization of their surface and, consequently, their entropy. In the future, the considerable amount of data obtained by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration will be followed by observations from next-generation interferometers such as the Einstein Telescope or the Cosmic Explorer. It is therefore of great interest to explore the potential of gravitational wave observations for investigating aspects of quantum gravity, which we will address considering the special case of the ringdown emission following the coalescence of binary black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Charged Hayward black hole with a cosmological constant and surrounded by quintessence and a cloud of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of exact solutions extending the Hayward black hole by incorporating multiple sources is obtained. The most comprehensive scenario describes a charged Hayward black hole with a cosmological constant, immersed in quintessence and accompanied by a cloud of strings. The study examines how the Kretschmann scalar varies with the parameters linked to the various sources and concludes with an analysis of the geodesics and the corresponding effective potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact solutions which generalize the Bardeen black hole solution, in the sense that several sources are taken into account, are derived. The most general case corresponds to a charged Bardeen black hole with a cosmological constant and surrounded by quintessence and a cloud of strings. A discussion is presented concerning the Kretschmann scalar and its dependence with the parameters associated to the different sources. Finally, the geodesics and effective potential are analyzed.</description>

      <title>The parameterized quasinormal modes for modified Teukolsky equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the modified Teukolsky equation within a parameterized framework, analogous to the case of small deviations of potential in spherical symmetry. Both the radial and angular equations acquire modifications described by two independent sets of parameters. We derive the parameterized framework of the quasinormal mode spectra using the continued fraction method. The results are cross-validated with the two-dimensional pseudo-spectral method, demonstrating excellent agreement and ensuring self-consistency. This work establishes a robust foundation for a theory-agnostic interpretation of gravitational-wave ringdown signals, providing a practical tool for probing potential deviations from General Relativity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Signatures of a Schwarzschild-like Black Hole Immersed in Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are often surrounded by dark matter, which can influence their dynamics and observational signatures. In this work, we study a Schwarzschild-like black hole immersed in a Dehnen-type $(1,4,2)$ dark matter halo and analyse scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations in this spacetime. We compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation method with Pad\'e approximants, investigate particle motion and photon trajectories, and use black hole shadow observations to place constraints on the halo parameters. We further examine the greybody factors associated with Hawking radiation for different perturbation spins. This combined analysis aims to understand how dark matter environments may affect black hole oscillations, radiation properties, and the corresponding observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tidal Response of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical Love numbers capture the conservative response of an object to a time-dependent external tidal gravitational field. We compute the dynamical Love numbers of Schwarzschild black holes in general relativity within a point-particle effective field theory framework. In addition to the known logarithmic running, we compute the finite scheme-dependent contributions to the Love number couplings. We do this by matching the renormalized one-point function in the effective theory to the classical field profile computed in general relativity. On the general relativity side, we solve the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations perturbatively in a small frequency expansion. In order to match on the effective field theory side we include gravitational interactions using the Born series and employ dimensional regularization to obtain a renormalized field profile.</description>

      <title>Observational properties and quasinormal Modes of the Hayward black Hole surrounded by a cloud of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explored the Hayward black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings, with a focus on the effects of the regularization parameter $l$ and the string cloud parameter $a$ on its observational properties and quasinormal modes (QNMs). Utilizing the spacetime metric and geodesic equations, we calculated several geometric quantities characterizing the black hole. To visualize the observational appearance of the accretion disk, we employed the Novikov--Thorne model to simulate both its primary and secondary images. Furthermore, we analyzed the QNMs of the black hole under scalar and electromagnetic perturbations for different parameter values. The results indicate that as the regularization parameter $l$ increases, the outer horizon radius $r_{+}$, photon-sphere radius $r_{\text{ph}}$, critical impact parameter $b_{c}$, and innermost stable circular orbit $r_{\text{isco}}$ exhibit a gradual decrease, while the inner horizon radius $r_{-}$ and the real part of the QNMs frequency $\omega_{r}$ increase. In contrast, as the string cloud parameter $a$ increases, $r_{+}$, $r_{\text{ph}}$, $b_{c}$, and $r_{\text{ isco}}$ demonstrate a rapid increase, whereas $r_{-}$ and $\omega_{r}$ decrease. In both cases, the absolute value of the imaginary part of the QNMs frequency decreases with the increase $l$ or $a$. This work offers a theoretical foundation for understanding the coupling between regular black holes and surrounding string clouds.</description>

      <title>Rotating wormholes in Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider rotating wormhole solutions in general relativity supported by a complex non-phantom spinor field (which provides a nontrivial spacetime topology) and electromagnetic fields. The solutions are asymmetric, regular, asymptotically flat and carry nonzero total angular momentum. The physical properties of the resulting configurations are completely determined by the values of three input quantities: the throat parameter, the spinor frequency, and the electromagnetic coupling constant. The wormholes connect two identical Minkowski spacetimes possessing in general different masses and global charges.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition and Critical Behavior in Gravitational Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamic analysis of spherically symmetric gravitational collapse. Using the Hayward-Kodama formalism, we treat a collapsing sphere as a thermodynamic system and express the surface gravity $\kappa_{hk}$ in terms of the geometric variables. We derive the specific heat capacities and identify a critical condition $\dot{\kappa}_{hk} = 0$ as the locus of second order phase transition during the collapse. Through specific examples, we demonstrate that the condition is independent of singular/non-singular nature of the geometry. We also find that the critical condition of phase transition is equivalent to a stationary condition of the expansion of null congruence. This establishes a direct correspondence between geometric stability and thermodynamic criticality, allowing the identification of apparent horizon as a universal critical surface in the phase-space of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>'Small' singular regions of spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every open connected region of relativistic spacetime $(M,\textbf{g})$ that encloses a $b$-incomplete half-curve has an open connected subregion that encloses a $b$-incomplete half-curve and is also 'small' in the following sense: it is the image, under the bundle projection map, of some open region in the (connected) orthonormal frame bundle $O^+M$ over that spacetime which is bounded, and whose closure is Cauchy incomplete, with respect to any 'natural' distance function on $O^+M$. As a corollary, it follows that every $b$-incomplete half-curve can be covered by a sequence of singular regions which are images of a sequence of bounded subsets of $O^+M$ whose diameter, with respect to any 'natural' distance function on $O^+M$, tends to zero. We discuss to what extent these results can be interpreted in favour of the claim that singular structure in classical general relativity is 'localizable'.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02683v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) experiments have been proposed as a witness of the quantum nature of gravity, more and more theories of classical gravity coupled to quantum matter have been shown to predict GIE, despite the existence of several theory-independent no-go theorems purportedly claiming that it should not be possible. This note explains why this is possible, and why this makes the GIE experiments an even more urgent matter in quantum gravity research.</description>

      <title>GW231123 ringdown: interpretation as multimodal Kerr signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GW231123 is a short-duration, low-frequency gravitational wave signal consistent with a binary black hole coalescence and dominated by the merger-ringdown regime due to the high mass of the source. We demonstrate that fits of this ringdown signal using two quasinormal modes are statistically preferred over single-mode fits, for a broad range of fit start times. We also find that two-mode fits give remnant mass and spin measurements consistent with those of the inspiral-merger-ringdown model NRSur7dq4, whereas one-mode fits struggle to do so. Agreement of our fits with those of NRSur7dq4 is achieved by labeling the two quasinormal modes as the ${(\ell,m)=(2,2)}$ and ${(2,0)}$ Kerr prograde fundamental modes. However, we find some indications that fits with the ${(2,1)}$ quasinormal mode instead of the ${(2,0)}$ mode may describe the data better, hinting at possible NRSur7dq4 error or other systematics. When fitting at early times near the estimated peak strain, we find that the inclusion of a third mode, an ${(\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)}$ prograde overtone, improves consistency with fits at later times. Finally, we perform a test of general relativity by searching for deviations from the Kerr frequency spectrum. Setting issues of systematics aside, we validate the Kerr frequency and damping rate spectrum to within $\pm10\%$ at the 90$\%$ credible level using a fundamental mode fit, and we also report $\pm8\%$ constraints using a model with fundamental modes and an overtone fit at times near the peak strain. Understanding the systematic errors that may be affecting the most accurate analyses of GW231123 is crucial in the context of population and binary formation studies -- our ${(2,1)}$ mode fits return a significantly higher remnant mass and spin than all available inspiral-merger-ringdown models including NRSur7dq4, and this difference in parameter estimates may have astrophysical implications.</description>

      <title>Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations suggest that the accelerated expansion of the Universe at late times is caused by a temporally changing dark energy component, rather than the constant one in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario. In this context quintessence, i.e. a canonical scalar field minimally coupled to gravity, plays a prominent role. There are, however, three main types of quintessence models: thawing quintessence, scaling freezing quintessence, and tracking quintessence. Dynamical systems reformulations of the field equations for a broad set of scalar field potentials, including some new ones, allow us to use dynamical systems methods to derive global and asymptotic features, visualised in bounded state space pictures clearly illustrating the relationships and properties of the different types of quintessence, clarifying initial data issues, and yielding simple and accurate approximations.</description>

      <title>Observational tests of the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02729v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider detailed cosmological tests of dark energy models obtained from the general conformal transformation of the Kropina metric, representing an $(\alpha,\beta)$-type Finslerian geometry. In particular, we restrict our analysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\alpha$ and of the one-form $\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the conformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models obtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the Riemannian metric $\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\beta$ and the conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free parameter $\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of $\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed. Our results indicate that the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple, alternative to standard cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Nested Apparent Horizons and Quantized Separation from Intense Hawking Backreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When Hawking radiation from a rotating or non-rotating black hole becomes sufficiently intense, its own stress energy can no longer be treated as a perturbation on a fixed background. In this regime the outgoing flux may generate an additional, transient trapping surf ace exterior to the original event horizon. Using a simple spherically symmetric semi classical model we demonstrate that strong outgoing null energy can create nested apparent horizons, a feature reminiscent of the Penrose process but mediated by quantum back reaction. The effect is illustrated using a smooth Vaidya type mass profile, and conditions for bifurcation and merger of horizons are derived. We further propose that the separation between nested horizons may obey a discrete quantization rule analogous to the Bohr Sommerfeld condition,suggesting a geometric route toward quantum-gravity discreteness.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Non-Gaussianity from Neutrino Seesaw Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16033v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutrino mass generation via conventional seesaw mechanism is realized at high scales around $O(10^{14})$GeV with natural Yukawa couplings of $O(1)$, making the test of neutrino seesaw a great challenge. It is intriguing to note that the neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the upper range of the cosmological inflation scale. In this work, we propose a new framework incorporating inflation and neutrino seesaw in which the inflaton primarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. With the neutrino seesaw mechanism, we construct a new realization of the Higgs modulated reheating, in which the fluctuations of Higgs field can modulate the inflaton decays and contribute to the primordial curvature perturbation. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and demonstrate, for the first time, that such signatures provide an important means to directly probe the high scale of natural neutrino seesaw. We further analyze the interplay of the non-Gaussianity signatures with the low-energy neutrino experiments, and their interplay with the Higgs self-coupling measurements at the LHC and future colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21045v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tiny neutrino masses are most naturally explained by seesaw mechanism through singlet right-handed neutrinos, which can further explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. In this Letter, we propose a new approach to study cosmological signatures of neutrino seesaw through the interaction between inflaton and right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. In our framework, after inflation the inflaton predominantly decays into right-handed neutrinos and its decay rate is modulated by the fluctuations of Higgs field that act as the source of curvature perturbations. This gives a new realization of Higgs modulated reheating, and it produces primordial non-Gaussian signatures that can be measured by the forthcoming large-scale structure surveys. We find that these surveys have the potential to probe a large portion of the neutrino seesaw parameter space, opening up a new window for testing the high scale seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>Optimal strategies for continuous wave detection in pulsar timing arrays: Realistic pulsar noise and a gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), such as those produced by supermassive binary black holes at subparsec separations. The incoherent superposition of GWs emitted by a cosmological population of these sources produces a gravitational wave background (GWB), while some individual sources may be resolvable as deterministic signals with slowly varying GW frequencies, which are often referred to as "continuous waves" (CWs). The Fp-statistic is a frequentist method of detecting these CWs. In this paper, we study how the presence of pulsar red noise and a GWB affect the Fp-statistic. We compare results when marginalizing over the red noise and using the maximum-likelihood values of the red noise, and find little difference between the two. We also present results of using the Fp-statistic to analyze the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set, where we find no evidence for CWs in agreement with the previously published Bayesian results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling regime of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric vacua of the heterotic string is analyzed from a dual domain wall perspective. Using modular invariance, we compute a closed form for the non-perturbative corrections to the supersymmetric domain wall equations, which enables a quantitative study of gravitational strong coupling regimes. A strong coupling singularity for the hidden Horava-Witten 9-brane is resolved, and the domain wall interpolates between the visible 9-brane and a supersymmetric Anti-de Sitter vacuum, thereby realizing a variant of the Randall-Sundrum model.</description>

      <title>Dark neutron stars from a heavy dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation and properties of dark neutron stars in a scenario where dark matter is made up of (heavy) dark baryons in a sequestered copy of the MSSM. This scenario naturally explains the coincidence of baryonic and dark matter abundances without the need for tuning particle masses. In particular, the supersymmetry breaking scales in the visible and dark sectors may differ by up to 10-11 orders of magnitude. We argue that dark neutrons should be the lightest dark baryons, but that dark protons may be cosmologically long lived. This allows a small fraction of dark matter to remain ionized until the first halos start to form, providing cooling mechanisms that foster the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of sub-halo structures, ultimately resulting in dark neutron star and black hole formation. For a wide range of model parameters, we find dark neutron stars with generally smaller mass and radius than ordinary visible sector neutron stars. We also discuss their potential detectability, particularly through gravitational microlensing and dark magnetic dipole radiation at radio frequencies through photon-dark photon kinetic mixing.</description>

      <title>Plasma flow in force-free magnetospheres: two-fluid model near pulsars and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Force-free electrodynamics describes the electromagnetic field of the magnetically dominated plasma found near pulsars and active black holes, but gives no information about the underlying particles that ultimately produce the observable emission. Working in the two-fluid approximation, we show how particles can be "painted on" to a force-free solution as a function of boundary conditions that encode the particle output of "gap regions" where the force-free approximation does not hold. These boundary conditions also determine the leading parallel electric field in the entire magnetosphere. Our treatment holds in a general (possibly curved) spacetime and is phrased in language intrinsic to the 1+1 dimensional "field sheet spacetimes" experienced by particles stuck to magnetic field lines. Besides the new results, this provides an elegant formulation of some standard equations; for example, we show that the zero-gyroradius guiding center approximation is just the Lorentz force law on the field sheet. We derive a general perturbative method and apply it to pulsar and black hole magnetospheres with radial magnetic fields to produce fully analytic models that capture key features of the full problem. When applied to more realistic magnetic field configurations together with simulation-informed boundary conditions for the gap regions, this approach has the potential to provide global magnetosphere models without the need for global particle-in-cell simulations.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Kinetic Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that violent kinetic preheating following inflation can lead to the formation of black holes in the early Universe. In $\alpha$-attractor models with derivative inflaton couplings, nonlinear amplification of field fluctuations drives large spacetime curvature and gravitational collapse shortly after inflation ends. Using fully general-relativistic lattice simulations, we find that these dynamics produce black holes with masses of order tens of grams at sub-horizon scales, without requiring large primordial curvature perturbations. Although such micro-black holes evaporate rapidly via Hawking radiation, their formation modifies the post-inflationary equation of state and their evaporation can successfully reheat the Universe before Big Bang nucleosynthesis. These results identify kinetic preheating as a new, efficient channel for black-hole production and establish a direct connection between inflationary symmetries and strong-gravity phenomena at reheating.</description>

      <title>Euler-Heisenberg action for fermions coupled to gauge and axial vectors: Hessian diagonalization, sector classification, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler--Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.</description>

      <title>Measurement of angular cross-correlation between the cosmological dispersion measure and the thermal Sunyaev--Zeldovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measures (${\rm DMs}$) from fast radio bursts (FRBs) and the thermal Sunyaev--Zeldovich (tSZ) effect probe the free-electron density and pressure, respectively, in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the intervening galaxies and clusters. Their combination enables disentangling the gas density and temperature. In this work, we present the first detection of an angular cross-correlation between the ${\rm DMs}$ and the Compton $y$ parameter of the tSZ effect. The theoretical expectation is calculated using the halo model $\texttt{HMx}$, calibrated with hydrodynamic simulations. The observational cross-correlation is measured over angular separations of $1^\prime$--$1000^\prime$ using the ${\rm DMs}$ from $133$ localized FRBs and the $y$-maps from the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We detect a positive correlation with amplitudes of $\mathcal{A}=2.26 \pm 0.56$ ($4.0 \sigma$) for Planck and $\mathcal{A}=1.38 \pm 0.92$ ($1.5 \sigma$) for ACT, where $\mathcal{A}=1$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction of the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Assuming an isothermal gas, the measured amplitude implies an average electron temperature of $\approx 2 \times 10^7 \, {\rm K}$. The correlation is highly sensitive to the matter clustering parameter $\sigma_8$, and its dependence on other cosmological and astrophysical parameters -- such as the ionized fraction, the Hubble constant, and baryon feedback -- differs from that of the ${\rm DM}$ alone. This suggests that future joint analyses of the ${\rm DMs}$ and the tSZ effect could help break degeneracies among these parameters.</description>

      <title>Fundamental structure of string geometry theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String geometry theory is one of the candidates of a non-perturbative formulation of string theory. In this theory, the ``classical'' action is almost uniquely determined by T-symmetry, which is a generalization of the T-duality, where the parameter of ``quantum'' corrections $\beta$ in the path-integral of the theory is independent of that of quantum corrections $\hbar$ in the perturbative string theories. We distinguish the effects of $\beta$ and $\hbar$ by putting " " like "classical" and "loops" for tree level and loop corrections with respect to $\beta$, respectively, whereas by putting nothing like classical and loops for tree level and loop corrections with respect to $\hbar$, respectively. A non-renormalization theorem states that there is no ``loop'' correction. Thus, there is no problem of non-renormalizability, although the theory is defined by the path-integral over the fields including a metric on string geometry. No ``loop'' correction is also the reason why the complete path-integrals of the all-order perturbative strings in general string backgrounds are derived from the ``tree''-level two-point correlation functions in the perturbative vacua, although string geometry includes information of genera of the world-sheets of the stings. Furthermore, a non-perturbative correction in string coupling with the order $e^{-1/g_s^2}$ is given by a transition amplitude representing a tunneling process between the semi-stable vacua in the ``classical'' potential by an ``instanton'' in the theory. From this effect, a generic initial state will reach the minimum of the potential.</description>

      <title>General relativistic study of $f$-mode oscillations in neutron stars with gravitationally bound dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive investigation of nonradial oscillations in neutron star (NS) admixed with gravitationally bounded dark matter (DM) is carried out within the framework of full general relativity. The relativistic mean field (RMF) formalism is employed to illustrate the hadronic equation of state (EOS), while a physically motivated, gravitationally captured, non-uniform fermionic Higgs-portal DM component is incorporated to model DM-admixed NS. The DM distribution is characterized by two free parameters: $\alpha M_\chi$, an effective scaling factor that combines the DM concentration and the DM candidate mass, and $\beta$, a steepness index controlling the DM density distribution. The quasi normal mode (QNM) characteristics such as fundamental ($f$) mode frequency and its corresponding gravitational-wave (GW) damping time ($\tau$) is calculated for DM-admixed NS by solving the general relativistic perturbed equations involving axial as well as polar modes. The study demonstrates how the inclusion of DM distribution modifies the $f$-mode frequency and enhances the damping rate, reflecting a stronger coupling between matter and spacetime perturbations. Considering DM effects, the correlation analysis among DM model parameters, NS observables and QNM characteristics also carried out. Analytic fits for the $f-C-\tau$ and $f-\Lambda -\tau$ relations are constructed and calibrated for DM-admixed NS models. Building upon asteroseismic universal relations (URs), multimessenger constraint from the GW170817 event is employed by mapping the tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.4}$ into the $(f_{1.4},\tau_{1.4})$ space, thereby providing observational bounds on the oscillation properties of canonical DM-admixed NS model.</description>

      <title>Stability and rigidity of axisymmetric marginally outer trapped two-spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [7], H. Bray, S. Brendle, and A. Neves studied rigidity properties of area-minimizing two-spheres in Riemannian three-manifolds with uniformly positive scalar curvature. In [13], these results were extended to marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS) in general initial data sets $(M^3,g,K)$ under a natural energy condition. In the present work, we refine the latter results to the setting of axisymmetric MOTS in initial data sets admitting a nontrivial Killing vector field. Conditions for the stability of such MOTS, as well as a new foliation lemma by axisymmetric surfaces of constant outward null expansion, are obtained. Finally, we discuss some aspects of the rotating Nariai spacetimes and their relation to these results.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Stars with Large Quark Cores</title>

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are interesting objects capable of reaching densities unattainable on Earth. The properties of matter under these conditions remain a mystery. Exotic matter, including quark matter, may be present in the NS core. In this work, we explore the possible compositions of NS cores, in particular, the possible existence of large quark cores. We use the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with nonlinear terms for the hadron phase and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and Mean Field Theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (MFTQCD) for the quark phase. Through Bayesian inference, we obtain different sets of equations: four sets with hybrid equations (three using the NJL model and the other using the MFTQCD model), and one set with only the hadron phase. We impose constraints regarding the properties of nuclear matter, X-ray observational data from NICER, perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, and causality on all sets. One set of hybrid NJL equations of state was also constrained by adding the GW170817 detection. All sets can describe observational data and theoretical restrictions. The MFTQCD allows for a phase transition to quark matter at lower densities compared to the NJL models. The MFTQCD model indicates that NSs with 1.4 solar mass have quark matter in their inner core. However, NJL models suggest that it is more probable that 1.4 solar mass NSs do not contain quark matter. Both the MFTQCD and NJL models agree that there is quark matter in 2 solar mass NSs. It is discussed that hybrid stars with a stiff quark equation of state could explain a larger radius of more massive stars, such as two solar mass stars, with respect to the canonical NS.</description>

Abstract: The regain of interest in Moon exploration has substantially grown in the last years. For this reason, the space agencies consider the development of a precise navigation and positioning service similar to the Earth GNSS. Aiming at some meter accuracy, this requires to set up a relativistic lunar reference frame, with an associated coordinate time. If the IAU already defined the Lunar Coordinate Time TCL, there is still some freedom in the choice of the coordinate timescale to be adopted as reference on or around the Moon. This paper proposes a trade-off analysis of different possible options for this reference time scale. It shows that TCL is the best option to be used as practical time reference on the Moon, without the need to define a new time scale based on a scaling of TCL.</description>

Abstract: We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that rotating black holes can undergo spontaneous scalarization, leading to deviations from general relativity in the strong-field regime. We present the first nonperturbative calculation of the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of scalarized Kerr black holes in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, without assuming small spin or weak coupling. Our results reveal a universal splitting of the fundamental $l=m=2$ mode into axial-led, polar-led, and scalar-led branches, breaking the isospectrality characteristic of Kerr black holes. This splitting offers distinct signatures in the ringdown phase of gravitational wave signals and provides a new avenue to test gravity in the strong-field regime. Our findings open the possibility of probing beyond-GR physics using precision measurements of black hole ringdowns in upcoming gravitational wave observations.</description>

Abstract: Adopting the modifications induced by the truncated version of the Kaniadakis entropy on the Friedmann equations, we explore some relevant aspects of this cosmological scenario at the background level. We analyze the constraint imposed on the parameter $K$ obtained from the accelerated cosmic expansion condition, and we also study the role of such a parameter as a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Probing Black Hole Phase Transitions through Quasi-Periodic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we probe the well known thermodynamic phase structure of black hole through the lens of its quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Can QPOs be influenced by black hole phase transi- tions? Do they carry any signature of such transitions in their observational patterns? These were the central questions guiding our study. Using both RN AdS and Kerr black hole backgrounds across different QPO models, we analyzed the behavior of upper and lower QPO frequencies as functions of the Hawking temperature. Our results shows that QPO frequencies trace out distinct thermo- dynamic phases and also reflect their stability properties. As the black hole transitions between different thermodynamic phases, the trend of QPO frequencies with respect to temperature also shifts. Due to lack of of observational data, the present work is primarily more on the mathematical side, as the underlying mechanism responsible for the Hawking temperature has not yet been fully understood or experimentally verified. Moreover, given the speculative nature of black hole phase transitions, it would be unfair to claim that our results establish a definitive connection between an observable quantity such as the QPO frequency and the thermodynamic phase behavior of black holes. Nevertheless, our analysis suggests a possibility that changes in black hole geometry could be one of the contributing factors influencing QPO behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we capture the hitherto unobserved phenomenon of trans-Planckian damping. We show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is subsequently broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.</description>

      <title>Complete quasinormal modes of Type-D black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14635v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra of black holes exhibit two open problems [Conf. Proc. C 0405132, 145 (2004); CQG 26, 163001 (2009)]: (i) the discontinuity in highly damped QNMs between Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions as $a \to 0$, and (ii) the unexplained spectral proximity between QNMs and algebraically special (AS) frequencies, particularly the anomalous multiplet splitting for Kerr $\ell=2$, $m \geq 0$ modes. We develop a novel method to compute complete QNM spectra for Type-D black holes, solving both problems and establishing a mathematical framework for boundary value problems of dissipative systems. Using analytic continuation of radial eigenvalue equations, our method eliminates the dependence on auxiliary parameters in the connection formulas for confluent Heun solutions. This breakthrough overcomes the long-standing challenge of calculating QNMs that cross or lie on the negative imaginary axis (NIA). For Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes ($0 \leq {n} \leq 41$, $2 \leq \ell \leq 16$), we present complete spectra validated through scattering amplitudes with errors $&lt;10^{-10}$. The results provide definitive solutions to both open problems: (i) The inability of conventional methods to compute QNMs crossing or residing on the NIA leads to apparent discontinuities in Kerr spectra as $a \to 0$. (ii) When a QNM exactly coincides with the AS frequency, an additional QNM (unconventional mode) appears nearby. For the Kerr case with $\ell=2$, overtone sequences from both unconventional and AS modes exhibit precisely $2\ell+1$ branches, without multiplets or supersymmetry breaking at AS frequencies. Our method confirms Leung's conjecture of high-$\ell$ unconventional mode deviations from the NIA through the first $\ell=3$ calculation. Moreover, this paradigm surpasses the state-of-the-art Cook's continued fraction and isomonodromic methods in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Non-linear stability analysis of $\ell$-Proca stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector boson stars, also known as Proca stars, exhibit remarkable dynamical robustness, making them strong candidates for potential astrophysical exotic compact objects. In search of theoretically well-motivated Proca star models, we recently introduced the $\ell$-Proca star, a multi-field extension of the spherical Proca star, whose $(2\ell + 1)$ constitutive fields have the same time and radial dependence, and their angular structure is given by all the available spherical harmonics for a fixed angular momentum number $\ell$. In this work, we conduct a non-linear stability analysis of these stars by numerically solving the Einstein-(multi, complex) Proca system for the case of $\ell = 2$, which are formed by five constitutive independent, complex Proca fields with $m = 0, |1|$, and $|2|$. Our analysis is based on long-term, fully non-linear, 3-dimensional numerical-relativity simulations without imposing any symmetry. We find that ($\ell=2$)-Proca stars are unstable throughout their entire domain of existence. In particular, we highlight that less compact configurations dynamically lose their global spherical symmetry, developing a non-axisymmetric $\tilde{m}=4$ mode instability and a subsequent migration into a new kind of multi-field Proca star formed by fields with different angular momentum number, $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$, that we identify as unstable multi-$\ell$ Proca stars.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian expansion of fluxes from a scalar charge on an inclined-spherical orbit about a Kerr black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efforts are underway to accurately model extreme-mass-ratio inspirals for binaries with a spinning (Kerr) primary. At lowest order the adiabatic evolution depends on the radiation fluxes. Fluxes and other self-force quantities can be expanded analytically in post-Newtionian (PN) series allowing the early evolutionary phase to be understood. When it comes to more complicated background geodesic orbits, it proves useful to use the scalar field model problem to guide development and testing of techniques. In this paper, we present analytical expressions for the scalar fluxes from a scalar point-charge in inclined-spherical orbit about a Kerr black hole up to 12PN relative order, with expressions that are exact in terms of the inclination parameter $x$ and black hole spin $a$. The expressions are constructed using the Mano, Suzuki, and Takasugi method of solving the scalar wave equation in a Kerr background. We compare the numerical evaluation of these flux expressions to full numerical ($s=0$) Teukolsky code results, examining their degree of utility as the strong-field region is approached.</description>

      <title>Duality Symmetry and Anomaly for Gravitational Waves in Curved Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vacuum Einstein equations admit a formulation closely analogous to the source-free Maxwell theory. In particular, the linearized equations exhibit an electric-magnetic duality symmetry. We develop a framework that makes this analogy manifest by explicitly identifying the electric and magnetic components of perturbative gravitational waves. Within this formulation, we show that duality rotations between these gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields constitute a Noether symmetry of the linearized theory, and we derive the associated conserved current. The corresponding conserved charge encodes the difference in intensity between the right- and left-handed circularly polarized components of the gravitational wave - that is, between its self-dual and anti-self-dual parts. Remarkably, this conservation law remains valid even when the gravitational perturbations propagate on generic curved backgrounds. We then investigate whether this symmetry survives quantization. While the duality symmetry is preserved at the quantum level in flat spacetime, we find that it is anomalously broken in curved backgrounds. As a result, an imbalance between right- and left-handed gravitons could be excited from the vacuum. This effect represents a chiral anomaly for massless spin-two fields, generalizing known results for fermions and spin-one photon fields.</description>

      <title>New class of rotating charged black holes with nonaligned electromagnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a large family of twisting and expanding solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations of algebraic type D, for which the two double principal null directions (PNDs) of the Weyl tensor are not aligned with the null eigendirections of the Faraday tensor. In addition to systematically deriving this new class, we present its various metric forms and convenient parameterizations. We show that in Boyer-Lindquist-type coordinates these solutions depend on 7 parameters, namely the Kerr and NUT (Newman-Unti-Tamburino) twist parameters $a$ and $l$, mass parameter $m$, acceleration $\alpha$, strength of the Maxwell field $|c|$, and angular parameters $\beta, \gamma$ that represent two duality rotations of the Faraday tensor, which include the rotation between the electric and magnetic charges generating the aligned part of the Maxwell field. This coordinate parameterization, analogous to the Griffiths-Podolsk\'y form of the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions, allows us to perform various limits, explicitly identify the subcases, and determine the physical interpretation of the new class. Interestingly, by considering the limit with no acceleration ($\alpha\to 0$), one obtains either the famous Kerr-Newman-NUT black holes (if the parameter $|c|$ remains constant) or the novel Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes, announced recently in our work [Kerr Black Hole in a Uniform Bertotti-Robinson Magnetic Field: An Exact Solution, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 135} (2025) 18, 181401] (if $|c|\rightarrow \infty$ while $\alpha |c|=\mathrm{const.}$). We may thus conclude that this new class of spacetimes represents twisting charged accelerating black holes, immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field. In the non-twisting subcase, we obtain the previously known solution of Van den Bergh-Carminati.</description>

Abstract: In this communication we address whether or not there is an equivalence between the kinematical and dynamical descriptions of the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We address this by investigating whether an almost $\Lambda$CDM expansion history ($j(z)\approx1$) corresponds to an almost $\Lambda$CDM model ($w_{\rm DE}(z)\approx-1$) by considering two particular explicit examples. At least for the cases considered, this turns out not to be the case. Instead, what we find is that an almost $\Lambda$CDM cosmic evolution rather corresponds to an \emph{almost unified dark fluid model}. Considering that one never gets the exact condition $j(z)=1$ from any cosmographic data sets, this raises further questions on whether the $\Lambda$CDM model is the best candidate for the standard model of the evolution of the universe.</description>

      <title>Weak Lensing Approximation of Wave-optics Effects from General Symmetric Lens Profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of electromagnetic (EM) waves has yielded many profound discoveries across fundamental physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. Similar to EM waves, gravitational waves (GWs) can also be lensed. When their wavelength is comparable to the characteristic scale of the lens, wave-optics (WO) effects manifest as frequency-dependent modulations in the GW waveform. These WO features encode valuable information about the lensing system but are challenging to model, especially in the weak lensing regime, which has a larger optical depth than strong lensing. We present a novel and efficient framework to accurately approximate WO effects induced by general symmetric lens profiles. Our method is validated against numerical calculations and recovers the expected asymptotic behavior in both high- and low-frequency limits. Accurate and efficient modeling of WO effects in the weak lensing regime will enable improved lens reconstruction, delensing of standard sirens, and provide a unique probe to the properties of low-mass halos with minimal baryonic content, offering new insights into the nature of dark matter.</description>

Abstract: LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA form a network of gravitational-wave observatories. Data and analysis results from this network are made publicly available through the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center. This paper describes open data from this network, including the addition of data from the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a) and selected periods from the preceding engineering run, collected from May 2023 to January 2024. The public data set includes calibrated strain time series for each instrument, data from additional channels used for noise subtraction and detector characterization, and analysis data products from version 4.0 of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog.</description>

      <title>Vacuum breakdown around a Kerr black hole surrounded by a magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the invariant characterization of the region where vacuum breakdown into electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pairs occurs due to an overcritical electric field, the dyadoregion, in the case of a Kerr black hole (BH) in the presence of an external, asymptotically uniform test magnetic field aligned with the BH rotation axis, using the Wald solution. We calculate the dyadoregion morphology, the electromagnetic energy available to the pairs, the pair-creation rate, the pair number density, the average energy per pair, and the pair energy density and pressure. These results provide initial conditions for simulating the subsequent dynamics of the pair-produced plasma and astrophysical applications in the context of high-energy transients involving BHs in strong electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Costless correction of chain based nested sampling parameter estimation in gravitational wave data and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nested sampling parameter estimation differs from evidence estimation, in that it incurs an additional source of uncertainty. This uncertainty affects estimates of parameter means and credible intervals in gravitational wave analyses and beyond, and yet, it is typically not accounted for in standard uncertainty estimation methods. In this paper, we present two novel methods to quantify this uncertainty more accurately for any chain based nested sampler, using the additional likelihood calls made at runtime in producing independent samples. Using injected signals of black hole binary coalescences as an example, we first show concretely that the usual uncertainty estimation method is insufficient to capture the true error bar on parameter estimates. We then demonstrate how the extra points in the chains of chain based samplers may be carefully utilised to estimate this uncertainty correctly, and provide a way to check the accuracy of the resulting error bars. Finally, we discuss how this uncertainty affects $p$-$p$ plots and coverage assessments.</description>

      <title>Accelerated nested sampling with posterior repartitioning and $\beta$-flows for gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is an ever-growing need in the gravitational wave community for fast and reliable inference methods, accompanied by an informative error bar. Nested sampling satisfies the last two requirements, but its computational cost can become prohibitive when using the most accurate waveform models. In this paper, we demonstrate the acceleration of nested sampling using a technique called posterior repartitioning. This method leverages nested sampling's unique ability to separate prior and likelihood contributions at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we define a `repartitioned prior' informed by the posterior from a low-resolution run. To construct this repartitioned prior, we use a $\beta$-flow, a novel type of conditional normalizing flow designed to better learn deep tail probabilities. $\beta$-flows are trained on the entire nested sampling run and conditioned on an inverse temperature $\beta$. Applying our methods to simulated and real binary black hole mergers, we demonstrate how they can reduce the number of likelihood evaluations required for a given evidence precision by up to an order of magnitude, enabling faster model comparison and parameter estimation. Furthermore, we highlight the robustness of using $\beta$-flows over standard normalizing flows for posterior repartitioning. Notably, $\beta$-flows are able to recover posteriors and evidences which are generally consistent with those from traditional nested sampling, even in cases where standard normalizing flows fail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sphere partition function is one of the simplest euclidean gravity computations. It is usually interpreted as count of states. However, the one loop gravity correction contains a dimension dependent phase factor, $i^{D+2}$, which seems confusing for such an interpretation. We show that, after including an observer, this phase gets mostly cancelled for the quantity that should correspond to a count of states. However, an overall minus sign remains.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-process reconstructions and model building of quintom dark energy from latest cosmological observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we use the latest cosmological observations, including SNe, BAO, CC and RSD, to reconstruct the cosmological evolution via the Gaussian process. At the background level, we find consistency with the quintom dynamics for different data combinations and divide the characteristics of dark energy into three different categories, which are negative-energy dark energy, late-dominated dark energy and oscillating dark energy, respectively. Considering the effect of modified gravity on the growth of matter perturbations, the reconstruction results at the perturbative level show that we only need minor corrections to general relativity. Furthermore, we provide theoretical interpretation for the three different types of dynamical dark-energy behavior, in the framework of modified gravity, scalar fields, and dark-energy equation-of-state parametrizations. Finally, we show that all of these models can be unified in the framework of effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the standard siren method: Improved constraints on modified gravitational-wave propagation with future data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary mergers have emerged as one of the most promising probes of cosmology and General Relativity (GR). However, a major challenge in fully exploiting GWs as standard sirens with current and future GW observatories is developing efficient and robust codes capable of analyzing the increasing data volumes that are, and will be, acquired. We present here CHIMERA 2.0, an advanced computational framework for hierarchical Bayesian inference of cosmological, modified gravity, and population hyperparameters using standard sirens and galaxy catalogs. This upgrade introduces novel GPU-accelerated algorithms to estimate the hierarchical likelihood, enabling the analysis of thousands of events - crucial for next-generation experiments - and includes the two-parameter ($\Xi_0-n$) modified GW propagation model. Using CHIMERA 2.0, we forecast cosmological and modified GW propagation constraints for the future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5-like run. We analyze three binary black hole populations of 300 events at SNR&gt;20, each with a different value of $\Xi_0$: 0.6, 1 (corresponding to GR), and 1.8. Multiple analyses were performed each catalog, comprising a population of approximately 5000 events, thanks to CHIMERA 2.0, which is 10-1000 times faster depending on the settings and catalog size. We jointly infer cosmological, modified GW propagation, and population hyperparameters. With spectroscopic galaxy catalogs, the fiducial $\Xi_0$ is recovered with a precision of $22\%$, $7.5\%$, and $10\%$ for $\Xi_0$ = 0.6, 1, and 1.8, respectively; while the precision on $H_0$ is 2-7 times worse than when $\Xi_0$ is not inferred. Finally,in the case of photometric redshifts the constraints degrade on average by 3.5 times in all cases, underscoring the importance of future spectroscopic surveys in maximizing the constraining power of standard sirens.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A as a Signal of Electroweak Vacuum Turbulence in Merging Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Confirms GW231123 is a "Lite" Intermediate Mass Black Hole Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported GW231123, a black hole merger with total mass of around 190-265 solar mass. This event adds to the growing evidence of "lite" intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) discoveries of post-merger black holes &gt;100 solar mass. GW231123 posed several data analysis challenges owing to waveform-model systematics and presence of noise artifacts called glitches. We present the first comprehensive machine learning analysis to further validate this event, strengthen its astrophysical inference, and characterize instrumental noise in its vicinity. Our approach uses a combination of tools tailored for specific analyses: GW-Whisper, an adaptation of OpenAI's audio transformer, ArchGEM, a Gaussian mixture model-based soft clustering and density approximation software and AWaRe, a convolutional autoencoder. We identify the data segment containing the merger with &gt;70% confidence in both detectors and verify its astrophysical origin. We then characterize the scattered light glitch around the event, providing the first physically interpretable parameters for the glitch. We also reconstruct the real waveforms from the data with slightly better agreement to model-agnostic reconstructions than to quasi-circular models, hinting at possible astrophysics beyond current waveform families (such as non-circular orbits or environmental imprints). Finally, by demonstrating high-fidelity waveform reconstructions for simulated mergers with total masses between 100-1000 solar mass, we show that our method can confidently probe the IMBH regime. Our integrated framework offers a powerful complementary tool to traditional pipelines for rapid, robust analysis of massive, glitch-contaminated events.</description>

      <title>Spinning Boundary Correlators from (A)dS$_4$ Twistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a twistor-space framework to compute boundary correlators via a boundary limit of nested Penrose transforms in (A)dS$_4$. Starting from correlators of (anti-)self-dual bulk fields, the boundary limit reproduces the correlators of the dual conserved currents; we demonstrate this explicitly for two- and three-point functions. The two-point correlator is rendered finite by working in Euclidean signature. At three points, we obtain compact rational twistor-space representatives obeying a double-copy relation, thereby clarifying the twistor-space origin of the results in Baumann et al. 2024. We further extend the analysis to non-conserved currents with integer conformal dimension, dual to massive bulk fields, as well as to the free scalar.</description>

      <title>Hubble Constant and Mass Determination of Centaurus A &amp; M83 from TRGB Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An independent determination of the Hubble constant is crucial given the persistent tension between early- and late-Universe measurements. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of the Centaurus~A (CenA) and M83 galaxies, along with their associated dwarf companions identified via Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance measurements, to constrain both the group mass and the local value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$). By examining the motions of these galaxies relative to the system's barycenter, we apply both the minor and major infall models, which provide bounds on the true radial velocity dispersion. From the overlap of these approaches, we obtain a virial mass estimate of $(7.3 \pm 2.0) \times 10^{12}\,M_{\odot}$ and a Hubble flow-based mass of $(2.6 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{12}\,M_{\odot}$. Modeling the cold Hubble flow around the group center of mass yields a corresponding Hubble constant of $(64.0 \pm 4.6)\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. These results offer an independent, dynamically motivated constraint on the local value of $H_0$, explicitly accounting for the impact of peculiar velocities in the nearby Universe. We also discuss the $\sim 2\sigma$ tension between the virial and Hubble flow-based mass estimates, which likely arises from the proximity of M83 to the velocity surface, breaking the assumptions of the Hubble flow model. While the Hubble flow fit emphasizes galaxies that follow smooth expansion on the lower branch of the velocity-distance relation, the virial mass estimate is in good agreement with the group mass derived from the $K$-band luminosity of its brightest members and from projected mass methods.</description>

Abstract: Carrollian physics provides the natural framework for describing null hypersurfaces. This review explores the geometry of Carrollian manifolds -- spaces endowed with a degenerate metric. We begin with an algebraic overview of the Carroll group, its conformal extension, and its relation to the BMS group. Then, in the core of the review, we follow the standard pseudo-Riemannian narrative: metric $\to$ connection $\to$ curvature. We first introduce the modern, general definition of a Carrollian structure, the analogue of the metric on such manifolds, reviewing the historical developments, symmetries, and link with the algebraic groups. The second part concerns connections. We show the breakdown of the Levi-Civita theorem in the Carrollian setting and construct the most general intrinsic Carrollian connection. A preferred connection is then identified intrinsically and later shown to coincide with the one induced by embedding a null hypersurface in an ambient spacetime. The third part develops the associated curvature tensors. We include novel results presented here for the first time.
  Two advanced topics highlight the broader scope of this framework. The first treats null hypersurfaces via the rigging technique, deriving the induced geometry from the ambient space. This provides a unified language for spacelike, timelike, and null hypersurfaces, and shows that the induced rigged connection exactly reproduces the intrinsic Carrollian one. From this, the Gauss and Codazzi-Mainardi equations follow, and the Einstein equations emerge as conservation laws for the null Brown-York stress tensor. The second topic extends the Carrollian setup to generic, non-null hypersurfaces, enabling a smooth null limit and completing the unified geometric description of hypersurfaces of all causal characters.</description>
