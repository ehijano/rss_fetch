      <title>Long-range gene expression prediction with token alignment of large language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene expression is a cellular process that plays a fundamental role in human phenotypical variations and diseases. Despite advances of deep learning models for gene expression prediction, recent benchmarks have revealed their inability to learn distal regulatory grammar. Here, we address this challenge by leveraging a pretrained large language model to enhance gene expression prediction. We introduce Genetic sequence Token Alignment (GTA), which aligns genetic sequence features with natural language tokens, allowing for symbolic reasoning of genomic sequence features via the frozen language model. This cross-modal adaptation learns the regulatory grammar and allows us to further incorporate gene-specific human annotations as prompts, enabling in-context learning that is not possible with existing models. Trained on lymphoblastoid cells, GTA was evaluated on cells from the Geuvadis consortium and outperforms state-of-the-art models such as Enformer, achieving a Spearman correlation of 0.65, a 10\% improvement. Additionally, GTA offers improved interpretation of long-range interactions through the identification of the most meaningful sections of the input genetic context. GTA represents a powerful and novel cross-modal approach to gene expression prediction by utilizing a pretrained language model, in a paradigm shift from conventional gene expression models trained only on sequence data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Omic and Quantum Machine Learning Integration for Lung Subtypes Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is a red-hot field that brings novel discoveries and exciting opportunities to resolve, speed up, or refine the analysis of a wide range of computational problems. In the realm of biomedical research and personalized medicine, the significance of multi-omics integration lies in its ability to provide a thorough and holistic comprehension of complex biological systems. This technology links fundamental research to clinical practice. The insights gained from integrated omics data can be translated into clinical tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. The fusion of quantum computing and machine learning holds promise for unraveling complex patterns within multi-omics datasets, providing unprecedented insights into the molecular landscape of lung cancer. Due to the heterogeneity, complexity, and high dimensionality of multi-omic cancer data, characterized by the vast number of features (such as gene expression, micro-RNA, and DNA methylation) relative to the limited number of lung cancer patient samples, our prime motivation for this paper is the integration of multi-omic data, unique feature selection, and diagnostic classification of lung subtypes: lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC-I) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD-II) using quantum machine learning. We developed a method for finding the best differentiating features between LUAD and LUSC datasets, which has the potential for biomarker discovery.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Free Guidance in Continuous and Discrete Diffusion Models with Soft Value-Based Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08252v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at capturing the natural design spaces of images, molecules, DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.
