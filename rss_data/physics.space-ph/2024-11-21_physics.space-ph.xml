      <title>Production and Loss Processes of Hydrogen Energetic Neutral Atoms in the Heliosphere from 5 eV to 500 keV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) observations provide valuable insights into the plasma conditions in the heliosphere and the surrounding interstellar medium. Unlike plasma detectors, which measure charged particles tied to the magnetic fields at their location, ENA detectors capture former ions that were neutralized in distant regions and traverse the heliosphere in straight trajectories. ENA fluxes near the Sun represent line-of-sight integrals of parent ion fluxes multiplied by neutralization (production) rates and reduced by the probability of ENA reionization (loss) processes. So far, most ENA analyses have focused on charge exchange between hydrogen atoms and protons as the primary source of ENAs. Here, we examine various ENA production and loss processes throughout the heliosphere in the broad energy range (5 eV to 500 keV) encompassing the next-generation ENA instruments aboard the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) mission. Our study considers binary collisions involving the most abundant species: protons, electrons, {\alpha}-particles, He+ ions, photons, as well as hydrogen and helium atoms. Our findings indicate that, in addition to ENAs produced by charge exchange of energetic protons with hydrogen atoms, a significant portion of high-energy ENAs originate from the charge exchange with helium atoms. Below 10 keV, the dominant ENA loss processes are charge exchange collisions with protons and photoionization. However, stripping ionization processes, e.g., from collisions with ambient interstellar neutral hydrogen, become the main loss mechanism for higher energies because the charge exchange rate rapidly decreases.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mission Observations of Relativistic Electrons and High-Speed Jets Linked to Shock Generated Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shock-generated transients, such as hot flow anomalies (HFAs), upstream of planetary bow shocks, play a critical role in electron acceleration. Using multi-mission data from NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) and ESA's Cluster missions, we demonstrate the transmission of HFAs through Earth's quasi-parallel bow shock, associated with acceleration of electrons up to relativistic energies. Energetic electrons, initially accelerated upstream, are shown to remain broadly confined within the transmitted transient structures downstream, where betatron acceleration further boosts their energy due to elevated compression levels. Additionally, high-speed jets form at the compressive edges of HFAs, exhibiting a significant increase in dynamic pressure and potentially contributing to driving further localized compression. Our findings emphasize the efficiency of quasi-parallel shocks in driving particle acceleration far beyond the immediate shock transition region, expanding the acceleration region to a larger spatial domain. Finally, this study underscores the importance of multi-scale observational approach in understanding the convoluted processes behind collisionless shock physics and their broader implications.</description>

      <title>New Insights on the High Reconnection Rate and the Diminishment of Ion Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered electron-only reconnection has drawn great interests due to abnormal features like lack of ion outflows and high reconnection rates. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate their physical mechanisms. The reconnection rate, when normalized by ion parameters ($R_i$), may appear anomalously high, whereas that normalized by electron parameters ($R_e$) remains ~0.1. We propose that the essence of high $R_i$ is insufficient field line bending outside the electron diffusion region, indicating an incomplete development of the ion diffusion region. It may result from bursty reconnection in thin current sheets, or small system sizes. The ion outflow diminishes at high $\beta_i$ when the gyroradius ($\rho_i$) exceeds the system size. Low-velocity ions still experience notable acceleration from Hall fields. However, a local distribution includes many high-velocity ions that experience random accelerations from different electric fields across $\rho_i$, resulting in near-zero bulk velocities. Our study helps understand reconnection structures and the underlying physics for transitions between different regimes.</description>

      <title>Extreme heating of minor ions in imbalanced solar-wind turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minor ions in the solar corona are heated to extreme temperatures, far in excess of those of the electrons and protons that comprise the bulk of the plasma. These highly non-thermal distributions make minor ions sensitive probes of the underlying collisionless heating processes, which are crucial to coronal heating and the creation of the solar wind. The recent discovery of the "helicity barrier" offers a mechanism where imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence in low-beta plasmas preferentially heats protons over electrons, generating high-frequency, proton-cyclotron-resonant fluctuations. We use the hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell code, Pegasus++, to drive imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence in a 3D low-beta plasma with additional passive ion species, He$^{2+}$ and O$^{5+}$. A helicity barrier naturally develops, followed by clear phase-space signatures of oblique ion-cyclotron-wave heating and Landau-resonant heating from the imbalanced Alfv\'enic fluctuations. The former results in characteristically arced ion velocity distribution functions, whose non-bi-Maxwellian features are shown by linear ALPS calculations to be critical to the heating process. Additional features include a steep transition-range electromagnetic spectrum, the presence of ion-cyclotron waves propagating in the direction of imbalance, significantly enhanced proton-to-electron heating ratios, anisotropic ion temperatures that are significantly more perpendicular with respect to magnetic field, and extreme heating of heavier species in a manner consistent with empirically derived mass scalings informed by measurements. None of these features are realized in an otherwise equivalent simulation of balanced turbulence. If seen simultaneously in the fast solar wind, these signatures of the helicity barrier would testify to the necessity of incorporating turbulence imbalance in a complete theory for the evolution of the solar wind.</description>
