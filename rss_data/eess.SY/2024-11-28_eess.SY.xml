      <title>Optimization and Dynamic Analysis of a Vibro-Impact Nonlinear Energy Sink with Electromagnetic Coil for Vibration Suppression and Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a system comprising a linear oscillator (LO) equipped with a Vibro-Impact Nonlinear Energy Sink (VI-NES) and a coil. The LO's damping and stiffness coefficients are represented by ( C ) and ( k ), respectively, while a ball inside the LO moves within a cavity, colliding with the walls at both ends. The primary focus is on optimizing the cavity length (( L_c )) and the coefficient of restitution (( \kappa )) and coil parameter () using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The motion equations for the LO incorporating the VI-NES are derived, considering the electromagnetic force (( F_e )) and contact force (( F_c )). The study also explores the energy harvesting circuit, which generates electric power by connecting a load resistance to the coil, transforming mechanical energy into electrical energy. The dynamic behavior of the system is analyzed, highlighting the transition from predictable patterns to chaotic responses. Efficiency metrics are defined to measure the VI-NES's performance in absorbing and dissipating excitation energy. The optimization formulation addresses the influence of initial conditions, proposing a multi-objective approach to handle uncertainties. Validation against existing studies confirms the reliability of the proposed optimization method. The results demonstrate that optimizing both ( L_c ) and ( \kappa ) using GA effectively minimizes the amplitude response of the LO, outperforming approximate methods.</description>

      <title>A Parameter Adaptive Trajectory Tracking and Motion Control Framework for Autonomous Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the trajectory tracking and motion control problems for autonomous vehicles (AVs). A parameter adaptive control framework for AVs is proposed to enhance tracking accuracy and yaw stability. While establishing linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and three robust controllers, the control framework addresses trajectory tracking and motion control in a modular fashion, without introducing complexity into each controller. The robust performance has been guaranteed in three robust controllers by considering the parameter uncertainties, mismatch of unmodeled subsystem as well as external disturbance, comprehensively. Also, the dynamic characteristics of uncertain parameters are identified by Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm, while the boundaries of three robust factors are determined through combining Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Bayesian optimization machine learning methods, reducing the conservatism of the controller. Sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability under the diverse robust factors are provided by the Lyapunov method analytically. The simulation results on MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim joint platform demonstrate that the proposed methodology considerably improves tracking accuracy, driving stability, and robust performance, guaranteeing the feasibility and capability of driving in extreme scenarios.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of Phase-locked loops: a non reductionist approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-locked loop (PLL), conceived in 1932 by H. Bellescize, has been the basic electronic component in the development of communication technology from the early analog radio receptors to modern digital civil and military facilities. Traditionally, the analysis is conducted by modeling the dynamical behavior of phase and frequency errors, hence following a phase reduction approach. One of the main goals of the present work is to describe and investigate the dynamics of a PLL node by representing it in full state-space, here called non reductionist model, without the usual design simplifications i.e., considering different input and output frequencies and not neglecting the higher frequencies components generated in the phase detection process. On the one hand, this approach complicates the use of analytical tools but on the other hand it permits an efficient numerical approach that can be used for precise definition of regions in parameters space that show the boundaries between synchronization and non synchronization regimes, even when noise is considered. Results show that the PLL node can be simulated in a more realistic way using the state-space model and that a number of design-relevant aspects can now be investigated numerically.</description>

      <title>Combined Learning of Linear Parameter-Varying Models and Robust Control Invariant Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical models identified from data are frequently employed in control system design. However, decoupling system identification from controller synthesis can result in situations where no suitable controller exists after a model has been identified. In this work, we introduce a novel control-oriented regularization in the identification procedure to ensure the existence of a controller that can enforce constraints on system variables robustly. The combined identification algorithm includes: (i) the concurrent learning of an uncertain model and a nominal model using an observer; (ii) a regularization term on the model parameters defined as the size of the largest robust control invariant set for the uncertain model. To make the learning problem tractable, we consider nonlinear models in quasi Linear Parameter-Varying (qLPV) form, utilizing a novel scheduling function parameterization that facilitates the derivation of an associated uncertain linear model. The robust control invariant set is represented as a polytope, and we adopt novel results from polytope geometry to derive the regularization function as the optimal value of a convex quadratic program. Additionally, we present new model-reduction approaches that exploit the chosen model structure. Numerical examples on classical identification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. A simple control scheme is also derived to provide an example of data-driven control of a constrained nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>Application of Soft Actor-Critic Algorithms in Optimizing Wastewater Treatment with Time Delays Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants face unique challenges for process control due to their complex dynamics, slow time constants, and stochastic delays in observations and actions. These characteristics make conventional control methods, such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative controllers, suboptimal for achieving efficient phosphorus removal, a critical component of wastewater treatment to ensure environmental sustainability. This study addresses these challenges using a novel deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, integrated with a custom simulator designed to model the delayed feedback inherent in wastewater treatment plants. The simulator incorporates Long Short-Term Memory networks for accurate multi-step state predictions, enabling realistic training scenarios. To account for the stochastic nature of delays, agents were trained under three delay scenarios: no delay, constant delay, and random delay. The results demonstrate that incorporating random delays into the reinforcement learning framework significantly improves phosphorus removal efficiency while reducing operational costs. Specifically, the delay-aware agent achieved 36% reduction in phosphorus emissions, 55% higher reward, 77% lower target deviation from the regulatory limit, and 9% lower total costs than traditional control methods in the simulated environment. These findings underscore the potential of reinforcement learning to overcome the limitations of conventional control strategies in wastewater treatment, providing an adaptive and cost-effective solution for phosphorus removal.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Agility and Reconfigurability in Satellite Systems for Tropical Cyclone Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly dynamic natural disasters that travel vast distances and occupy a large spatial scale, leading to loss of life, economic strife, and destruction of infrastructure. The severe impact of TCs makes them crucial to monitor such that the collected data contributes to forecasting their trajectory and severity, as well as the provision of information to relief agencies. Among the various methods used to monitor TCs, Earth observation satellites are the most flexible, allowing for frequent observations with a wide variety of instruments. Traditionally, satellite scheduling algorithms assume nadir-directional observations, a limitation that can be alleviated by incorporating satellite agility and constellation reconfigurability -- two state-of-the-art concepts of operations (CONOPS) that extend the amount of time TCs can be observed from orbit. This paper conducts a systematic comparative analysis between both CONOPS to present the performance of each relative to baseline nadir-directional observations in monitoring TCs. A dataset of 100 historical TCs is used to provide a benchmark concerning real-world data through maximizing the number of quality observations. The results of the comparative analysis indicate that constellation reconfigurability allowing plane-change maneuvers outperforms satellite agility in the majority of TCs analyzed.</description>

      <title>SRG Analysis of Lur'e Systems and the Generalized Circle Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems. However, we show that the current SRG analysis suffers from some pitfalls that limit its applicability in analysing practical nonlinear systems. We overcome these pitfalls by modifying the SRG of a linear time invariant operator, combining the SRG with the Nyquist criterion, and apply our result to Lur'e systems. We thereby obtain a generalization of the celebrated circle criterion, which deals with broader class of nonlinearities, and provides (incremental) $L^2$-gain performance bounds. We illustrate the power of the new approach on the analysis of the controlled Duffing oscillator.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Coverage in Convex Quadrilateral Regions with a Single UAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates the optimal hovering altitude of a single UAV to provide coverage over any convex quadrilateral region on the ground. The UAV employs a directional antenna with a tiltable beam, producing an elliptical coverage pattern. Two scenarios are considered: (1) inscribing the largest ellipse within the quadrilateral to cover its interior, and (2) circumscribing the smallest ellipse about the quadrilateral to ensure full coverage. We derive the optimal UAV altitude and antenna tilt conditions in both scenarios for a simplified yet widely accepted path loss model and present numerical results for coverage efficiency. The work contributes to the development of energy-efficient UAV-based communication systems.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Orchestration of Service-Oriented Model-Based Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel graph-based method for adapting control system architectures at runtime. We use a service-oriented architecture as a basis for its formulation. In our method, adaptation is achieved by selecting the most suitable elements, such as filters and controllers, for a control system architecture to improve control systems objective based on a predefined cost function. Traditional configuration methods, such as state machines, lack flexibility and depend on a predefined control system architecture during runtime. Our graph-based method allows for dynamic changes in the control system architecture, as well as a change in its objective depending on the given system state. Our approach uses a weighted, directed graph to model the control system elements and their interaction. In a case-study with a three-tank system, we show that by using our graph-based method for architecture adaptation, the control system is more flexible, has lower computation time, and higher accuracy than traditional configuration methods.</description>

      <title>Generating CKM Using Others' Data: Cross-AP CKM Inference with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a promising paradigm shift towards environment-aware communication and sensing by providing location-specific prior channel knowledge before real-time communication. Although CKM is particularly appealing for dense networks such as cell-free networks, it remains a challenge to efficiently generate CKMs in dense networks. For a dense network with CKMs of existing access points (APs), it will be useful to efficiently generate CKMs of potentially new APs with only AP location information. The generation of inferred CKMs across APs can help dense networks achieve convenient initial CKM generation, environment-aware AP deployment, and cost-effective CKM updates. Considering that different APs in the same region share the same physical environment, there exists a natural correlation between the channel knowledge of different APs. Therefore, by mining the implicit correlation between location-specific channel knowledge, cross-AP CKM inference can be realized using data from other APs. This paper proposes a cross-AP inference method to generate CKMs of potentially new APs with deep learning. The location of the target AP is fed into the UNet model in combination with the channel knowledge of other existing APs, and supervised learning is performed based on the channel knowledge of the target AP. Based on the trained UNet and the channel knowledge of the existing APs, the CKM inference of the potentially new AP can be generated across APs. The generation results of the inferred CKM validate the feasibility and effectiveness of cross-AP CKM inference with other APs' channel knowledge.</description>

      <title>Securing RIS-Aided Wireless Networks Against Full Duplex Active Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the physical layer security of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided wireless network in the presence of full-duplex active eavesdropping. In this scenario, the RIS cooperates with the Base Station (BS) to transfer information to the intended user while an active attacker attempts to intercept the information through a wiretap channel. In addition, the attacker sends jamming signals to interfere with the legitimate user's reception of the signal and increase the eavesdropping rate. Our objective is to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the active and passive beamformers at the BS and RIS, respectively. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose a solution that decomposes it into two disjoint beamforming design sub-problems solved iteratively using Alternating Optimization (AO) techniques. Numerical analysis is conducted to evaluate the impacts of varying the number of active attacking antennas and elements of the RIS on the secrecy performance of the considered systems under the presence of jamming signals sent by the attacker. The results demonstrate the importance of considering the impact of jamming signals on physical layer security in RIS-aided wireless networks. Overall, our work contributes to the growing body of literature on RIS-aided wireless networks and highlights the need to address the effects of jamming and active eavesdropping signals in such systems.</description>

      <title>Stability and Synchronization of Kuramoto Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine a group of oscillators, each endowed with their own rhythm or frequency, be it the ticking of a biological clock, the swing of a pendulum, or the glowing of fireflies. While these individual oscillators may seem independent of one another at first glance, the true magic lies in their ability to influence and synchronize with one another, like a group of fireflies glowing in unison.
  The Kuramoto model was motivated by this phenomenon of collective synchronization, when a group of a large number of oscillators spontaneously lock to a common frequency, despite vast differences in their individual frequencies. Inspired by Kuramoto's groundbreaking work in the 1970s, this model captures the essence of how interconnected systems, ranging from biological networks to power grids, can achieve a state of synchronization.
  This work aims to study the stability and synchronization of Kuramoto oscillators, starting off with an introduction to Kuramoto Oscillators and it's broader applications. We then at a graph theoretic formulation for the same and establish various criterion for the stability, synchronization of Kuramoto Oscillators. Finally, we broadly analyze and experiment with various physical systems that tend to behave like Kuramoto oscillators followed by further simulations.</description>

      <title>RL for Mitigating Cascading Failures: Targeted Exploration via Sensitivity Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electricity grid's resiliency and climate change strongly impact one another due to an array of technical and policy-related decisions that impact both. This paper introduces a physics-informed machine learning-based framework to enhance grid's resiliency. Specifically, when encountering disruptive events, this paper designs remedial control actions to prevent blackouts. The proposed Physics-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PG-RL) framework determines effective real-time remedial line-switching actions, considering their impact on power balance, system security, and grid reliability. To identify an effective blackout mitigation policy, PG-RL leverages power-flow sensitivity factors to guide the RL exploration during agent training. Comprehensive evaluations using the Grid2Op platform demonstrate that incorporating physical signals into RL significantly improves resource utilization within electric grids and achieves better blackout mitigation policies - both of which are critical in addressing climate change.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a distributed trajectory planning method for multi-agent aerial tracking. The proposed method uses a Dynamic Buffered Voronoi Cell (DBVC) and a Dynamic Inter-Visibility Cell (DIVC) to formulate the distributed trajectory generation. Specifically, the DBVC and the DIVC are time-variant spaces that prevent mutual collisions and occlusions among agents, while enabling them to maintain suitable distances from the moving target. We combine the DBVC and the DIVC with an efficient Bernstein polynomial motion primitive-based tracking generation method, which has been refined into a less conservative approach than in our previous work. The proposed algorithm can compute each agent's trajectory within several milliseconds on an Intel i7 desktop. We validate the tracking performance in challenging scenarios, including environments with dozens of obstacles.</description>

      <title>A Runtime-Adaptive Transformer Neural Network Accelerator on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks (TNN) excel in natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV) without relying on recurrent or convolutional layers. However, they have high computational and memory demands, particularly on resource-constrained devices like FPGAs. Moreover, transformer models vary in processing time across applications, requiring custom models with specific parameters. Designing custom accelerators for each model is complex and time-intensive. Some custom accelerators exist with no runtime adaptability, and they often rely on sparse matrices to reduce latency. However, hardware designs become more challenging due to the need for application-specific sparsity patterns. This paper introduces ADAPTOR, a runtime-adaptive accelerator for dense matrix computations in transformer encoders and decoders on FPGAs. ADAPTOR enhances the utilization of processing elements and on-chip memory, enhancing parallelism and reducing latency. It incorporates efficient matrix tiling to distribute resources across FPGA platforms and is fully quantized for computational efficiency and portability. Evaluations on Xilinx Alveo U55C data center cards and embedded platforms like VC707 and ZCU102 show that our design is 1.2$\times$ and 2.87$\times$ more power efficient than the NVIDIA K80 GPU and the i7-8700K CPU respectively. Additionally, it achieves a speedup of 1.7 to 2.25$\times$ compared to some state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerators.</description>

      <title>A Cost-Effective Approach to Smooth A* Path Planning for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path planning for wheeled mobile robots is a critical component in the field of automation and intelligent transportation systems. Car-like vehicles, which have non-holonomic constraints on their movement capability impose additional requirements on the planned paths. Traditional path planning algorithms, such as A* , are widely used due to their simplicity and effectiveness in finding optimal paths in complex environments. However, these algorithms often do not consider vehicle dynamics, resulting in paths that are infeasible or impractical for actual driving. Specifically, a path that minimizes the number of grid cells may still be too curvy or sharp for a car-like vehicle to navigate smoothly. This paper addresses the need for a path planning solution that not only finds a feasible path but also ensures that the path is smooth and drivable. By adapting the A* algorithm for a curvature constraint and incorporating a cost function that considers the smoothness of possible paths, we aim to bridge the gap between grid based path planning and smooth paths that are drivable by car-like vehicles. The proposed method leverages motion primitives, pre-computed using a ribbon based path planner that produces smooth paths of minimum curvature. The motion primitives guide the A* algorithm in finding paths of minimal length and curvature. With the proposed modification on the A* algorithm, the planned paths can be constraint to have a minimum turning radius much larger than the grid size. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in different unstructured environments. In a two-stage planning approach, first the modified A* algorithm finds a grid-based path and the ribbon based path planner creates a smooth path within the area of grid cells. The resulting paths are smooth with small curvatures independent of the orientation of the grid axes and even in presence of sharp obstacles.</description>

      <title>SCoTT: Wireless-Aware Path Planning with Vision Language Models and Strategic Chains-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path planning is a complex problem for many practical applications, particularly in robotics. Existing algorithms, however, are exhaustive in nature and become increasingly complex when additional side constraints are incorporated alongside distance minimization. In this paper, a novel approach using vision language models (VLMs) is proposed for enabling path planning in complex wireless-aware environments. To this end, insights from a digital twin (DT) with real-world wireless ray tracing data are explored in order to guarantee an average path gain threshold while minimizing the trajectory length. First, traditional approaches such as A* are compared to several wireless-aware extensions, and an optimal iterative dynamic programming approach (DP-WA*) is derived, which fully takes into account all path gains and distance metrics within the DT. On the basis of these baselines, the role of VLMs as an alternative assistant for path planning is investigated, and a strategic chain-of-thought tasking (SCoTT) approach is proposed. SCoTT divides the complex planning task into several subproblems and solves each with advanced CoT prompting. Results show that SCoTT achieves very close average path gains compared to DP-WA* while at the same time yielding consistently shorter path lengths. The results also show that VLMs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by efficiently reducing the algorithm's search space and thus saving up to 62\% in execution time. This work underscores the potential of VLMs in future digital systems as capable assistants for solving complex tasks, while enhancing user interaction and accelerating rapid prototyping under diverse wireless constraints.</description>

      <title>Certified Training with Branch-and-Bound: A Case Study on Lyapunov-stable Neural Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning Lyapunov-stable neural controllers which provably satisfy the Lyapunov asymptotic stability condition within a region-of-attraction. Compared to previous works which commonly used counterexample guided training on this task, we develop a new and generally formulated certified training framework named CT-BaB, and we optimize for differentiable verified bounds, to produce verification-friendly models. In order to handle the relatively large region-of-interest, we propose a novel framework of training-time branch-and-bound to dynamically maintain a training dataset of subregions throughout training, such that the hardest subregions are iteratively split into smaller ones whose verified bounds can be computed more tightly to ease the training. We demonstrate that our new training framework can produce models which can be more efficiently verified at test time. On the largest 2D quadrotor dynamical system, verification for our model is more than 5X faster compared to the baseline, while our size of region-of-attraction is 16X larger than the baseline.</description>

      <title>Wearable intelligent throat enables natural speech in stroke patients with dysarthria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable silent speech systems hold significant potential for restoring communication in patients with speech impairments. However, seamless, coherent speech remains elusive, and clinical efficacy is still unproven. Here, we present an AI-driven intelligent throat (IT) system that integrates throat muscle vibrations and carotid pulse signal sensors with large language model (LLM) processing to enable fluent, emotionally expressive communication. The system utilizes ultrasensitive textile strain sensors to capture high-quality signals from the neck area and supports token-level processing for real-time, continuous speech decoding, enabling seamless, delay-free communication. In tests with five stroke patients with dysarthria, IT's LLM agents intelligently corrected token errors and enriched sentence-level emotional and logical coherence, achieving low error rates (4.2% word error rate, 2.9% sentence error rate) and a 55% increase in user satisfaction. This work establishes a portable, intuitive communication platform for patients with dysarthria with the potential to be applied broadly across different neurological conditions and in multi-language support systems.</description>

      <title>G3Flow: Generative 3D Semantic Flow for Pose-aware and Generalizable Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning for 3D robotic manipulation have shown promising results with diffusion-based policies. However, achieving human-level dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal BD-RIS in Full-duplex Communications: A Perspective on Sum-rate Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been envisioned as a key technology in future wireless communication networks to enable smart radio environment. To further enhance the passive beamforming capability of RIS, beyond diagonal (BD)-RIS has been proposed considering interconnections among different RIS elements. BD-RIS has a unique feature that cannot be enabled by conventional diagonal RIS; it can be realized by non-reciprocal circuits and thus has asymmetric scattering matrix. This feature provides probability to break the wireless channel reciprocity, and thus has potential to benefit the full-duplex (FD) system. In this paper, we model the BD RIS-assisted FD systems, where the impact of BD-RIS non-reciprocity and that of structural scattering, which refers to the virtual direct channel constructed by RIS when the RIS is turned OFF, are explicitly captured. To visualize the analysis, we propose to design the scattering matrix, precoder and combiner to maximize the DL and UL sum-rates in the FD system. To tackle this optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordination descent (BCD) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD). Numerical results demonstrate surprising benefits of non-reciprocal BD-RIS that it can achieve higher DL and UL sum-rates in the FD scenario than reciprocal BD-RIS and conventional diagonal RIS.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Cumulative Reward in Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the concentration properties of cumulative rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), focusing on both asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings. We introduce a unified approach to characterize reward concentration in MDPs, covering both infinite-horizon settings (i.e., average and discounted reward frameworks) and finite-horizon setting. Our asymptotic results include the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem, and the law of iterated logarithms, while our non-asymptotic bounds include Azuma-Hoeffding-type inequalities and a non-asymptotic version of the law of iterated logarithms. Additionally, we explore two key implications of our results. First, we analyze the sample path behavior of the difference in rewards between any two stationary policies. Second, we show that two alternative definitions of regret for learning policies proposed in the literature are rate-equivalent. Our proof techniques rely on a novel martingale decomposition of cumulative rewards, properties of the solution to the policy evaluation fixed-point equation, and both asymptotic and non-asymptotic concentration results for martingale difference sequences.</description>

      <title>Strategic Planning of Carbon-Neutral Heating Demand Coverage Under Uncertainty in a Coupled Multi-Energy Grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating the gas and district heating with the electrical grid in a multi-energy grid has been shown to provide flexibility and prevent bottlenecks in the operation of electrical distribution grids. This integration assumes a top-down grid planning approach and a perfect knowledge of consumer behaviour. In reality, consumers decides whether to adopt a heating technology based on costs and government regulation. This behavior is highly uncertain and depends on fluctuations in heating technology costs and energy prices. The uncertainty associated with consumer behavior increases the risk of investment in grid expansion. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes an approach with the consumer at the center of the planning method. Robust optimization is used to model the uncertainty in prices to reduce the risk of investment in grid expansion. The uncertainty in energy prices is modeled using interval uncertainty with a proportional deviation. This allows planners, operators and regulators to predict the adoption rate of certain heating technology in different geographical areas and prioritize the expansion of specific grids where they are required. By minimizing a cost function subject to robust constraints, the strategy ensures robustness against uncertainties in energy prices. This robust optimization approach is applied to Hamburg as a case study. The result of the optimization represents the consumer's decision. The impact of the consumer's decision on the electrical grid is analzed on different benchmark distribution grids. The study concludes that district heating expansion in high-density areas is a low-risk investment for carbon neutrality. In less dense areas, electrification supports decentralized heat pumps. Meanwhile, hydrogen gas grids are viable where electric expansion is impractical. Increased uncertainty leads to more conservative solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19353v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of stabilizing a leader-follower formation specified by a set of bearing constraints and being disturbed by some unknown uniformly bounded disturbance{s}. A set of leaders are positioned at their desired positions, while each follower is modeled by a single integrator with an additive time-varying disturbance. Adaptive variable-structure control laws using displacements or only bearing vectors are provided to stabilize the desired formation. Thanks to the adaptive mechanisms, the proposed control laws require neither information of the bearing Laplacian nor the disturbances' directions and upper bounds. It is further proved that when the leaders are moving with a same bounded uniformly continuous velocity, the moving target formation can still be achieved under the proposed control laws. Simulation results are also given to support the stability analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper offers a comprehensive performance analysis of the distributed continuous-time filtering in the presence of modeling errors. First, we introduce two performance indices, namely the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. By leveraging the nominal performance index and the Frobenius norm of the modeling deviations, we derive the bounds of the estimation error covariance and the lower bound of the nominal performance index. Specifically, we reveal the effect of the consensus parameter on both bounds. We demonstrate that, under specific conditions, an incorrect process noise covariance can lead to the divergence of the estimation error covariance. Moreover, we investigate the properties of the eigenvalues of the error dynamical matrix. Furthermore, we explore the magnitude relations between the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. Finally, we present some numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present, analyze, and illustrate a first-of-its-kind model of two-dimensional excitable (spiking) dynamics for decision-making over two options. The model, Spiking Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (S-NOD), provides superior agility, characterized by fast, flexible, and adaptive response to rapid and unpredictable changes in context, environment, or information received about available options. S-NOD derives through the introduction of a single extra term to the previously presented Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (NOD) for fast and flexible multi-agent decision-making behavior. The extra term is inspired by the fast-positive, slow-negative mixed-feedback structure of excitable systems. The agile behaviors brought about by the new excitable nature of decision-making driven by S-NOD are analyzed in a general setting and illustrated in an application to multi-robot navigation around human movers.</description>

      <title>Observability and Generalized Sensor Placement for Nonlinear Quality Models in Drinking Water Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of optimal geographic placement of water quality (WQ) sensors in drinking water distribution networks (WDNs), with a specific focus on chlorine transport, decay, and reaction models. Such models are traditionally used as suitable proxies for WQ. The literature on this topic is indeed inveterate, but has a key limitation: it utilizes simplified single-species decay and reaction models that do not capture WQ transients for nonlinear, multi-species interactions. This results in sensor placements that do not account for nonlinear WQ dynamics. Furthermore, and as WQ simulations are parameterized by hydraulic profiles and demand patterns, the placement of sensors are often hydraulics-dependent. This study produces a simple algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned limitations. The presented algorithm is grounded in nonlinear dynamic system sciences and observability theory, and yields sensor placements that are robust to hydraulic changes. Thorough case studies on benchmark water networks are provided. The key findings provide practical recommendations for WDN operators.</description>

      <title>QP Chaser: Polynomial Trajectory Generation for Autonomous Aerial Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maintaining the visibility of the target is one of the major objectives of aerial tracking missions. This paper proposes a target-visible trajectory planning pipeline using quadratic programming (QP). Our approach can handle various tracking settings, including 1) single- and dual-target following and 2) both static and dynamic environments, unlike other works that focus on a single specific setup. In contrast to other studies that fully trust the predicted trajectory of the target and consider only the visibility of the target's center, our pipeline considers error in target path prediction and the entire body of the target to maintain the target visibility robustly. First, a prediction module uses a sample-check strategy to quickly calculate the reachable sets of moving objects, which represent the areas their bodies can reach, considering obstacles. Subsequently, the planning module formulates a single QP problem, considering path topology, to generate a tracking trajectory that maximizes the visibility of the target's reachable set among obstacles. The performance of the planner is validated in multiple scenarios, through high-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Linear quadratic control of nonlinear systems with Koopman operator learning and the Nystr\"om method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how the Koopman operator framework can be combined with kernel methods to effectively control nonlinear dynamical systems. While kernel methods have typically large computational requirements, we show how random subspaces (Nystr\"om approximation) can be used to achieve huge computational savings while preserving accuracy. Our main technical contribution is deriving theoretical guarantees on the effect of the Nystr\"om approximation. More precisely, we study the linear quadratic regulator problem, showing that the approximated Riccati operator converges at the rate $m^{-1/2}$, and the regulator objective, for the associated solution of the optimal control problem, converges at the rate $m^{-1}$, where $m$ is the random subspace size. Theoretical findings are complemented by numerical experiments corroborating our results.</description>

      <title>Distributed Prescribed-Time Convex Optimization: Cascade Design and Time-Varying Gain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the distributed prescribed-time convex optimization (DPTCO) problem for a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) under undirected connected graph. A cascade design framework is proposed such that the DPTCO implementation is divided into two parts: distributed optimal trajectory generator design and local reference trajectory tracking controller design. The DPTCO problem is then transformed into the prescribed-time stabilization problem of a cascaded system. Changing Lyapunov function method and time-varying state transformation method together with the sufficient conditions are proposed to prove the prescribed-time stabilization of the cascaded system as well as the uniform boundedness of internal signals in the closed-loop systems. The proposed framework is then utilized to solve robust DPTCO problem for a class of chain-integrator MASs with external disturbances by constructing a novel variables and exploiting the property of time-varying gains. The proposed framework is further utilized to solve the adaptive DPTCO problem for a class of strict-feedback MASs with parameter uncertainty, in which backstepping method with prescribed-time dynamic filter is adopted. The descending power state transformation is introduced to compensate the growth of increasing rate induced by the derivative of time-varying gains in recursive steps and the high-order derivative of local reference trajectory is not required. Finally, theoretical results are verified by two numerical examples.</description>
