      <title>Model Reference Adaptive Control of Networked Systems with State and Input Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive control strategies have progressively advanced to accommodate increasingly uncertain, delayed, and interconnected systems. This paper addresses the model reference adaptive control (MRAC) of networked, heterogeneous, and unknown dynamical agents subject to both state and input delays. The objective is to ensure that all follower agents asymptotically track the trajectory of a stable leader system, despite system uncertainties and communication constraints. Two communication topologies are considered, full connectivity between each agent and the leader, and partial connectivity wherein agents rely on both neighboring peers and the leader. The agent-to-agent and agent-to-leader interactions are encoded using a Laplacian-like matrix and a diagonal model-weighting matrix, respectively. To compensate for the delays, a predictor-based control structure and an auxiliary dynamic system are proposed. The control framework includes distributed adaptive parameter laws derived via Lyapunov-based analysis, ensuring convergence of the augmented tracking error. Stability conditions are established through a carefully constructed Lyapunov Krasovskii functional, under minimal assumptions on connectivity and excitation. Numerical simulations of both network structures validate the proposed method, demonstrating that exact leader tracking is achieved under appropriately designed learning rates and initializations. This work lays a foundation for future studies on fault-resilient distributed adaptive control incorporating data-driven or reinforcement learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design of Experiment for Electrochemical Parameter Identification of Li-ion Battery via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation in electrochemical battery models is essential for monitoring and assessing the performance of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). This paper presents a novel approach that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with an optimal experimental design (OED) framework to identify key electrochemical parameters of LiB cell models. The proposed method utilizes the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm to optimize input excitation, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the system response to electrochemical parameters. The performance of this DRL-based approach is evaluated against a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method and conventional tests. Results indicate that the DRL-based method provides superior information content, reflected in higher Fisher information (FI) values and lower parameter estimation errors compared to the NMPC design and conventional test practices. Additionally, the DRL approach offers a substantial reduction in experimental time and computational resources.</description>

      <title>Looking for Signs: Reasoning About FOBNNs Using SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-Order Boolean Networks with Non-deterministic updates (FOBNN) compute a boolean transition graph representing the absence and presence of species over time. The utility of FOBNNs has been justified by their theoretical soundness with respect to the Euler simulation of the differential equations. However, we lack practical means to work with FOBNNs and an empirical evaluation of their properties. We present a sound and efficient reduction of the first-order FOBNN transition relation to a propositional logic formula. This makes it possible to use modern SAT solvers to reason on the full transition graph, even for large models. We use this encoding to assess the feasibility and efficiency of practical reasoning with FOBNNs. To do so, we focus on the computation of fixed points. We also compare the transition graphs obtained via FOBNNs to those computed by the classic boolean semantics of reaction networks. Overall, our encoding opens new directions for the analysis of FOBNNs and deepens the understanding of their relationship with reaction networks.</description>

      <title>AgenticControl: An Automated Control Design Framework Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional control system design, reliant on expert knowledge and precise models, struggles with complex, nonlinear, or uncertain dynamics. This paper introduces AgenticControl, a novel multi-agent framework that automates controller design using coordinated Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Through structured JSON communication, these agents handle tasks including controller selection, scenario design, parameter optimization, performance evaluation, and decision-making. Through an actor-critic optimization approach, the system iteratively improves performance while progressing through scenarios of increasing complexity to ensure robustness under nominal conditions, measurement noise, actuator disturbances, and parametric uncertainties. Key innovations include structured multi-agent collaboration, robust optimization mechanisms, and real-time adaptability via in-context learning. Validated across four diverse control systems, namely, DC Motor Position control, Ball and Beam, Inverted Pendulum, and Double Inverted Pendulum, the framework achieves competitive performance against classical methods. Its Full State Feedback solution closely matches Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) results, while the designed PID controller significantly outperforming MATLAB's PIDTuner, reducing PID tracking error by 55% through adaptive parameter exploration. A comparative study of five LLM models reveals distinct optimization profiles, with DeepSeek achieving the fastest convergence. This work demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven control design, paving the way for advanced techniques like model predictive control and reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a closed-loop dc-dc converter using a physics-informed neural network-based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing reliance on power electronics introduces new challenges requiring detailed time-domain analyses with fast and accurate circuit simulation tools. Currently, commercial time-domain simulation software are mainly relying on physics-based methods to simulate power electronics. Recent work showed that data-driven and physics-informed learning methods can increase simulation speed with limited compromise on accuracy, but many challenges remain before deployment in commercial tools can be possible. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed bidirectional long-short term memory neural network (BiLSTM-PINN) model to simulate the time-domain response of a closed-loop dc-dc boost converter for various operating points, parameters, and perturbations. A physics-informed fully-connected neural network (FCNN) and a BiLSTM are also trained to establish a comparison. The three methods are then compared using step-response tests to assess their performance and limitations in terms of accuracy. The results show that the BiLSTM-PINN and BiLSTM models outperform the FCNN model by more than 9 and 4.5 times, respectively, in terms of median RMSE. Their standard deviation values are more than 2.6 and 1.7 smaller than the FCNN's, making them also more consistent. Those results illustrate that the proposed BiLSTM-PINN is a potential alternative to other physics-based or data-driven methods for power electronics simulations.</description>

      <title>Low-Cost Infrastructure-Free 3D Relative Localization with Sub-Meter Accuracy in Near Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative localization in the near-field scenario is critically important for unmanned vehicle (UxV) applications. Although related works addressing 2D relative localization problem have been widely studied for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), the problem in 3D scenarios for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) involves more uncertainties and remains to be investigated. Inspired by the phenomenon that animals can achieve swarm behaviors solely based on individual perception of relative information, this study proposes an infrastructure-free 3D relative localization framework that relies exclusively on onboard ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors. Leveraging 2D relative positioning research, we conducted feasibility analysis, system modeling, simulations, performance evaluation, and field tests using UWB sensors. The key contributions of this work include: derivation of the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) for near-field scenarios; development of two localization algorithms -- one based on Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) and another employing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE); comprehensive performance comparison and computational complexity analysis against state-of-the-art methods; simulation studies and field experiments; a novel sensor deployment strategy inspired by animal behavior, enabling single-sensor implementation within the proposed framework for UxV applications. The theoretical, simulation, and experimental results demonstrate strong generalizability to other 3D near-field localization tasks, with significant potential for a cost-effective cross-platform UxV collaborative system.</description>

      <title>Online Algorithms for Recovery of Low-Rank Parameter Matrix in Non-stationary Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a two-stage online algorithm for recovery of low-rank parameter matrix in non-stationary stochastic systems. The first stage applies the recursive least squares (RLS) estimator combined with its singular value decomposition to estimate the unknown parameter matrix within the system, leveraging RLS for adaptability and SVD to reveal low-rank structure. The second stage introduces a weighted nuclear norm regularization criterion function, where adaptive weights derived from the first-stage enhance low-rank constraints. The regularization criterion admits an explicit and online computable solution, enabling efficient online updates when new data arrive without reprocessing historical data. Under the non-stationary and the non-persistent excitation conditions on the systems, the algorithm provably achieves: (i) the true rank of the unknown parameter matrix can be identified with a finite number of observations, (ii) the values of the matrix components can be consistently estimated as the number of observations increases, and (iii) the asymptotical normality of the algorithm is established as well. Such properties are termed oracle properties in the literature. Numerical simulations validate performance of the algorithm in estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Peer-to-Peer Energy Markets With Uniform Pricing: A Dynamic Operating Envelope Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of rooftop solar backed by battery storage is enabling energy customers to both produce and consume electricity (i.e., prosumers of electricity). To facilitate prosumer participation in the electric grid, new market mechanisms are required. In this paper, we design peer-to-peer energy markets where prosumers trade their excess energy with peers to gain profit while satisfying the overall balance in electricity supply and demand. We first consider a market structure, considering the case where voltage and/or thermal constraints are binding. When such grid constraints are binding, market clearing prices can vary across locations. However, heterogeneous prices may be considered by regulators to lack fairness. To ensure uniform pricing, we design two peer-to-peer energy markets with dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs). DOEs enable us to decompose global voltage and thermal constraints across the power grid into local constraints for each prosumer, resulting in uniform prices across the grid. By means of numerical simulations on an IEEE 13-node feeder, we benchmark the proposed market-based approaches in the presence of binding voltage constraints.</description>

      <title>Partially Observable Residual Reinforcement Learning for PV-Inverter-Based Voltage Control in Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient Residual Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework for voltage control in active distribution grids. Voltage control remains a critical challenge in distribution grids, where conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often suffer from slow training convergence and inefficient exploration. To overcome these challenges, the proposed RRL approach learns a residual policy on top of a modified Sequential Droop Control (SDC) mechanism, ensuring faster convergence. Additionally, the framework introduces a Local Shared Linear (LSL) architecture for the Q-network and a Transformer-Encoder actor network, which collectively enhance overall performance. Unlike several existing approaches, the proposed method relies solely on inverters' measurements without requiring full state information of the power grid, rendering it more practical for real-world deployment. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the RRL framework in achieving rapid convergence, minimizing active power curtailment, and ensuring reliable voltage regulation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Power System Stabilizers with Increased Inverter-Based Generation: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As power systems evolve with increasing production from Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), their underlying dynamics are undergoing significant changes that can jeopardize system operation, leading to poorly damped oscillations or small-signal rotor angle instability. In this work, we investigate whether Power System Stabilizer (PSS) setting adjustments can effectively restore system stability and provide adequate damping in systems with increased IBR penetration, using the benchmark Kundur Two-Area System as a case study. Specifically, we evaluate the model-based Residues and P-Vref PSS tuning methods to examine their effectiveness under evolving grid conditions. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of these tuning methods is not guaranteed, particularly when coordination is limited. Consequently, our case study motivates local and adaptive online PSS tuning methods.</description>

      <title>Beam Squint Mitigation in Wideband Hybrid Beamformers: Full-TTD, Sparse-TTD, or Non-TTD?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam squint poses a fundamental challenge in wideband hybrid beamforming, particularly for mmWave and THz systems that demand both ultra-wide bandwidth and high directional beams. While conventional phase shifter-based beamformers may offer partial mitigation, True Time Delay (TTD) units provide a fundamentally more effective solution by enabling frequency-independent beam steering. However, the high cost of TTD units has recently driven much interest in Sparse-TTD architectures, which combine a limited number of TTDs with a higher number of conventional phase shifters to balance performance and cost. This paper provides a critical examination of beam squint mitigation strategies in wideband hybrid beamformers, comparing Full-TTD, Sparse-TTD, and Non-TTD architectures. We analyze recent Non-TTD approaches, specifically the scheme leveraging the wideband beam gain (WBBG) concept, evaluating their performance and cost characteristics against TTD-based solutions. A key focus is placed on the practical limitations of Sparse-TTD architectures, particularly the often-overlooked requirement for wideband phase shifters operating alongside TTDs, which can significantly impact performance and implementation cost in real-world scenarios, especially for ultra-wideband applications. Finally, we conduct a cost-performance analysis to examine the trade-offs inherent in each architecture and provide guidance on selecting the most suitable hybrid beamforming structure for various fractional bandwidth regimes.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Fault Ride-Through Grid Forming with Transient Synchronisation Stability and Current Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During grid faults, grid-forming converters are typically suggested to switch from a voltage-source to a current-source mode to limit the current and protect the electronics. This transition has the potential for the converter to transiently lose synchronization due to such current saturation. Therefore, this paper proposes an alternative current saturation algorithm to improve transient synchronization stability during mode switching. The algorithm is designed for grid-forming converters to meet low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) requirements and grid-fault standards in addition to transient synchronization stability. Moreover, it limits the converter output current during grid faults with a new control parameter. The presented method introduces converter output virtual fluxes to calculate the current references in the d- and q-axes for the current saturation algorithm to enhance LVRT performance and grid stability. The method exploits the correlation between the converter's virtual fluxes and currents to modify the current saturation levels through real-time converter virtual flux estimation. The adaptive saturation levels ensure precise control and high dynamics during grid faults and facilitate optimal power injection or absorption to support the grid. The proposed current-saturation algorithm is analytically evaluated. Further, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Time-Constrained Interception of Seeker-Equipped Interceptors with Bounded Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear guidance scheme designed to achieve precise interception of stationary targets at a pre-specified impact time. The proposed strategy essentially accounts for the constraints imposed by the interceptor's seeker field-of-view (FOV) and actuator limitations, which, if ignored, can degrade guidance performance. To address these challenges, the guidance law incorporates known actuator bounds directly into its design, thereby improving overall interceptor effectiveness. The proposed method utilizes an input-affine magnitude saturation model to effectively enforce these constraints. By appending this input saturation model to the interceptor's kinematic equations, a guidance law is derived that ensures interception at the desired impact time while accounting for the physical constraints of the sensor and actuator. The efficacy of the proposed strategies is demonstrated through comprehensive numerical simulations across various scenarios and is compared against an existing guidance strategy.</description>

      <title>Finite-Horizon Strategy in Infinite-Horizon Linear-Quadratic Discrete-Time Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a finite-horizon strategy, ``watching $T$ steps into the future and moving one step now,'' in an $N$-person infinite-horizon discrete-time linear-quadratic dynamic game. The game involves linear input/output/state dynamics and quadratic cost functions with heterogeneous discount factors. For the finite-horizon version, which forms the basis of the infinite-horizon game, we analyze the structure of the coupled generalized discrete Riccati difference equations related to the feedback Nash equilibrium (FNE) and derive a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the finite-horizon FNE. Under this condition, the FNE can be efficiently computed via the proposed algorithm. In the infinite-horizon game, assume all players adopt this finite-horizon strategy. If the iterations of the coupled equations related to the FNE converge, and the invertibility and stability conditions hold, we prove the convergence of each player's total cost under the finite-horizon strategy, even when players use individual prediction horizons. Furthermore, we provide an explicit upper bound on the cost difference between the finite-horizon strategy and the infinite-horizon FNE associated with the limiting matrices, expressed via the distance between their feedback strategy matrices. This bound vanishes as $T$ tends to infinity, implying convergence to the infinite-horizon FNE cost. A non-scalar numerical example illustrates the convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Implementation and Analysis of Different Geomagnetic Field Models for Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) of a Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Attitude Determination and Control System is essential for orientation stability and performance of slew maneuvers on the satellite. This research focuses on comparing two different geomagnetic field models, Direct Dipole Model and International Geomagnetic Reference Field Model, for modeling of magnetometer and magnetorquers. Both these magnetic field models are compared and analyzed for two satellite attitude cases: orientation stability and unloading of reaction wheels. Magnetometer modeling is utilized to get sensor data for attitude determination and control to attain orientation stability. Whereas, the magnetorquer model aids in reaction wheel unloading, by performing the required actuation on the satellite, upon interaction with the Earth's magnetic field. The study offers a comprehensive lookout on the impact of geomagnetic field models on the overall ADCS performance, incorporating both attitude estimation and control via the sensor and actuator modeling. Apart from this, valuable insights are gained into selecting optimal models based on specific mission requirements and available computational resources. Finally, this comparison and analysis results in unique findings for an actual future satellite mission, that is to be launched soon.</description>

      <title>Resilience assessment framework for cyber-physical distribution power system based on coordinated cyber-physical attacks under dynamic game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the advanced communication networks and intelligent electronic devices, the cyber-physical distribution systems (CPDSs) possess the capability to perform flexible economic dispatch and achieve rapid self-healing from extreme events. Meanwhile, the deep integration of cyber and physical systems makes CPDS vulnerable to coordinated cyber-physical attacks. In this paper, a resilience assessment framework for the CPDS under coordinated cyber-physical attacks is proposed to investigate the impact of the coordinated attacks on load loss and service restoration in CPDS. First, a three-stage defender-attacker-defender dynamic game model considering fake base station (FBS) and physical attacks for CPDS is established, aiming at seeking the optimal defense resource deployment strategy to enhance the resilience of the CPDS. The physical attack is launched to cause faults on the power lines, and the FBS attack is employed to interrupt the service of wireless cellular network to hinder the self-healing process of the CPDS. The lognormal shadowing model and search theory are applied to quantitatively describe the process of the coordinated cyber-physical attacks. Further, the constructed three-stage dynamic game model is equivalently recast as a tri-level max-min-max optimization model, which is solved using column-and-constraint generation combined with enumeration method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed resilience assessment framework and solution strategy is demonstrated by conducting simulation analysis on the modified IEEE 33-node CPDS and a real-world 47-node CPDS in China.</description>

      <title>Learning to Solve Parametric Mixed-Integer Optimal Control Problems via Differentiable Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to solving input- and state-constrained parametric mixed-integer optimal control problems using Differentiable Predictive Control (DPC). Our approach follows the differentiable programming paradigm by learning an explicit neural policy that maps control parameters to integer- and continuous-valued decision variables. This policy is optimized via stochastic gradient descent by differentiating the quadratic model predictive control objective through the closed-loop finite-horizon response of the system dynamics. To handle integrality constraints, we incorporate three differentiable rounding strategies. The approach is evaluated on a conceptual thermal energy system, comparing its performance with the optimal solution for different lengths of the prediction horizon. The simulation results indicate that our self-supervised learning approach can achieve near-optimal control performance while significantly reducing inference time by avoiding online optimization, thus implying its potential for embedded deployment even on edge devices.</description>

      <title>Decision-Focused Learning for Neural Network-Constrained Optimization: Application to HVAC Management System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is a major electricity end-use with a substantial potential for grid services such as demand response. Harnessing this flexibility requires accurate modeling of the thermal dynamics of buildings, which is challenging due to their nonlinear and repetitive behavior (e.g., daily pattern), which reduce the value of historical data. To address this issue, this paper presents an HVAC management system formulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP), where Neural Network (NN) models of thermal dynamics are embedded as exact mixed-integer linear constraints. We employ Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) which tunes the NN parameters to improve the HVAC performance rather than prediction metrics. However, the discrete nature of the MIQP poses challenges for this approach, as it leads to gradients that are undefined or discontinuous, thus impeding standard gradient-based training. Here, we employ Stochastic Smoothing (SS), which enables efficient gradient computation without the need to differentiate through the MIQP. Experiments on a realistic five-zone building using a high-fidelity building simulator demonstrate that the proposed SS-DFL approach outperforms conventional two-stage and relaxed DFL methods in both cost savings and grid service performance, highlighting its potential for scalable, grid-interactive building control.</description>

      <title>MDR-DeePC: Model-Inspired Distributionally Robust Data-Enabled Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Model-Inspired Distributionally Robust Data-enabled Predictive Control (MDR-DeePC) framework for systems with partially known and uncertain dynamics. The proposed method integrates model-based equality constraints for known dynamics with a Hankel matrix-based representation of unknown dynamics. A distributionally robust optimization problem is formulated to account for parametric uncertainty and stochastic disturbances. Simulation results on a triple-mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved disturbance rejection, reduced output oscillations, and lower control cost compared to standard DeePC. The results validate the robustness and effectiveness of MDR-DeePC, with potential for real-time implementation pending further benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Observability and Performance Tradeoffs in Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a feedback controller that minimizes the observability of a set of adversarial sensors of a linear system, while adhering to strict closed-loop performance constraints. We quantify the effectiveness of adversarial sensors using the trace of their observability Gramian and its inverse, capturing both average observability and the least observable state directions of the system. We derive theoretical lower bounds on these metrics under performance constraints, characterizing the fundamental limits of observability reduction as a function of the performance tradeoff. Finally, we show that the performance-constrained optimization of the Gramian's trace can be formulated as a one-shot semidefinite program, while we address the optimization of its inverse through sequential semidefinite programming. Simulations on an aircraft show how the proposed scheme yields controllers that deteriorate adversarial observability while having near-optimal closed-loop performance.</description>

      <title>Bird's-eye view safety monitoring for the construction top under the tower crane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tower crane is involving more automated and intelligent operation procedure, and importantly, the application of automation technologies to the safety issues is imperative ahead of the utilization of any other advances. Among diverse risk management tasks on site, it is essential to protect the human workers on the workspace between the tower crane and constructed building top area (construction top) from the bird's-eye view, especially with Modular Integrated Construction (MiC) lifted. Also, the camera and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) can capture abundant 3D information on site, which is however yet made the best use. Considering the safety protection for humans and tower cranes, we present an AI-based fully automated safety monitoring system for tower crane lifting from the bird's-eye view, surveilling to shield the human workers on the construction top and avoid cranes' collision by alarming the crane operator. The system achieved a 3D data fusion for localization of humans and MiCs by integrating the captured information from camera and LiDAR. The state-of-the-art methods were explored and implemented into our proposed software pipeline coupled with the hardware and display systems. Furthermore, we conducted an analysis of the components in the pipeline to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the involved methods. The display and visualization on the real site proved that our system can serve as a valuable safety monitoring toolkit on site.</description>

      <title>Online Learning for Dynamic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves Mechanism in Sequential Auctions under Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon average-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and reward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller determines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition kernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate the problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the environment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper considers a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market continues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient, truthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves these desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an online reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying MDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG mechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges to a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.</description>

      <title>Model Reduction of Homogeneous Polynomial Dynamical Systems via Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model reduction plays a critical role in system control, with established methods such as balanced truncation widely used for linear systems. However, extending these methods to nonlinear settings, particularly polynomial dynamical systems that are often used to model higher-order interactions in physics, biology, and ecology, remains a significant challenge. In this article, we develop a novel model reduction method for homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDSs) with linear input and output grounded in tensor decomposition. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of HPDSs, we construct reduced models by extracting dominant mode subspaces via higher-order singular value decomposition. Notably, we establish that key system-theoretic properties, including stability, controllability, and observability, are preserved in the reduced model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Ontology Neural Network and ORTSF: A Framework for Topological Reasoning and Delay-Robust Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of autonomous robotic systems has led to impressive capabilities in perception, localization, mapping, and control. Yet, a fundamental gap remains: existing frameworks excel at geometric reasoning and dynamic stability but fall short in representing and preserving relational semantics, contextual reasoning, and cognitive transparency essential for collaboration in dynamic, human-centric environments. This paper introduces a unified architecture comprising the Ontology Neural Network (ONN) and the Ontological Real-Time Semantic Fabric (ORTSF) to address this gap. The ONN formalizes relational semantic reasoning as a dynamic topological process. By embedding Forman-Ricci curvature, persistent homology, and semantic tensor structures within a unified loss formulation, ONN ensures that relational integrity and topological coherence are preserved as scenes evolve over time. The ORTSF transforms reasoning traces into actionable control commands while compensating for system delays. It integrates predictive and delay-aware operators that ensure phase margin preservation and continuity of control signals, even under significant latency conditions. Empirical studies demonstrate the ONN + ORTSF framework's ability to unify semantic cognition and robust control, providing a mathematically principled and practically viable solution for cognitive robotics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inertial parameter identification of industrial robots is an established process, but standard methods using Least Squares or Machine Learning do not consider prior information about the robot and require extensive measurements. Inspired by Bayesian statistics, this paper presents an identification method with improved generalization that incorporates prior knowledge and is able to learn with only a few or without additional measurements (Zero-Shot Learning). Furthermore, our method is able to correctly learn not only the inertial but also the mechanical and base parameters of the MABI Max 100 robot while ensuring physical feasibility and specifying the confidence intervals of the results. We also provide different types of priors for serial robots with 6 degrees of freedom, where datasheets or CAD models are not available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of mutual coupling on MIMO systems with densely deployed antennas. Leveraging multiport communication theory, we analyze both coherent and noncoherent detection approaches in a single-user uplink scenario where the receiver ignores mutual coupling effects. Simulation results indicate that while coherent detection is generally more accurate, it is highly sensitive to mismatches in the coupling model, leading to severe performance degradation when antennas are closely spaced, to the point of becoming unusable. Noncoherent detection, on the other hand, exhibits a higher error probability but is more robust to coupling model mismatches.</description>

Abstract: By the year 2023, the global population of individuals with impaired vision has surpassed 220 million. People with impaired vision will find it difficult while finding path or avoiding obstacles, and must ask for auxiliary tools for help. Although traditional aids such as guide canes and guide dogs exist, they still have some shortcomings. In this paper, we present our wearable blind guiding device, what perform navigation guidance through our proposed Gait-based Guiding System. Our device innovatively integrates gait phase analysis for walking guide, and in terms of environmental perception, we use multimodal sensing to acquire diverse environment information. During the experiment, we conducted both indoor and outdoor experiments, and compared with the standard guide cane. The result shows superior performance of our device in blind guidance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As labor shortages and productivity stagnation increasingly challenge the construction industry, automation has become essential for sustainable infrastructure development. This paper presents an autonomous payload transportation system as an initial step toward fully unmanned construction sites. Our system, based on the CD110R-3 crawler carrier, integrates autonomous navigation, fleet management, and GNSS-based localization to facilitate material transport in construction site environments. While the current system does not yet incorporate dynamic environment adaptation algorithms, we have begun fundamental investigations into external-sensor based perception and mapping system. Preliminary results highlight the potential challenges, including navigation in evolving terrain, environmental perception under construction-specific conditions, and sensor placement optimization for improving autonomy and efficiency. Looking forward, we envision a construction ecosystem where collaborative autonomous agents dynamically adapt to site conditions, optimizing workflow and reducing human intervention. This paper provides foundational insights into the future of robotics-driven construction automation and identifies critical areas for further technological development.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modelling and safety assurance of an agriculture robot providing light-treatment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continued adoption of agricultural robots postulates the farmer's trust in the reliability, robustness and safety of the new technology. This motivates our work on safety assurance of agricultural robots, particularly their ability to detect, track and avoid obstacles and humans. This paper considers a probabilistic modelling and risk analysis framework for use in the early development phases. Starting off with hazard identification and a risk assessment matrix, the behaviour of the mobile robot platform, sensor and perception system, and any humans present are captured using three state machines. An auto-generated probabilistic model is then solved and analysed using the probabilistic model checker PRISM. The result provides unique insight into fundamental development and engineering aspects by quantifying the effect of the risk mitigation actions and risk reduction associated with distinct design concepts. These include implications of adopting a higher performance and more expensive Object Detection System or opting for a more elaborate warning system to increase human awareness. Although this paper mainly focuses on the initial concept-development phase, the proposed safety assurance framework can also be used during implementation, and subsequent deployment and operation phases.</description>

      <title>A Verification Methodology for Safety Assurance of Robotic Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots deployed in shared human environments, such as agricultural settings, require rigorous safety assurance to meet both functional reliability and regulatory compliance. These systems must operate in dynamic, unstructured environments, interact safely with humans, and respond effectively to a wide range of potential hazards. This paper presents a verification workflow for the safety assurance of an autonomous agricultural robot, covering the entire development life-cycle, from concept study and design to runtime verification. The outlined methodology begins with a systematic hazard analysis and risk assessment to identify potential risks and derive corresponding safety requirements. A formal model of the safety controller is then developed to capture its behaviour and verify that the controller satisfies the specified safety properties with respect to these requirements. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a field robot operating in an agricultural setting. The results show that the methodology can be effectively used to verify safety-critical properties and facilitate the early identification of design issues, contributing to the development of safer robots and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Estimating Spatially-Dependent GPS Errors Using a Swarm of Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External factors, including urban canyons and adversarial interference, can lead to Global Positioning System (GPS) inaccuracies that vary as a function of the position in the environment. This study addresses the challenge of estimating a static, spatially-varying error function using a team of robots. We introduce a State Bias Estimation Algorithm (SBE) whose purpose is to estimate the GPS biases. The central idea is to use sensed estimates of the range and bearing to the other robots in the team to estimate changes in bias across the environment. A set of drones moves in a 2D environment, each sampling data from GPS, range, and bearing sensors. The biases calculated by the SBE at estimated positions are used to train a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model. We use a Sparse Gaussian process-based Informative Path Planning (IPP) algorithm that identifies high-value regions of the environment for data collection. The swarm plans paths that maximize information gain in each iteration, further refining their understanding of the environment's positional bias landscape. We evaluated SBE and IPP in simulation and compared the IPP methodology to an open-loop strategy.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic free energy map for the non-oxidative glycolysis pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing reaction pathways that maximize the production of a target compound in a given metabolic network is a fundamental problem in systems biology. In this study, we systematically explore the non-oxidative glycolysis metabolic network, guided by the principle that reactions with negative Gibbs free energy differences are thermodynamically favored. We enumerate alternative pathways that implement the net non-oxidative glycolysis reaction, categorized by their length. Our analysis reveals several alternative thermodynamically favorable pathways beyond those reported in experiments. In addition, we identify molecules within the network, such as 3-hydroxypropionic acid, that may have significant potential for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Sampling-based Stochastic Data-driven Predictive Control under Data Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a stochastic constrained output-feedback data-driven predictive control scheme for linear time-invariant systems subject to bounded additive disturbances. The approach uses data-driven predictors based on an extension of Willems' fundamental lemma and requires only a single persistently exciting input-output data trajectory. Compared to current state-of-the-art approaches, we do not rely on availability of exact disturbance data. Instead, we leverage a novel parameterization of the unknown disturbance data considering consistency with the measured data and the system class. This allows for deterministic approximation of the chance constraints in a sampling-based fashion. A robust constraint on the first predicted step enables recursive feasibility, closed-loop constraint satisfaction, and robust asymptotic stability in expectation under standard assumptions. A numerical example demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed control scheme.</description>

      <title>Stochastic MPC for Finite Gaussian Mixture Disturbances with Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) algorithm for linear systems subject to additive Gaussian mixture disturbances, with the goal of satisfying chance constraints. We focus on a special case where each Gaussian mixture component has a similar variance. To solve the SMPC problem, we formulate a branch model predictive control (BMPC) problem on simplified dynamics and leverage stochastic simulation relations (SSR). Our contribution is an extension of the SMPC literature to accommodate Gaussian mixture disturbances while retaining recursive feasibility and closed-loop guarantees. We illustrate the retention of guarantees with a case study of vehicle control on an ill-maintained road.</description>

      <title>Smart Sensing Breaks the Accuracy Barrier in Battery State Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate state-of-charge (SOC) estimation is essential for optimizing battery performance, ensuring safety, and maximizing economic value. Conventional current and voltage measurements, however, have inherent limitations in fully inferring the multiphysics-resolved dynamics inside battery cells. This creates an accuracy barrier that constrains battery usage and reduces cost-competitiveness and sustainability across industries dependent on battery technology. In this work, we introduce an integrated sensor framework that combines novel mechanical, thermal, gas, optical, and electrical sensors with traditional measurements to break through this barrier. We generate three unique datasets with eleven measurement types and propose an explainable machine-learning approach for SOC estimation. This approach renders the measured signals and the predictive result of machine learning physically interpretable with respect to battery SOC, offering fundamental insights into the time-varying importance of different signals. Our experimental results reveal a marked increase in SOC estimation accuracy--enhanced from 46.1% to 74.5%--compared to conventional methods. This approach not only advances SOC monitoring precision but also establishes a foundation for monitoring additional battery states to further improve safety, extend lifespan, and facilitate fast charging.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning for efficient and robust multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking in bioprocesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and robust bioprocess control is essential for maximizing performance and adaptability in advanced biotechnological systems. In this work, we present a reinforcement-learning framework for multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking. Tracking multiple setpoints and time-varying trajectories in reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complexity of balancing multiple objectives, a difficulty further exacerbated by system uncertainties such as uncertain initial conditions and stochastic dynamics. This challenge is relevant, e.g., in bioprocesses involving microbial consortia, where precise control over population compositions is required. We introduce a novel return function based on multiplicative reciprocal saturation functions, which explicitly couples reward gains to the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple references. Through a case study involving light-mediated cybergenetic growth control in microbial consortia, we demonstrate via computational experiments that our approach achieves faster convergence, improved stability, and superior control compliance compared to conventional quadratic-cost-based return functions. Moreover, our method enables tuning of the saturation function's parameters, shaping the learning process and policy updates. By incorporating system uncertainties, our framework also demonstrates robustness, a key requirement in industrial bioprocessing. Overall, this work advances reinforcement-learning-based control strategies in bioprocess engineering, with implications in the broader field of process and systems engineering.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control of Dubins Vehicle in the Presence of Loss of Effectiveness (Extended Version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of a Dubins Vehicle when subjected to a loss of control effectiveness in the turning rate is considered. A complex state-space representation is used to model the vehicle dynamics. An adaptive control design is proposed, with the underlying stability analysis guaranteeing closed-loop boundedness and tracking of a desired path. It is shown that a path constructed by waypoints and a minimum turn radius can be specified using a reference model which can be followed by the closed loop system. The control design utilizes the complex state-space representation as well as a PID controller for the nominal closed-loop. How the design can be modified to ensure path following even in the presence input constraints is also discussed. Simulation studies are carried out to complement the theoretical derivations.</description>

      <title>PGLib-CO2: A Power Grid Library for Computing and Optimizing Carbon Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sustainable electricity infrastructure requires the explicit integration of carbon emissions into power system modeling and optimization paradigms. However, existing open-source datasets for power system R&amp;D lack generator-level carbon emission profiling, limiting the ability to benchmark and compare various carbon-aware grid operational strategies. To address this gap, this work introduces PGLib-CO2, an open-source extension to the widely adopted PGLib-OPF test case library. PGLib-CO2 enriches standard network cases with CO2 and CO2-equivalent emission intensity factors by expanding the fuel-type categorization used by PGLib-OPF, attaining a realistic generator-level carbon profiling. It is also packaged for both Python's pandapower and Julia's PowerModels.jl, for a seamless, user-friendly integration of emission modeling into grid computation and optimization tasks. The dataset produced by PGLib-CO2 can support grid-based carbon accounting, emission metric evaluation, and integration into AC optimal power flow (OPF) and optimal load shifting (OLS) formulations. We demonstrate PGLib-CO2's utility through case studies that quantify cost-emission trade-offs and optimize a carbon-aware objective function. By standardizing carbon-enhanced test cases, PGLib-CO2 provides an open-source, reproducible foundation for benchmarking carbon-aware computation, facilitating future research in sustainable power system operation.</description>

      <title>PID Tuning via Desired Step Response Curve Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a PID tuning method based on step response curve fitting (PID-SRCF) that utilizes L2-norm minimization for precise reference tracking and explicit transient response shaping. The algorithm optimizes controller parameters by minimizing the root-mean-square error between desired and actual step responses. The proposed approach determines optimal PID parameters by matching any closed-loop response to a desired system step response. Practically a first-order plus time delay model or a second-order system with defined settling time and overshoot requirements are preferred. The method has open-source implementation using constrained nonlinear optimization in MATLAB. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that PID-SRCF can replace known analytical methods like Ziegler Nichols, Lambda Tuning, Pole Placement, Dominant Pole and MATLAB proprietary PID tuning applications.</description>

      <title>Linear and Nonlinear Ultra-Short Pulse Looped Antennas: Radiation and Parametric Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern optical systems send and receive ultra-short temporal pulses (USP). While ultra-broad band antennas do exist in the microwave region (e.g., log-periodic antennas), their short temporal response is typically limited by the antenna's large dispersion, hence, resulting in a substantial pulse broadening. The issue becomes more severe when one considers both the transmitted and received pulses. Through simulations and experiments one can show that properly designed loop antennas, either thick loops or 3-loop antennas, exhibit USP attributes, 280 ps upon transmission and 380 ps upon reception (or, an overall equivalent coherent channel exceeding 2.5 GHz). Finally, most parametric amplifiers are narrow band and one may ask if a broadband amplification is possible. A loop inside a loop system, coupled by a nonlinear impedance element exhibits a line narrowing and signal amplification with large bandwidth, which is inversely scalable with the loops' diameter. In all, these elements could be advantageous for applications such as ultra-wide bandwidth communication and non-linear quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication in Multi-team Dynamic Games: A Mean Field Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordinating communication and control is a key component in the stability and performance of networked multi-agent systems. While single user networked control systems have gained a lot of attention within this domain, in this work, we address the more challenging problem of large population multi-team dynamic games. In particular, each team constitutes two decision makers (namely, the sensor and the controller) who coordinate over a shared network to control a dynamically evolving state of interest under costs on both actuation and sensing/communication. Due to the shared nature of the wireless channel, the overall cost of each team depends on other teams' policies, thereby leading to a noncooperative game setup. Due to the presence of a large number of teams, we compute approximate decentralized Nash equilibrium policies for each team using the paradigm of (extended) mean-field games, which is governed by (1) the mean traffic flowing over the channel, and (2) the value of information at the sensor, which highlights the semantic nature of the ensuing communication. In the process, we compute optimal controller policies and approximately optimal sensor policies for each representative team of the mean-field system to alleviate the problem of general non-contractivity of the mean-field fixed point operator associated with the finite cardinality of the sensor action space. Consequently, we also prove the $\epsilon$--Nash property of the mean-field equilibrium solution which essentially characterizes how well the solution derived using mean-field analysis performs on the finite-team system. Finally, we provide extensive numerical simulations, which corroborate the theoretical findings and lead to additional insights on the properties of the results presented.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Kinematic Trajectory Control and Planning of Tracked Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tracked vehicles distribute their weight continuously over a large surface area (the tracks). This distinctive feature makes them the preferred choice for vehicles required to traverse soft and uneven terrain. From a robotics perspective, however, this flexibility comes at a cost: the complexity of modelling the system and the resulting difficulty in designing theoretically sound navigation solutions. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for the navigation of tracked vehicles, built upon three key pillars. The first pillar comprises two models: a simulation model and a control-oriented model. The simulation model captures the intricate terramechanics dynamics arising from soil-track interaction and is employed to develop faithful digital twins of the system across a wide range of operating conditions. The control-oriented model is pseudo-kinematic and mathematically tractable, enabling the design of efficient and theoretically robust control schemes. The second pillar is a Lyapunov-based feedback trajectory controller that provides certifiable tracking guarantees. The third pillar is a portfolio of motion planning solutions, each offering different complexity-accuracy trade-offs. The various components of the proposed approach are validated through an extensive set of simulation and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Fully distributed and resilient source seeking for robot swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a self-contained, resilient and fully distributed solution for locating the maximum of an unknown scalar field using a swarm of robots that travel at a constant speed. Unlike conventional reactive methods relying on gradient information, our methodology enables the swarm to determine an ascending direction so that it approaches the source with an arbitrary precision. Our source-seeking solution consists of three distributed algorithms running simultaneously in a slow-fast closed-loop system. The fastest algorithm provides the centroid-relative coordinates of the robots and the next slower one provides the ascending direction to be tracked. The tracking of the ascending direction by single integrators is instantaneous; howeverin this paper we will also focus on 2D unicycle-like robots with a constant speed. The third algorithm, the slowest one since the speed of the robots can be chosen arbitrarily slow, is the individual control law for the unicycle to track the estimated ascending direction.We will show that the three distributed algorithms converge exponentially fast to their objectives, allowing for a feasible slow-fast closed-loop system. The robots are not constrained to any particular geometric formation, and we study both discrete and continuous distributions of robots.The swarm shape analysis reveals the resiliency of our approach as expected in robot swarms, i.e., by amassing robots we ensure the source-seeking functionality in the event of missing or misplaced individuals or even if the robot network splits in two or more disconnected subnetworks.We exploit such an analysis so that the swarm can adapt to unknown environments by morphing its shape and maneuvering while still following an ascending direction. We analyze our solution with robots as kinematic points in n-dimensional Euclidean spaces and extend the analysis to 2D unicycle-like robots with constant speeds.</description>

Abstract: We propose an online motion planner for legged robot locomotion with the primary objective of achieving energy efficiency. The conceptual idea is to leverage a placement set of footstep positions based on the robot's body position to determine when and how to execute steps. In particular, the proposed planner uses virtual placement sets beneath the hip joints of the legs and executes a step when the foot is outside of such placement set. Furthermore, we propose a parameter design framework that considers both energy-efficiency and robustness measures to optimize the gait by changing the shape of the placement set along with other parameters, such as step height and swing time, as a function of walking speed. We show that the planner produces trajectories that have a low Cost of Transport (CoT) and high robustness measure, and evaluate our approach against model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) and motion imitation using biological dog motion priors as the reference. Overall, within low to medium velocity range, we show a 50.4% improvement in CoT and improved robustness over model-free RL, our best performing baseline. Finally, we show ability to handle slippery surfaces, gait transitions, and disturbances in simulation and hardware with the Unitree A1 robot.</description>
