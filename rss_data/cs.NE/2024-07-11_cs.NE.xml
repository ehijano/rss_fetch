      <title>Towards Explainable Evolution Strategies with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach that integrates self-adaptive Evolution Strategies (ES) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the explainability of complex optimization processes. By employing a self-adaptive ES equipped with a restart mechanism, we effectively navigate the challenging landscapes of benchmark functions, capturing detailed logs of the optimization journey, including fitness evolution, step-size adjustments, and restart events due to stagnation. An LLM is then utilized to process these logs, generating concise, user-friendly summaries that highlight key aspects such as convergence behavior, optimal fitness achievements, and encounters with local optima. Our case study on the Rastrigin function demonstrates how our approach makes the complexities of ES optimization transparent and accessible. Our findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to bridge the gap between advanced optimization algorithms and their interpretability.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Runtime of the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA) on the Concatenated Trap Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA) is a state of the art evolutionary algorithm that leverages linkage learning to efficiently exploit problem structure. By identifying and preserving important building blocks during variation, GOMEA has shown promising performance on various optimization problems. In this paper, we provide the first runtime analysis of GOMEA on the concatenated trap function, a challenging benchmark problem that consists of multiple deceptive subfunctions. We derived an upper bound on the expected runtime of GOMEA with a truthful linkage model, showing that it can solve the problem in $O(m^{3}2^k)$ with high probability, where $m$ is the number of subfunctions and $k$ is the subfunction length. This is a significant speedup compared to the (1+1) EA, which requires $O(ln{(m)}(mk)^{k})$ expected evaluations.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Deployment of Hybrid SNNs on Neuromorphic and Edge AI Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the synergistic potential of neuromorphic and edge computing to create a versatile machine learning (ML) system tailored for processing data captured by dynamic vision sensors. We construct and train hybrid models, blending spiking neural networks (SNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) using PyTorch and Lava frameworks. Our hybrid architecture integrates an SNN for temporal feature extraction and an ANN for classification. We delve into the challenges of deploying such hybrid structures on hardware. Specifically, we deploy individual components on Intel's Neuromorphic Processor Loihi (for SNN) and Jetson Nano (for ANN). We also propose an accumulator circuit to transfer data from the spiking to the non-spiking domain. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive performance analyses of hybrid SNN-ANN models on a heterogeneous system of neuromorphic and edge AI hardware, evaluating accuracy, latency, power, and energy consumption. Our findings demonstrate that the hybrid spiking networks surpass the baseline ANN model across all metrics and outperform the baseline SNN model in accuracy and latency.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Deep Neural Networks in Deployment (A Comparative and Replicability Study)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly used in safety-critical applications, there is a growing concern for their reliability. Even highly trained, high-performant networks are not 100% accurate. However, it is very difficult to predict their behavior during deployment without ground truth. In this paper, we provide a comparative and replicability study on recent approaches that have been proposed to evaluate the reliability of DNNs in deployment. We find that it is hard to run and reproduce the results for these approaches on their replication packages and even more difficult to run them on artifacts other than their own. Further, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of the approaches, due to the lack of clearly defined evaluation metrics. Our results indicate that more effort is needed in our research community to obtain sound techniques for evaluating the reliability of neural networks in safety-critical domains. To this end, we contribute an evaluation framework that incorporates the considered approaches and enables evaluation on common benchmarks, using common metrics.</description>

      <title>A New Self-organizing Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network for Multi-Step Time Series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new self-organizing interval type-2 fuzzy neural network with multiple outputs (SOIT2FNN-MO) for multi-step time series prediction. Differing from the traditional six-layer IT2FNN, a nine-layer network is developed to improve prediction accuracy, uncertainty handling and model interpretability. First, a new co-antecedent layer and a modified consequent layer are devised to improve the interpretability of the fuzzy model for multi-step predictions. Second, a new transformation layer is designed to address the potential issues in the vanished rule firing strength caused by highdimensional inputs. Third, a new link layer is proposed to build temporal connections between multi-step predictions. Furthermore, a two-stage self-organizing mechanism is developed to automatically generate the fuzzy rules, in which the first stage is used to create the rule base from empty and perform the initial optimization, while the second stage is to fine-tune all network parameters. Finally, various simulations are carried out on chaotic and microgrid time series prediction problems, demonstrating the superiority of our approach in terms of prediction accuracy, uncertainty handling and model interpretability.</description>

      <title>STAL: Spike Threshold Adaptive Learning Encoder for Classification of Pain-Related Biosignal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first application of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for the classification of chronic lower back pain (CLBP) using the EmoPain dataset. Our work has two main contributions. We introduce Spike Threshold Adaptive Learning (STAL), a trainable encoder that effectively converts continuous biosignals into spike trains. Additionally, we propose an ensemble of Spiking Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN) classifiers for the multi-stream processing of sEMG and IMU data. To tackle the challenges of small sample size and class imbalance, we implement minority over-sampling with weighted sample replacement during batch creation. Our method achieves outstanding performance with an accuracy of 80.43%, AUC of 67.90%, F1 score of 52.60%, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.437, surpassing traditional rate-based and latency-based encoding methods. The STAL encoder shows superior performance in preserving temporal dynamics and adapting to signal characteristics. Importantly, our approach (STAL-SRNN) outperforms the best deep learning method in terms of MCC, indicating better balanced class prediction. This research contributes to the development of neuromorphic computing for biosignal analysis. It holds promise for energy-efficient, wearable solutions in chronic pain management.</description>

      <title>How more data can hurt: Instability and regularization in next-generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been found recently that more data can, counter-intuitively, hurt the performance of deep neural networks. Here, we show that a more extreme version of the phenomenon occurs in data-driven models of dynamical systems. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we focus on next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC) -- a popular framework for learning dynamics from data. We find that, despite learning a better representation of the flow map with more training data, NGRC can adopt an ill-conditioned ``integrator'' and lose stability. We link this data-induced instability to the auxiliary dimensions created by the delayed states in NGRC. Based on these findings, we propose simple strategies to mitigate the instability, either by increasing regularization strength in tandem with data size, or by carefully introducing noise during training. Our results highlight the importance of proper regularization in data-driven modeling of dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm combined with Novelty Search. Novelty Search finds novel place to search in the search domain and then Particle Swarm Optimization rigorously searches that area for global optimum solution. This method is never blocked in local optima because it is controlled by Novelty Search which is objective free. For those functions where there are many more local optima and second global optimum is far from true optimum, the present method works successfully. The present algorithm never stops until it searches entire search area. A series of experimental trials prove the robustness and effectiveness of the present algorithm on complex optimization test functions.</description>

      <title>Direct Training High-Performance Deep Spiking Neural Networks: A Review of Theories and Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising energy-efficient alternative to artificial neural networks (ANNs), in virtue of their high biological plausibility, rich spatial-temporal dynamics, and event-driven computation. The direct training algorithms based on the surrogate gradient method provide sufficient flexibility to design novel SNN architectures and explore the spatial-temporal dynamics of SNNs. According to previous studies, the performance of models is highly dependent on their sizes. Recently, direct training deep SNNs have achieved great progress on both neuromorphic datasets and large-scale static datasets. Notably, transformer-based SNNs show comparable performance with their ANN counterparts. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to summarize the theories and methods for training deep SNNs with high performance in a systematic and comprehensive way, including theory fundamentals, spiking neuron models, advanced SNN models and residual architectures, software frameworks and neuromorphic hardware, applications, and future trends.

      <title>An Attempt to Devise a Pairwise Ising-Type Maximum Entropy Model Integrated Cost Function for Optimizing SNN Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment process of a spiking neural network (SNN) often involves partitioning the neural network and mapping these partitions onto processing units within the neuromorphic hardware. Finding optimal deployment schemes is an NP-hard problem. Optimizing these schemes presents challenges, particular in devising computationally effective cost functions optimization objectives such as communication time consumption and energy efficiency. These objectives require consideration of network dynamics shaped by neuron activity patterns, demanding intricate mathematical analyses or simulations for integrating them into a cost model for SNN development.
  Our approach focuses on network dynamics, which are hardware-independent and can be modeled separately from specific hardware configurations. We employ a pairwise Ising-type maximum entropy model, which is a model show effective in accurately capturing pairwise correlations among system components in a collaborative system. On top of this model, we incorporates hardware and network structure-specific factors to devise a cost function.
  We conducted an extremely preliminary investigation using the SpiNNaker machine. We show that the ising model training can also be computationally complex. Currently, we lack sufficient evidence to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Further efforts is needed to explore integrating network dynamics into SNN deployment.</description>

      <title>Provably Good Solutions to the Knapsack Problem via Neural Networks of Bounded Size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.14105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of a satisfying and rigorous mathematical understanding of the performance of neural networks is a major challenge in artificial intelligence. Against this background, we study the expressive power of neural networks through the example of the classical NP-hard Knapsack Problem. Our main contribution is a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with rectified linear units that are iteratively applied to each item of a Knapsack instance and thereby compute optimal or provably good solution values. We show that an RNN of depth four and width depending quadratically on the profit of an optimum Knapsack solution is sufficient to find optimum Knapsack solutions. We also prove the following tradeoff between the size of an RNN and the quality of the computed Knapsack solution: for Knapsack instances consisting of $n$ items, an RNN of depth five and width $w$ computes a solution of value at least $1-\mathcal{O}(n^2/\sqrt{w})$ times the optimum solution value. Our results build upon a classical dynamic programming formulation of the Knapsack Problem as well as a careful rounding of profit values that are also at the core of the well-known fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the Knapsack Problem. A carefully conducted computational study qualitatively supports our theoretical size bounds. Finally, we point out that our results can be generalized to many other combinatorial optimization problems that admit dynamic programming solution methods, such as various Shortest Path Problems, the Longest Common Subsequence Problem, and the Traveling Salesperson Problem.</description>

      <title>SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13939v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking GPT-4 on Algorithmic Problems: A Systematic Evaluation of Prompting Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing thanks to their ability to reuse knowledge acquired on massive text corpora on a wide variety of downstream tasks, with minimal (if any) tuning steps. At the same time, it has been repeatedly shown that LLMs lack systematic generalization, which allows to extrapolate the learned statistical regularities outside the training distribution. In this work, we offer a systematic benchmarking of GPT-4, one of the most advanced LLMs available, on three algorithmic tasks characterized by the possibility to control the problem difficulty with two parameters. We compare the performance of GPT-4 with that of its predecessor (GPT-3.5) and with a variant of the Transformer-Encoder architecture recently introduced to solve similar tasks, the Neural Data Router. We find that the deployment of advanced prompting techniques allows GPT-4 to reach superior accuracy on all tasks, demonstrating that state-of-the-art LLMs constitute a very strong baseline also in challenging tasks that require systematic generalization.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain "how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics". So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication) and later digital messengers, covering at the same time its syntactic, semantic and pragmatic flavors. In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our representation starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our framework is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Being compatible with the free energy principle, we have developed a computational enactivist theoretical framework that could be able to describe from the origin of life to high-level cognition, as if it were a purely constructivist narrative. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models with Grid-Based Game Competitions: An Extensible LLM Benchmark and Leaderboard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel and extensible benchmark for large language models (LLMs) through grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku. The open-source game simulation code, available on GitHub, allows LLMs to compete and generates detailed data files in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG formats for leaderboard rankings and further analysis. We present the results of games among leading LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet by Anthropic, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B by Meta. We also encourage submissions of results from other LLMs. In total, we simulated 2,310 matches (5 sessions for each pair among 7 LLMs and a random player) across three types of games, using three distinct prompt types: list, illustration, and image. The results revealed significant variations in LLM performance across different games and prompt types, with analysis covering win and disqualification rates, missed opportunity analysis, and invalid move analysis. The details of the leaderboard and result matrix data are available as open-access data on GitHub. This study enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in playing games they were not specifically trained for, helping to assess their rule comprehension and strategic thinking. On the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), this study lays the groundwork for future exploration into their utility in complex decision-making scenarios, illuminating their strategic thinking abilities and offering directions for further inquiry into the limits of LLMs within game-based frameworks.</description>
