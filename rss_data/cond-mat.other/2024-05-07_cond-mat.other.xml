      <title>The influence of dark excitons on the electroabsorption spectrum of polyacetylene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study revisits the electroabsorption (EA) spectrum of polyacetylene, as functions of the electric field strength, isomerization degree, and light polarization states. The EA spectrum of $cis$-$(CH)_x$ reveals an oscillatory feature that follows the Stark shift-related first derivative of the materials absorption spectrum that contains v(0-1) and v(0-2) sidebands of the excited $C=C$ stretching vibration that agrees well with the Raman spectrum. EA spectrum of $trans $-$(CH)_x$ does not match the first derivative of the materials absorption spectrum, and the phonon sideband frequency does not agree with the RS spectrum. EA spectrum of $trans $-$(CH)_x$ reveals a band below the first allowed $1B_u$ exciton. We interpret this feature as due to the electric field activated even-parity dark (forbidden) exciton, namely $mA_g$ ($m &gt;1$), showing that the nonluminescent $trans $-$(CH)_x$ is due to the reverse order of the excited states, where a dark $mA_g$ exciton lies below the allowed $1B_u$ exciton. This agrees with the unusual phonon sideband in $trans $-$(CH)_x$ absorption, since the excited state attenuation caused by the fast internal conversion from $1B_u$ to $mA_g$ influences the apparent frequency that determines the phonon sideband. Consequently, from the EA and RS spectra we estimate the $1B_u$ lifetime in $trans $-$(CH)_x$ to be $\sim 30$ fs. Integrated EA spectrum of $trans $-$(CH)_x$ shows a traditional Huang-Rhys type series with a relaxation parameter, $S \sim 0.5$. This indicates that the EA spectrum of the $trans $ isomer is also determined by a Stark shift related to the first derivative of the absorption spectrum, but preferentially for the longest chains in the films chain lengths distribution. This is due to the $N^3$ response of the non-linear susceptibility, $\chi^{(3)}$ ($\sim$EA), dependence on the chain length having $N$ monomers.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Ordering of Ammonium Cations in NH$_4$I, NH$_4$Br and NH$_4$Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The different types of magnetism arise mainly from how electrons move and interact with each other. In this work, we show how protons (H$^+$) also exhibit magnetic behavior. We measured the magnetic susceptibility of the ammonium halides and identified pronounced increases at 232 K, 233 K and 243 K for NH$_4$I, NH$_4$Br and NH$_4$Cl, respectively, which all coincide to the geometric ordering of its ammonium cations. With extensive literature establishing the fact that the ammonium cations exhibit rotational motion even towards the lowest temperatures, we take into account that the orbital motion of the protons carries a magnetic moment and find it to be larger than that of the paired electrons. Consequently, the structural phase transitions are magnetically-driven as the system attempts to lift 8-fold energy degeneracies of the proton orbitals via Jahn-Teller distortions. Our findings identify that NH$_4$$^+$ cations are capable of comprising magnetism which appears to be ubiquitous in ammonia-based molecular solids.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Secondary and Backscattered Electron Energy Spectra and Yields Analysis: from Theory to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>

      <title>Phase transition and polar cluster behavior above Curie temperature in ferroelectric BaTi$_{0.8}$Zr$_{0.2}$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phase transition behavior of the ferroelectric BaTi$_{0.8}$Zr$_{0.2}$O$_3$ in the paraelectric region. The temperature dependencies of thermal, polar, elastic and dielectric properties indicate the presence of local structures above the paraelectric-ferroelectric transition temperature Tc = 292 K. The non-zero remnant polarization is measured up to a characteristic temperature T* ~350 K, which coincides with the temperature where the dielectric constant deviates from Curie-Weiss law. Resonant Piezoelectric Spectroscopy shows that DC field-cooling above Tc using fields smaller than the coercive field leads to an elastic response and remnant piezoelectricity below T*, which likely corresponds to the coherence temperature associated with polar nanostructures in ferroelectrics. The observed remnant effect is attributed to the reorientation of polar nanostructures above Tc.</description>
