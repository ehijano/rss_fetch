      <title>Extending Network Calculus To Deal With Partially Negative And Decreasing Service Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Calculus (NC) is a versatile analytical methodology to efficiently compute performance bounds in networked systems. The arrival and service curve abstractions allow to model diverse and heterogeneous distributed systems. The operations to compute residual service curves and to concatenate sequences of systems enable an efficient and accurate calculation of per-flow timing guarantees. Yet, in some scenarios involving multiple concurrent flows at a system, the central notion of so-called min-plus service curves is too weak to still be able to compute a meaningful residual service curve. In these cases, one usually resorts to so-called strict service curves that enable the computation of per-flow bounds. However, strict service curves are restrictive: (1) there are service elements for which only min-plus service curves can be provided but not strict ones and (2) strict service curves generally have no concatenation property, i.e., a sequence of two strict systems does not yield a strict service curve. In this report, we extend NC to deal with systems only offering aggregate min-plus service curves to multiple flows. The key to this extension is the exploitation of minimal arrival curves, i.e., lower bounds on the arrival process. Technically speaking, we provide basic performance bounds (backlog and delay) for the case of negative service curves. We also discuss their accuracy and show them to be tight. In order to illustrate their usefulness we also present patterns of application of these new results for: (1) heterogeneous systems involving computation and communication resources and (2) finite buffers that are shared between multiple flows.</description>

      <title>How to Cache Important Contents for Multi-modal Service in Dynamic Networks: A DRL-based Caching Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous evolution of networking technologies, multi-modal services that involve video, audio, and haptic contents are expected to become the dominant multimedia service in the near future. Edge caching is a key technology that can significantly reduce network load and content transmission latency, which is critical for the delivery of multi-modal contents. However, existing caching approaches only rely on a limited number of factors, e.g., popularity, to evaluate their importance for caching, which is inefficient for caching multi-modal contents, especially in dynamic network environments. To overcome this issue, we propose a content importance-based caching scheme which consists of a content importance evaluation model and a caching model. By leveraging dueling double deep Q networks (D3QN) model, the content importance evaluation model can adaptively evaluate contents' importance in dynamic networks. Based on the evaluated contents' importance, the caching model can easily cache and evict proper contents to improve caching efficiency. The simulation results show that the proposed content importance-based caching scheme outperforms existing caching schemes in terms of caching hit ratio (at least 15% higher), reduced network load (up to 22% reduction), average number of hops (up to 27% lower), and unsatisfied requests ratio (more than 47% reduction).</description>

      <title>Fast Decision Algorithms for Efficient Access Point Assignment in SDN-Controlled Wireless Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global optimization of access point (AP) assignment to user terminals requires efficient monitoring of user behavior, fast decision algorithms, efficient control signaling, and fast AP reassignment mechanisms. In this scenario, software defined networking (SDN) technology may be suitable for network monitoring, signaling, and control. We recently proposed embedding virtual switches in user terminals for direct management by an SDN controller, further contributing to SDN-oriented access network optimization. However, since users may restrict terminal-side traffic monitoring for privacy reasons (a common assumption by previous authors), we infer user traffic classes at the APs. On the other hand, since handovers will be more frequent in dense small-cell networks (e.g., mmWave-based 5G deployments will require dense network topologies with inter-site distances of ~150-200 m), the delay to take assignment decisions should be minimal. To this end, we propose taking fast decisions based exclusively on extremely simple network-side application flow-type predictions based on past user behavior. Using real data we show that a centralized allocation algorithm based on those predictions achieves network utilization levels that approximate those of optimal allocations. We also test a distributed version of this algorithm. Finally, we quantify the elapsed time since a user traffic event takes place until its terminal is assigned an AP, when needed.</description>

      <title>Peregrine: ML-based Malicious Traffic Detection for Terabit Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malicious traffic detectors leveraging machine learning (ML), namely those incorporating deep learning techniques, exhibit impressive detection capabilities across multiple attacks. However, their effectiveness becomes compromised when deployed in networks handling Terabit-speed traffic. In practice, these systems require substantial traffic sampling to reconcile the high data plane packet rates with the comparatively slower processing speeds of ML detection. As sampling significantly reduces traffic observability, it fundamentally undermines their detection capability.
  We present Peregrine, an ML-based malicious traffic detector for Terabit networks. The key idea is to run the detection process partially in the network data plane. Specifically, we offload the detector's ML feature computation to a commodity switch. The Peregrine switch processes a diversity of features per-packet, at Tbps line rates - three orders of magnitude higher than the fastest detector - to feed the ML-based component in the control plane. Our offloading approach presents a distinct advantage. While, in practice, current systems sample raw traffic, in Peregrine sampling occurs after feature computation. This essential trait enables computing features over all traffic, significantly enhancing detection performance. The Peregrine detector is not only effective for Terabit networks, but it is also energy- and cost-efficient. Further, by shifting a compute-heavy component to the switch, it saves precious CPU cycles and improves detection throughput.</description>

      <title>LightningNet: Distributed Graph-based Cellular Network Performance Forecasting for the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cellular network plays a pivotal role in providing Internet access, since it is the only global-scale infrastructure with ubiquitous mobility support. To manage and maintain large-scale networks, mobile network operators require timely information, or even accurate performance forecasts. In this paper, we propose LightningNet, a lightweight and distributed graph-based framework for forecasting cellular network performance, which can capture spatio-temporal dependencies that arise in the network traffic. LightningNet achieves a steady performance increase over state-of-the-art forecasting techniques, while maintaining a similar resource usage profile. Our architecture ideology also excels in the respect that it is specifically designed to support IoT and edge devices, giving us an even greater step ahead of the current state-of-the-art, as indicated by our performance experiments with NVIDIA Jetson.</description>

      <title>qIoV: A Quantum-Driven Internet-of-Vehicles-Based Approach for Environmental Monitoring and Rapid Response Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research addresses the critical necessity for advanced rapid response operations in managing a spectrum of environmental hazards. We propose a novel framework, qIoV that integrates quantum computing with the Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) to leverage the computational efficiency, parallelism, and entanglement properties of quantum mechanics. Our approach involves the use of environmental sensors mounted on vehicles for precise air quality assessment. These sensors are designed to be highly sensitive and accurate, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to detect and measure environmental parameters. A salient feature of our proposal is the Quantum Mesh Network Fabric (QMF), a system designed to dynamically adjust the quantum network topology in accordance with vehicular movements. This capability is critical to maintaining the integrity of quantum states against environmental and vehicular disturbances, thereby ensuring reliable data transmission and processing. Moreover, our methodology is further augmented by the incorporation of a variational quantum classifier (VQC) with advanced quantum entanglement techniques. This integration offers a significant reduction in latency for hazard alert transmission, thus enabling expedited communication of crucial data to emergency response teams and the public. Our study on the IBM OpenQSAM 3 platform, utilizing a 127 Qubit system, revealed significant advancements in pair plot analysis, achieving over 90% in precision, recall, and F1-Score metrics and an 83% increase in the speed of toxic gas detection compared to conventional methods.Additionally, theoretical analyses validate the efficiency of quantum rotation, teleportation protocols, and the fidelity of quantum entanglement, further underscoring the potential of quantum computing in enhancing analytical performance.</description>

      <title>Throughput Maximization in Multi-Band Optical Networks with Column Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-band transmission is a promising technical direction for spectrum and capacity expansion of existing optical networks. Due to the increase in the number of usable wavelengths in multi-band optical networks, the complexity of resource allocation problems becomes a major concern. Moreover, the transmission performance, spectrum width, and cost constraint across optical bands may be heterogeneous. Assuming a worst-case transmission margin in U, L, and C-bands, this paper investigates the problem of throughput maximization in multi-band optical networks, including the optimization of route, wavelength, and band assignment. We propose a low-complexity decomposition approach based on Column Generation (CG) to address the scalability issue faced by traditional methodologies. We numerically compare the results obtained by our CG-based approach to an integer linear programming model, confirming the near-optimal network throughput. Our results also demonstrate the scalability of the CG-based approach when the number of wavelengths increases, with the computation time in the magnitude order of 10 s for cases varying from 75 to 1200 wavelength channels per link in a 14-node network.

      <title>RACH-less Handover with Early Timing Advance Acquisition for Outage Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For fifth-generation (5G) and 5G-Advanced networks, outage reduction within the context of reliability is a key objective since outage denotes the time period when a user equipment (UE) cannot communicate with the network. Earlier studies have shown that in the experimental high mobility scenario considered, outage is dominated by the interruption time that stems from the random access channel (RACH)-based handover process from the serving cell to the target cell. A handover by itself is a necessary mobility process to prevent mobility failures and their associated outage. This paper proposes a RACH-less handover signaling scheme for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) conditional handover (CHO) mechanism. The proposed scheme exploits the decoupling between the CHO preparation and execution phases to establish initial synchronization between the UE and the target cell through an early acquisition of the timing advance. This significantly curtails the RACH process and therefore the handover interruption time. Results based on a system-level simulation-based mobility study have shown that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the outage and its constituent handover interruption time relatively by 18.7% and 43.2%, respectively.</description>

      <title>CrystalBox: Future-Based Explanations for Input-Driven Deep RL Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13483v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present CrystalBox, a novel, model-agnostic, posthoc explainability framework for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) controllers in the large family of input-driven environments which includes computer systems. We combine the natural decomposability of reward functions in input-driven environments with the explanatory power of decomposed returns. We propose an efficient algorithm to generate future-based explanations across both discrete and continuous control environments. Using applications such as adaptive bitrate streaming and congestion control, we demonstrate CrystalBox's capability to generate high-fidelity explanations. We further illustrate its higher utility across three practical use cases: contrastive explanations, network observability, and guided reward design, as opposed to prior explainability techniques that identify salient features.</description>

      <title>Stability of Sequential Lateration and of Stress Minimization in the Presence of Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential lateration is a class of methods for multidimensional scaling where a suitable subset of nodes is first embedded by some method, e.g., a clique embedded by classical scaling, and then the remaining nodes are recursively embedded by lateration. A graph is a lateration graph when it can be embedded by such a procedure. We provide a stability result for a particular variant of sequential lateration. We do so in a setting where the dissimilarities represent noisy Euclidean distances between nodes in a geometric lateration graph. We then deduce, as a corollary, a perturbation bound for stress minimization. To argue that our setting applies broadly, we show that a (large) random geometric graph is a lateration graph with high probability under mild conditions, extending a previous result of Aspnes et al (2006).</description>
