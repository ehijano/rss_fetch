      <title>A weighted approach to identifying key team contributors: Individual productivity in professional road cycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing an individual's contribution within a team remains a fundamental challenge across many domains, particularly when recognition for collective achievements is limited to only a few members. This issue is especially important in professional road cycling, where personal success depends on both individual talent and group effort. Existing points-based ranking systems tend to disproportionately reward high-scoring team leaders while undervaluing domestiques - riders who sacrifice personal success to support group performance. To better capture a rider's impact on the team, we propose a weighted measure of cycling productivity that factors in race points, a redistribution metric, and an adapted version of the CoScore formula. This formula assesses an individual's productivity relative to their teammates' performance. Using data from the 2023 season, we show that our approach offers a comprehensive evaluation of professional cyclists, addressing key limitations of existing ranking systems.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Advantage: How Reinforcement Learning Generates Rich Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze strategic communication when advice is generated by a reinforcement-learning algorithm rather than by a fully rational sender. Building on the cheap-talk framework of Crawford and Sobel (1982), an advisor adapts its messages based on payoff feedback, while a decision maker best-responds. We provide a theoretical analysis of the long-run communication outcomes induced by such reward-driven adaptation. With aligned preferences, we establish that learning robustly leads to informative communication even from uninformative initial policies. With misaligned preferences, no stable outcome exists; instead, learning generates cycles that sustain highly informative communication and payoffs exceeding those of any static equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Creative Ownership in the Age of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copyright law focuses on whether a new work is "substantially similar" to an existing one, but generative AI can closely imitate style without copying content, a capability now central to ongoing litigation. We argue that existing definitions of infringement are ill-suited to this setting and propose a new criterion: a generative AI output infringes on an existing work if it could not have been generated without that work in its training corpus. To operationalize this definition, we model generative systems as closure operators mapping a corpus of existing works to an output of new works. AI generated outputs are \emph{permissible} if they do not infringe on any existing work according to our criterion. Our results characterize structural properties of permissible generation and reveal a sharp asymptotic dichotomy: when the process of organic creations is light-tailed, dependence on individual works eventually vanishes, so that regulation imposes no limits on AI generation; with heavy-tailed creations, regulation can be persistently constraining.</description>

      <title>Collaboration drives phase transitions towards cooperation in prisoner's dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a collaboration ring model -- a network of players playing the prisoner's dilemma game and collaborating among the nearest neighbours by forming coalitions. The microscopic stochastic updating of the players' strategies are driven by their innate nature of seeking selfish gains and shared intentionality. Cooperation emerges in such a structured population through non-equilibrium phase transitions driven by propensity of the players to collaborate and by the benefit that a cooperator generates. The robust results are qualitatively independent of number of neighbours and collaborators.</description>

      <title>Bandit Learning in Matching Markets with Interviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-sided matching markets rely on preferences from both sides, yet it is often impractical to evaluate preferences. Participants, therefore, conduct a limited number of interviews, which provide early, noisy impressions and shape final decisions. We study bandit learning in matching markets with interviews, modeling interviews as \textit{low-cost hints} that reveal partial preference information to both sides. Our framework departs from existing work by allowing firm-side uncertainty: firms, like agents, may be unsure of their own preferences and can make early hiring mistakes by hiring less preferred agents. To handle this, we extend the firm's action space to allow \emph{strategic deferral} (choosing not to hire in a round), enabling recovery from suboptimal hires and supporting decentralized learning without coordination. We design novel algorithms for (i) a centralized setting with an omniscient interview allocator and (ii) decentralized settings with two types of firm-side feedback. Across all settings, our algorithms achieve time-independent regret, a substantial improvement over the $O(\log T)$ regret bounds known for learning stable matchings without interviews. Also, under mild structured markets, decentralized performance matches the centralized counterpart up to polynomial factors in the number of agents and firms.</description>

      <title>Goodness-of-fit and utility estimation: what's possible and what's not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A goodness-of-fit index measures the consistency of consumption data with a given model of utility-maximization. We show that for the class of well-behaved (i.e., continuous and increasing) utility functions there is no goodness-of-fit index that is continuous and accurate, where the latter means that a perfect score is obtained if and only if a dataset can be rationalized by a well-behaved utility function. While many standard goodness-of-fit indices are inaccurate we show that these indices are (in a sense we make precise) essentially accurate. Goodness-of-fit indices are typically generated by loss functions and we find that standard loss functions usually do not yield a best-fitting utility function when they are minimized. Nonetheless, welfare comparisons can be made by working out a robust preference relation from the data.</description>

      <title>Endogenous Inequality Aversion: Decision criteria for triage and other ethical tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical ``Crisis Standards of Care'' call for a utilitarian allocation of scarce resources in emergencies, while favoring the worst-off under normal conditions. Inspired by such triage rules, we introduce social welfare functions whose distributive tradeoffs depend on the prevailing level of aggregate welfare. These functions are inherently self-referential: they take the welfare level as an input, even though that level is itself determined by the function. In our formulation, inequality aversion varies with welfare and is therefore self-referential. We provide an axiomatic foundation for a family of social welfare functions that move from Rawlsian to utilitarian criteria as overall welfare falls, thereby formalizing triage guidelines. We also derive the converse case, in which the social objective shifts from Rawlsianism toward utilitarianism as welfare increases.</description>

      <title>The Architecture of Illusion: Network Opacity and Strategic Escalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard models of bounded rationality typically assume agents either possess accurate knowledge of the population's reasoning abilities (Cognitive Hierarchy) or hold dogmatic, degenerate beliefs (Level-$k$). We introduce the ``Connected Minds'' model, which unifies these frameworks by integrating iterative reasoning with a parameterized network bias. We posit that agents do not observe the global population; rather, they observe a sample biased by their network position, governed by a locality parameter $p$ representing algorithmic ranking, social homophily, or information disclosure. We show that this parameter acts as a continuous bridge: the model collapses to the myopic Level-$k$ recursion as networks become opaque ($p \to 0$) and recovers the standard Cognitive Hierarchy model under full transparency ($p=1$). Theoretically, we establish that network opacity induces a \emph{Sophisticated Bias}, causing agents to systematically overestimate the cognitive depth of their opponents while preserving the log-concavity of belief distributions. This makes $p$ an actionable lever: a planner or platform can tune transparency, globally or by segment (a personalized $p_k$), to shape equilibrium behavior. From a mechanism design perspective, we derive the \emph{Escalation Principle}: in games of strategic complements, restricting information can maximize aggregate effort by trapping agents in echo chambers where they compete against hallucinated, high-sophistication peers. Conversely, we identify a \emph{Transparency Reversal} for coordination games, where maximizing network visibility is required to minimize variance and stabilize outcomes. Our results suggest that network topology functions as a cognitive zoom lens, determining whether agents behave as local imitators or global optimizers.</description>
