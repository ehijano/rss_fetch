      <title>On a Family of Nested Recurrences and Their Arithmetical Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of nested recurrence relations $a(n+1) = n - a^{(m)}(n) + a^{(m+1)}(n)$, parameterized by an integer $m \ge 1$ with initial condition $a(1)=1$, is studied. We prove that $a(n)=n-h(n)$ is the unique solution satisfying this condition, where $h(n)$ is an arithmetical sequence in which each non-negative integer $k$ appears $mk+1$ times, with $h(n)$ 1-indexed such that $h(1)=0$. An explicit floor formula for $h(n)$ (and thus for $a(n)$) is derived. The proof of the main theorem involves establishing a key identity for $h(n)$ that arises from the recurrence; this identity is then proved using arithmetical properties of $h(n)$ and the iterated function $a^{(m)}(n)$ at critical boundary points. Combinatorial interpretations for $a(n)$ and its partial sums (for $m=2$), and connections to The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), including generalizations of Connell's sequence, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Shuffle Tableaux, Littlewood--Richardson Coefficients, and Schur Log-Concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new formula for the Littlewood--Richardson coefficients in terms of peelable tableaux compatible with shuffle tableaux, in the same fashion as Remmel--Whitney rule. This gives an efficient way to compute generalized Littlewood--Richardson coefficients for Temperley--Lieb immanants of Jacobi--Trudi matrices. We will also show that our rule behaves well with Bender--Knuth involutions, recovering the symmetry of Littlewood--Richardson coefficients. As an application, we use our rule to prove a special case of a Schur log-concavity conjecture by Lam--Postnikov--Pylyavskyy.</description>

      <title>Tiling symmetric groups by transpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two nonempty subsets $X$ and $Y$ of a group $G$, we say that $(X,Y)$ is a tiling of $G$ if every element of $G$ can be uniquely expressed as $xy$ for some $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$. In 1966, Rothaus and Thompson studied whether the symmetric group $S_n$ with $n\geq3$ admits a tiling $(T_n,Y)$, where $T_n$ consists of the identity and all the transpositions in $S_n$. They showed that no such tiling exists if $1+n(n-1)/2$ is divisible by a prime number at least $\sqrt{n}+2$. In this paper, we establish a new necessary condition for the existence of such a tiling: the subset $Y$ must be partition-transitive with respect to certain partitions of $n$. This generalizes the result of Rothaus and Thompson, as well as a result of Nomura in 1985. We also study whether $S_n$ can be tiled by the set $T_n^*$ of all transpositions, which finally leads us to conjecture that neither $T_n$ nor $T_n^*$ tiles $S_n$ for any $n\geq3$.</description>

      <title>The Interplay between Additive and Multiplicative Central Sets Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of Central sets, introduced by Furstenberg through the framework of topological dynamics, has played a pivotal role in combinatorial number theory. Furstenberg's Central Sets Theorem highlighted their rich combinatorial structure. Later, De, Hindman, and Strauss strengthen this theorem using the algebraic framework of the Stone--\v{C}ech compactification. In this article, we establish a unified version of the Central Sets Theorem that simultaneously captures both additive and multiplicative structures.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Hopf Monoids and Supersolvable Convex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Hopf monoid of convex geometries, which contains partial orders as a Hopf submonoid, and investigate combinatorial invariants constructed from canonical characters on them. Each invariant consists of a pair: a polynomial and a more general quasisymmetric function. We provide combinatorial descriptions of the polynomial invariants and prove combinatorial reciprocity theorems for polynomials that generalize order and enriched order polynomials within a unified framework. For the quasisymmetric invariants, we show that their coefficients enumerate faces of certain simplicial complexes, including subcomplexes of the Coxeter complex and a CW-sphere structure introduced by Billera, Hsiao, and Provan. We also examine the associated $ab$- and $cd$-indices. We prove an equivalent condition for convex geometries to be supersolvable, which enables us to describe the coefficients of the $ab$- and $cd$-indices geometrically for this class of convex geometries.</description>

      <title>On the local metric dimension of $K_4$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph of order $ n(G) $, local metric dimension $ \dim_l(G) $, and clique number $ \omega(G) $. It has been conjectured that if $ n(G) \geq \omega(G) + 1 \geq 4 $, then $ \dim_l(G) \leq \left( \frac{\omega(G) - 2}{\omega(G) - 1} \right) n(G) $. In this paper the conjecture is confirmed for the case $ \omega(G) = 3 $. Consequently, a problem regarding the local metric dimension of planar graphs is also resolved.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial $t$-Designs from Finite Abelian Groups and Their Applications to Elliptic Curve Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the conditions for some finite abelian groups and the family all the $k$-sets in each of them summing up to an element $x$ to form $t$-designs. We fully characterize the sufficient and necessary conditions for the incidence structures to form $1$-designs in finite abelian $p$-groups, generalizing existing results on vector spaces over finite fields. For finite abelian groups of exponent $pq$, we also propose sufficient and necessary conditions for the incidence structures to form a $1$-designs. Furthermore, some interesting observations of the general case when the group is cyclic or non-cyclic are presented and the relations between $(t-1)$-designs and $t$-designs from subset sums are established. As an application, we demonstrate the correspondence between $t$-designs from the minimum-weight codewords in elliptic curve codes and subset-sum designs in their groups of rational points. By such a correspondence, elliptic curve codes supporting designs can be simply derived from subset sums in finite abelian groups that supporting designs.</description>

      <title>Mutual-visibility of the disjointness graph of segments in ${\mathbb R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00689v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V(G),E(G))$ be a simple graph, and let $U\subseteq V(G)$. Two distinct vertices $x,y\in U$ are $U$-mutually visible if $G$ contains a shortest $x$-$y$ path that is internally disjoint from $U$. $U$ is called a mutual-visibility set of $G$ if any two vertices of $U$ are $U$-mutually visible. The mutual-visibility number $\mu(G)$ of $G$ is the size of a largest mutual-visibility set of $G$. Let $P$ be a set of $n\geq 3$ points in ${\mathbb R}^2$ in general position. The disjointness graph of segments $D(P)$ of $P$ is the graph whose vertices are all the closed straight line segments with endpoints in $P$, two of which are adjacent in $D(P)$ if and only if they are disjoint. In this paper we establish tight lower and upper bounds for $\mu(D(P))$, and show that almost all edge disjointness graphs have diameter 2.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Algebraic Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an introduction to algebraic combinatorics, written for a quarter-long graduate course. It starts with a rigorous introduction to formal power series with some combinatorial applications, then discusses integer partitions (proving Jacobi's triple product identity), permutations (Lehmer codes, cycles) and subtractive methods (alternating sums, cancellations and inclusion-exclusion principles, with a particular focus on sign-reversing involutions and determinants). The last chapter introduces symmetric polynomials and proves the Littlewood--Richardson rule using Bender--Knuth involutions (a la Stembridge).
  The appendix contains over 200 exercises (without solutions).</description>

      <title>The minimum size of maximal bipartite IC-plane graphs with given connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the problem of establishing bounds on the edge density of 1-planar graphs, including their subclass IC-planar graphs, has received considerable attention. In 2018, Angelini et al. showed that any n-vertex bipartite IC-planar graph has at most 2.25n-4 edges, which implies that bipartite IC-planar graphs have vertex-connectivity at most 4. In this paper, we prove that any n-vertex maximal bipartite IC-plane graph with connectivity 2 has at least 3/2n-2 edges, and those with connectivity 3 has at least 2n-3 edges. All the above lower bounds are tight. For 4-connected maximal bipartite IC-planar graphs, the question of determining a non-trivial lower bound on the size remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$ with girth $g$. For $k=1,\dots,\min\{g-1, n-g\}$, let $n(G,k)$ be the number of Laplacian eigenvalues (counting multiplicities) of $G$ that fall inside the interval $[n-g-k+4,n]$. We prove that if $g\ge 4$, then \[ n(G,k)\le n-g. \] Those graphs achieving the bound for $k=1,2$ are determined. We also determine the graphs $G$ with $g=3$ such that $n(G,k)=n-1, n-2, n-3$.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the chromatic polynomial coefficients via hyperplane arrangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent result of Lofano and Paolini expresses the characteristic polynomial of a real hyperplane arrangement in terms of a projection statistic on the regions of the arrangement. We use this result to give an alternative proof for Greene and Zaslavsky's interpretation for the coefficients of the chromatic polynomial of a graph. We also show that this projection statistic has a nice combinatorial interpretation in the case of the braid arrangement, which generalizes to graphical arrangements of natural unit interval graphs. We use this generalization to give a new proof of the formula for the chromatic polynomial of a natural unit interval graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is even-degenerate if one can iteratively remove a vertex of even degree at each step until at most one edge remains. Recently, Janzer and Yip showed that the Erd\H{o}s--Renyi random graph $G(n,1/2)$ is even-degenerate with high probability, and asked whether an analogous result holds for any general $G(n,p)$. In this paper, we answer this question for any constant $p\in (0,1)$ in affirmation by proving that $G(n,p)$ is even-degenerate with high probability.</description>

      <title>On the Conjecture of the Representation Number of Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the problem of determining the representation number of an arbitrary word-representable graph is NP-hard, this problem is open even for bipartite graphs. The representation numbers are known for certain bipartite graphs including all the graphs with at most nine vertices. For bipartite graphs with partite sets of sizes $m$ and $n$, Glen et al. conjectured that the representation number is at most $\lceil \frac{m+n}{4}\rceil$, where $m+n \ge 9$.
  In this paper, we show that every bipartite graph is $\left( 1+ \lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil \right)$-representable, where $m$ is the size of its smallest partite set. Furthermore, if $m$ is odd then we prove that the bipartite graphs are $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil $-representable. Accordingly, we establish that the conjecture by Glen et al. holds good for all bipartite graphs leaving the bipartite graphs whose partite sets are of equal and even size. In case of the bipartite graphs with partite sets of equal and even size, we prove the conjecture for certain subclasses using the neighborhood inclusion graph approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every tree $T$ which is not an edge, for almost every graph $G$ which does not contain $T$ as an induced subgraph, $V(G)$ has a partition into $\alpha(T)-1$ parts certifying this fact. Each part induces a graph which is $P_4$-free and has further properties which depend on $T$. As a consequence we obtain good bounds (often tight up to a constant factor) on the number of $T$-free graphs and show in a follow-up paper~\cite{RY} that almost every $T$-free graph $G$ has chromatic number equal to the size of its largest clique.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic $\chi$-boundedness of hereditary families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family ${\cal F}$ of graphs is asymptotically $\chi$-bounded with bounding function $f$ if almost every graph $G$ in the family satisfies $\chi(G) \le f(\omega(G))$. A graph is $H$-free if it does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph. We ask which hereditary families are asymptotically $\chi$-bounded, and discuss some related questions. We show that for every tree $T$, almost all $T$-free graphs $G$ satisfy $\chi(G)=\omega(G)$. We show that for every cycle $C_k$ except $C_6$, almost every $C_k$-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) = \omega(G)$. We show that the $C_6$-free graphs are asymptotically $\chi$-bounded with bounding function $f(w)=(1+o(1))\frac{w^2}{\log w}$.</description>

      <title>On the number of edges of restricted matchstick graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph whose vertices are points in the plane and whose edges are noncrossing straight-line segments of unit length is called a \emph{matchstick graph}. We prove two somewhat counterintuitive results concerning the maximum number of edges of such graphs in two different scenarios.
  First, we show that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that every triangle-free matchstick graph on $n$ vertices has at most $2n-c\sqrt{n}$ edges. This statement is not true for any $c&gt;\sqrt2.$
  We also prove that for every $r&gt;0$, there is a constant $\varepsilon(r)&gt;0$ with the property that every matchstick graph on $n$ vertices contained in a disk of radius $r$ has at most $(2-\varepsilon(r))n$ edges.</description>

      <title>A Grammatical Calculus for the Ramanujan Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As remarked by Berndt, no combinatorial perspective seems to be
  alluded in the original definition
  of the Ramanujan polynomials. On a different scene,
  a recursive algorithm to generate rooted
  trees has been devised independently by
  Shor and Dumont-Ramamonjisoa.
  Zeng
  discovered the connection between
  the Ramanujan polynomials
  and the enumeration of rooted
  trees by number of improper edges. We present a proper labeling scheme for
  rooted trees by employing an extra label.
  Harnessed by this grammar, we develop a calculus heavily
  depending on the constant properties for
  the Ramanujan polynomials. From the
  grammatical formulation, we recover
  the defining equation
  of Ramanujan on an implicit function. So the
  two themes of Ramanujan converge to one combinatorial structure. Moreover, we provide a grammatical treatment of a bijection
  behind the recursion independently due to
  Shor and Berndt-Evans-Wilson.</description>

      <title>On the quadratic 8-edge case of the Brown-Erd\H{o}s-S\'os problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f^{(r)}(n;s,k)$ be the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $r$-uniform hypergraph containing no $k$ edges on at most $s$ vertices. Brown, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os conjectured in 1973 that the limit $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}n^{-2}f^{(3)}(n;k+2,k)$ exists for all $k$. Recently, Delcourt and Postle settled the conjecture and their approach was generalised by Shangguan to every uniformity $r\ge 4$: the limit $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}n^{-2}f^{(r)}(n;rk-2k+2,k)$ exists for all $r\ge 3$ and $k\ge 2$.
  The value of the limit is currently known for $k\in \{2,3,4,5,6,7\}$ due to various results authored by Glock, Joos, Kim, K\"{u}hn, Lichev, Pikhurko, R\"odl and Sun. In this paper we look at the case $k=8$, determining the value of the limit for each $r\ge 4$ and presenting a lower bound for $k=3$ that we conjecture to be sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new advancement in the sum and difference of sets problem, which improves upon recent results by both DeepMind's AlphaEvolve ($\theta = 1.1584$) and subsequent explicit constructions ($\theta = 1.173050$). In this work, we construct a sequence of $U$ sets which in the limit establishes a new lower bound of $\theta = 1.173077$.</description>

      <title>Triangles in the Plane and arithmetic progressions in thick compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on the occurrence of three-point configurations in subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d\geq 1$ of sufficient thickness. We prove that compact sets $A\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ contain a similar copy of any linear $3$ point configuration provided $A$ satisfies a mild Yavicoli-thickness condition and an $r$-uniformity condition for $d\geq 2$; or, when $d=1$, the result holds provided the Newhouse thickness of $A$ is at least $1$.
  Moreover, we prove that compact sets $A\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ contain the vertices of an equilateral triangle (and more generally, the vertices of a similar copy of any given triangle) provided $A$ satisfies a mild Yavicoli-thickness condition and an $r$-uniformity condition. Further, $C\times C$ contains the vertices of an equilateral triangle (and more generally the vertices of a similar copy of any given three-point configuration) provided the Newhouse thickness of $C$ is at least $1$. These are among the first results in the literature to give explicit criteria for the occurrence of three-point configurations in the plane.</description>

      <title>Regular genus of $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$, $4$-torus, and small covers over $\Delta^2 \times \Delta^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A crystallization of a PL manifold is an edge-colored graph encoding a contracted triangulation of the manifold. The concept of regular genus generalizes the notions of surface genus and Heegaard genus for 3-manifolds to higher-dimensional closed PL manifolds. The regular genus of a PL manifold is a PL invariant. Determining the regular genus of a closed PL $n$-manifold remains a fundamental challenge in combinatorial topology. In this article, we first resolve a conjecture by proving that the regular genus of $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ is 6. Additionally, we determine that the regular genus of $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ is 16. We also present some observations related to the regular genus of the $n$-dimensional torus and conjecture that the regular genus of $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \cdots \times \mathbb{S}^1$ ($n$ times) is $1+\frac{(n+1)! \ (n-3)}{8}$, for $n\ge 5$. Then, we investigate the regular genus of small covers. Small covers are closed $n$-manifolds admitting a locally standard $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-action with orbit space homeomorphic to a simple convex polytope $P^n$. For the polytope $P = \Delta^2 \times \Delta^2$, we classify all the small covers up to Davis-Januszkiewicz (D-J) equivalence and show that there are exactly seven such covers. Among these, one is $\mathbb{RP}^2 \times \mathbb{RP}^2$, while the others are $\mathbb{RP}^2$-bundles over $\mathbb{RP}^2$. Remarkably, each of these seven small covers has the regular genus 8. Results in this article provide explicit regular genus values for several important 4-manifolds, offering new insights and tools for future work in combinatorial topology.</description>

      <title>The random $k$-SAT Gibbs uniqueness threshold revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any $k\geq3$ for clause/variable ratios up to the Gibbs uniqueness threshold of the corresponding Galton-Watson tree, the number of satisfying assignments of random $k$-SAT formulas is given by the `replica symmetric solution' predicted by physics methods [Monasson, Zecchina: Phys. Rev. Lett. (1996)]. Furthermore, while the Gibbs uniqueness threshold is still not known precisely for any $k\geq3$, we derive new lower bounds on this threshold that improve over prior work [Montanari and Shah: SODA (2007)].The improvement is significant particularly for small $k$.</description>

      <title>Percolation on random 2-lifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, we consider a model for a random cover of $G$ by taking two parallel copies of $G$ and crossing every pair of parallel edges randomly with probability $q$ independently of each other. The resulting graph $G_q$, is a random $2$-lift of $G$ that may not be transitive but still probabilistically exhibit many properties of transitive graphs. Studying percolation in this context can help us test the reliability and robustness of our proofs methods in percolation theory. Our three main results on this model are the continuity of the critical parameter $p_c(G_q)$, for $q\in(0,1)$, the strict monotonicity $p_c(G_q)&lt; p_c(G)$ and the exponential decay of the cluster size in the subcritical regime at $q=1/2$.</description>

      <title>On the homological shifts of cover ideals of Cohen-Macaulay graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a non-negative integer $k$, let $\mathrm{HS}_{k}(J(G))$ denote the $k^{\text{th}}$ homological shift ideal of the vertex cover ideal $J(G)$ of a graph $G$. For each $k\geq 2$, we construct a Cohen-Macaulay very well-covered graph $G_k$ which is both Cohen-Macaulay bipartite and a whiskered graph so that $\mathrm{HS}_{k}(J(G))$ does not have a linear resolution. This contradicts several results as well as disproves a conjecture in [J. Algebra, $\mathbf{629}$, (2023), 76-108] and [Mediterr. J. Math., $\mathbf{21}$, 135 (2024)]. The graphs $G_k$ are also examples of clique-whiskered graphs introduced by Cook and Nagel, which include Cohen-Macaulay chordal graphs, Cohen-Macaulay Cameron-Walker graphs, and clique corona graphs. Surprisingly, for Cohen-Macaulay chordal graphs, we can use a special ordering on the minimal generators to show that $\mathrm{HS}_{k}(J(G))$ has linear quotients for all $k$. Moreover, for all Cohen-Macaulay Cameron-Walker graphs and certain clique corona graphs, we show that $\mathrm{HS}_{k}(J(G))$ is weakly polymatroidal, and thus, has linear quotients for all $k$.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of the Spread-Global Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by constructions from applied topology, there has been recent interest in the homological algebra of linear representations of posets, specifically in homological algebra relative to non-standard exact structures. A prominent example of such exact structure is the spread exact structure, which is an exact structure on the category of representations of a fixed poset whose indecomposable projectives are the spread representations (that is, the indicator representations of convex and connected subsets). The spread-global dimension is known to be finite on finite posets, and unbounded on the collection of Cartesian products between two arbitrary finite total orders. It is conjectured in [AENY23] that the spread-global dimension is bounded on the collection of Cartesian products between a fixed, finite total order and an arbitrary finite total order. We give a positive answer to this conjecture, and, more generally, we prove that the spread-global dimension is bounded on the collection of Cartesian products between any fixed, finite poset and an arbitrary finite total order. In doing this, we also establish the existence of finite spread-resolutions for finitely presented representations of arbitrary upper semilattices.</description>

Abstract: We prove that given a constant $k \ge 2$ and a large set system $\mathcal{F}$ of sets of size at most $w$, a typical $k$-tuple of sets $(S_1, \cdots, S_k)$ from $\mathcal{F}$ can be ``blown up" in the following sense: for each $1 \le i \le k$, we can find a large subfamily $\mathcal{F}_i$ containing $S_i$ so that for $i \neq j$, if $T_i \in \mathcal{F}_i$ and $T_j \in \mathcal{F}_j$ , then $T_i \cap T_j=S_i \cap S_j$. We also show that the answer to the multicolor version of the sunflower conjecture is the same as the answer for the original, up to an exponential factor.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be the graph on vertices $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$, and having all edges except $(4, 5)$. A continuous map $f:K\to \R^2$ is called an \emph{almost embedding} if $f$-images of non-adjacent edges are disjoint. Take the winding numbers of the $f$-image of the oriented cycle $(1, 2, 3)$ around $f(4)$ and around $f(5)$. We prove that the difference of these numbers equals $\pm 1$. This is surprising, because in other similar situations analogous statement is wrong.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04502v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of symmetric structures is a new trend in Ramsey theory. Recently in [7], Di Nasso initiated a systematic study of symmetrization of classical Ramsey theoretical results, and proved a symmetric version of several Ramsey theoretic results. In this paper Di Nasso asked if his method could be adapted to find new non-linear Diophantine equations that are partition regular [7,Final remarks (4)]. By analyzing additive, multiplicative, and symmetric large sets, we construct new partition regular equations that give a first affirmative answer to this question. A special case of our result shows that if $P$ is a polynomial with no constant term then the equation $x+P(y-x)=z+w+zw$, where $y\neq x$ is partition regular. Also we prove several new monochromatic patterns involving additive, multiplicative, and symmetric structures. Throughout our work, we use tools from the Algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech Compactifications of discrete semigroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a general framework to construct colorings avoiding short monochromatic arithmetic progressions in Euclidean Ramsey theory. Specifically, if $\ell_m$ denotes $m$ collinear points with consecutive points of distance one apart, we say that $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_r,\ell_s)$ if there is a red/blue coloring of $n$-dimensional Euclidean space that avoids red congruent copies of $\ell_r$ and blue congruent copies of $\ell_s$. We show that $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_3, \ell_{20})$, improving the best-known result $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_3, \ell_{1177})$ by F\"uhrer and T\'oth, and also establish $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_4, \ell_{14})$ and $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_5, \ell_{8})$ in the spirit of the classical result $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_6, \ell_{6})$ due to Erd\H{o}s et. al. We also show a number of similar $3$-coloring results, as well as $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_3, \alpha\ell_{6889})$, where $\alpha$ is an arbitrary positive real number. This final result answers a question of F\"uhrer and T\'oth in the positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2017, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie, Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + \sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper, we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich words is $1 + 1/(3 - \mu) \approx 2.25876324$, where $\mu$ is the unique real root of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present outlines of a general method to reach certain kinds of $q$-multiple sum identities. Throughout our exposition, we shall give generalizations to the results given by Dilcher, Prodinger, Fu and Lascoux, Zeng, and Guo and Zhang concerning $q$-series identities related to divisor functions. Our exposition shall also provide a generalization of the duality relation for finite multiple harmonic $q$-series given by Bradley. Utilizing these generalizations, we will also arrive at some new interesting classes of $q$-multiple sums.</description>

      <title>Wheel-like bricks and minimal matching covered graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connected graph G with at least two vertices is matching covered if each of its edges lies in a perfect matching. We say that an edge e in a matching covered graph G is removable if G-e is matching covered. A pair {e; f} of edges of a matching covered graph G is a removable doubleton if G-e-f is matching covered, but neither G-e nor G-f is. Removable edges and removable doubletons are called removable classes, introduced by Lovasz and Plummer in connection with ear decompositions of matching covered graphs. A 3-connected graph is a brick if the removal of any two distinct vertices, the left graph has a perfect matching. A brick G is wheel-like if G has a vertex h, such that every removable class of G has an edge incident with h. Lucchesi and Murty proposed a problem of characterizing wheel-like bricks. We show that every wheel-like brick may be obtained by splicing graphs whose underlying simple graphs are odd wheels in a certain manner. A matching covered graph is minimal if the removal of any edge, the left graph is not matching covered. Lovasz and Plummer proved that the minimum degree of a minimal matching covered bipartite graph different from K2 is 2 by ear decompositions in 1977. By the properties of wheel-like bricks, we prove that the minimum degree of a minimal matching covered graph other than K2 is 2 or 3.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Andrews considered the partitions with parts separated by parity, in which parts of a given parity are all smaller than those of the other parity. Inspired from the partitions with parts separated by parity, we investigate the overpartitions with separated overlined parts and non-overlined parts, in which the sizes of overlined parts (resp. non-overlined parts) are greater than or equal to those of non-overlined parts (resp. overlined parts).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02274v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2024, Bellamy, Craw, Rayan, Schedler, and Weiss introduced a particular family of real hyperplane arrangements stemming from hyperpolygonal spaces associated with certain quiver varieties which we thus call hyperpolygonal arrangements $\mathcal H_n$. In this note we study these arrangements and investigate their properties systematically. Remarkably the arrangements $\mathcal H_n$ discriminate between essentially all local properties of arrangements. In addition we show that hyperpolygonal arrangements are projectively unique and combinatorially formal.
  We note that the arrangement $\mathcal H_5$ is the famous counterexample of Edelman and Reiner from 1993 of Orlik's conjecture that the restriction of a free arrangement is again free.</description>

      <title>Sorting permutations with pile shuffle on queue-like and stack-like piles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by a common technique for shuffling a deck of cards on a table without riffling, we formalize the pile shuffle and investigate its capabilities as a sorting device. Our study is novel in that we consider pile shuffle in three variations: (1) using queue-like piles, (2) using stack-like piles, and (3) using a heterogeneous mixture of those two pile types, either given or decided during the shuffle by the dealer herself. We first characterize the sortable permutations of one or more sequential rounds of pile shuffle, under constraints on the number and types of piles to be used, and then derive formulas to obtain a sorting shuffle of a given permutation on the minimum number of piles, efficiently, whenever feasible. In the process, we present an interesting mathematical interpretation of any multi-round shuffle on fixed-type piles, as a single-round shuffle on a generally larger number of fixed-type ``virtual piles''; we confirm that repetition augments the power of pile shuffle exponentially, in that $m$ piles over $T$ rounds enjoys the capacity of $m^T$ piles in a single round. Finally, we motivate a forthcoming companion paper in which we prove that dealer choice -- where the dealer is allowed to choose the types of the piles during the shuffle -- makes deciding feasibility of sort NP-Hard for some variants of multi-round pile shuffle; proof is by a novel reduction from Boolean satisfiability (SAT).</description>

      <title>A Multigraph Characterization of Permutiple Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A permutiple is a natural number whose representation in some base is an integer multiple of a number whose representation has the same collection of digits. A previous paper utilizes a finite-state-machine construction and its state graph to recognize permutiples and to generate new examples. Permutiples are associated with walks on the state graph which necessarily satisfy certain conditions. However, the above effort does not provide conditions sufficient for the existence of permutiples. In this paper, we provide such a condition, which we will state using the language of multigraphs.</description>

For a tree $T=(V,E)$ with $n=|V|$ vertices and $m=|E|$ edges, we provide several bounds and exact formulas for these two topological indices, and we show that the Albertson index $\irr(T)$ and the first Zagreb index $M_1(T)$ satisfy the association \[ \operatorname{irr}(T)=d_1^2+d_n^2+(n-2)\left(\frac{\Delta + \delta}{2}\right)^2+\sum_{i=2}^{n-1} d_i+d_n - d_1-2n-2.\] Our goal of this paper is provide a topological indices, Albertson index, Sigma index among a degree sequence $\mathscr{D}=(d_1,\dots,d_n)$ where it is non-increasing and non-decreasing of tree $T$.</description>

      <title>Halfway to induced saturation for even cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For graphs $G$ and $H$, we say that $G$ is $H$-free if no induced subgraph of $G$ is isomorphic to $H$, and that $G$ is $H$-induced-saturated if $G$ is $H$-free but removing or adding any edge in $G$ creates an induced copy of $H$. A full characterization of graphs $H$ for which $H$-induced-saturated graphs exist remains elusive. Even the case where $H$ is a path -- now settled by the collective results of Martin and Smith, Bonamy et al., and Dvo\'{r}\v{a}k -- was already quite challenging.
  What if $H$ is a cycle? The complete answer for odd cycles was given by Behren et al., leaving the case of even cycles (except for the $4$-cycle) wide open. Our main result is the first step toward closing this gap: We prove that for every even cycle $H$, there is a graph $G$ with at least one edge such that $G$ is $H$-free but removing any edge from $G$ creates an induced copy of $H$ (in fact, we construct $H$-induced-saturated graphs for every even cycle $H$ on at most 10 vertices).</description>

      <title>On Computing Vertex Connectivity of 1-Plane Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vertex connectivity of a graph $G$ is the size of the smallest set of vertices $S$ such that $G \setminus S$ is disconnected. For the class of planar graphs, the problem of vertex connectivity is well-studied, both from structural and algorithmic perspectives. Let $G$ be a plane embedded graph, and $\Lambda(G)$ be an auxiliary graph obtained by inserting a face vertex inside each face and connecting it to all vertices of $G$ incident with the face. If $S$ is a minimal vertex cut of $G$, then there exists a cycle of length $2|S|$ whose vertices alternate between vertices of $S$ and face vertices. This structure facilitates the designing of a linear-time algorithm to find minimum vertex cuts of planar graphs. In this paper, we attempt a similar approach for the class of 1-plane graphs -- these are graphs with a drawing on the plane where each edge is crossed at most once.
  We consider different classes of 1-plane graphs based on the subgraphs induced by the endpoints of crossings. For 1-plane graphs where the endpoints of every crossing induce the complete graph $K_4$, we show that the structure of minimum vertex cuts is identical to that in plane graphs, as mentioned above. For 1-plane graphs where the endpoints of every crossing induce at least three edges (i.e., one edge apart from the crossing pair of edges), we show that for any minimal vertex cut $S$, there exists a cycle of diameter $O(|S|)$ in $\Lambda(G)$ such that all vertices of $S$ are in the neighbourhood of the cycle. This structure enables us to design a linear time algorithm to compute the vertex connectivity of all such 1-plane graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The volume of a cyclic polytope can be obtained by forming an iterated integral along a suitable piecewise linear path running through its edges. Different choices of such a path are related by the action of a subgroup of the combinatorial automorphisms of the polytope. Motivated by this observation, we look for other linear combinations of iterated integrals that are invariant under the subgroup action. This yields interesting polynomial attributes of the cyclic polytope. We prove that there are infinitely many of these invariants which are algebraically independent in the shuffle algebra.</description>

Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1, \ldots,x_n]$ denote the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$ and $I \subset S$ a monomial ideal. Given a vector $\mathfrak{c}\in\mathbb{N}^n$, the ideal $I_{\mathfrak{c}}$ is the ideal generated by those monomials belonging to $I$ whose exponent vectors are componentwise bounded above by $\mathfrak{c}$. Let $\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)$ be the largest integer $q$ for which $(I^q)_{\mathfrak{c}}\neq 0$. For a finite graph $G$, its edge ideal is denoted by $I(G)$. Let $\mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{c},G)$ be the toric ring which is generated by the monomials belonging to the minimal system of monomial generators of $(I(G)^{\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\mathfrak{c}}$. In a previous work, the authors proved that $(I(G)^{\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\mathfrak{c}}$ is a polymatroidal ideal. It follows that $\mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{c},G)$ is a normal Cohen--Macaulay domain. In this paper, we study the Gorenstein property of $\mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{c},G)$.</description>

Abstract: Functions satisfying the functional equation
  \begin{align*}
  \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} (-1)^r f(x+ry, ny) = f(x,y), \quad \text{for any positive odd integer $n$},
  \end{align*} are named the alternating invariant functions. Examples of such functions include Euler polynomials, alternating Hurwitz zeta functions and their associated Gamma functions. In this paper, we systematically investigate the fundamental properties of alternating invariant functions. We prove that the set of such functions is closed under translation, reflection, and differentiation. In addition, we define a convolution operation on alternating invariant functions and derive explicit convolution formulas for Euler polynomials and alternating Hurwitz zeta functions, respectively. Furthermore, using distributional relations, we construct new examples of alternating invariant functions, including suitable combinations of trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, among others.</description>
