      <title>Vision-Based CNN Prediction of Sunspot Numbers from SDO/HMI Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspot numbers constitute the longest and most widely used record of solar activity, with direct implications for space weather forecasting and heliophysical research. Traditional sunspot counting relies on visual inspection or algorithmic feature detection, both of which are limited by subjectivity, image quality, and methodological inconsistencies. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enable the direct use of solar imagery for automated prediction tasks, reducing reliance on manual feature engineering. In this work, we present a supervised vision-based regression framework to estimate daily sunspot numbers from full-disk continuum images acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Images from 2011-2024 were paired with daily sunspot numbers from the SILSO Version 2.0 dataset of the Royal Observatory of Belgium. After preprocessing and augmentation, a CNN was trained to predict scalar sunspot counts directly from pixel data. The proposed model achieved strong predictive performance, with R2 = 0.986 and RMSE = 6.25 on the test set, indicating close agreement with SILSO reference values. Comparative evaluation against prior studies shows that our approach performs competitively with, and in several cases outperforms, statistical and hybrid machine learning methods, while offering the novel advantage of bypassing explicit detection and manual feature extraction. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients confirmed that the network consistently attends to sunspot regions when forming predictions. These results highlight the potential of deep vision-based approaches for operational solar monitoring, providing a scalable and automated pathway for real-time estimation of classical heliophysical indices</description>

      <title>Observation of undepleted phosphine in the atmosphere of a low-temperature brown dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheres of low-temperature brown dwarfs and gas giant planets are expected to contain the phosphine molecule, PH$_3$ However, previous observations have shown much lower abundances of this molecule than predicted by atmospheric chemistry models. We report JWST spectroscopic observations of phosphine in the atmosphere of the brown dwarf Wolf 1130C. Multiple absorption lines due to phosphine are detected around 4.3 ${\mu}$m, from which we calculate a phosphine abundance of 0.100$\pm$0.009 parts per million. This abundance is consistent with disequilibrium atmospheric chemistry models that reproduce the phosphine abundances in Jupiter and Saturn, and is much higher than abundances previously reported for other brown dwarfs or exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Prominences and Coronal Rain with the MPI-AMRVAC Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review surveys recent advances in the numerical modeling of solar prominences and coronal rain achieved with the fully open-source adaptive-grid, parallelized Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC). We examine how these models have contributed to our understanding of the formation and evolution of cool plasma structures in the solar corona. We first discuss prominence models that focus on prominence formation and their dynamic behavior. We then turn to coronal rain, highlighting its connection to thermal instability and its role in the exchange of mass and energy between the corona and chromosphere. Particular attention is given to the growing efforts to connect simulations with observations through synthetic emission and spectral diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Ten new, ultracompact triply eclipsing triple star systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have identified more than a hundred close triply eclipsing hierarchical triple star systems from data taken with the space telescope TESS. Many of them have outer periods less than or, close to 100 days, hence, we call them `ultracompact hierarchical triples'. These systems are noteworthy in that we can potentially determine their dynamical and astrophysical parameters with a high precision, in many cases even without radial velocity data. In the present paper we report the comprehensive study of ten new ultracompact triply eclipsing triple star systems, located in the northern ecliptic hemisphere, taken from this larger sample: TICs 198581208, 265274458, 283846096, 337993842, 351404069, 378270875, 403792414, 403916758, 405789362, 461500036.
  Most of the data for this study come from TESS observations, but we obtained supplemental ground-based photometric measurements for two of the systems. The eclipse timing variation curves extracted from the TESS and the ground-based follow up data, the photometric light curves, and the spectral energy distribution are combined in a complex photodynamical analysis to yield the stellar and orbital parameters of all ten systems.
  The outer periods are in the range of 46.8-101.4 days. We found third-body forced, rapid apsidal motion in four systems. Moreover, TIC 403916758 was found to be a double twin triple (i.e. both the inner and the outer mass ratios are close to unity). All of the systems are substantially flat, with mutual inclination angles of $&lt;5^o$. Finally, we have taken the results for the ten systems in the present paper, and combined them with the system parameters for more than 30 other compact triples that we have reported on in previous work, in order to examine some of the global properties of these systems on a statistical basis.</description>

      <title>A type II solar radio burst without a coronal mass ejection association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II solar radio bursts are commonly associated with shocks generated by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), where plasma waves are excited by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes and converted into radio waves at the local plasma frequency or its harmonics. However, there are instances where type II bursts occur in the absence of whitelight CMEs. We analysed one such metric type II radio burst observed on November 2, 2023, characterized by split band features and fundamental-harmonic lanes. Notably, no CME was detected with space-based coronagraphs during this event. However, an intense M1.6 class flare was observed just before the type II burst and an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) disturbance was observed expanding into surrounding regions. The absence of any whitelight CME seen in any coronagraph field of view even though the EUV shock had a moderate speed of $\approx500~km/s$, which was close to the shock speed derived from radio observations, %indicates that the shock in the inner corona was most-likely produced by the very intense solar flare and the type II was associated with the EUV disturbance seen in the lower corona. These observations indicate that the shock in the inner corona was most-likely driven by the EUV ejecta seen in the lower corona, but the ejecta did not survive as a CME in the coronagraph field of view.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Periodic Pulsations Driven by Structural Oscillations in a Kink-Unstable Flaring Coronal Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted coronal loops in the solar atmosphere may become kink-unstable when their magnetic field lines are sufficiently twisted. This instability can trigger magnetic reconnection, leading to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, which manifests as a solar flare. Previous research has demonstrated that oscillations in microwave emissions, resembling observed quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs), can be generated by the reconnecting loop. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between the oscillations of the loop and these microwave pulsations. Using 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we examine two models: a straight loop in a uniform-density atmosphere and a curved loop in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. Using new methodology, we extract the reconnecting loop-top from both models and identify structural oscillations. We then compare these oscillations with the gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation emitted from the simulations, which is forward-modelled using a radiative transfer code. We find that oscillations in the GS emissions are driven by sausage and kink-mode oscillations. However, the relationship between the oscillation frequencies of the GS emission and the identified loop oscillation modes is complex. The dominant mode in the former may result from interference between sausage-mode and kink-mode oscillations or entirely different mechanisms. Results such as these increase our understanding of the time-dependent behaviour of solar flares and lay the groundwork for potential diagnostic tools that could be used to determine physical parameters within a flaring loop</description>

      <title>Abundance of strontium in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We have determined Sr abundance in a sample of 31 red giant branch stars located in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc with the aim to identify potential differences in the Sr abundance between first population (1P, Na-poor) and second population (2P, Na-rich) stars. Methods. We derived the Na and Sr abundances from the archival spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph. To do this, we used 1D ATLAS9 model atmospheres and a 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral synthesis method. Particular attention was paid to assessing the potential impact of CN line blending on the obtained Sr abundances. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential influence of convection on the Sr line formation by using 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the CO5BOLD code. Results. Our results suggest a weak correlation between the abundances of Sr and Na. Together with a similar correlation between the abundances of Zr and Na determined in our previous study, our analysis of Sr suggests that polluters that have enriched 2P stars with light elements may have produced some s-process elements as well. The mean Sr abundance determined in 31 red giant branch stars of 47~Tuc is $\langle {\rm [Sr/Fe]} \rangle = 0.18\pm0.08$ (the error denotes the standard deviation due to the star-to-star abundance scatter). This value is within the range of the Sr abundance variation that is observed in Galactic field stars of similar metallicity. The mean [Sr/Zr] abundance ratio in our sample stars suggests that the two s-process elements could have been synthesized by either low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars ($M=1-4 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) or massive ($M=10-20 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) fast-rotating ($v_{\rm rot}=200-300$ km/s) stars.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the variability of a sample of massive stars in eclipsing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars exhibit a perplexing mismatch between their inferred masses from different observational techniques, posing a significant challenge to our understanding of stellar evolution and structure. This discrepancy is believed to be caused by the underestimation of the convective core masses. The efficiency of such measurement is usually impaired by a lot of processes at work in the interior of the stars such as convective core overshooting and interior rotation. By integrating the precision of asteroseismology which provides insights into the internal structure and dynamics of stars, with the detailed observational constraints offered by eclipsing binary systems, this study aims to precisely characterize a sample of massive stars in eclipsing binaries to infer their properties and evolutionary state. In this paper, the sample, observed photometrically with TESS and spectroscopically with SALT HRS, CHIRON, HERMES and a spectrograph at Skalnate Pleso Observatory between 2021 and 2024, are analyzed. The orbital elements as well as the basic stellar parameters of the targets in the sample are fitted to derive the geometry of their orbits as well as their absolute parameters. The asteroseismic properties of the targets are also obtained, which unravel their core dynamics and profiles. This is a precursor work that provides detailed characterization of the targets in the sample for future theoretical modeling.</description>

      <title>The demographics of core-collapse supernovae I. The role of binary evolution and CSM interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observational properties of core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe) are shaped by the envelopes of their progenitors. In massive binary systems, mass-transfer alters the pre-SN structures compared to single stars, leading to a diversity in SN explosions. Aims. We compute the distribution of CC-SN properties based on comprehensive detailed grids of single and binary stellar evolution models. We conduct a grid-based population synthesis to produce a synthetic population of CC-SNe, and compare it to observed SN samples. We also apply various explodability and merger criteria to our models. In line with earlier results, we identify interacting SN progenitors as those stars that undergo CC during or shortly after a Roche-lobe overflow phase. With an interacting binary fraction of 68%, our models predict two-thirds of all CC-SNe to be of Type IIP/L, and 1/3 of Type Ibc, in agreement with recent volume-limited SN surveys. We find that 76% of the Type Ibc SN progenitors took part in a previous binary mass transfer (mostly as mass donor), but also 63% of the Type IIP/L SN progenitors (mostly as mass gainers), yielding a much broader envelope mass distribution than expected from single stars. We find that mass-transfer induced interacting SNe make up ~5% of all CC-SNe, which is close to the observed fractions of Type IIn and Type Ibn SNe. When assuming a disk or toroidal CSM geometry for Type IIn SNe, our models predict a bimodal distribution of the radiated energies, similar to that deduced from observations. While we find the effect of binary evolution on the relative number of Type Ibc and Type IIP/L SNe to be moderate, it leads to lower average ejecta masses in Type Ibc and Type IIb SNe, and can lead to higher pre-SN masses in Type IIP/L SNe than single stars. Binary models are also able to reproduce the number and properties of interacting SNe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-frequency resolution of the four-year $\textit{Kepler}$ time series allows detailed study of seismic modes in luminous giants. Seismic observables help infer interior structures via comparisons with stellar models. We aim to investigate differences between H-shell (Red-Giant Branch; RGB) and He-burning (red clump and Asymptotic-Giant Branch; AGB) stars in the He-II ionisation zone and the sensitivity of seismic parameters to input physics in stellar models. We used a grid of stellar models with masses $0.8-2.5M_\odot$ and metallicities $-1.0-0.25$dex, including mass loss, overshooting, thermohaline mixing, and rotation-induced mixing. P-mode frequencies were inferred by suppressing g-modes in the core. The main factors affecting seismic observables are stellar mass and metallicity. The He-II glitch amplitude in the local large frequency separation $\Delta\nu$ correlates with the He-II ionisation zone density, explaining observed differences between RGB and clump/AGB stars. That amplitude exceeds 10% of $\Delta\nu$ in high-luminosity giants, making the asymptotic expansion less accurate when $\Delta\nu \le 0.5\,\mu$Hz. Mass loss on the RGB and rotation-induced mixing from the main sequence to the early-AGB produce phase differences in the He-II glitch modulation signature between RGB and clump/AGB stars. Efficient RGB mass loss (for $M \le 1.5\,M_\odot$) and mixing processes (for $M \ge 1.5\,M_\odot$) leave detectable signatures in p-mode frequencies, enabling classification of red giants.</description>

      <title>Exploring Low-Amplitude Variability in First Overtone Cepheids with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Cepheid stars that pulsate in the first overtone radial mode often exhibit additional periodicities at the millimagnitude level. Extensive studies of the OGLE data of the Magellanic Clouds have revealed distinct groups based on their period ratio with the first overtone mode. These groups are similar to those found in overtone RR Lyrae stars. Theoretical calculations suggest that some of the observed periodicities may be consistent with non-radial modes, while others remain unexplained. Currently, we only know of a handful of examples from the Galactic Cepheid sample that exhibit low-amplitude periodicities. The purpose of this study is to undertake a systematic search for low-amplitude variability in overtone Cepheids of the Milky Way in the photometric data of the full-frame images of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which were produced with the MIT Quick Look Pipeline. We applied standard Fourier analysis and classified the additional signals according to their period ratio to the overtone pulsation period. We found 127 stars in total to exhibit additional periodicities. In 17 stars, these can be identified as a second radial overtone. A further 83 stars were observed to display periodic signals with a ratio of $P_{\mathrm{x}}/P_{1\mathrm{O}}$ in the range 0.60$-$0.65. In 15 stars, the $P_{1\mathrm{O}}/P_{\mathrm{x}}$ is found to be near $\sim$0.68, of which six are also found to be in the previous group. Furthermore, we observed the presence of low-amplitude signals in 22 stars outside the aforementioned period ratios. It is possible that some of these may be direct detections of non-radial modes, with no harmonic frequency peak in the 0.60$-$0.65 period range. The TESS measurements revealed that the amplitudes and frequencies of these signals often vary within a TESS sector, a phenomenon that challenges theoretical models.</description>

Abstract: We announce V. 2025-08-08 of the Chroma+ suite of stellar atmosphere and spectrum modelling codes for fast, approximate, effectively platform-independent stellar spectrum synthesis, written in a number of free well-supported programming languages. The Chroma+ suite now computes the emergent surface intensity and flux distributions and the hydrostatic pressure structure assuming a spherical atmosphere rather than local flatness by implementing the analytic formal solution of the 1D spherical radiative transfer equation of Chapman (1966} based on an integration factor. We present our adaptation and discretization of the solution and demonstrate the resulting impact of our sphericity treatment on a number of computed observables, including exo-planet transit light-curves. All codes are available from the OpenStars www site: www.ap.smu.ca/OpenStars.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $^{30}$P($p,\gamma)^{31}$S reaction rate in ONe novae via the weak, low-energy, $\beta$-delayed proton decay of $^{31}$Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $^{30}$P$(p,\gamma)^{31}$S reaction plays an important role in understanding nucleosynthesis of $A\geq 30$ nuclides in oxygen-neon novae. The Gaseous Detector with Germanium Tagging was used to measure $^{31}$Cl $\beta$-delayed proton decay through the key $J^{\pi}=3/2^{+}$, 260-keV resonance. The intensity $I^{260}_{\beta p} = 8.3^{+1.2}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-6}$ represents the weakest $\beta$-delayed, charged-particle emission ever measured below 400 keV, resulting in a proton branching ratio of $\Gamma_p / \Gamma = 2.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \times 10^{-4}$. By combining this measurement with shell-model calculations for $\Gamma_{\gamma}$ and past work on other resonances, the total $^{30}$P$(p,\gamma)^{31}$S rate has been determined with reduced uncertainty. The new rate has been used in hydrodynamic simulations to model the composition of nova ejecta, leading to a concrete prediction of $^{30}$Si/$^{28}$Si excesses in presolar nova grains and the calibration of nuclear thermometers.</description>

      <title>Faint supernovae and hyper-runaway white-dwarfs from single He-detonation in double HeCO-white-dwarf mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of mergers between low-mass hybrid HeCO white dwarfs (WDs), offering new insights into the diversity of thermonuclear transients. Unlike previously studied mergers involving higher-mass HeCO WDs and CO WDs, where helium detonation often triggers core ignition, our simulations reveal incomplete helium shell detonations in comparable-mass, lower-mass WD pairs. The result is a faint, rapidly evolving transient driven by the ejection of intermediate-mass elements and radioactive isotopes such as $^{48}$Cr and $^{52}$Fe, without significant $^{56}$Ni production. These transients may be detectable in upcoming wide-field surveys and could account for a subset of faint thermonuclear supernovae. Long-term evolution of the merger remnant shows that high-velocity PG-1159-type stars might be formed through this scenario, similar to normal CO-CO white dwarf mergers. This work expands our understanding of white dwarf mergers and their implications for nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>The impact of internal versus external perturbations on close-in exoplanet architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young planetary systems are subjected to different dynamical effects that can influence their orbital structure over time. In systems with more than one planet, other planets can internally influence each other, e.g. via planet-planet scattering. External perturbing effects also need to be taken into account, as stars do not form by themselves but together with other stars in young star-forming regions. This birth environment can externally affect young multi-planet systems, e.g. via fly-bys. Previous work has shown that the absence/presence and location of an outer giant planet around a close-in planet system do not change how these inner planets react to a single fly-by with another star. We further explore this by comparing the effects of these external perturbations on four close-in sub-Neptune planets to those caused by a situation where only the distant giant is perturbed by the same kind of encounter. Our results indicate that the close-in planet systems have a "preferred" end state after 500 Myr, which is reached regardless of how it was perturbed. In addition, the mass of the giant appears not to impact the reaction of the inner planet system in the scenario of an external perturbation in our tested set-ups, i.e. either a single 1 or 5 M_Jup giant placed at 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 au. However, the mass affects the subsequent evolution of the inner planets if only internal perturbations by the giant are considered. The reduction in mass leads to an absence of collisions during the 500 Myr.</description>

      <title>Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients as very massive star core-collapse events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are rare extragalactic events of unknown origin. Tidal disruptions of white dwarfs by intermediate mass black holes, mergers of black holes and Wolf-Rayet stars, and failed supernovae are among the suggestions. In this paper, we explore the viability of very massive star core-collapse events as the origin of LFBOTs. The appeal of such a model is that the formation of massive black holes via core collapse may yield observational signatures that can match the disparate lines of evidence that point towards both core-collapse and tidal disruption origins for LFBOTs. We explore the formation rate of massive black holes in population synthesis models, and compare the metallicities of their progenitors with the observed metallicities of LFBOT host galaxies. We further examine the composition, mass loss rates and fallback masses of these stars, placing them in the context of LFBOT observations. The formation rate of black holes with mass greater than ~30-40Msol is similar to the observed LFBOT rate. The stars producing these black holes are biased to low metallicity (Z&lt;0.3Zsol), are H and He-poor and have dense circumstellar media. However, some LFBOTs have host galaxies with higher metallicities than predicted, and others have denser environments (plausibly due to late mass loss not captured in the models). We find that long-lived emission from an accretion disc (as implicated in the prototypical LFBOT AT2018cow) can plausibly be produced in these events. We conclude that (very) massive star core-collapse is a plausible explanation for LFBOTs. The preferred progenitors for LFBOTs in this scenario overlap with those predicted to produce super-kilonovae. We therefore suggest that LFBOTs are promising targets to search for super-kilonovae, and that they may contribute non-negligibly to the r-process enrichment of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Encoding as a Regularizer in Binary Loss for Solar Flare Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of solar flares is typically formulated as a binary classification task, distinguishing events as either Flare (FL) or No-Flare (NF) according to a specified threshold (for example, greater than or equal to C-class, M-class, or X-class). However, this binary framework neglects the inherent ordinal relationships among the sub-classes contained within each category (FL and NF). Several studies on solar flare prediction have empirically shown that the most frequent misclassifications occur near this prediction threshold. This suggests that the models struggle to differentiate events that are similar in intensity but fall on opposite sides of the binary threshold. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a modified loss function that integrates the ordinal information among the sub-classes of the binarized flare labels into the conventional binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This approach serves as an ordinality-aware, data-driven regularization method that penalizes the incorrect predictions of flare events in close proximity to the prediction threshold more heavily than those away from the boundary during model optimization. By incorporating ordinal weighting into the loss function, we aim to enhance the model's learning process by leveraging the ordinal characteristics of the data, thereby improving its overall performance.</description>

      <title>Methanol emission tracing ice chemistry and dust evolution in the TW Hya protoplanetary disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) ice is abundant in space and is a key feedstock for seeding chemical complexity in interstellar and circumstellar environments. Despite its ubiquity, gas-phase methanol has only been detected in one disk around a Solar-type star to date, TW Hya. Here we present new high sensitivity (~1 mJy/beam) observations of TW Hya with ALMA that detect four individual transitions of gas-phase methanol spanning upper level energies from 17 to 38 K. We confirm the presence of gas-phase methanol in the luke-warm molecular layer of the disk ($35.9^{+25.9}_{-10.6}$ K) and with a disk-integrated column density of $1.8^{+1.3}_{-0.5}\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. A radially-resolved analysis suggests that the gas-phase methanol is centrally compact, peaking within the spatial extent of the mm-sized dust grains ($\lesssim 80$ au). Static gas-grain chemical disk models confirm photodesorption as an important mechanism releasing methanol into the gas phase, with the column density further boosted by the inclusion of grain-surface chemistry, reactive desorption, and an increase in dust-grain surface area assuming fractal grains. However, no model can fully reproduce the observed column density nor the radial distribution, and we suggest that the inclusion of dynamic processes such as vertical mixing and radial drift would be required to do so. Our results demonstrate that the abundance and distribution of the precursors for complex chemistry in the planet-forming regions around Solar-type stars is ultimately controlled by the interplay of grain surface chemistry coupled with the evolution of dust in their disks.</description>

      <title>A Link Between Rocky Planet Density and Host Star Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets and their host stars form from the same cloud of gas and dust, so we assume that their chemical compositions are linked. However, a clear correlation between rocky planet interior properties and host star chemistry remains elusive for planets around FGK dwarfs, and non-existent for planets around M dwarfs because cool stars frequently lack detailed chemical information. Here, we investigate the relationship between small (R$_{P}$ $\leq$ 1.8 R$_{\oplus}$) planet densities and host star elemental abundances. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper and an accompanying data-driven framework to obtain abundances for FGK and M dwarf hosts of 22 rocky planets. We find that planet densities exhibit a strong, inverse relationship to [Mg/Fe] abundances of FGK hosts (p = 0.001). This correlation becomes more significant with the addition of M dwarf hosts (p = 0.0005). If we assume that rocky planets have terrestrial-like compositions, this suggests that low [Mg/Fe] environments form planets with larger Fe-rich cores and thus higher densities. The thick disk planets in our sample help anchor this trend, illustrating the importance of sampling exoplanet properties across a range of host star populations. This finding highlights the connection between Galactic chemical evolution and rocky planet formation, and indicates that Earth-like planet compositions may vary significantly across different regions of the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>From theory to observation: understanding filamentary flows in high-mass star-forming clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we use data from multi-scale galactic MHD simulations to observe filaments and star forming clumps on 10's of pc scales and investigate flow rate relationships along, and onto filaments as well as flows towards the clumps. Using the FilFinderPPV identification technique, we identify the prominent filamentary structures in each data cube. Each filament and its corresponding clump are analysed by calculating flow rates along each filament towards the clump, onto each filament from increasing distances, and radially around each clump. This analysis is conducted for two cubes, one feedback dominated region, and one with less feedback. Looking at the face-on inclination of the simulations (0 degrees), we observe different trends depending on the environmental conditions (more or less feedback). The median flow rate in the region with more feedback is 8.9$\times$10$^{-5}$ M$_{sun}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and we see that flow rates along the filaments toward the clumps generally decrease in these regions. In the region with less feedback we have a median flow rate of 2.9$\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_{sun}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and when looking along the filaments here we see the values either increase or remain constant. We find that the flow rates from the environments onto the primary filaments are of an order of magnitude sufficient to sustain the flow rates along these filaments. When discussing the effects of galactic and filamentary inclination, we also observe that viewing the filaments from different galactic inclinations can reveal the presence of feeder structures (smaller filamentary structures aiding in the flow of material). The method used to estimate these flow rates, which has been previously applied to observational data, produced results consistent with those obtained from the simulations themselves, providing high confidence in the flow rate calculation method.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning inference of stellar properties using integrated photometric and spectroscopic data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar astrophysics relies on diverse observational modalities-primarily photometric light curves and spectroscopic data from which fundamental stellar properties are inferred. While machine learning (ML) has advanced analysis within individual modalities, the complementary information encoded across modalities remains largely underexploited. We present DESA (Dual Embedding model for Stellar Astrophysics), a novel multi-modal foundation model that integrates light curves and spectra to learn a unified, physically meaningful latent space for stars. DESA first trains separate modality-specific encoders using a hybrid supervised/self-supervised scheme, and then aligns them through DualFormer, a Transformer-based cross-modal integration module tailored for astrophysical data. DualFormer combines cross- and self-attention, a novel dual-projection alignment loss, and a projection-space eigendecomposition that yields physically structured embeddings. We demonstrate that DESA significantly outperforms leading unimodal and self-supervised baselines across a range of tasks. In zero- and few-shot settings, DESA's learned representations recover stellar color-magnitude and Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams with high fidelity ($R^2 = 0.92$ for photometric regressions). In full fine-tuning, DESA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for binary star detection (AUC = $0.99$, AP = $1.00$) and stellar age prediction (RMSE = $0.94$ Gyr). As a compelling case, DESA naturally separates synchronized binaries from young stars, two populations with nearly identical light curves, purely from their embedded positions in UMAP space, without requiring external kinematic or luminosity information. DESA thus offers a powerful new framework for multimodal, data-driven stellar population analysis, enabling both accurate prediction and novel discovery.</description>

      <title>Identification and characterization of nascent planetary nebulae with OH and H$_2$O masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars like the Sun expel their outer layers and form planetary nebulae (PNe) as they evolve into white dwarfs. PNe exhibit diverse morphologies, the origins of which are not fully understood. PNe with OH (OHPNe) and H$_{2}$O (H$_{2}$OPNe) masers are thought to be nascent PNe. However, the number of known OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe remains small, and only in eight cases the position of the maser emission has been found to coincide with the PN, using the high astrometric accuracy of interferometric observations. In order to identify more OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe, we used public databases and our own ATCA/VLA observations to match the positions of OH and H$_{2}$O masers with known PNe and radio continuum emitters, considering radio continuum emission as a possible tracer of the photoionized gas that characterizes PNe. Here we report the confirmation of positional coincidence of maser emission with one more PN, and 12 PN candidates. Moreover, we have confirmed three evolved stars as `water fountains' (WFs) hosting H$_2$O masers. These WFs are associated with radio continuum emission, but their possible nature as PNe has not yet been confirmed. Although a final characterization of maser-emitting PNe as a group still requires confirmation of more objects, their distribution in the infrared color-color diagrams suggests that they are a heterogeneous group of PNe. In particular, the new OHPN IRAS 07027$-$7934 has been reported to contain a late [WC]-type central star, while the maser emission implies an O-rich envelope. This property is found in only one other known maser-emitting PN, although we found evidence that other confirmed and candidate OHPNe may also have mixed chemistry, since they show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The new WF IRAS 18443$-$0231 shows radio continuum that is dominated by strong and variable non-thermal emission, as in magnetized outflows.</description>

      <title>Low- and high-velocity `water fountains': different evolutionary stages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: `Water fountains' (WFs) are optically obscured evolved stars, most of them thought to be in the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) phase, characterized by H$_{2}$O maser emission tracing molecular jets. Interestingly, four WFs (IRAS 15445$-$5449, IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18443$-$0231, and IRAS 18464$-$0140) and one WF candidate (IRAS 18480+0008) are potential planetary nebulae (PNe) because they exhibit radio continuum emission, suggesting the presence of a photoionized region characteristic of PNe. To classify these objects, we obtained K-band (2.0-2.3 $\mu$m) spectra of these WFs, including the only WF PN known (IRAS 15103$-$5754) for comparison. Our spectra reveal two group of sources: (i) `low-velocity' WFs with H$_2$O maser velocity spread of $\lesssim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18464$-$0140, and IRAS 18480+0008) showing the CO band at 2.29 $\mu$m in absorption, typical of cool giant stars, and no emission lines; and (ii) `high-velocity' WFs, velocity spread of $\gtrsim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 15103$-$5754, IRAS 15445$-$5449, and IRAS 18443$-$0231), exhibiting emission lines of Br$\gamma$, He I, and H$_2$, consistent with hotter central stars and/or shock-excited emission. The emission line ratios of these lines in IRAS 18443$-$0231 indicates that it may be a nascent PN. The spectrum of IRAS 15445$-$5449 also shows a CO band and Na I doublet in emission, suggesting the presence of a compact circumstellar disk and/or active mass loss. These results favor the previously suggested notion that the difference between low- and high-velocity WFs is not simply a projection effect but reflects intrinsically different evolutionary stages. Moreover, the results are also consistent with the idea of an increase in the jet ejection velocity as the post-AGB evolution proceeds.</description>

      <title>Photometric Analysis of 30 Contact Binaries in M31</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: M31, as the largest galaxy in the Local Group, is of significant importance for the study of stellar formation and evolution. Based on the data of 5,859 targets observed in M31 by Gu et al (2024), we selected 30 contact binaries by visual inspection for further study. Using the PHOEBE software and employing Bayesian optimization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, we determined the physical parameters of these 30 systems. The results show that 10 systems exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is well explained by introducing a dark spot on the primary star. 11 systems have mass ratios below 0.15, classifying them as extremely low mass ratio contact binaries, making them promising candidates for binary mergers. Six systems have primary star temperatures exceeding 10,000 K, classifying them as early-type contact binaries. The absolute physical parameters reveal that two contact binary systems contain massive stellar components, which may eventually evolve into compact binary star systems. To compare the effects of different galactic environments on the evolution of contact binaries, we constructed evolutionary diagrams for these 30 targets and for contact binaries in the Milky Way. The results show that, at the same mass, our targets have larger radii, higher luminosities, and lower orbital angular momenta than contact binaries in the Milky Way, indicating that they are at more advanced evolutionary stages. This may be attributed to the higher metallicity in M31 compared to the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Leptodermic corrections to the TOV equations and nuclear astrophysics within the effective surface approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a liquid drop at the equilibrium
  is used to extend the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations taking into account the gradient terms
  responsible for the system surface. The parameters of the Schwarzschild metric in the spherical case
  are found with these surface corrections to the known leading (zero) order of the leptodermic approximation
  $a/R&lt;&lt;1$, where $a$ is the NS effective-surface (ES) thickness, and $R$ is the effective NS radius.
  The energy density $\mathcal{E}$ is considered in a general form including the functions of the particle number
  density and of its gradient terms. The macroscopic gravitational component $\Phi(\rho)$ of the energy density
  is taken into account in the simplest form as expansion in powers of $\rho-\overline{\rho} $, where
  $\overline{\rho}$ is the saturation density, up to second order, in terms of its contributions to the
  separation particle energy and incompressibility. Density distributions $\rho$ across the NS ES in the
  normal direction to the ES, which are derived in the simple analytical form at the same leading approximation, was
  used for the derivation of the modified TOV (MTOV) equations by accounting for their NS surface corrections.
  The MTOV equations are analytically solved at first order and the results are compared with the standard
  TOV approach of the zero order.</description>

      <title>The origin of hypervelocity white dwarfs in the merger-disruption of He-CO white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs) are stellar remnants moving at speeds exceeding the Milky Way's escape velocity. The origins of the fastest HVWDs are enigmatic, with proposed formation scenarios facing challenges explaining both their extreme velocities and observed properties. Here we report a three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of a merger between two hybrid Helium-Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs (HeCO WDs with masses of 0.69 and 0.62 M$_\odot$). We find that the merger leads to a partial disruption of the secondary WD, coupled with a double-detonation explosion of the primary WD. This launches the remnant core of the secondary WD at a speed of $~2000$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with observed HVWDs. The low mass of the ejected remnant and its heating from the primary WD's ejecta explain the observed luminosities and temperatures of hot HVWDs, which are otherwise difficult to reconcile with previous models (such as the D6). This discovery establishes a new formation channel for HVWDs and points to a previously unrecognized pathway for producing peculiar Type Ia supernovae and faint explosive transients.</description>

      <title>Triples as Links between Binary Black Hole Mergers, their Electromagnetic Counterparts, and Galactic Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formation pathway linking black holes (BHs) observed in gravitational-wave (GW) mergers, wide BH-stellar systems uncovered by Gaia, and accreting low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In this scenario, a stellar-mass BH binary undergoes isolated binary evolution and merges while hosting a distant, dynamically unimportant tertiary stellar companion. The tertiary becomes relevant only after the merger, when the remnant BH receives a GW recoil kick. Depending on the kick velocity and system configuration, the outcome can be: (i) a bright electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the GW merger; (ii) an LMXB; (iii) a wide BH-stellar companion resembling the Gaia BH population; or (iv) an unbound, isolated BH. Modeling the three-body dynamics, we find that $\sim 0.02\%$ of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) mergers may be followed by an EM counterpart within $\sim$10 days, produced by tidal disruption of the star by the BH. The flare is likely brightest in the optical-UV and lasts days to weeks; in some cases, partial disruption causes recurring flares with a period of $\sim$2 months. We further estimate that this channel can produce $\sim 1-10\%$ of Gaia BH systems in the Milky Way. This scenario provides the first physically motivated link between GW sources, Gaia BHs, and some X-ray binaries, and predicts a rare but robust pathway for EM counterparts to binary BH mergers, potentially detectable in LVK's O5 run.</description>

      <title>The CCOR Compact Coronagraphs for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-19 (GOES-19) and the Space Weather Follow On (SWFO) Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CCOR Compact Coronagraph is a series of two operational solar coronagraphs sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They were designed, built, and tested by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The CCORs will be used by NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center to detect and track Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and predict the Space Weather. CCOR-1 is on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite -U (GOES-U, now GOES-19/GOES-East). GOES-U was launched from Kennedy Space Flight Center, Florida, on 25 June 2024. CCOR-2 is on board the Space Weather Follow On at Lagrange point 1 (SWFO-L1). SWFO-L1 is scheduled to launch in the fall of 2025. SWFO will be renamed SOLAR-1 once it reaches L1. The CCORs are white-light coronagraphs that have a field of view and performance similar to the SOHO LASCO C3 coronagraph. CCOR-1 FOV spans from 4 to 22 Rsun, while CCOR-2 spans from 3.5 to 26 Rsun. The spatial resolution is 39 arcsec for CCOR-1 and 65 arcsec for CCOR-2. They both operate in a band-pass of 470 - 740 nm. The synoptic cadence is 15 min and the latency from image capture to the forecaster on the ground is less than 30 min. Compared to past generation coronagraphs such as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO), CCOR uses a compact design; all the solar occultation is done with a single multi-disk external occulter. No internal occulter is used. This allowed a substantial reduction in size and mass compared to SECCHI COR-2, for example, but with slightly lower signal-to-noise ratio. In this article, we review the science that the CCORs will capitalize on for the purpose of operational space weather prediction. We give a description of the driving requirements and accommodations, and provide details on the instrument design. In the end, information on ground processing and data levels is provided.</description>
