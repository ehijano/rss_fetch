      <title>What Does Information Science Offer for Data Science Research?: A Review of Data and Information Ethics Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews literature pertaining to the development of data science as a discipline, current issues with data bias and ethics, and the role that the discipline of information science may play in addressing these concerns. Information science research and researchers have much to offer for data science, owing to their background as transdisciplinary scholars who apply human-centered and social-behavioral perspectives to issues within natural science disciplines. Information science researchers have already contributed to a humanistic approach to data ethics within the literature and an emphasis on data science within information schools all but ensures that this literature will continue to grow in coming decades. This review article serves as a reference for the history, current progress, and potential future directions of data ethics research within the corpus of information science literature.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Graphs for Digitized Manuscripts in Jagiellonian Digital Library Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digitizing cultural heritage collections has become crucial for preservation of historical artifacts and enhancing their availability to the wider public. Galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM institutions) are actively digitizing their holdings and creates extensive digital collections. Those collections are often enriched with metadata describing items but not exactly their contents. The Jagiellonian Digital Library, standing as a good example of such an effort, offers datasets accessible through protocols like OAI-PMH. Despite these improvements, metadata completeness and standardization continue to pose substantial obstacles, limiting the searchability and potential connections between collections. To deal with these challenges, we explore an integrated methodology of computer vision (CV), artificial intelligence (AI), and semantic web technologies to enrich metadata and construct knowledge graphs for digitized manuscripts and incunabula.</description>

      <title>Comparing Retrieval Strategies to Capture Interdisciplinary Scientific Research: A Bibliometric Evaluation of the Integration of Neuroscience and Computer Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary scientific research is increasingly important in knowledge production, funding policies, and academic discussions on scholarly communication. While many studies focus on interdisciplinary corpora defined a priori - usually through keyword-based searches within assumed interdisciplinary domains - few explore interdisciplinarity as an emergent intersection between two distinct fields. Thus, methodological proposals for building databases at the intersection of two fields of knowledge are scarce. The goal of this article is to develop and compare different strategies for defining an interdisciplinary corpus between two bodies of knowledge. As a case study, we focus on the intersection between neuroscience and computer science. To this end, we develop and compare four retrieval strategies, two of them based on keywords and two based on citation and reference patterns. Our results show that keyword-based strategies provide both better precision and recall. While we focus on comparing strategies for the study of the intersection between the fields of neuroscience and computer science, this proposed methodological reflection is applicable to a wide range of interdisciplinary domains.</description>

      <title>Human-In-The-Loop Workflow for Neuro- Symbolic Scholarly Knowledge Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the volume of scientific literature continues to grow, efficient knowledge organization is an increasingly challenging task. Traditional structuring of scientific content is time-consuming and requires significant domain expertise, increasing the need for tool support. Our goal is to create a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflow that supports researchers in creating and structuring scientific knowledge, leveraging neural models and knowledge graphs, exemplified using the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). The workflow aims to automate key steps, including data extraction and knowledge structuring, while keeping user oversight through human validation. We developed a modular framework implementing the workflow and evaluated it along the Quality Improvement Paradigm (QIP) with participants from the ORKG user community. The evaluation indicated that the framework is highly usable and provides practical support. It significantly reduces the time and effort required to transition from a research interest to literature-based answers by streamlining the import of information into a knowledge graph. Participants evaluated the framework with an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 84.17, an A+ -- the highest achievable rating. They also reported that it improved their time spent, previously between 4 hours and two weeks, down to an average of 24:40 minutes. The tool streamlines the creation of scientific corpora and extraction of structured knowledge for KG integration by leveraging LLMs and user-defined models, significantly accelerating the review process. However, human validation remains essential throughout the extraction process, and future work is needed to improve extraction accuracy and entity linking to existing knowledge resources.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Automatic PT Tagging for MEDLINE Citations Using Transformer-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the feasibility of predicting Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Publication Types (PTs) from MEDLINE citation metadata using pre-trained Transformer-based models BERT and DistilBERT. This study addresses limitations in the current automated indexing process, which relies on legacy NLP algorithms. We evaluated monolithic multi-label classifiers and binary classifier ensembles to enhance the retrieval of biomedical literature. Results demonstrate the potential of Transformer models to significantly improve PT tagging accuracy, paving the way for scalable, efficient biomedical indexing.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing True Influence from Hyperprolificity with Citation Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately evaluating scholarly influence is essential for fair academic assessment, yet traditional bibliometric indicators - dominated by publication and citation counts - often favor hyperprolific authors over those with deeper, long-term impact. We propose the x-index, a novel citation-based metric that conceptualizes citation as a process of knowledge diffusion and incorporates citation distance to reflect the structural reach of scholarly work. By weighting citations according to the collaborative proximity between citing and cited authors, the x-index captures both the depth and breadth of influence within evolving academic networks. Empirical analyses show that the x-index significantly improves the rankings of Turing Award recipients while reducing those of hyperprolific authors, better aligning rankings with recognized academic merit. It also demonstrates superior discriminatory power among early-career researchers and reveals stronger sensitivity to institutional research quality. These results suggest that the x-index offers a more equitable and forward-looking alternative to existing metrics, with practical applications in talent identification, funding decisions, and academic recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Preface to the Special Issue of the TAL Journal on Scholarly Document Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of scholarly literature makes it increasingly difficult for researchers to keep up with new knowledge. Automated tools are now more essential than ever to help navigate and interpret this vast body of information. Scientific papers pose unique difficulties, with their complex language, specialized terminology, and diverse formats, requiring advanced methods to extract reliable and actionable insights. Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities, enabling tasks such as literature reviews, writing assistance, and interactive exploration of research. This special issue of the TAL journal highlights research addressing these challenges and, more broadly, research on natural language processing and information retrieval for scholarly and scientific documents.</description>

      <title>Introducing multiverse analysis to bibliometrics: The case of team size effects on disruptive research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although bibliometrics has become an essential tool in the evaluation of research performance, bibliometric analyses are sensitive to a range of methodological choices. Subtle choices in data selection, indicator construction, and modeling decisions can substantially alter results. Ensuring robustness, meaning that findings hold up under different reasonable scenarios, is therefore critical for credible research and research evaluation. To address this issue, this study introduces multiverse analysis to bibliometrics. Multiverse analysis is a statistical tool that enables analysts to transparently discuss modeling assumptions and thoroughly assess model robustness. Whereas standard robustness checks usually cover only a small subset of all plausible models, multiverse analysis includes all plausible models. We illustrate the benefits of multiverse analysis by testing the hypothesis posed by Wu et al. (2019) that small teams produce more disruptive research than large teams. While we found robust evidence of a negative effect of team size on disruption scores, the effect size is so small that its practical relevance seems questionable. Our findings underscore the importance of assessing the multiverse robustness of bibliometric results to clarify their practical implications.</description>

      <title>International collaboration of Ukrainian scholars: Effects of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the effects of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on the international collaboration of Ukrainian scholars. First and foremost, Ukrainian scholars deserve respect for continuing to publish despite life-threatening conditions, mental strain, shelling and blackouts. In 2022-2023, universities gained more from international collaboration than the NASU. The percentage of internationally co-authored articles remained unchanged for the NASU, while it increased for universities. In 2023, 40.8% of articles published by the NASU and 32,2% of articles published by universities were internationally co-authored. However, these figures are still much lower than in developed countries (60-70%). The citation impact of internationally co-authored articles remained statistically unchanged for the NASU but increased for universities. The highest share of internationally co-authored articles published by the NASU in both periods was in the physical sciences and engineering. However, the citation impact of these articles declined in 2022-2023, nearly erasing their previous citation advantage over university publications. Universities consistently outperformed the NASU in the citation impact of internationally co-authored articles in biomedical and health sciences across both periods. International collaboration can help Ukrainian scholars to go through this difficult time. In turn, they can contribute to the strengthening of Europe.</description>
