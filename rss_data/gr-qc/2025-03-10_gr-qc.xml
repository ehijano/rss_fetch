      <title>Impact of Perfect Fluid Dark Matter on the Thermodynamics of $AdS$ Ay\'{o}n--Beato--Garc\'{i}a Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the black hole solution in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) coupled to a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) field. The resulting black hole solution interpolates between the $AdS$ Ay\'{o}n--Beato--Garc\'{i}a (ABG) black hole in the absence of the PFDM field and the Schwarzschild black hole devoid of magnetic monopole charges and PFDM influence. A numerical investigation of the horizon structure and thermodynamic properties, including both local and global stability, is conducted for the obtained black hole solution. The thermodynamic quantities are shown to be modified by the presence of the NLED and PFDM fields. We observe that the behaviour of thermodynamical quantities of black holes depends on these parameters significantly. We also discuss the stability and phase transition dependency on these parameters.</description>

      <title>Accumulation of Charge on an Extremal Black Hole's Event Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically analyze the behavior of a charged scalar field on a fixed extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om background. We find an extension of the Aretakis instability characterized by an accumulation of charge on the extremal event horizon. In particular, when the charge coupling to the scalar field is sufficiently large, the charge density on the horizon asymptotes to a nonzero constant at late times. By constructing monochromatic initial data at the onset of charged superradiance, we give evidence supporting the claim that this instability is connected to the presence of a nearly zero-damped mode. Throughout this work, we employ a numerical integration scheme in compactified double-null coordinates, which allows us to capture the asymptotic behavior of the matter at the boundaries of the spacetime.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark-sector effects using gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations are a powerful tool to constrain fundamental physics. This work considers dark matter that carries charge under a dark abelian massive vector field. If such dark matter is bound inside coalescing neutron stars, the presence of the new force will modify the total energy of the binary, and the emission of dark radiation modes will impact the rate of inspiral. At leading order, the dark matter corrections introduce a Yukawa term to the potential energy and a dipole radiation mode. We calculate modifications to the binary inspiral waveform to first post-Newtonian order, incorporate these corrections into a state-of-the-art waveform model for neutron star binaries, and use this model in a Bayesian parameter estimation analysis on real data collected by current, second-generation ground-based detectors. Through this study, we place the first robust constraints on the Yukawa interaction strength and dipole emission parameter. We find that the strongest constraints are obtained from analysis of the GW170817 event, for which the Yukawa interaction strength is constrained to be less than $O(10^{-2})$ and the dipole emission parameter is less than $O(10^{-4})$ at 90% credibility.</description>

      <title>Cumulative effects of laser-generated gravitational shock waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emission of light pulses is expected to generate gravitational waves, opening the possibility of controlling gravity in an Earthed laboratory. However, measuring the optically-driven spacetime deformations is challenging due to the inherently weak interaction. We explore the possibility to achieve a detectable gravitational effect from light emission by examining the cumulative effect of a sequence of laser-generated gravitational shock waves on a test particle. We derive an exact solution to the Einstein equations for cylindrically-shaped optical beams with constant energy density, imposing continuity condition for the metric and its first-order derivatives. Our analysis reveals that laser-induced gravitational fields cause a spatial shift in the test particle, which is measurable within current interferometric technology.</description>

      <title>Restricted Gravity: Lagrangian Formalism and Explicit Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that, making the Abelian projection of Einstein's theory one can obtain the restricted gravity which is simpler than Einstein's theory but describes the core dynamics of Einstein's gravity. In this paper we present the Lagrangian formalism of the restricted gravity which makes the restricted gravity a self consistent field theory by itself, independent of Einstein's theory. With this we present interesting solutions of the restricted gravity, in particular the gravitational cosmic string, the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime, the axisymmetric pp-wave, and the conformally flat waves with flat wavefront. Moreover, we show that in the restricted gravity the Rosen-Bondi gravitational plane wave could be described by two spin-one Maxwellian potentials. This could play important role in quantum gravity. We discuss the physical implications of the restricted gravity.</description>

      <title>Renormalized Quantum Stress-Energy Tensor of a Nonzero Radius Cosmic String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the effects of quantum fluctuations of a scalar field in the "ballpoint pen" cosmic string geometry. Using the approach to renormalization established previously for the energy density in two space dimensions, we extend those calculations to $3+1$ dimensions, nonzero scalar mass, and the full stress-energy tensor, including its contribution to the null energy condition for radial geodesics. The calculation demonstrates in detail the process of renormalization in curved spacetime, including the effects of the conformal anomaly. This calculation provides one of the few examples where quantum effects in curved spacetime can be explicitly calculated.</description>

      <title>Impact of eccentricity and mean anomaly in numerical relativity mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modelling of black hole binaries is critical to achieve the science goals of gravitational-wave detectors. Modelling such configurations relies strongly on calibration to numerical-relativity (NR) simulations. Binaries on quasi-circular orbits have been widely explored in NR, however, coverage of the broader 9-dimensional parameter space, including orbital eccentricity, remains sparse. This article develops a new procedure to control orbital eccentricity of binary black hole simulations that enables choosing initial data parameters with precise control over eccentricity and mean anomaly of the subsequent evolution, as well as the coalescence time. We then calculate several sequences of NR simulations that nearly uniformly cover the 2-dimensional eccentricity--mean anomaly space for equal mass, non-spinning binary black holes. We demonstrate that, for fixed eccentricity, many quantities related to the merger dynamics of binary black holes show an oscillatory dependence on mean anomaly. The amplitude of these oscillations scales nearly linearly with the eccentricity of the system. We find that for the eccentricities explored in this work, deviations in various quantities such as the merger amplitude and peak luminosity can approach $\sim5\%$ of their quasi-circular value. We use our findings to explain eccentric phenomena reported in other studies. We also show that methods for estimating the remnant mass employed in the effective-one-body approach exhibit similar deviations, roughly matching the amplitude of the oscillations we find in NR simulations. This work is an important step towards a complete description of eccentric binary black hole mergers, and demonstrates the importance of considering the entire 2-dimensional parameter subspace related to eccentricity.</description>

      <title>A novel Lagrange-multiplier approach to the effective-one-body dynamics of binary systems in post-Minkowskian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to the conservative dynamics of binary systems, within the effective one-body (EOB) framework, based on the use of a Lagrange multiplier to impose the mass-shell constraint. When applied to the post-Minkowskian (PM) description of the two-body problem in Einsteinian gravity, this Lagrange-EOB (LEOB) approach allows for a new formulation of the conservative dynamics that avoids the drawbacks of the recursive definition of EOB-PM Hamiltonians. Using state-of-the-art values of the waveform and radiation reaction, based on factorized and resummed post-Newtonian (PN) expressions, we apply our new formalism to the construction of an aligned-spin, quasi-circular, inspiralling EOB waveform model, called LEOB-PM, that incorporates analytical information up to the 4PM level, completed by 4PN contributions up to the sixth order in eccentricity, in the orbital sector, and by 4.5PN contributions, in the spin-orbit sector. In the nonspinning case, we find, for the first time, that an uncalibrated LEOB-PM model delivers EOB/NR unfaithfulness (with the Advanced LIGO noise in the total mass range $10-200M_\odot$) of at most $1\%$ over all the nonspinning dataset of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) Numerical Relativity (NR) catalog up to mass ratio $q=15$, also yielding excellent phasing agreement with the $q=32$ configuration of the RIT catalog. When NR-informing the dynamics of the model (both orbital and spinning sectors) by using only 17 SXS dataset, we find that the EOB/NR unfaithfulness (compared to 530 spin-aligned SXS waveforms) has a median value of $5.39\times 10^{-4}$ reaching at most $\sim 1\%$ in some of the high-spin corners. Our finding shows that the LEOB approach is a promising route towards robustly incorporating both PM and PN information in the EOB description of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Search for primordial black holes from gravitational wave populations using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) signals detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration might be sourced (partly) by the merges of primordial black holes (PBHs). The conventional hierarchical Bayesian inference methods can allow us to study population properties of GW events to search for the hints for PBHs. However, hierarchical Bayesian analysis require an analytic population model, and becomes increasingly computationally expensive as the number of sources grows. In this paper, we present a novel population analysis method based on deep learning, which enables the direct and efficient estimation of PBH population hyperparameters, such as the PBH fraction in dark matter, $f_{\rm PBH}$. Our approach leverages neural posterior estimation combined with conditional normalizing flows and two embedding networks. Our results demonstrate that inference can be performed within seconds, highlighting the promise of deep learning as a powerful tool for population inference with an increasing number of GW signals for next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Inverting no-hair theorems: How requiring General Relativity solutions restricts scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole solutions in general scalar-tensor theories are known to permit hair, i.e. non-trivial scalar profiles and/or metric solutions different from the ones of General Relativity (GR). Imposing that some such solutions$\unicode{x2013}$e.g. Schwarzschild or de Sitter solutions motivated in the context of black hole physics or cosmology$\unicode{x2013}$should exist, the space of scalar-tensor theories is strongly restricted. Here we investigate precisely what these restrictions are within general quadratic/cubic higher-order scalar-tensor theories for stealth solutions, whose metric is given by that in GR, supporting time-dependent scalar hair with a constant kinetic term. We derive, in a fully covariant approach, the conditions under which the Euler-Lagrange equations admit all (or a specific set of) exact GR solutions, as the first step toward our understanding of a wider class of theories that admit approximately stealth solutions. Focusing on static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes, we study the dynamics of linear odd-parity perturbations and discuss possible deviations from GR. Importantly, we find that requiring the existence of all stealth solutions prevents any deviations from GR in the odd-parity sector. In less restrictive scenarios, in particular for theories only requiring the existence of Schwarzschild(-de Sitter) black holes, we identify allowed deviations from GR, derive the stability conditions for the odd modes, and investigate the generic deviation of a non-trivial speed of gravitational waves. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via companion $\texttt {Mathematica}$ notebooks.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Coupled Scalar Dark Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled dark sector models have gained significant attention, motivated by recent advances in cosmology and the pressing need to address unresolved puzzles. In this work, we study coupled scalar dark sector models inspired by ultraviolet-complete frameworks such as supergravity and string theory. These models involve scalar couplings arising either from their kinetic terms, through a non-trivial field space metric, or from their scalar potential. We demonstrate how these couplings can be elegantly formulated in terms of an interacting vector, a standard tool in coupled dark sector studies, and analyse their distinct cosmological effects using a dynamical systems approach. Using this framework, we further investigate an axio-dilaton system recently explored in the literature, where the dilaton also couples to baryons. Intriguingly, we show that certain kinetic and potential interactions may mimic one another or even cancel out, making them observationally indistinguishable. If such a distinction becomes possible through observational constraints, it could provide valuable insights into the underlying field space metric and its connection to fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals in Active Galactic Nucleus Disks: The Role of Circumsingle Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we numerically explore the dynamics of a point mass (e.g., a stellar-mass black hole) moving within a thin accretion disk of a massive object (i.e., a supermassive black hole) with three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations using \texttt{Athena++}. We are particularly interested in the regime that the Hill radius of the point mass is greater than the disk thickness, but the point mass is not sufficiently massive to open a ``gap" in a high viscosity disk. This parameter regime may be seen for stellar-mass objects moving within thin accretion disks of massive black holes, but less studied for the planet migration scenario in protoplanetary disks. We find that the disk migration may be significantly slower than the type I migration, depending on the surface density gradient of the disk. Furthermore, the circumsingle disk around the point mass plays an important role in damping the orbital eccentricity. If the gravitational interaction between the point mass and circumsingle disk material is turned off, the orbital eccentricity may be pumped to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ level. Because space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is able to measure the eccentricity of extreme mass-ratio inspirals to the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$, this finding highlights the importance of understanding stellar-mass black hole feedback mechanisms which will modify the structures of the circumsingle disk, as they will impact LISA observables such as the eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Modular Fluctuations in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verlinde and Zurek (VZ) have proposed that quantum gravity fluctuations in causal diamonds lead to observable effects. In particular, they argued that in quantum gravity causal diamonds have an uncertainty in their size that scales as $\delta L \sim \sqrt{\ell_p L}$, i.e. fluctuations are enhanced from the Planck scale. In this work, we explore the origin of the VZ scaling by studying scalar perturbations in inflationary cosmology. We reinterpret these cosmological perturbations as fluctuations of the modular Hamiltonian associated with a causal diamond, establishing a connection between modular fluctuations and observable primordial perturbations. Independent of assumptions about the modular Hamiltonian or the background spacetime, our results show that -- whenever an (effective) spherically symmetric perturbation is quantized -- it leads to the VZ scaling. However, whether such a mode exists in the vacuum of any theory of quantum gravity remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Massive Double White Dwarf Binary Mergers from the Moon: Extending the Reach of Multi-messenger Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of lunar-based gravitational-wave detectors to broaden the multi-messenger astrophysics landscape by detecting mergers of massive ($\gtrsim 1~M_{\odot}$) double white dwarf (WD) binaries. These systems are potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae and could serve as independent probes of cosmic expansion. We examine two proposed lunar gravitational-wave detector concepts operating in the sub-hertz band (0.1-1 Hz): the Gravitational-Wave Lunar Observatory for Cosmology (a proxy for suspended test mass detectors) and the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (a proxy for seismic array detectors). Using both contact and Roche lobe overflow merger scenarios, we estimate that these detectors could reach distances of up to ~1 Gpc for the most massive mergers. We show that lunar detectors could observe up to dozens of massive WD mergers annually, including those originating from globular clusters. Lunar detectors would constrain the masses of these WDs with an unprecedented accuracy of one part in a million. Furthermore, these detectors would provide early warnings of weeks before merger, including sky-localization of square arcminute resolution, enabling a new era of coordinated multi-messenger follow-up of electromagnetic transients-whether they evolve into Type Ia supernovae or accretion-induced collapse events.</description>

Abstract: Brown and Maclay \cite{Brown} found the energy-momentum tensor for the Casimir effect of parallel plates in 1969. We find its curved spacetime version in a static background using the point splitting regularization method. Previous results in the literature are reinforced and some consequences discussed.</description>

      <title>Bridging between reheating and late-time observations in quintessential inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an idea to build a bridge between reheating and late-time observations in quintessential inflation by backtracking the evolution of the inflaton field from the present time to the end of reheating. This idea is implemented when the potential gradient is negligible compared to the Hubble friction, rendering the inflaton field frozen, till the present time. We find a simple analytic relation between the reheating temperature and the observational parameters for dark energy, and numerically confirm its validity for typical models of quintessential inflation. This relation is universal and can apply to all quintessential inflation models with any reheating mechanism. It also implies that any quintessential inflation model with a successful reheating with the reheating temperature $1\textrm{MeV}\lesssim T_\textrm{re}\lesssim 10^{15}\textrm{GeV}$ predicts the equation of state of dark energy today extremely close to $-1$, i.e. $-1+10^{-60}\lesssim w_0\lesssim -1+10^{-24}$, unless the inflaton field unfreezes before the present time.</description>

      <title>The growth of linear perturbations in the interacting dark energy models and observational constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of interaction between dark matter and dark energy on the growth rate $f$ of matter density perturbations within the framework of an interacting $w$CDM model. The coupling term is assumed to be proportional to the dark energy density, and the growth rate $f$ is parameterized using the form $\Omega_{\rm m}^\gamma$. By considering the effect of this interaction on the growth index $\gamma$ and assuming that $\gamma$ varies with redshift $z$, we derive the $\gamma$ up to its second-order approximation. Our analysis demonstrates that the parameterized form $\Omega_{\rm m}^\gamma$ closely approximates the actual growth rate $f$. We utilize this parameterized form, along with the astronomic observations from Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Microwave Background, Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and the growth rate data from theredshift space distortion (RSD) measurement, to make constraints on the free parameters of the interacting $w$CDM model. Our findings indicate that incorporating RSD measurement data into cosmic background observations can significantly tighten the constraints on the coupling constant, suggesting a preference for a weak interaction between dark matter and dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a new 2+1 theory of gravity. We start with a modification of Chern-Simons 2+1 gravity. By introducing a vector field $\Phi$ to the usual composition of the vierbein and connection, we derive a new action that includes the Einstein-Hilbert term, a cosmological constant and a polynomial term for the vector field. This allows us to write a Chern-Simons inspired Massive Gravity. After solving the polynomial function, the action can be rewritten as a Born-Infeld type action. Moreover, we show that the second order expansion of this action is equivalent to New Massive Gravity. We explore solutions to the theory and show that it has a BTZ solution with an effective cosmological constant in terms of the parameters of the theory, global Lifshitz space-times as well as regular Lifshitz black holes, and asymptotically flat black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we discuss an influence of an external weak gravitational field on the gravitational self-decoherence effect with help of the stochastic extension of regularized Shr\"odinger-Newton equation in a curved background. We derive the master equation and demonstrate that it leads to the experimentally verifiable conclusions about applicability of the classical description of the weak gravitation field. Namely, a presence of oscillating terms in the otherwise purely exponential decay of the coherence would indicate classicality of gravity for the case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the statistics of peaks of non-Gaussian random fields and implement it to study the sphericity of peaks. For non-Gaussianity of the local type, we present a general formalism valid regardless of how large the deviation from Gaussian statistics is. For general types of non-Gaussianity, we provide a framework that applies to any system with a given power spectrum and the corresponding bispectrum in the regime in which contributions from higher-order correlators can be neglected. We present an explicit expression for the most probable values of the sphericity parameters, including the effect of non-Gaussianity on the profile. We show that the effects of small perturbative non-Gaussianity on the sphericity parameters are negligible, as they are even smaller than the subleading Gaussian corrections. In contrast, we find that large non-Gaussianity can significantly distort the peak configurations, making them much less spherical.</description>

      <title>Topological modes, non-locality and the double copy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double copy connects scattering amplitudes and other objects in gauge and gravity theories. Open conceptual issues include whether non-local information in gravity theories can be generated from the double copy, and how the double copy should be practically implemented in unseen cases. In this paper, we consider topological theories (with and without mass) in 2+1 dimensions, and argue that this makes a useful playground for exploring non-locality. In particular, topological modes of the gauge field arise, themselves associated with non-trivial global behaviour, and it is not clear {\it a priori} how to double copy them. We settle this issue, and clarify the role of BCJ shifts in modifying how topological modes contribute. We show how our conclusions apply to four- and five-point scattering amplitudes in topological gauge / gravity theories, as a by-product obtaining greatly simplified analytic expressions for the four-point amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Determinism and Asymmetry in General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the question of which collections of general relativistic spacetimes are deterministic relative to which definitions. We begin by considering a series of three definitions of increasing strength due to Belot (1995). The strongest of these definitions is particularly interesting for spacetime theories because it involves an asymmetry condition called ``rigidity'' that has been studied previously in a different context (Geroch 1969; Halvorson and Manchak 2022; Dewar 2024). We go on to explore other (stronger) asymmetry conditions that give rise to other (stronger) forms of determinism. We introduce a number of definitions of this type and clarify the relationships between them and the three considered by Belot. We go on to show that there are collections of general relativistic spacetimes that satisfy much stronger forms of determinism than previously known. We also highlight a number of open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectroscopic study of black hole quasinormal modes in gravitational-wave ringdown observations is hindered by our ignorance of which modes should dominate astrophysical signals for different binary configurations, limiting tests of general relativity and astrophysics. In this work, we present a description of the quasinormal modes that are excited in the ringdowns of comparable mass, quasi-circular precessing binary black hole coalescences -- a key region of parameter space that has yet to be fully explored within the framework of black hole spectroscopy. We suggest that the remnant perturbation for precessing and non-precessing systems is approximately the same up to a rotation, which implies that the relative amplitudes of the quasinormal modes in both systems are also related by a rotation. We present evidence for this by analyzing an extensive catalog of numerical relativity simulations. Additional structure in the amplitudes is connected to the system's kick velocity and other asymmetries in the orbital dynamics. We find that the ringdowns of precessing systems need not be dominated by the ${(\ell,m)=(2,\pm 2)}$ quasinormal modes, and that instead the $(2,\pm 1)$~or~$(2,0)$ quasinormal modes can dominate. Our results are consistent with a ringdown analysis of the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave signal GW190521, and may also help in understanding phenomenological inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model systematics.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Tests of Gravitational Quantum Field Theory with Spin and Scaling Gauge Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A self-consistent gravitational quantum field theory, with gravitational force treated on the same footing as the other three fundamental interactions, was established recently. The gravidynamics predicted by such a theory could lead to important implications, and the comparisons with experimental results may provide us opportunities to test such new approach of gravity based on the framework of the quantum field theory of gauge interactions. In this work, we start with the effective field equation of the gravitational quantum field theory, and then solve the perturbative gravigauge field order by order up to the 1st post-Newtonian level under the assumption of a simplified energy-momentum tensor of perfect fluids. Having the constraints on the related post-Newtonian parameters from the most up-to-date observational data, the new bound on the combined coupling in the gravitational quantum field theory $|\gamma_G(\alpha_G-\alpha_W/2)|\leq (2.4\pm30)\times10^{-6} $ is obtained. Under such bound, we found that the new gravitational quantum field theory successfully passed and found no conflict with the contemporary keynote Solar system experiments of gravity.</description>

      <title>Tracking the nonlinear formation of an interfacial wave spectral cascade from one to few to many</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hallmark of far-from-equilibrium systems is the emergence of a spectral cascade, where energy is transferred across length-scales following a simple power law. The universal nature of this phenomenon has led to advances in a range of disciplines, including climate forecasting, foreign exchange trading, and the modelling of neurological activity. For many diverse far-from-equilibrium scenarios, the scaling laws of steady states have been successfully predicted by the statistical theory of weak wave turbulence, originally developed by considering the leading order interactions between waves on a fluid surface. However, the predictive power of weak wave turbulence breaks down in the presence of large amplitudes, high dissipation, and finite-size effects. We offer new insight into these regimes by experimentally tracking the formation of a spectral cascade under these conditions in an externally driven fluid-fluid interface. We resolve individual wave modes and observe their time evolution from one to few to many, a process culminating in a steady state with a spectral density characterised by a power-law scaling. Our findings confirm that interfacial dynamics can be effectively modelled by a weakly nonlinear Lagrangian theory, a predictive framework encompassing both underlying wave interaction and emergent behaviours of the system. Such nonlinear interactions are experimentally quantified through statistical correlations, revealing a hierarchy in wave-mixing order that confirms a key assumption of weak wave turbulence. The Lagrangian formulation further aids our time-evolution analysis; specific interactions are tracked through time, and we predict the timescale until a cascade emerges. Our findings are transferable to other far-from-equilibrium systems, which we demonstrate by providing a mapping to reheating scenarios following cosmic inflation in the early Universe.</description>

Abstract: Cartan $F(R)$ gravity introduces the equivalent scalar-tensor theory by extending the gravity sector. From the solution of the modified Cartan equation leads to the interaction with the scalar field and the fermion. We derived the effective potential of the scalar field using the auxiliary field method, which is commonly used in studies of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. Using this effective potential we investigated the mass-radius relation of neutron star to solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. By the numerical computation, we found that the contribution of the scalar field increases the mass of a neutron star. This could give theoretical plausibility to the current observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we exhaustively investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a probe scalar field over a d-dimensional regular black hole (BH) characterized by the parameter A. The quasinormal frequencies (QNFs) exhibit different behaviors with respect to the parameter A for d = 4 and d &gt; 4. Firstly, the trends of QNFs with respect to A exhibit completely opposite patterns for the case of d = 4 and d &gt; 4. Secondly, in the 4-dimensional regular BH, a non-monotonic behavior with respect to A is observed in the imaginary part of the fundamental modes with vanishing angular quantum number. In contrast, this non-monotonic behavior only appears in the overtones when d &gt; 4. Thirdly, an overtone outburst accompanied by an oscillatory patter is observed only in the case of d &gt; 4, but not in d = 4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11525v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate electromagnetic and gravitational radiation generated during the process of the tidal stripping of a white dwarf star circulating a black hole. We go beyond Chandrasekhar's ideas and not only consider a white dwarf itself as a quantum object, but also describe the dynamics of a produced accretion disk in a quantum way. We model the white dwarf star as a Bose-Fermi droplet and use the quantum hydrodynamic equations to simulate the evolution of the black hole-white dwarf binary system. While going through the periastron, the white dwarf loses a small fraction of its mass. The mass falling onto a black hole is a source of powerful electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. Bursts of ultraluminous radiation are flared at each periastron passage. This resembles the recurrent flaring of X-ray sources discovered recently by Irwin et al. Gravitational energy bursts occur mainly through emission at very low frequencies. The accretion disk, formed due to stripping of the white dwarf, starts at some point to contribute continuously to radiation of both electromagnetic and gravitational types.</description>

      <title>Bayesian framework to infer the Hubble constant from the cross-correlation of individual gravitational wave events with galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from the inspiral of binary compact objects offer a one-step measurement of the luminosity distance to the event, which is essential for the measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, which characterizes the expansion rate of the Universe. However, unlike binary neutron stars, the inspiral of binary black holes is not expected to be accompanied by electromagnetic radiation and a subsequent determination of its redshift. Consequently, independent redshift measurements of such GW events are necessary to measure $H_0$. In this study, we present a novel Bayesian approach to infer $H_0$ by measuring the overdensity of galaxies around individual binary black hole merger events in configuration space. We model the measured overdensity using the $3$D cross-correlation between galaxies and GW events, explicitly accounting for the GW event localization uncertainty. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with $250$ simulated GW events distributed within $1$ Gpc in colored Gaussian noise of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors operating at O4 sensitivity. We show that such measurements can constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of $\lesssim 8 \%$ ($90\%$ highest density interval). We highlight the potential improvements that need to be accounted for in further studies before the method can be applied to real data.</description>

Abstract: While pulsar timing array experiments have recently found evidence for the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, its origin is still unclear. If this background is of astrophysical origin, we expect the distribution of GW sources to follow the one of galaxies. Since galaxies are not perfectly isotropically distributed at large scales, but follow the cosmological large-scale structure, this would lead to an intrinsic anisotropy in the distribution of GW sources. In this work, we develop a formalism to account for this anisotropy, by considering a Gaussian ensemble of sources in each realization of the universe and then taking ensemble averages over all such realizations. We find that large-scale galaxy clustering has no impact on the expectation value of pulsar timing residual correlations, described by the Hellings-Downs curve. However, it introduces a new contribution to the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation. Hence, the anisotropic distribution of sources contributes to the amount by which the measurements of pulsar timing residual correlations, in our single realization of the universe, may differ from the Hellings-Downs curve.</description>

      <title>Gravitational charge production</title>

Abstract: Wash-in leptogenesis is an attractive mechanism to produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. It treats right-handed-neutrino interactions as spectator processes, on the same footing as electroweak sphalerons, that reprocess primordial charge asymmetries in the thermal plasma into a baryon-minus-lepton asymmetry. The origin of these primordial charges must be accounted for by new $CP$-violating dynamics at very high energies. In this paper, we propose such a scenario of chargegenesis that, unlike earlier proposals, primarily relies on new interactions in the gravitational sector. We point out that a coupling of a conserved current to the divergence of the Ricci scalar during reheating can lead to nonzero effective chemical potentials in the plasma that, together with a suitable charge-violating interaction, can result in the production of a primordial charge asymmetry. Gravitational chargegenesis represents a substantial generalization of the idea of gravitational baryogenesis. We provide a detailed analysis of a generic and minimal realization that is consistent with inflation and show that it can successfully explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation and non-perturbative power spectrum beyond slow roll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic inflation, together with the $\Delta N$ formalism, provides a powerful tool for estimating the large-scale behaviour of primordial fluctuations. In this work, we develop a numerical code to capture the non-perturbative statistics of these fluctuations and validate it to obtain the exponential non-Gaussian tail of the curvature perturbations. We present a numerical algorithm to compute the non-perturbative curvature power spectrum and apply it to both slow-roll (SR) and ultra-slow-roll (USR) single-field models of inflation. We accurately generate a non-perturbative scale-invariant power spectrum in the SR scenario. In the USR case, we obtain a peak in the power spectrum that, in the time-independent regime, aligns with the structure of its perturbative counterpart. Additionally, We underscore how the evolving nature of the super-Hubble perturbations in the USR model complicates the numerical computation of the non-perturbative spectrum.</description>

      <title>The gravitational path integral from an observer's point of view</title>

Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in quantum gravity is to describe the experience of a gravitating observer in generic spacetimes. In this paper, we develop a framework for describing non-perturbative physics relative to an observer using the gravitational path integral. We apply our proposal to an observer that lives in a closed universe and one that falls behind a black hole horizon. We find that the Hilbert space that describes the experience of the observer is much larger than the Hilbert space in the absence of an observer. In the case of closed universes, the Hilbert space is not one-dimensional, as calculations in the absence of the observer suggest. Rather, its dimension scales exponentially with $G_N^{-1}$. Similarly, from an observer's perspective, the dimension of the Hilbert space in a two-sided black hole is increased. We compute various observables probing the experience of a gravitating observer in this Hilbert space. We find that an observer experiences non-trivial physics in the closed universe in contrast to what it would see in a one-dimensional Hilbert space. In the two-sided black hole setting, our proposal implies that non-perturbative corrections to effective field theory for an infalling observer are suppressed until times exponential in the black hole entropy, resolving a recently raised puzzle in black hole physics. While the framework that we develop is exemplified in the toy-model of JT gravity, most of our analysis can be extended to higher dimensions and, in particular, to generic spacetimes not admitting a conventional holographic description, such as cosmological universes or black hole interiors.</description>

      <title>Modelling noise in gravitational-wave observatories with transdimensional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modelling noise in gravitational-wave observatories is crucial for accurately inferring the properties of gravitational-wave sources. We introduce a transdimensional Bayesian approach to characterise the noise in ground-based gravitational-wave observatories using the Bayesian inference software $\texttt{Bilby}$. The algorithm models broadband noise with a combination of power laws; narrowband features with Lorentzians; and shapelets to capture any additional features in the data. We show that our noise model provides a significantly improved fit of the LIGO and Virgo noise amplitude spectral densities compared to currently available noise fits obtained with on-source data segments. We perform astrophysical inference on well-known events in the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog using our noise model and observe shifts of up to $7\%$ in the $90\%$ boundaries of credible intervals for some parameters. We discuss plans to deploy this framework systematically for gravitational-wave inference along with possible areas of improvement.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Dark Energy from Time Crystals"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently proposed (arxiv:2502.08887) that the time crystal Lagrangian introduced by Shapere and Wilczek in 2012 could be a model of dark energy. I point out that the model has an instability that drives its energy density to negative values, which may render it unsuitable as a model of dark energy.</description>
