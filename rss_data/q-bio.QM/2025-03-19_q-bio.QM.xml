      <title>Optimal compound downselection to promote diversity and parallel chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early stage drug discovery and molecular design projects often follow iterative design-make-test cycles. The selection of which compounds to synthesize from all possible candidate compounds is a complex decision inherent to these design cycles that must weigh multiple factors. We build upon the algorithmic downselection framework SPARROW that considers synthetic cost, synthetic feasibility, and compound utility, extending it to address additional critical factors related to the risk of synthesis failure, molecular diversity, and parallel chemistry capabilities. These design considerations further align algorithmic compound selection with the true complexity of this decision-making process, allowing SPARROW to capture a broader set of principles typically reliant on expert chemist intuition. The application of these formulations to an exemplary case study highlights SPARROW's ability to promote the selection of diverse batches of compounds whose syntheses are amenable to parallel chemistry.</description>

      <title>Developing cholera outbreak forecasting through qualitative dynamics: Insights into Malawi case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cholera, an acute diarrheal disease, is a serious concern in developing and underdeveloped areas. A qualitative understanding of cholera epidemics aims to foresee transmission patterns based on reported data and mechanistic models. The mechanistic model is a crucial tool for capturing the dynamics of disease transmission and population spread. However, using real-time cholera cases is essential for forecasting the transmission trend. This prospective study seeks to furnish insights into transmission trends through qualitative dynamics followed by machine learning-based forecasting. The Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach is employed to calibrate the proposed mechanistic model. We identify critical parameters that illustrate the disease's dynamics using partial rank correlation coefficient-based sensitivity analysis. The basic reproduction number as a crucial threshold measures asymptotic dynamics. Furthermore, forward bifurcation directs the stability of the infection state, and Hopf bifurcation suggests that trends in transmission may become unpredictable as societal disinfection rates rise. Further, we develop epidemic-informed machine learning models by incorporating mechanistic cholera dynamics into autoregressive integrated moving averages and autoregressive neural networks. We forecast short-term future cholera cases in Malawi by implementing the proposed epidemic-informed machine learning models to support this. We assert that integrating temporal dynamics into the machine learning models can enhance the capabilities of cholera forecasting models. The execution of this mechanism can significantly influence future trends in cholera transmission. This evolving approach can also be beneficial for policymakers to interpret and respond to potential disease systems. Moreover, our methodology is replicable and adaptable, encouraging future research on disease dynamics.</description>

      <title>CINNAMON: A hybrid approach to change point detection and parameter estimation in single-particle tracking data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Change point detection has become an important part of the analysis of the single-particle tracking data, as it allows one to identify moments, in which the motion patterns of observed particles undergo significant changes. The segmentation of diffusive trajectories based on those moments may provide insight into various phenomena in soft condensed matter and biological physics. In this paper, we propose CINNAMON, a hybrid approach to classifying single-particle tracking trajectories, detecting change points within them, and estimating diffusion parameters in the segments between the change points. Our method is based on a combination of neural networks, feature-based machine learning, and statistical techniques. It has been benchmarked in the second Anomalous Diffusion Challenge. The method offers a high level of interpretability due to its analytical and feature-based components. A potential use of features from topological data analysis is also discussed.</description>

      <title>AI-driven control of bioelectric signalling for real-time topological reorganization of cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13489v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and manipulating bioelectric signaling could present a new wave of progress in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology. Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell membranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these signals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in organisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles in tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in diseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time manipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and morphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with biological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback. Combining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics, voltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could provide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to improved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative bioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and advancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize bioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering applications.</description>

      <title>Finger-to-Chest Style Transfer-assisted Deep Learning Method For Photoplethysmogram Waveform Restoration with Timing Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable measurements, such as those obtained by photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors are highly susceptible to motion artifacts and noise, affecting cardiovascular measures. Chest-acquired PPG signals are especially vulnerable, with signal degradation primarily resulting from lower perfusion, breathing-induced motion, and mechanical interference from chest movements. Traditional restoration methods often degrade the signal, and supervised deep learning (DL) struggles with random and systematic distortions, requiring very large datasets for successful training. To efficiently restore chest PPG waveform, we propose a style transfer-assisted cycle-consistent generative adversarial network, called starGAN, whose performance is evaluated on a three-channel PPG signal (red, green,and infrared) acquired by a chest-worn multi-modal sensor, called Soundi. Two identical devices are adopted, one sensor to collect the PPG signal on the chest, considered to feature low quality and undergoing restoration, and another sensor to obtain a high-quality PPG signal measured on the finger, considered the reference signal. Extensive validation over some 8,000 5-second chunks collected from 40 subjects showed about 90% correlation of the restored chest PPG with the reference finger PPG, with a 30% improvement over raw chest PPG. Likewise, the signal-to-noise ratio improved on average of about 125%, over the three channels. The agreement with heart-rate computed from concurrent ECG was extremely high, overcoming 84% on average. These results demonstrate effective signal restoration, comparable with findings in recent literature papers. Significance: PPG signals collected from wearable devices are highly susceptible to artifacts, making innovative AI-based techniques fundamental towards holistic health assessments in a single device.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking community drug response prediction models: datasets, models, tools, and metrics for cross-dataset generalization analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in drug response prediction (DRP), yet their ability to generalize across datasets remains an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. Due to the lack of standardized benchmarking approaches, model evaluations and comparisons often rely on inconsistent datasets and evaluation criteria, making it difficult to assess true predictive capabilities. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework for evaluating cross-dataset prediction generalization in DRP models. Our framework incorporates five publicly available drug screening datasets, six standardized DRP models, and a scalable workflow for systematic evaluation. To assess model generalization, we introduce a set of evaluation metrics that quantify both absolute performance (e.g., predictive accuracy across datasets) and relative performance (e.g., performance drop compared to within-dataset results), enabling a more comprehensive assessment of model transferability. Our results reveal substantial performance drops when models are tested on unseen datasets, underscoring the importance of rigorous generalization assessments. While several models demonstrate relatively strong cross-dataset generalization, no single model consistently outperforms across all datasets. Furthermore, we identify CTRPv2 as the most effective source dataset for training, yielding higher generalization scores across target datasets. By sharing this standardized evaluation framework with the community, our study aims to establish a rigorous foundation for model comparison, and accelerate the development of robust DRP models for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>In silico clinical trials in drug development: a systematic review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of clinical research, computational models have received increasing attention over the past decades. In this systematic review, we aimed to provide an overview of the role of so-called in silico clinical trials (ISCTs) in medical applications. Exemplary for the broad field of clinical medicine, we focused on in silico (IS) methods applied in drug development, sometimes also referred to as model informed drug development (MIDD). We searched PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov for published articles and registered clinical trials related to ISCTs. We identified 202 articles and 48 trials, and of these, 76 articles and 19 trials were directly linked to drug development. We extracted information from all 202 articles and 48 clinical trials and conducted a more detailed review of the methods used in the 76 articles that are connected to drug development. Regarding application, most articles and trials focused on cancer and imaging related research while rare and pediatric diseases were only addressed in 18 and 4 studies, respectively. While some models were informed combining mechanistic knowledge with clinical or preclinical (in-vivo or in-vitro) data, the majority of models were fully data-driven, illustrating that clinical data is a crucial part in the process of generating synthetic data in ISCTs. Regarding reproducibility, a more detailed analysis revealed that only 24% (18 out of 76) of the articles provided an open-source implementation of the applied models, and in only 20% of the articles the generated synthetic data were publicly available. Despite the widely raised interest, we also found that it is still uncommon for ISCTs to be part of a registered clinical trial and their application is restricted to specific diseases leaving potential benefits of ISCTs not fully exploited.</description>

      <title>Inverse 3D microscopy rendering for cell shape inference with active mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods for biological shape inference, such as deep learning (DL) and active contour models, face limitations in 3D. DL requires large labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain, while active contour models rely on fine-tuned hyperparameters for intensity attraction and regularization. We introduce deltaMic, a novel 3D differentiable renderer for fluorescence microscopy. By leveraging differentiable Fourier-space convolution, deltaMic accurately models the image formation process, integrating a parameterized microscope point spread function and a mesh-based object representation. Unlike DL-based segmentation, it directly optimizes shape and microscopy parameters to fit real microscopy data, removing the need for large datasets or heuristic priors. To enhance efficiency, we develop a GPU-accelerated Fourier transform for triangle meshes, significantly improving speed. We demonstrate deltaMic's ability to reconstruct cellular shapes from synthetic and real microscopy images, providing a robust tool for 3D segmentation and biophysical modeling. This work bridges physics-based rendering with modern optimization techniques, offering a new paradigm for microscopy image analysis and inverse biophysical modeling.</description>

      <title>A compact model of Escherichia coli core and biosynthetic metabolism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metabolic models condense biochemical knowledge about organisms in a structured and standardised way. As large-scale network reconstructions are readily available for many organisms, genome-scale models are being widely used among modellers and engineers. However, these large models can be difficult to analyse and visualise and occasionally generate predictions that are hard to interpret or even biologically unrealistic. Of the thousands of enzymatic reactions in a typical bacterial metabolism, only a few hundred form the metabolic pathways essential to produce energy carriers and biosynthetic precursors. These pathways carry relatively high flux, are central to maintaining and reproducing the cell, and provide precursors and energy to engineered metabolic pathways. Focusing on these central metabolic subsystems, we present iCH360, a manually curated medium-scale model of energy and biosynthesis metabolism for the well-studied bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. The model is a sub-network of the most recent genome-scale reconstruction, iML1515, and comes with an updated layer of database annotations and with a range of metabolic maps for visualisation. We enriched the stoichiometric network with extensive biological information and quantitative data, enhancing the scope and applicability of the model. In addition, we assess the properties of this model in comparison to its genome-scale parent and demonstrate the use of the network and supporting data in various scenarios, including enzyme-constrained flux balance analysis, elementary flux mode analysis, and thermodynamic analysis. Overall, we believe this model holds the potential to become a reference medium-scale metabolic model for E. coli.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Z-Slice Augmentation for 3D Bio-Imaging via Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional biological microscopy has significantly advanced our understanding of complex biological structures. However, limitations due to microscopy techniques, sample properties or phototoxicity often result in poor z-resolution, hindering accurate cellular measurements. Here, we introduce ZAugNet, a fast, accurate, and self-supervised deep learning method for enhancing z-resolution in biological images. By performing nonlinear interpolation between consecutive slices, ZAugNet effectively doubles resolution with each iteration. Compared on several microscopy modalities and biological objects, it outperforms competing methods on most metrics. Our method leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture combined with knowledge distillation to maximize prediction speed without compromising accuracy. We also developed ZAugNet+, an extended version enabling continuous interpolation at arbitrary distances, making it particularly useful for datasets with nonuniform slice spacing. Both ZAugNet and ZAugNet+ provide high-performance, scalable z-slice augmentation solutions for large-scale 3D imaging. They are available as open-source frameworks in PyTorch, with an intuitive Colab notebook interface for easy access by the scientific community.</description>
