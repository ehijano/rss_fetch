      <title>Speciation by local adaptation and isolation by distance in extended environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speciation is often associated with geographical barriers that limit gene flow. However, species can also emerge in continuous homogeneous environments through isolation by distance. When the environment is not homogeneous, natural selection contributes to differentiation by local adaptation and tends to facilitate speciation. To explore how isolation by distance and adaptation combine to determine species diversity, we implemented a model regulated by these two components. The first is implemented via mating restrictions on spatial proximity and genetic similarity. The second is realized by an ecological phenotype subjected to adaption and natural selection. We consider scenarios where the environment is either homogeneous, with a single ecological optimum, or heterogeneous with two distinct optima. In homogeneous environments no speciation is observed under permissive mating restrictions, independent on the strength of natural selection. On the other hand, if reproduction requires close genetic similarity (strict mating restrictions), speciation occurs only under strong selection. In contrast, in environments with two local optima and strong selection, species well adapted to each of the niches emerge along the spatial structure, leading to the formation of groups with distinct phenotypes. Permissive mating restrictions leads to the formation of only two species, each occupying one of the niches; strong mating restriction leads to several species per niche, in a much faster speciation process. Interestingly, when selection is weak and reproduction requires strong genetic similarity, several species form, but the process is slow. Moreover, species average phenotypes do not remain constant over generations, causing the phenotypic distribution to oscillate, never reaching a stationary pattern.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the space of phylogenetic trees with non-identical leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees summarize evolutionary relationships. The Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) space for comparing phylogenetic trees has many elegant mathematical properties, but it does not encompass trees with differing leaf sets. To overcome this, we introduce Towering space: a complete metric space that extends BHV space to trees with non-identical leaf sets. Towering space is a structured collection of BHV spaces connected via pruning and regrafting operations. We study the geometry of paths in Towering space and present an algorithm for computing metric distances. By addressing a major limitation of BHV space, Towering space facilitates the analysis of modern phylogenetic datasets such as multi-domain gene trees.</description>

      <title>Expand or better manage protected areas: a framework for minimising extinction risk when threats are concentrated near edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several international agreements have called for the rapid expansion of protected areas to halt biodiversity declines. However, recent research has shown that expanding protected areas may be less cost-effective than redirecting resources towards threat management in existing reserves. These findings often assume that threats are homogeneously distributed in the landscape. In some cases, threats are more concentrated near the edge of protected areas. As protected areas expand, core habitat in the centre expands more rapidly than its edge, potentially creating a refuge from threats. In this paper, we present a framework linking protected area expansion and threat management to extinction risk, via their impact on population carrying capacity and growth rate within core and edge habitats. We demonstrate the framework using a simple population model where individuals are uniformly distributed in a circular protected area threatened by poachers who penetrate the protected area to a fixed distance. We parameterise the model for Peter's Duiker (Cephalophus callipygus) harvested for food in the dense undergrowth of African forests using snares. Expanding protected areas can reduce extinction risk more effectively compared to an equivalent investment in snare removal for larger protected areas that already sustain core unhunted habitat. Our results demonstrate the importance of protected area expansion in buffering susceptible populations from fixed hunting pressure restricted to protected area edges. However, for cases where threats, wildlife, and managers respond to each other strategically in space, the relative importance of expansion versus increased management remains a significant open problem.</description>

      <title>Treemble: A Graphical Tool to Generate Newick Strings from Phylogenetic Tree Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees are ubiquitous and central to biology, but most published trees are available only as visual diagrams and not in the machine-readable newick format. There are thus thousands of published trees in the scientific literature that are unavailable for follow-up analyses, comparisons, supertree construction, etc. Experts can easily read such diagrams, but the manual construction of a newick string is prohibitively laborious. Previous attempts to semi-automate the reading of tree images relied on image processing techniques. These quickly encounter difficulties with typical published tree diagrams that contain various graphical elements that overlap the branches, such as error bars on internal nodes. Here we introduce Treemble, a user-friendly desktop application for generating newick strings from tree images. The user simply clicks to mark node locations, and Treemble algorithmically assembles the tree from the node coordinates alone. Tip nodes can be automatically detected and marked. Treemble also facilitates the automatic reading of tip name labels and can handle both rectangular and circular trees. Treemble is a native desktop application for both MacOS and Windows, and is freely available and fully documented at treemble.org.</description>

      <title>BIGBOY1.2: Generating Realistic Synthetic Data for Disease Outbreak Modelling and Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling disease outbreak models remains challenging due to incomplete surveillance data, noise, and limited access to standardized datasets. We have created BIGBOY1.2, an open synthetic dataset generator that creates configurable epidemic time series and population-level trajectories suitable for benchmarking modelling, forecasting, and visualisation. The framework supports SEIR and SIR-like compartmental logic, custom seasonality, and noise injection to mimic real reporting artifacts. BIGBOY1.2 can produce datasets with diverse characteristics, making it suitable for comparing traditional epidemiological models (e.g., SIR, SEIR) with modern machine learning approaches (e.g., SVM, neural networks).</description>

      <title>Human Extinction A Demographic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies that predict species extinction have focused on a range of flora and fauna but in regard to Homo sapiens there are, with one notable exception, no predictive studies, only considerations of possible ways this may occur. The exception believes extinction of Homo sapiens will happen in 10,000 years. We agree that extinction will happen, but we disagree on the timing: The work we present here suggests that if the current decline in birth rates continues, humans could be extinct by 2394. If we consider the absence of working-age people and the accompanying collapse of services, the survivorship rates would most likely be lower. Given this, it is plausible that extinction could occur around 2359. We also examined a scenario in which births ended in 2024, which revealed that Homo sapiens would become extinct in 2134. Given societal collapse, extinction under the zero births scenario could occur around 2089.</description>

      <title>Embedding Sustainability in Undergraduate Mathematics with Actionable Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing need to integrate sustainability into tertiary mathematics education given the urgency of addressing global environmental challenges. This paper presents four case studies from Australian university courses that incorporate ecological and environmentally-conscious concepts into the mathematics curriculum. These case studies cover topics such as population dynamics, sustainable fisheries management, statistical inference for endangered species assessment, and mathematical modelling of climate effects on marine ecosystems. Each case demonstrates how fundamental mathematical methods, including calculus, statistics and operations research, can be applied to real-world ecological issues. These examples are ready-to-implement problems for integrating ecological thinking into mathematics classes, providing educators with practical tools to help students develop interdisciplinary problem-solving skills and prepare for the challenges of sustainability in their future careers.</description>

      <title>Actuarial Analysis of an Infectious Disease Insurance based on an SEIARD Epidemiological Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing number of infectious disease outbreaks, like the one caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, underscores the necessity of actuarial models that can adapt to epidemic-driven risks. Traditional life insurance frameworks often rely on static mortality assumptions that fail to capture the temporal and behavioral complexity of disease transmission. In this paper, we propose an integrated actuarial framework based on the SEIARD epidemiological model. This framework enables the explicit modeling of incubation periods and disease-induced mortality. We derive key actuarial quantities, including the present value of annuity benefits, payment streams, and net premiums, based on SEIARD dynamics. We formulate a prospective reserve function and analyze its evolution throughout the course of an epidemic. Additionally, we examine the forces of infection, mortality, and removal to assess their impact on epidemic-adjusted survival probabilities. Numerical simulations implemented via a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme illustrate the model's applicability under various parameter settings and insurance policy assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.10414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rich and varied ways that genetic material can be passed between species has motivated extensive research into the theory of phylogenetic networks. Features that align with biological processes, or with desirable mathematical properties, have been used to define classes and prove results, with the goal of developing the theoretical foundations for network reconstruction methods. We may have now reached the point where a collection of recent results can be drawn together to make one class of network, the \emph{normal} networks, a leading contender, sitting in the sweet spot between biological relevance and mathematical tractability.</description>

      <title>Petri nets in epidemiology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.03269v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides a geometric version of the next-generation matrix method for obtaining the basic reproduction number of an epidemiological model. We exhibit a certain correspondence between any system of ODEs and Petri nets. We observe that any epidemiological model has the basic structures found in the SIR model of Kermack-McKendrick. This means that the basic reproduction number depends only on three substructures inside the Petri net, which are also given by three Petri nets inside, representing the susceptible population, the infection process, and the infected population. The five assumptions of the next-generation matrix method given by van den Driessche-Watmough can be described geometrically using Petri nets. Thus, the next-generation matrix results in a matrix of flows between the infection compartments with a dominant eigenvalue given by the basic reproduction number.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of human population reproduction through marriage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a linear one-sex dynamical model of human population reproduction through marriage. In our model, a woman may marry and divorce multiple times; however, only women who are currently married are assumed to bear children. The iterative marriage process is formulated as a three-state compartmental model, which is described by a system of McKendrick equations with a marital birth rate function that depends on the duration of marriage and the age at marriage. To examine the impact of changing nuptiality on fertility, we derive new formulas for the reproduction indices. In particular, the total fertility rate (TFR) is expressed as the product of the total marriage number and the average total marital fertility. Using Japanese vital statistics, we show that our model provides a reasonable estimate of the current TFR and its future trajectory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model in which cells belonging to two species proliferate with volume exclusion on an expanding surface. If the surface expands uniformly, we show that the domains formed by the two species present a critical behavior. We compute the critical exponents characterizing the decay of interfaces and the size distribution of domains using a mean-field theory. These mean-field exponents agree very accurately with those fitted in numerical simulations, suggesting that the theory is exact.</description>

      <title>Costs and benefits of phytoplankton motility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motility skills of phytoplankton have evolved and persisted over millions of years, primarily in response to factors such as nutrient and light availability, temperature and viscosity gradients, turbulence, and predation pressure. Phytoplankton motility is broadly categorized into swimming and buoyancy regulation. Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility costs and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative understanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an organism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism encounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather available pieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to paint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of sinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of sinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this efficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass density adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles. We propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving non-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in response to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light, temperature, and viscosity. Identifying intracellular buoyancy-regulating dissipative processes offers deeper insight into the motility costs relative to the organism's total metabolic rate.</description>
