      <title>How Powerful is Graph Filtering for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that the effectiveness of graph convolutional network (GCN) for recommendation is attributed to the spectral graph filtering. Most GCN-based methods consist of a graph filter or followed by a low-rank mapping optimized based on supervised training. However, we show two limitations suppressing the power of graph filtering: (1) Lack of generality. Due to the varied noise distribution, graph filters fail to denoise sparse data where noise is scattered across all frequencies, while supervised training results in worse performance on dense data where noise is concentrated in middle frequencies that can be removed by graph filters without training. (2) Lack of expressive power. We theoretically show that linear GCN (LGCN) that is effective on collaborative filtering (CF) cannot generate arbitrary embeddings, implying the possibility that optimal data representation might be unreachable.
  To tackle the first limitation, we show close relation between noise distribution and the sharpness of spectrum where a sharper spectral distribution is more desirable causing data noise to be separable from important features without training. Based on this observation, we propose a generalized graph normalization G^2N to adjust the sharpness of spectral distribution in order to redistribute data noise to assure that it can be removed by graph filtering without training. As for the second limitation, we propose an individualized graph filter (IGF) adapting to the different confidence levels of the user preference that interactions can reflect, which is proved to be able to generate arbitrary embeddings. By simplifying LGCN, we further propose a simplified graph filtering (SGFCF) which only requires the top-K singular values for recommendation. Finally, experimental results on four datasets with different density settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Graph Neural Network for Mechanical CAD Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CAD (Computer-Aided Design) plays a crucial role in mechanical industry, where large numbers of similar-shaped CAD parts are often created. Efficiently reusing these parts is key to reducing design and production costs for enterprises. Retrieval systems are vital for achieving CAD reuse, but the complex shapes of CAD models are difficult to accurately describe using text or keywords, making traditional retrieval methods ineffective. While existing representation learning approaches have been developed for CAD, manually labeling similar samples in these methods is expensive. Additionally, CAD models' unique parameterized data structure presents challenges for applying existing 3D shape representation learning techniques directly. In this work, we propose GC-CAD, a self-supervised contrastive graph neural network-based method for mechanical CAD retrieval that directly models parameterized CAD raw files. GC-CAD consists of two key modules: structure-aware representation learning and contrastive graph learning framework. The method leverages graph neural networks to extract both geometric and topological information from CAD models, generating feature representations. We then introduce a simple yet effective contrastive graph learning framework approach, enabling the model to train without manual labels and generate retrieval-ready representations. Experimental results on four datasets including human evaluation demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant accuracy improvements and up to 100 times efficiency improvement over the baseline methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond effectiveness, the robustness of an information retrieval (IR) system is increasingly attracting attention. When deployed, a critical technology such as IR should not only deliver strong performance on average but also have the ability to handle a variety of exceptional situations. In recent years, research into the robustness of IR has seen significant growth, with numerous researchers offering extensive analyses and proposing myriad strategies to address robustness challenges. In this tutorial, we first provide background information covering the basics and a taxonomy of robustness in IR. Then, we examine adversarial robustness and out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness within IR-specific contexts, extensively reviewing recent progress in methods to enhance robustness. The tutorial concludes with a discussion on the robustness of IR in the context of large language models (LLMs), highlighting ongoing challenges and promising directions for future research. This tutorial aims to generate broader attention to robustness issues in IR, facilitate an understanding of the relevant literature, and lower the barrier to entry for interested researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Contextual Distillation Model for Diversified Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diversity of recommendation is equally crucial as accuracy in improving user experience. Existing studies, e.g., Determinantal Point Process (DPP) and Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), employ a greedy paradigm to iteratively select items that optimize both accuracy and diversity. However, prior methods typically exhibit quadratic complexity, limiting their applications to the re-ranking stage and are not applicable to other recommendation stages with a larger pool of candidate items, such as the pre-ranking and ranking stages. In this paper, we propose Contextual Distillation Model (CDM), an efficient recommendation model that addresses diversification, suitable for the deployment in all stages of industrial recommendation pipelines. Specifically, CDM utilizes the candidate items in the same user request as context to enhance the diversification of the results. We propose a contrastive context encoder that employs attention mechanisms to model both positive and negative contexts. For the training of CDM, we compare each target item with its context embedding and utilize the knowledge distillation framework to learn the win probability of each target item under the MMR algorithm, where the teacher is derived from MMR outputs. During inference, ranking is performed through a linear combination of the recommendation and student model scores, ensuring both diversity and efficiency. We perform offline evaluations on two industrial datasets and conduct online A/B test of CDM on the short-video platform KuaiShou. The considerable enhancements observed in both recommendation quality and diversity, as shown by metrics, provide strong superiority for the effectiveness of CDM.</description>

      <title>On Softmax Direct Preference Optimization for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems aim to predict personalized rankings based on user preference data. With the rise of Language Models (LMs), LM-based recommenders have been widely explored due to their extensive world knowledge and powerful reasoning abilities. Most of the LM-based recommenders convert historical interactions into language prompts, pairing with a positive item as the target response and fine-tuning LM with a language modeling loss. However, the current objective fails to fully leverage preference data and is not optimized for personalized ranking tasks, which hinders the performance of LM-based recommenders. Inspired by the current advancement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in human preference alignment and the success of softmax loss in recommendations, we propose Softmax-DPO (\textbf{S-DPO}) to instill ranking information into the LM to help LM-based recommenders distinguish preferred items from negatives, rather than solely focusing on positives. Specifically, we incorporate multiple negatives in user preference data and devise an alternative version of DPO loss tailored for LM-based recommenders, connected to softmax sampling strategies. Theoretically, we bridge S-DPO with the softmax loss over negative sampling and find that it has a side effect of mining hard negatives, which assures its exceptional capabilities in recommendation tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of S-DPO to effectively model user preference and further boost recommendation performance while mitigating the data likelihood decline issue of DPO.

      <title>Khmer Semantic Search Engine: Digital Information Access and Document Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search engine process is crucial for document content retrieval. For Khmer documents, a tool is needed to extract essential keywords. Despite the daily generation of significant Khmer content, Cambodians struggle to find necessary documents due to the lack of an effective semantic searching tool. Even Google does not deliver high accuracy for Khmer content. Semantic search engines improve search results by employing advanced algorithms to understand various content types. With the rise in Khmer digital content such as reports, articles, and social media feedback enhanced search capabilities are essential. This research proposes the first Khmer Semantic Search Engine (KSE), designed to improve traditional Khmer search methods. Utilizing semantic matching techniques and formally annotated semantic content, our tool extracts meaningful keywords from user queries performs precise matching, and provides the best matching offline documents and online URL documents. We propose two semantic search frameworks based on keyword extraction and semantic search matching. Additionally, we developed tools for data preparation, including document addition and manual keyword extraction. To evaluate performance, we created a ground truth dataset and discussed issues related to searching and semantic search. Our findings show how understanding search term semantics can lead to more accurate results.</description>

      <title>Master of Disaster: A Disaster-Related Event Monitoring System From News Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for a disaster-related event monitoring system has arisen due to the societal and economic impact caused by the increasing number of severe disaster events. An event monitoring system should be able to extract event-related information from texts, and discriminates event instances. We demonstrate our open-source event monitoring system, namely, Master of Disaster (MoD), which receives news streams, extracts event information, links extracted information to a knowledge graph (KG), in this case Wikidata, and discriminates event instances visually. The goal of event visualization is to group event mentions referring to the same real-world event instance so that event instance discrimination can be achieved by visual screening.</description>

      <title>Can't Hide Behind the API: Stealing Black-Box Commercial Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding models that generate representation vectors from natural language text are widely used, reflect substantial investments, and carry significant commercial value. Companies such as OpenAI and Cohere have developed competing embedding models accessed through APIs that require users to pay for usage. In this architecture, the models are "hidden" behind APIs, but this does not mean that they are "well guarded". We present, to our knowledge, the first effort to "steal" these models for retrieval by training local models on text-embedding pairs obtained from the commercial APIs. Our experiments show using standard benchmarks that it is possible to efficiently replicate the retrieval effectiveness of the commercial embedding models using an attack that costs only around $200 to train (presumably) smaller models with fewer dimensions. Our findings raise important considerations for deploying commercial embedding models and suggest measures to mitigate the risk of model theft.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Code-Mixing Patterns in Migration Discourse: Automated Detection and Analysis of Online Conversations on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surge in global migration patterns underscores the imperative of integrating migrants seamlessly into host communities, necessitating inclusive and trustworthy public services. Despite the Nordic countries' robust public sector infrastructure, recent immigrants often encounter barriers to accessing these services, exacerbating social disparities and eroding trust. Addressing digital inequalities and linguistic diversity is paramount in this endeavor. This paper explores the utilization of code-mixing, a communication strategy prevalent among multilingual speakers, in migration-related discourse on social media platforms such as Reddit. We present Ensemble Learning for Multilingual Identification of Code-mixed Texts (ELMICT), a novel approach designed to automatically detect code-mixed messages in migration-related discussions. Leveraging ensemble learning techniques for combining multiple tokenizers' outputs and pre-trained language models, ELMICT demonstrates high performance (with F1 more than 0.95) in identifying code-mixing across various languages and contexts, particularly in cross-lingual zero-shot conditions (with avg. F1 more than 0.70). Moreover, the utilization of ELMICT helps to analyze the prevalence of code-mixing in migration-related threads compared to other thematic categories on Reddit, shedding light on the topics of concern to migrant communities. Our findings reveal insights into the communicative strategies employed by migrants on social media platforms, offering implications for the development of inclusive digital public services and conversational systems. By addressing the research questions posed in this study, we contribute to the understanding of linguistic diversity in migration discourse and pave the way for more effective tools for building trust in multicultural societies.</description>

      <title>DIET: Customized Slimming for Incompatible Networks in Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the continuously improving capabilities of mobile edges, recommender systems start to deploy models on edges to alleviate network congestion caused by frequent mobile requests. Several studies have leveraged the proximity of edge-side to real-time data, fine-tuning them to create edge-specific models. Despite their significant progress, these methods require substantial on-edge computational resources and frequent network transfers to keep the model up to date. The former may disrupt other processes on the edge to acquire computational resources, while the latter consumes network bandwidth, leading to a decrease in user satisfaction. In response to these challenges, we propose a customizeD slImming framework for incompatiblE neTworks(DIET). DIET deploys the same generic backbone (potentially incompatible for a specific edge) to all devices. To minimize frequent bandwidth usage and storage consumption in personalization, DIET tailors specific subnets for each edge based on its past interactions, learning to generate slimming subnets(diets) within incompatible networks for efficient transfer. It also takes the inter-layer relationships into account, empirically reducing inference time while obtaining more suitable diets. We further explore the repeated modules within networks and propose a more storage-efficient framework, DIETING, which utilizes a single layer of parameters to represent the entire network, achieving comparably excellent performance. The experiments across four state-of-the-art datasets and two widely used models demonstrate the superior accuracy in recommendation and efficiency in transmission and storage of our framework.</description>

      <title>Reducing Task Discrepancy of Text Encoders for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve a target image based on a reference image and conditioning text, enabling controllable searches. Due to the expensive dataset construction cost for CIR triplets, a zero-shot (ZS) CIR setting has been actively studied to eliminate the need for human-collected triplet datasets. The mainstream of ZS-CIR employs an efficient projection module that projects a CLIP image embedding to the CLIP text token embedding space, while fixing the CLIP encoders. Using the projected image embedding, these methods generate image-text composed features by using the pre-trained text encoder. However, their CLIP image and text encoders suffer from the task discrepancy between the pre-training task (text $\leftrightarrow$ image) and the target CIR task (image + text $\leftrightarrow$ image). Conceptually, we need expensive triplet samples to reduce the discrepancy, but we use cheap text triplets instead and update the text encoder. To that end, we introduce the Reducing Task Discrepancy of text encoders for Composed Image Retrieval (RTD), a plug-and-play training scheme for the text encoder that enhances its capability using a novel target-anchored text contrastive learning. We also propose two additional techniques to improve the proposed learning scheme: a hard negatives-based refined batch sampling strategy and a sophisticated concatenation scheme. Integrating RTD into the state-of-the-art projection-based ZS-CIR methods significantly improves performance across various datasets and backbones, demonstrating its efficiency and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Top-k Learning to Rank with Causal Likelihood Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unbiased learning to rank has been proposed to alleviate the biases in the search ranking, making it possible to train ranking models with user interaction data. In real applications, search engines are designed to display only the most relevant k documents from the retrieved candidate set. The rest candidates are discarded. As a consequence, position bias and sample selection bias usually occur simultaneously. Existing unbiased learning to rank approaches either focus on one type of bias (e.g., position bias) or mitigate the position bias and sample selection bias with separate components, overlooking their associations. In this study, we first analyze the mechanisms and associations of position bias and sample selection bias from the viewpoint of a causal graph. Based on the analysis, we propose Causal Likelihood Decomposition (CLD), a unified approach to simultaneously mitigating these two biases in top-k learning to rank. By decomposing the log-likelihood of the biased data as an unbiased term that only related to relevance, plus other terms related to biases, CLD successfully detaches the relevance from position bias and sample selection bias. An unbiased ranking model can be obtained from the unbiased term, via maximizing the whole likelihood. An extension to the pairwise neural ranking is also developed. Advantages of CLD include theoretical soundness and a unified framework for pointwise and pairwise unbiased top-k learning to rank. Extensive experimental results verified that CLD, including its pairwise neural extension, outperformed the baselines by mitigating both the position bias and the sample selection bias. Empirical studies also showed that CLD is robust to the variation of bias severity and the click noise.</description>

      <title>Whole Page Unbiased Learning to Rank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The page presentation biases in the information retrieval system, especially on the click behavior, is a well-known challenge that hinders improving ranking models' performance with implicit user feedback. Unbiased Learning to Rank~(ULTR) algorithms are then proposed to learn an unbiased ranking model with biased click data. However, most existing algorithms are specifically designed to mitigate position-related bias, e.g., trust bias, without considering biases induced by other features in search result page presentation(SERP), e.g. attractive bias induced by the multimedia. Unfortunately, those biases widely exist in industrial systems and may lead to an unsatisfactory search experience. Therefore, we introduce a new problem, i.e., whole-page Unbiased Learning to Rank(WP-ULTR), aiming to handle biases induced by whole-page SERP features simultaneously. It presents tremendous challenges: (1) a suitable user behavior model (user behavior hypothesis) can be hard to find; and (2) complex biases cannot be handled by existing algorithms. To address the above challenges, we propose a Bias Agnostic whole-page unbiased Learning to rank algorithm, named BAL, to automatically find the user behavior model with causal discovery and mitigate the biases induced by multiple SERP features with no specific design. Experimental results on a real-world dataset verify the effectiveness of the BAL.</description>

      <title>Language Models As Semantic Indexers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic identifier (ID) is an important concept in information retrieval that aims to preserve the semantics of objects such as documents and items inside their IDs. Previous studies typically adopt a two-stage pipeline to learn semantic IDs by first procuring embeddings using off-the-shelf text encoders and then deriving IDs based on the embeddings. However, each step introduces potential information loss, and there is usually an inherent mismatch between the distribution of embeddings within the latent space produced by text encoders and the anticipated distribution required for semantic indexing. It is non-trivial to design a method that can learn the document's semantic representations and its hierarchical structure simultaneously, given that semantic IDs are discrete and sequentially structured, and the semantic supervision is deficient. In this paper, we introduce LMIndexer, a self-supervised framework to learn semantic IDs with a generative language model. We tackle the challenge of sequential discrete ID by introducing a semantic indexer capable of generating neural sequential discrete representations with progressive training and contrastive learning. In response to the semantic supervision deficiency, we propose to train the model with a self-supervised document reconstruction objective. We show the high quality of the learned IDs and demonstrate their effectiveness on three tasks including recommendation, product search, and document retrieval on five datasets from various domains.

Abstract: In this contribution, we deal with seed-based information retrieval in networks of research publications. Using systematic reviews as a baseline, and publication data from the NIH Open Citation Collection, we compare the performance of the three citation-based approaches direct citation, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling with respect to recall and precision measures. In addition, we include the PubMed Related Article score as well as combined approaches in the comparison. We also provide a fairly comprehensive review of earlier research in which citation relations have been used for information retrieval purposes. The results show an advantage for co-citation over bibliographic coupling and direct citation. However, combining the three approaches outperforms the exclusive use of co-citation in the study. The results further indicate, in line with previous research, that combining citation-based approaches with textual approaches enhances the performance of seed-based information retrieval. The results from the study may guide approaches combining citation-based and textual approaches in their choice of citation similarity measures. We suggest that future research use more structured approaches to evaluate methods for seed-based retrieval of publications, including comparative approaches as well as the elaboration of common data sets and baselines for evaluation.</description>

      <title>How Do Recommendation Models Amplify Popularity Bias? An Analysis from the Spectral Perspective</title>

Abstract: Recommendation Systems (RS) are often plagued by popularity bias. When training a recommendation model on a typically long-tailed dataset, the model tends to not only inherit this bias but often exacerbate it, resulting in over-representation of popular items in the recommendation lists. This study conducts comprehensive empirical and theoretical analyses to expose the root causes of this phenomenon, yielding two core insights: 1) Item popularity is memorized in the principal spectrum of the score matrix predicted by the recommendation model; 2) The dimension collapse phenomenon amplifies the relative prominence of the principal spectrum, thereby intensifying the popularity bias. Building on these insights, we propose a novel debiasing strategy that leverages a spectral norm regularizer to penalize the magnitude of the principal singular value. We have developed an efficient algorithm to expedite the calculation of the spectral norm by exploiting the spectral property of the score matrix. Extensive experiments across seven real-world datasets and three testing paradigms have been conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Retrieval and Distill: A Temporal Data Shift-Free Paradigm for Online Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15678</link>

Abstract: Current recommendation systems are significantly affected by a serious issue of temporal data shift, which is the inconsistency between the distribution of historical data and that of online data. Most existing models focus on utilizing updated data, overlooking the transferable, temporal data shift-free information that can be learned from shifting data. We propose the Temporal Invariance of Association theorem, which suggests that given a fixed search space, the relationship between the data and the data in the search space keeps invariant over time. Leveraging this principle, we designed a retrieval-based recommendation system framework that can train a data shift-free relevance network using shifting data, significantly enhancing the predictive performance of the original model in the recommendation system. However, retrieval-based recommendation models face substantial inference time costs when deployed online. To address this, we further designed a distill framework that can distill information from the relevance network into a parameterized module using shifting data. The distilled model can be deployed online alongside the original model, with only a minimal increase in inference time. Extensive experiments on multiple real datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the performance of the original model by utilizing shifting data.</description>

      <title>Continual Collaborative Distillation for Recommender System</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a promising technique for addressing the computational challenges associated with deploying large-scale recommender systems. KD transfers the knowledge of a massive teacher system to a compact student model, to reduce the huge computational burdens for inference while retaining high accuracy. The existing KD studies primarily focus on one-time distillation in static environments, leaving a substantial gap in their applicability to real-world scenarios dealing with continuously incoming users, items, and their interactions. In this work, we delve into a systematic approach to operating the teacher-student KD in a non-stationary data stream. Our goal is to enable efficient deployment through a compact student, which preserves the high performance of the massive teacher, while effectively adapting to continuously incoming data. We propose Continual Collaborative Distillation (CCD) framework, where both the teacher and the student continually and collaboratively evolve along the data stream. CCD facilitates the student in effectively adapting to new data, while also enabling the teacher to fully leverage accumulated knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of CCD through extensive quantitative, ablative, and exploratory experiments on two real-world datasets. We expect this research direction to contribute to narrowing the gap between existing KD studies and practical applications, thereby enhancing the applicability of KD in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Counteracting Duration Bias in Video Recommendation via Counterfactual Watch Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07932</link>

Abstract: In video recommendation, an ongoing effort is to satisfy users' personalized information needs by leveraging their logged watch time. However, watch time prediction suffers from duration bias, hindering its ability to reflect users' interests accurately. Existing label-correction approaches attempt to uncover user interests through grouping and normalizing observed watch time according to video duration. Although effective to some extent, we found that these approaches regard completely played records (i.e., a user watches the entire video) as equally high interest, which deviates from what we observed on real datasets: users have varied explicit feedback proportion when completely playing videos. In this paper, we introduce the counterfactual watch time(CWT), the potential watch time a user would spend on the video if its duration is sufficiently long. Analysis shows that the duration bias is caused by the truncation of CWT due to the video duration limitation, which usually occurs on those completely played records. Besides, a Counterfactual Watch Model (CWM) is proposed, revealing that CWT equals the time users get the maximum benefit from video recommender systems. Moreover, a cost-based transform function is defined to transform the CWT into the estimation of user interest, and the model can be learned by optimizing a counterfactual likelihood function defined over observed user watch times. Extensive experiments on three real video recommendation datasets and online A/B testing demonstrated that CWM effectively enhanced video recommendation accuracy and counteracted the duration bias.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Realisation of an Information Need: An EEG Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the foundational goals of Information Retrieval (IR) is to satisfy searchers' Information Needs (IN). Understanding how INs physically manifest has long been a complex and elusive process. However, recent studies utilising Electroencephalography (EEG) data have provided real-time insights into the neural processes associated with INs. Unfortunately, they have yet to demonstrate how this insight can practically benefit the search experience. As such, within this study, we explore the ability to predict the realisation of IN within EEG data across 14 subjects whilst partaking in a Question-Answering (Q/A) task. Furthermore, we investigate the combinations of EEG features that yield optimal predictive performance, as well as identify regions within the Q/A queries where a subject's realisation of IN is more pronounced. The findings from this work demonstrate that EEG data is sufficient for the real-time prediction of the realisation of an IN across all subjects with an accuracy of 73.5% (SD 2.6%) and on a per-subject basis with an accuracy of 90.1% (SD 22.1%). This work helps to close the gap by bridging theoretical neuroscientific advancements with tangible improvements in information retrieval practices, paving the way for real-time prediction of the realisation of IN.</description>

      <title>Learning Metrics that Maximise Power for Accelerated A/B-Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online controlled experiments are a crucial tool to allow for confident decision-making in technology companies. A North Star metric is defined (such as long-term revenue or user retention), and system variants that statistically significantly improve on this metric in an A/B-test can be considered superior. North Star metrics are typically delayed and insensitive. As a result, the cost of experimentation is high: experiments need to run for a long time, and even then, type-II errors (i.e. false negatives) are prevalent.
  We propose to tackle this by learning metrics from short-term signals that directly maximise the statistical power they harness with respect to the North Star. We show that existing approaches are prone to overfitting, in that higher average metric sensitivity does not imply improved type-II errors, and propose to instead minimise the $p$-values a metric would have produced on a log of past experiments. We collect such datasets from two social media applications with over 160 million Monthly Active Users each, totalling over 153 A/B-pairs. Empirical results show that we are able to increase statistical power by up to 78% when using our learnt metrics stand-alone, and by up to 210% when used in tandem with the North Star. Alternatively, we can obtain constant statistical power at a sample size that is down to 12% of what the North Star requires, significantly reducing the cost of experimentation.</description>
