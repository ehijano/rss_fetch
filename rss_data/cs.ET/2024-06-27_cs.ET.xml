      <title>Designing Unit Ising Models for Logic Gate Simulation through Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Ising model is defined by a quadratic objective function known as the Hamiltonian, composed of spin variables that can take values of either $-1$ or $+1$. The goal is to assign spin values to these variables in a way that minimizes the value of the Hamiltonian. Ising models are instrumental in tackling many combinatorial optimization problems, leading to significant research in developing solvers for them. Notably, D-Wave Systems has pioneered the creation of quantum annealers, programmable solvers based on quantum mechanics, for these models. This paper introduces unit Ising models, where all non-zero coefficients of linear and quadratic terms are either $-1$ or $+1$. Due to the limited resolution of quantum annealers, unit Ising models are more suitable for quantum annealers to find optimal solutions. We propose a novel design methodology for unit Ising models to simulate logic circuits computing Boolean functions through integer linear programming. By optimizing these Ising models with quantum annealers, we can compute Boolean functions and their inverses. With a fixed unit Ising model for a logic circuit, we can potentially design Application-Specific Unit Quantum Annealers (ASUQAs) for computing the inverse function, which is analogous to Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in digital circuitry. For instance, if we apply this technique to a multiplication circuit, we can design an ASUQA for factorization of two numbers. Our findings suggest a powerful new method for compromising the RSA cryptosystem by leveraging ASUQAs in factorization.</description>

      <title>Dependence Analysis and Structured Construction for Batched Sparse Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In coding theory, codes are usually designed with a certain level of randomness to facilitate analysis and accommodate different channel conditions. However, the resulting random code constructed can be suboptimal in practical implementations. Represented by a bipartite graph, the Batched Sparse Code (BATS Code) is a randomly constructed erasure code that utilizes network coding to achieve near-optimal performance in wireless multi-hop networks. In the performance analysis in the previous research, it is implicitly assumed that the coded batches in the BATS code are independent. This assumption holds only asymptotically when the number of input symbols is infinite, but it does not generally hold in a practical setting where the number of input symbols is finite, especially when the code is constructed randomly. We show that dependence among the batches significantly degrades the code's performance. In order to control the batch dependence through graphical design, we propose constructing the BATS code in a structured manner. A hardware-friendly structured BATS code called the Cyclic-Shift BATS (CS-BATS) code is proposed, which constructs the code from a small base graph using light-weight cyclic-shift operations. We demonstrate that when the base graph is properly designed, a higher decoding rate and a smaller complexity can be achieved compared with the random BATS code.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics and stability analysis of locally-active Mott memristors using a physics-based compact model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally-active memristors are a class of emerging nonlinear dynamic circuit elements that hold promise for scalable yet biomimetic neuromorphic circuits. Starting from a physics-based compact model, we performed small-signal linearization analyses and applied Chua's local activity theory to a one-dimensional locally-active vanadium dioxide Mott memristor based on an insulator-to-metal phase transition. This approach allows a connection between the dynamical behaviors of a Mott memristor and its physical device parameters as well as a complete mapping of the locally passive and edge of chaos domains in the frequency and current operating parameter space, which could guide materials and device development for neuromorphic circuit applications. We also examined the applicability of local analyses on a second-order relaxation oscillator circuit that consists of a voltage-biased vanadium dioxide memristor coupled to a parallel reactive capacitor element and a series resistor. We show that global nonlinear techniques, including nullclines and phase portraits, provide insights on instabilities and persistent oscillations near non-hyperbolic fixed points, such as a supercritical Hopf-like bifurcation from an unstable spiral to a stable limit cycle, with each of the three circuit parameters acting as a bifurcation parameter. The abruptive growth in the limit cycle resembles the Canard explosion phenomenon in systems exhibiting relaxation oscillations. Finally, we show that experimental limit cycle oscillations in a vanadium dioxide nano-device relaxation oscillator match well with SPICE simulations built upon the compact model.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Expressive Power of Pulse-Based Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) based on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices hinges on the optimal utilization of limited quantum resources. While gate-based QML models are user-friendly for software engineers, their expressivity is restricted by the permissible circuit depth within a finite coherence time. In contrast, pulse-based models enable the construction of "infinitely" deep quantum neural networks within the same time, which may unleash greater expressive power for complex learning tasks. In this paper, this potential is investigated from the perspective of quantum control theory. We first indicate that the nonlinearity of pulse-based models comes from the encoding process that can be viewed as the continuous limit of data-reuploading in gate-based models. Subsequently, we prove that the pulse-based model can approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions when the underlying physical system is ensemble controllable. Under this condition, numerical simulations demonstrate the enhanced expressivity by either increasing the pulse length or the number of qubits. As anticipated, we show through numerical examples that the pulse-based model can unleash more expressive power compared to the gate-based model. These findings lay a theoretical foundation for understanding and designing expressive QML models using NISQ devices.</description>
