      <title>Quantum effects in the H-bond symmetrization and in the thermodynamic properties of high pressure ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and thermodynamic properties of high-pressure ice by incorporating quantum anharmonicity at a non-perturbative level. Quantum fluctuations reduce the critical pressure of the phase transition between phase VIII (with asymmetric H-bonds) and phase X (with symmetric H-bonds) by 65 GPa from its classical value of 116 GPa at 0K. Moreover, quantum effects make it temperature-independent over a wide temperature range (0K-300K), in agreement with experimental estimates obtained through vibrational spectroscopy and in striking contrast to the strong temperature dependence found in the classical approximation. The equation of state shows fingerprints of the transition in accordance with experimental evidence. Additionally, we demonstrate that, within our approach, proton disorder in phase VII has a negligible impact on the occurrence of phase X. Finally, we reproduce with high accuracy the 10 GPa isotope shift due to the hydrogen-to-deuterium substitution.</description>

      <title>Parametric tuning of dynamical phase transitions in ultracold reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in ultracold chemistry have led to the possibility of a coherent transformation between ultracold atoms and molecules including between completely bosonic condensates. Such transformations are enabled by the magneto-association of atoms at a Feshbach resonance which results in a passage through a quantum critical point. In this study, we show that the presence of generic interaction between the formed molecules can fundamentally alter the nature of the critical point, change the yield of the reaction and the order of the consequent phase transition. We find that the correlations introduced by this rather general interaction induce nontrivial many-body physics such as coherent oscillations between atoms and molecules, and a selective formation of squeezed molecular quantum states and quantum cat states. We provide analytical and numerical descriptions of these many-body effects, along with scaling laws for the reaction yield in both the adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes, and highlight the potential experimental relevance in quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Transverse Quantum Fluids</title>

Abstract: Motivated by remarkable properties of superfluid edge dislocations in solid Helium-4, we discuss a broad class of quantum systems -- boundaries in phase separated lattice states, magnetic domain walls, and ensembles of Luttinger liquids -- that can be classified as Transverse Quantum Fluids (TQF). After introducing the general idea of TQF, we focus on a coupled array of Luttinger liquids forming an incoherent TQF. This state is a long-range ordered quasi-one-dimensional superfluid, topologically protected against quantum phase slips by tight-binding of instanton dipoles, that has no coherent quasi-particle excitations at low energies. Incoherent TQF is a striking example of the irrelevance of the Landau quasiparticle criterion for superfluidity in systems that lack Galilean invariance. We detail its phenomenology, to motivate a number of experimental studies in condensed matter and cold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>QUEST-DMC superfluid $^3$He detector for sub-GeV dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The focus of dark matter searches to date has been on Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in the GeV/$c^2$-TeV/$c^2$ mass range. The direct, indirect and collider searches in this mass range have been extensive but ultimately unsuccessful, providing a strong motivation for widening the search outside this range. Here we describe a new concept for a dark matter experiment, employing superfluid $^3$He as a detector for dark matter that is close to the mass of the proton, of order 1 GeV/$c^2$. The QUEST-DMC detector concept is based on quasiparticle detection in a bolometer cell by a nanomechanical resonator. In this paper we develop the energy measurement methodology and detector response model, simulate candidate dark matter signals and expected background interactions, and calculate the sensitivity of such a detector. We project that such a detector can reach sub-eV nuclear recoil energy threshold, opening up new windows on the parameter space of both spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions of light dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Absence of barren plateaus in finite local-depth circuits with long-range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ground state preparation is classically intractable for general Hamiltonians. On quantum devices, shallow parameterized circuits can be effectively trained to obtain short-range entangled states under the paradigm of variational quantum eigensolver, while deep circuits are generally untrainable due to the barren plateau phenomenon. In this Letter, we give a general lower bound on the variance of circuit gradients for arbitrary quantum circuits composed of local 2-designs. Based on our unified framework, we prove the absence of barren plateaus in training finite local-depth circuits (FLDC) for the ground states of local Hamiltonians. FLDCs are allowed to be deep in the conventional circuit depth to generate long-range entangled ground states, such as topologically ordered states, but their local depths are finite, i.e., there is only a finite number of gates acting on individual qubits. This characteristic sets FLDC apart from shallow circuits: FLDC in general cannot be classically simulated to estimate local observables efficiently by existing tensor network methods in two and higher dimensions. We validate our analytical results with extensive numerical simulations and demonstrate the effectiveness of variational training using the generalized toric code model.</description>
