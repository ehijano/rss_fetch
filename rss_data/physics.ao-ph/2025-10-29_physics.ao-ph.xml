      <title>Global sonde datasets do not support a mesoscale transition in the turbulent energy cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conceptual and theoretical models describing the dynamics of the atmosphere often assume a hierarchy of dynamic regimes, each operating over some limited range of spatial scales. The largest scales are presumed to be governed by quasi-two-dimensional geostrophic turbulence, mesoscale dynamics by gravity waves, and the smallest scales by 3D isotropic turbulence. In theory, this hierarchy should be observable as clear scale breaks in turbulent kinetic energy spectra as one physical mechanism transitions to the next. Here, we show that this view is not supported by global dropsonde and radiosonde datasets of horizontal winds. Instead, the structure function for horizontal wind calculated for vertical separations between 200 m and 8 km has a Hurst exponent of $H_v \approx 0.6$, which is inconsistent with either gravity waves ($H_v = 1$) or 3D turbulence ($H_v = 1/3$). For horizontal separations between 200 km and 1800 km, the Hurst exponent is $H_h \approx 0.4$, which is inconsistent with quasi-geostrophic dynamics ($H_h = 1$). We argue that sonde observations are most consistent with a lesser known "Lovejoy-Schertzer" model for stratified turbulence where, at all scales, the dynamics of the atmosphere obey a single anisotropic turbulent cascade with $H_v=3/5$ and $H_h =1/3$. While separation scales smaller than 200 m are not explored here due to measurement limitations, the analysis nonetheless supports a single cohesive theoretical framework for describing atmospheric dynamics, one that might substitute for the more traditional hierarchy of mechanisms that depends on spatial scale.</description>

      <title>Forecasting precipitation in the Arctic using probabilistic machine learning informed by causal climate drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and forecasting precipitation events in the Arctic maritime environments, such as Bear Island and Ny-{\AA}lesund, is crucial for assessing climate risk and developing early warning systems in vulnerable marine regions. This study proposes a probabilistic machine learning framework for modeling and predicting the dynamics and severity of precipitation. We begin by analyzing the scale-dependent relationships between precipitation and key atmospheric drivers (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, cloud cover, and air pressure) using wavelet coherence, which captures localized dependencies across time and frequency domains. To assess joint causal influences, we employ Synergistic-Unique-Redundant Decomposition, which quantifies the impact of interaction effects among each variable on future precipitation dynamics. These insights inform the development of data-driven forecasting models that incorporate both historical precipitation and causal climate drivers. To account for uncertainty, we employ the conformal prediction method, which enables the generation of calibrated non-parametric prediction intervals. Our results underscore the importance of utilizing a comprehensive framework that combines causal analysis with probabilistic forecasting to enhance the reliability and interpretability of precipitation predictions in Arctic marine environments.</description>

      <title>From Novice to Expert in Cloud Physics: a Graph-Based Analysis of Learner Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06479v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how learners conceptualise complex scientific systems remains a key challenge in geoscience education. We investigate the evolution of conceptual understanding of cloud physics among 153 learners, ranging from bachelor students to disciplinary experts and representing diverse academic backgrounds across STEM. To do so, we trace how knowledge structures evolve over time using metrics from a cross-sectional network analysis. The analysis characterises the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the epistemological shift that learners experience as they mature in their understanding of the discipline. We show that in their description of the life-cycle of a cloud, they progressively transition from the general physics of the water cycle to detailed descriptions of cloud microphysical processes. A triangulation of data sources with a panel of experts complements and confirms the analysis. The results can assist lecturers in structuring their teaching towards higher levels of understanding and enable students to anticipate the key complexities and conceptual challenges in the field during their learning process. Furthermore, the generic nature of the analysis can be transferred to a wide range of disciplines.</description>
