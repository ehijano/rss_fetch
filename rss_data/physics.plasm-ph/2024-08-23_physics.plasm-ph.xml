      <title>Non-local, diamagnetic electromagnetic effects in long MITLs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the physics responsible for the critical reduction of current losses in magnetically insulated transmission lines (MITLs) before magnetic (self-) insulation has been established. Focusing on time-dependent physics, a drive current with a prototypical sine squared temporal profile introduces sufficiently strong time dependence that steady state results alone become insufficient for the complete understanding of current losses. We find that the effects of time dependence are most pronounced in long MITLs, i.e., MITLs in which an electromagnetic wave traverses its length in time comparable to the current pulse length. The time-dependent physics can be described as non-local, diamagnetic electromagnetic response of space charge limited currents. As the length of the MITL is reduced (in the above sense), current losses converge to those based on the well known Child-Langmuir law in static external fields. We present a simple one-dimensional (1D) model that encapsulates the essence of this physics. We find excellent agreement with 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations for two MITL geometries, Cartesian parallel plate and azimuthally symmetric straight coaxial. Based on the 1D model, we explore various scaling dependencies of current losses with relevant parameters, e.g., peak current, peak pulse time, geometrical dimensions, etc. We also propose an improved physics model of magnetic insulation, which could help improve predictions of current losses by common circuit element codes, such as BERTHA. Lastly, we describe how to calculate temperature rise due to electron impact, as a diagnostic within the 1D model.

      <title>Evaluating ion dynamics through Coulomb and Yukawa interaction potentials in one component strongly coupled plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric pressure helium plasmas are investigated employing molecular dynamics simulations at room temperature (300 K) for various ionization fractions ($\chi_i = 10^{-1} - 10^{-5}$) in the strongly coupled regime (ion coupling parameter, $\Gamma_i \sim 1 - 10$). The role of electron screening in ion dynamics and energetics is examined through ion and gas temperatures, mean squared displacement of ions, ion coupling parameter, and radial distribution function of the system by implementing both Coulomb and Yukawa potentials for ionic interactions. It is found that electron screening in the Yukawa potential limits the disorder-induced heating (DIH) mechanism and the coupling strength of the ions significantly for strongly ionized plasmas (ionization fraction, $\chi_i$ $\ge 10^{-3}$). Whereas, the ions show a prominent sub-diffusive behavior for the Coulomb potential that is associated with the DIH mechanism. DIH is explained using a simplified model based on energy conservation. Moreover, the screening effect affects the separation distance and arrangement of the ion-neutral pairs for all the values of $\chi_i$.</description>

      <title>Physics of the low momentum diffusivity regime in tokamaks and its experimental applicability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong $E\times B$ plasma flow shear is beneficial for reducing turbulent transport. However, traditional methods of driving flow shear do not scale well to large devices such as future fusion power plants. In this paper, we use a large number of nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations to study a novel approach to increase flow shear: decreasing the momentum diffusivity to make the plasma ``easier to push''. We first use an idealized circular geometry and find that one can obtain low momentum diffusivity at tight aspect ratio, low safety factor, high magnetic shear and low temperature gradient. This is the so-called Low Momentum Diffusivity (LMD) regime. To drive intrinsic momentum flux, we then tilt the flux surface, making it up-down asymmetric. In the LMD regime, this intrinsic momentum flux drives strong flow shear that can significantly reduce the heat flux and increase the critical temperature gradient. We also consider the actual experimental geometry of the MAST tokamak to illustrate that this strategy can be practical and create experimentally significant flow shear. Lastly, a preliminary prediction for the SMART tokamak is made.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Induced Ion Trapping Around Dust Particle in Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the binary collision between an ion and a charged dust particle in the plasma in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. The trajectories of ions are calculated using the modified Velocity Verlet algorithm designed for a reliable simulation of the charged particle dynamics in arbitrarily strong static homogeneous external magnetic fields. We consider the coupling parameter values characteristic for dusty plasma experiments and the external magnetic field with $B\leq 1~{\rm T}$. It has been revealed that at some magnetic field values, the ions are trapped around the charged dust particle. The magnetic field strength values in which the ion becomes trapped around the dust particle have been obtained for typical argon and helium gas discharge plasma parameters.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Alternator for the Onset of Large-Scale Magnetic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field configurations extending over macroscopic scale distances are shown to be generated in rarefied collisionless plasmas when non-thermal and spatially inhomogeneous electron distributions in phase space emerge. The analyzed representative case is where, in the presence of a significant spatial gradient of the electron pressure and of a sheared magnetic field configuration, an alternating magnetic field reconnection process can develop associated with the anisotropy of the fluctuating electron temperature. The relevant process is intrinsically different from that known as the Biermann Battery which does not involve magnetic reconnection and requires that the unperturbed spatial gradient of the (isotropic) electron temperature be misaligned relative to that of the density gradient.</description>

      <title>Scale Statistics of Current Sheets in Relativistic Collisionless Plasma Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze distributions of the spatial scales of coherent intermittent structures -- current sheets -- obtained from fully kinetic, two-dimensional simulations of relativistic plasma turbulence using unsupervised machine-learning data dissection. We find that the distribution functions of sheet length $\ell$ (longest scale of the analyzed structure in the direction perpendicular to the dominant guide field) and curvature $r_c$ (radius of a circle fitted to the structures) can be well-approximated by power-law distributions, indicating self-similarity of the structures. The distribution for the sheet width $w$ (shortest scale of the structure) peaks at the kinetic scales and decays exponentially at larger values. The data shows little or no correlation between $w$ and $\ell$, as expected from theoretical considerations. The typical $r_c$ depends linearly on $\ell$, which indicates that the sheets all have a similar curvature relative to their sizes. We find a weak correlation between $r_c$ and $w$. Our results can be used to inform realistic magnetohydrodynamic sub-grid models for plasma turbulence in high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear modulation of dispersive fast magnetosonic waves in an inhomogeneous rotating solar low-$\beta$ magnetoplasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the modulation of fast magnetosonic waves (MSWs) in rotating inhomogeneous low-$\beta$ magnetoplasmas with the effects of gravitation and the Coriolis force. By employing the standard multiple-scale reductive perturbation technique (RPT), we derive a nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation that governs the evolution of slowly varying MSW envelopes. The fast MSW becomes dispersive by the effects of the Coriolis force in the fluid motion, and the magnetic field and density inhomogeneity effects favor the Jeans instability in self-gravitating plasmas in a larger domain of the wave number ($k$, below the Jeans critical wave number, $k_J$) than homogeneous plasmas. The relative influence of the Jeans frequency ($\omega_J$, associated with the gravitational force) and the angular frequency ($\Omega_0$, relating to the Coriolis force) on the Jeans carrier MSW mode and the modulational instability (MI) of the MSW envelope is studied. We show that the MSW envelope (corresponding to the unstable carrier Jeans mode with $\omega_J&gt;2\Omega_0$ and $k&lt;k_J$) is always unstable against the plane wave perturbation with no cut-offs for growth rates. In contrast, the stable Jeans mode with $\omega_J&gt;2\Omega_0$ but $k&gt;k_J$ manifests either modulational stability or MI having a finite growth rate before being cut off. We find an enhancement of the MI growth rate by the influence of magnetic field or density inhomogeneity. The case with constant gravity force (other than the self-gravity) perpendicular to the magnetic field is also briefly discussed to show that the fast magnetosonic carrier mode is always unstable, giving MI of slowly varying envelopes with no cut-offs for the growth rates. Possible applications of MI in solar plasmas, such as those in the X-ray corona, are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Relaxation model for a homogeneous plasma with spherically symmetric velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the transport equations from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation when the velocity space is spherically symmetric. The Shkarofsky form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth collision operator is employed in the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. A relaxation model for homogeneous plasma could be presented in closed form in terms of Gauss HyperGeometric2F1 functions. This has been accomplished based on the Maxwellian mixture model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classic models such as two-temperature thermal equilibrium model, Braginskii model and thermodynamic equilibrium model are special cases of our relaxation model. The present relaxation model is a nonequilibrium model which is under the assumption that the plasma system possesses finitely distinguishable independent features, but it is not relying on the conventional near-equilibrium assumption.</description>
