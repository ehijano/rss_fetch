      <title>MgO Miscibility in Liquid Iron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore phase equilbria on the MgO-Fe join as a prototype of lithophile-core interaction in terrestrial planets. Our simulations, based on density functional theory, are based on a two-phase method: fluids of initially pure MgO and Fe compositions are allowed to establish a dynamic equilbrium across a near-planar interface. Methods for analyzing the composition and other properties of the two coexisting phases show that MgO behaves as a component, with indistinguishable Mg and O concentrations in Fe-rich and oxide-rich phases. The phase diagram is well described as that of a symmetric regular solution, a picture confirmed by independent one-phase determinations of the enthalpy, entropy, and volume of mixing. The critical temperature, above which there is complete miscibility across the MgO-Fe join is 7000 K at 68 GPa, and 9000 K and 172 GPa. The rate of MgO exsolution from the Fe-rich liquid on cooling is similar to that found in previous experimental studies, and is too small to drive a dynamo.</description>

      <title>DNN-based workflow for attenuating seismic interference noise and its application to marine towed streamer data from the Northern Viking Graben</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To separate seismic interference (SI) noise while ensuring high signal fidelity, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based workflow applied to common shot gathers (CSGs). In our design, a small subset of the entire to-be-processed data set is first processed by a conventional algorithm to obtain an estimate of the SI noise (from now on called the SI noise model). By manually blending the SI noise model with SI-free CSGs and a set of simulated random noise, we obtain training inputs for the DNN. The SI-free CSGs can be either real SI-free CSGs from the survey or SI-attenuated CSGs produced in parallel with the SI noise model from the conventional algorithm depending on the specific project. To enhance the DNN's output signal fidelity, adjacent shots on both sides of the to-be-processed shot are used as additional channels of the input. We train the DNN to output the SI noise into one channel and the SI-free shot along with the intact random noise into another. Once trained, the DNN can be applied to the entire data set contaminated by the same types of SI in the training process, producing results efficiently. For demonstration, we applied the proposed DNN-based workflow to 3D seismic field data acquired from the Northern Viking Graben (NVG) of the North Sea, and compared it with a conventional algorithm. The studied area has a challenging SI contamination problem with no sail lines free from SI noise during the acquisition. The comparison shows that the proposed DNN-based workflow outperformed the conventional algorithm in processing quality with less noise residual and better signal preservation. This validates its feasibility and value for real processing projects.</description>

      <title>A convolutional neural network approach to deblending seismic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For economic and efficiency reasons, blended acquisition of seismic data is becoming more and more commonplace. Seismic deblending methods are always computationally demanding and normally consist of multiple processing steps. Besides, the parameter setting is not always trivial. Machine learning-based processing has the potential to significantly reduce processing time and to change the way seismic deblending is carried out. We present a data-driven deep learning-based method for fast and efficient seismic deblending. The blended data are sorted from the common source to the common channel domain to transform the character of the blending noise from coherent events to incoherent distributions. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed according to the special character of seismic data, and performs deblending with comparable results to those obtained with conventional industry deblending algorithms. To ensure authenticity, the blending was done numerically and only field seismic data were employed, including more than 20000 training examples. After training and validation of the network, seismic deblending can be performed in near real time. Experiments also show that the initial signal to noise ratio (SNR) is the major factor controlling the quality of the final deblended result. The network is also demonstrated to be robust and adaptive by using the trained model to firstly deblend a new data set from a different geological area with a slightly different delay time setting, and secondly deblend shots with blending noise in the top part of the data.</description>

      <title>Short-range order stabilizes a cubic Fe alloy in Earth's inner core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase diagram and sound velocities of the Fe-Si binary alloy, crucial for understanding the Earth's core, are determined at inner core boundary pressure with \textit{ab-initio} accuracy through deep-learning-aided hybrid Monte Carlo simulations. A complex phase diagram emerges close to the melting temperature, where a re-entrance of the body-centered cubic (bcc) phase is observed. The bcc structure is stabilized by a pronounced short-range ordering of the Si atoms. The miscibility gap between the short-range ordered bcc structure and the long-range ordered cubic B2 structure shrinks with increasing temperature and the transition becomes continuous above 6000 K. We find that a bcc Fe-Si solid solution reproduces crucial geophysical data such as the low shear sound velocity and the seismic anisotropy of the inner core much better than other structures.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of marine seismic interference noise employing a customized U-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Marine seismic interference noise occurs when energy from nearby marine seismic source vessels is recorded during a seismic survey. Such noise tends to be well preserved over large distances and cause coherent artifacts in the recorded data. Over the years, the industry has developed various denoising techniques for seismic interference removal, but although well performing they are still time-consuming in use. Machine-learning based processing represents an alternative approach, which may significantly improve the computational efficiency. In case of conventional images, autoencoders are frequently employed for denoising purposes. However, due to the special characteristics of seismic data as well as the noise, autoencoders failed in the case of marine seismic interference noise. We therefore propose the use of a customized U-Net design with element-wise summation as part of the skip-connection blocks to handle the vanishing gradient problem and to ensure information fusion between high- and low-level features. To secure a realistic study, only seismic field data were employed, including 25000 training examples. The customized U-Net was found to perform well leaving only minor residuals, except for the case when seismic interference noise comes from the side. We further demonstrate that such noise can be treated by slightly increasing the depth of our network. Although our customized U-Net does not outperform a standard commercial algorithm in quality, it can (after proper training) read and process one single shot gather in approximately 0.02s. This is significantly faster than any existing industry denoising algorithm. In addition, the proposed network processes shot gathers in a sequential order, which is an advantage compared with industry algorithms that typically require a multi-shot input to break the coherency of the noise.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Taylor-Proudman constraint explains the flows into the Tangent Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tangent Cylinders (TCs) have shaped our understanding of planetary dynamos and liquid cores. The Taylor-Proudman Constraint (TPC) due to planetary rotation creates these imaginary surfaces separating polar and equatorial regions but cannot explain the flows meandering through them. Here we establish and verify experimentally that magnetic fields aligned with rotation drive flows \emph{into} TCs, linked to the flows \emph{along} TCs by a \emph{magnetic} Taylor-Proudman constraint. This constraint explains and quantifies how magnetic fields reshape rotating flows in planetary interiors and magnetorotating flows in general.</description>

      <title>DINOv2 Rocks Geological Image Analysis: Classification, Segmentation, and Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision have significantly improved image analysis tasks. Yet, deep learning models often struggle when applied to domains outside their training distribution, such as in geosciences, where domain-specific data can be scarce. This study investigates the classification, segmentation, and interpretability of CT-scan images of rock samples, focusing on the application of modern computer vision techniques to geoscientific tasks. We compare a range of segmentation methods to assess their efficacy, efficiency, and adaptability in geological image analysis. The methods evaluated include Otsu thresholding, clustering techniques (K-means, fuzzy C-means), a supervised machine learning approach (Random Forest), and deep learning models (UNet, ResNet152, and DINOv2), using ten binary sandstone datasets and three multi-class calcite datasets. DINOv2 was selected for its promising results in feature extraction and its potential applicability in geoscientific tasks, prompting further assessment of its interpretability and effectiveness in processing CT-scanned rock data. For classification, a non-fine-tuned DINOv2 demonstrates strong performance in classifying rock images, even when the CT-scans are outside its original training set. In segmentation tasks, thresholding and clustering techniques, though computationally efficient, produce subpar results despite preprocessing efforts. In contrast, supervised methods achieve better performance. While deep learning methods demand greater computational resources, they require minimal intervention and offer superior generalization. A LoRA fine-tuned DINOv2, in particular, excels in out-of-distribution segmentation and outperforms other methods in multi-class tasks, even with limited data. Notably, the segmentation masks generated by DINOv2 often appear more accurate than the original targets, based on visual inspection.</description>
