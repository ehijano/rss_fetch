      <title>Quench Spectroscopy for Dissipative and Non-Hermitian Quantum Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the open Bose-Hubbard chain confined in the superfluid phase submitted to a sudden global quench on the dissipations and the repulsive interactions. The latter is investigated by calculating the equations of motion of relevant quadratic correlators permitting to study the equal-time connected one-body and density-density correlations functions. We then compute the quench spectral function associated to each observable to perform the quench spectroscopy of this dissipative quantum lattice model. This permits to unveil the quasiparticle dispersion relation of the Bose-Hubbard chain in the superfluid phase in the presence of loss processes. The applicability of the quench spectroscopy is also generalized to non-Hermitian quantum lattice models by considering the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain in the paramagnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Field-induced quantum interference of inelastic scattering in ultracold atomic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: xploiting quantum interference remains a significant challenge in ultracold inelastic scattering. In this work, we propose a method to enable detectable quantum interference within the two-body loss rate resulting from various inelastic scattering channels. Our approach utilizes a ``ring-coupling" configuration, achieved by combining external radio-frequency and static electric fields during ultracold atomic collisions. We conduct close-coupling calculations for $^7$Li-$^{41}$K collisions at ultracold limit to validate our proposal. The results show that the interference profile displayed in two-body loss rate is unable to be observed with unoptimized external field parameters. Particularly, our findings demonstrate that the two-body loss rate coefficient exhibits distinct constructive and destructive interference patterns near the magnetically induced $p$-wave resonance in the incoming channel near which a rf-induced scattering resonance exists. These interference patterns become increasingly pronounced with greater intensities of the external fields. This work opens a new avenue for controlling inelastic scattering processes in ultracold collisions.</description>

      <title>Chirally-protected state manipulation by tuning one-dimensional statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is broken by typical interactions in lattice models, but the statistical interactions embodied in the anyon-Hubbard model are an exception. It is an example of a correlated hopping model in which chiral symmetry protects a degenerate zero-energy subspace. Complementary to the traditional approach of anyon braiding in real space, we adiabatically evolve the statistical parameter in the anyon-Hubbard model and we find non-trivial Berry phases and holonomies in this chiral subspace. The corresponding states possess stationary checkerboard pattern in their $N$-particle densities which are preserved under adiabatic manipulation. We give an explicit protocol for how these chirally-protected zero energy states can be prepared, observed, validated, and controlled.</description>

      <title>Bose-Hubbard model with power-law hopping in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-temperature phase diagram of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ using exact large scale Quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. For all $1&lt;\alpha\leq 3$ the quantum phase transition from a superfluid and a Mott insulator at unit filling is found to be continuous and scale invariant, in a way incompatible with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) scenario, which is recovered for $\alpha&gt;3$. We characterise the new universality class by providing the critical exponents by means of data collapse analysis near the critical point for each $\alpha$ and from careful analysis of the spectrum. Large-scale simulations of the grand canonical phase diagram and of the decay of correlation functions demonstrate an overall behavior akin to higher dimensional systems with long-range order in the ground state for $\alpha \leq 2$ and intermediate between one and higher dimensions for $2&lt;\alpha \leq 3$. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark to compare theories of long-range quantum models and are relevant for experiments with cold neutral atom, molecules and ion chains.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear coherent modes and atom optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By pumping energy into a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate it is possible to generate nonlinear coherent modes representing non-ground-state condensates. A Bose-condensed system of trapped atoms with nonlinear coherent modes is analogous to a finite-level atom considered in optics which can be excited by applying external fields. The excitation of finite-level atoms produces a variety of optical phenomena. In the similar way, the generation of nonlinear coherent modes in a trapped condensate results in many phenomena studied in what is termed atom optics. For example, there occur such effects as interference patterns, interference current, Rabi oscillations, harmonic generation, parametric conversion, Ramsey fringes, mode locking, and a dynamic transition between Rabi and Josephson regimes. The possibility of creating mesoscopic entangled states of trapped atoms and entanglement production by atomic states in optical lattices are studied.</description>

      <title>Induced three-neutron interactions with low cutoffs for dilute neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of dilute neutron matter are mostly determined by the s-wave two-body (2N) interaction, while three-body (3N) interactions are suppressed by the Pauli principle. In a previous work, we showed that it can be advantageous to use the renormalization group based effective interactions with cutoffs scaled with the Fermi momentum, especially at low densities. In that case, induced 3N interactions may become important. In this work, we compute the 3N interaction induced by the similarity renormalization group flow of the s-wave 2N interaction. We work in the momentum-space hyperspherical partial wave basis and investigate its convergence properties. Then we study the effect of the induced 3N interaction on the equation of state of dilute neutron matter. We observe that the cutoff dependence of the equation of state is strongly reduced when the effect of induced 3N interaction is included.</description>

      <title>Floquet driven long-range interactions induce super-extensive scaling in quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving quantum advantage in energy storage and power extraction is a primary objective in the design of quantum-based batteries. We explore how long-range (LR) interactions in conjunction with Floquet driving can improve the performance of quantum batteries, particularly when the battery is initialized in a fully polarized state. In particular, we exhibit that by optimizing the driving frequency, the maximum average power scales super extensively with system-size which is not achievable through next-nearest neighbor interactions or traditional unitary charging, thereby gaining genuine quantum advantage. We illustrate that the inclusion of either two-body or many-body interaction terms in the LR charging Hamiltonian leads to a scaling benefit. Furthermore, we discover that a super-linear scaling in power results from increasing the strength of interaction compared to the transverse magnetic field and the range of interaction with low fall-off rate, highlighting the advantageous role of long-range interactions in optimizing quantum battery charging.</description>

      <title>Universal Spreading Dynamics in Quasiperiodic Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive type of wave propagation, due to the intricate interplay of non-Hermiticity and disorder. Here, we investigate the spreading dynamics in the archetypal non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model with quasiperiodic disorder. We uncover counter-intuitive transport behaviors: subdiffusion with a spreading exponent $\delta=1/3$ in the localized regime and diffusion with $\delta=1/2$ in the delocalized regime, in stark contrast to their Hermitian counterparts (halted vs. ballistic). We then establish a unified framework from random-variable perspective to determine the universal scaling relations in both regimes for generic disordered non-Hermitian systems. An efficient method is presented to extract the spreading exponents from Lyapunov exponents. The observed subdiffusive or diffusive transport in our model stems from Van Hove singularities at the tail of imaginary density of states, as corroborated by Lyapunov-exponent analysis.</description>

      <title>Condensation dynamics in a two-dimensional photonic crystal waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polariton condensation occurs at the extrema of the underlying dispersion where the density of states diverges and carriers can naturally accumulate. The existence of multiple such points leads to coupling and competition between the associated modes and dynamical redistribution of the carriers in the dispersion. Here, we directly engineer the above situation via subwavelength periodic patterning of a two-dimensional nanostructure. This leads to multimode condensation into a pair of symmetric condensates that form at high-momenta, accidental-coupling points, and a high-symmetry $\Gamma$-point with a bound-in-the-continuum (BiC) state. The dynamical behaviour of the system reveals the non-simultaneous appearance of these condensates and the interplay of non-trivial gain and relaxation mechanisms. We fully characterise the quasi-static and dynamical regime of this artificial crystal and the properties of the different condensates. This understanding is necessary when band-structure engineering techniques are used to achieve precise control of condensate formation with given energy and momentum.</description>

      <title>Dark state transport between unitary Fermi superfluids</title>

Abstract: The formation of dark states is an important concept in quantum sciences, but its compatibility with strong interparticle interactions -- for example, in a quantum degenerate gas -- is hardly explored. Here, we realize a dark state in one of the spins of a two-component, resonantly interacting Fermi gas using a $\Lambda$ system within the $D_2$ transitions of $^6$Li at high magnetic field. The dark state is created in a micrometer-sized region within a one-dimensional channel connecting two superfluid reservoirs. The particle transport between the reservoirs is used as a probe. We observe that atoms are transported in the dark state and the superfluid-assisted fast current is preserved. If the dark state resonant condition is not met, the transport is suppressed by the spontaneous emission. We also uncover an asymmetry in the transport timescale across the two-photon resonance, which is absent in the non-interacting regime and diminished at higher temperatures. This work raises questions on the interplay of dark states with interparticle interactions and opens up perspectives for optical manipulation of fermionic pairing.</description>

      <title>Extracting the symmetries of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetries play a pivotal role in our understanding of the properties of quantum many-body systems. While there are theorems and a well-established toolbox for systems in thermal equilibrium, much less is known about the role of symmetries and their connection to dynamics out of equilibrium. This arises due to the direct link between a system's thermal state and its Hamiltonian, which is generally not the case for nonequilibrium dynamics. Here we present a pathway to identify the effective symmetries and to extract them from data in nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems. Our approach is based on exact relations between correlation functions involving different numbers of spatial points, which can be viewed as nonequilibrium versions of (equal-time) Ward identities encoding the symmetries of the system. We derive symmetry witnesses, which are particularly suitable for the analysis of measured or simulated data at different snapshots in time. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we apply our method to numerical and experimental data for a spinor Bose gas. We investigate the important question of a dynamical restoration of an explicitly broken symmetry of the Hamiltonian by the initial state. Remarkably, it is found that effective symmetry restoration can occur long before the system equilibrates. We also use the approach to define and identify spontaneous symmetry breaking far from equilibrium, which is of great relevance for applications to nonequilibrium phase transitions. Our work opens new avenues for the classification and analysis of quantum as well as classical many-body dynamics in a large variety of systems, ranging from ultracold quantum gases to cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circular atomtronics is known to exhibit a uniform ground state, unlike elliptical atomtronics. In elliptical atomtronics, the matter wave tends to accumulate along the semimajor edges during its time dynamics, which we depict by the survival function. Consequently, the dynamical time scales become coupled to the eccentricity, making the dynamics nontrivial for applications. We report that an appropriate dispersion management can decouple the time scales from the eccentricity. One can choose the suitable dispersion coefficient from the overlap function involving the corresponding ground state. We focus on producing distinct fractional matter waves inside an elliptical waveguide to achieve efficient atom interferometry. The said dispersion engineering can recover fractional revivals in the elliptical waveguide, analogous to the circular case. We demonstrate atom interferometry for the engineered elliptical atomtronics, where matter wave interference is mediated by an external harmonic trap for controlled interference patterns.</description>

      <title>Matsubara-Frequency-Resolved Spin Exchange-Correlation Kernel for the Three-Dimensional Uniform Electron Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems and can be characterized by the exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the spin channel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,\omega)$. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we compute the Matsubara-frequency-resolved spin XC kernel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,i\omega_n)$ for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas at sufficiently low temperatures with high precision. In the long-wavelength limit, we identified a singular behavior of the form $A(i\omega_n)/q^2$, confirming the theoretically predicted ultranonlocal behavior associated with spin Coulomb drag. Analysis of this structure in the low frequency region enables precise determination of two crucial parameters characterizing the spin Coulomb drag effect: the spin mass enhancement factor and spin diffusion relaxation time. We observe a significant trend of increasing enhancement of the spin mass factor with decreasing electron density, and provide clear evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures. These quantitative findings advance our understanding of Coulomb interaction effects on spin transport and provide essential parameters for time-dependent density functional theory and spintronics applications.</description>

Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer and vertex models, toric code, and certain Levin-Wen string-net models. We also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>
