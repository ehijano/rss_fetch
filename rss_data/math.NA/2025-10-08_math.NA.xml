      <title>Finite element approximation to linear, second order, parabolic problems with $L^1$ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the approximation to the solution of the initial boundary value problem for the heat equation with right hand side and initial condition that merely belong to $L^1$. Due to the low integrability of the data, to guarantee well-posedness, we must understand solutions in the renormalized sense. We prove that, under an inverse CFL condition, the solution of the standard implicit Euler scheme with mass lumping converges, in $L^\infty(0,T;L^1(\Omega))$ and $L^q(0,T;W^{1,q}_0(\Omega))$ ($q&lt;\tfrac{d+2}{d+1}$), to the renormalized solution of the problem.</description>

      <title>Domain Decomposition-Based Coupling of High-Fidelity Finite Element and Reduced Order Operator Inference Models Using the Schwarz Alternating Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel hybrid domain decomposition method that couples sub-domain-local high-fidelity finite element (FE) models with reduced order models (ROMs) using the Schwarz alternating method. By integrating the noninstrusive Operator Inference (OpInf) ROM, our approach accelerates the Schwarz process while allowing for geometry and mesh flexibility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new OpInf-FE method on a convection-dominated convection-diffusion-reaction problem, achieving stable and accurate predictive solutions while improving the ROM training process.</description>

      <title>A highly efficient second-order accurate long-time dynamics preserving scheme for some geophysical fluid models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a highly efficient, second-order time-marching scheme for infinite-dimensional nonlinear geophysical fluid models, designed to accurately approximate invariant measures-that is, the stationary statistical properties (or climate) of the underlying dynamical system. Beyond second-order accuracy in time, the scheme is particularly well suited for long-time simulations due to two key features: it requires solving only a fixed symmetric positive-definite linear system with constant coefficients at each step; and it guarantees long-time stability, producing uniformly bounded solutions in time for any bounded external forcing, regardless of initial data. For prototypical models such as the barotropic quasi-geostrophic equation, the method preserves dissipativity, ensuring that numerical solutions remain bounded in a function space compactly embedded in the phase space as time tends to infinity. Leveraging this property, we rigorously prove convergence of both global attractors and invariant measures of the discrete system to those of the continuous model in the vanishing time-step limit. A central innovation of the method is a mean-reverting scalar auxiliary variable (mr-SAV) formulation, which preserves the dissipative structure of externally forced systems within an appropriate phase space. For the infinite-dimensional models considered, we additionally employ fractional-order function spaces to establish compactness of numerical solutions in topologies compatible with the phase space.</description>

      <title>Finite element analysis of an eigenvalue problem arising from neutron transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two and three dimensions, we analyze a finite element method to approximate the solutions of an eigenvalue problem arising from neutron transport. We derive the eigenvalue problem of interest, which results to be non-symmetric. Under a standard finite element approximation based on piecewise polynomials of degree $k \geq 1$, and under the framework of the compact operators theory, we prove convergence and error estimates of the proposed method. We report a series of numerical tests in order confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A convergent adaptive finite element method for a phase-field model of dynamic fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an adaptive finite element method for a phase-field model of dynamic brittle fracture. The model couples a second-order hyperbolic equation for elastodynamics with the Ambrosio-Tortorelli regularization of the Francfort-Marigo variational fracture energy, which circumvents the need for explicit crack tracking. Our numerical scheme combines a staggered time-stepping algorithm with a variational inequality formulation to strictly enforce the irreversibility of damage. The mesh adaptation is driven by a residual-based a posteriori-type estimator, enabling efficient resolution of the evolving fracture process zone. The main theoretical contribution is a rigorous convergence analysis, where we prove that the sequence of discrete solutions generated by the AFEM converges (up to a tolerance) to a critical point of the governing energy functional. Numerical experiments for a two-dimensional domain containing an edge-crack under dynamic anti-plane shear loading demonstrate our method's capability of autonomously capturing complex phenomena, including crack branching and tortuosity, with significant computational savings over uniform refinement.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Filtering of the Spherical Harmonics Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a data-driven approach for tuning the filtered spherical harmonics method (\fpn) when solving the radiation transport equation (RTE). The \fpn method extends the classical spherical harmonics approach (\pn) by introducing regularization through a filter operator, which mitigates spurious oscillations caused by Gibbs' phenomenon. This filter includes a tunable parameter, the {filter strength}, that controls the degree of smoothing applied to the solution. However, selecting an optimal filter strength is nontrivial, often requiring inaccessible information such as the true or a high-order reference solution. To overcome this limitation, we model the filter strength as a neural network whose inputs include local state variables and material cross-sections. The optimal filter strength is formulated as the solution to a PDE-constrained optimization problem, and the neural network is trained using a discretize-then-optimize formulation in PyTorch. We evaluate the learned filter strength across a suite of test problems and compare the results to those from a simple, but tunable constant filter strength. In all cases, the neural-network-driven filter substantially improves the accuracy of the \pn approximation. For 1-D test cases, the constant filter outperforms the neural-network filter in some cases, but in 2-D problems, the neural-network filter generally performs better.</description>

      <title>Optimal $L^2$ Error Estimates for Non-symmetric Nitsche's Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish optimal $L^2$-error estimates for the non-symmetric Nitsche method. Existing analyses yield only suboptimal $L^2$ convergence, in contrast to consistently optimal numerical results. We resolve this discrepancy by introducing a specially constructed dual problem that restores adjoint consistency. Our analysis covers both super-penalty and penalty-free variants on quasi-uniform meshes, as well as the practically important case on general shape-regular meshes without quasi-uniformity. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions confirm the sharpness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A finite element model for thermomechanical stress-strain fields in transversely isotropic strain-limiting materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive computational framework for investigating thermo-elastic fracture in transversely isotropic materials, where classical linear elasticity fails to predict physically realistic behavior near stress concentrations. We address the challenge of unphysical strain singularities at crack tips by employing a strain-limiting theory of elasticity. This theory is characterized by an algebraically nonlinear constitutive relationship between stress and strain, which intrinsically enforces a limit on the norm of the strain tensor. This approach allows the development of very large stresses, as expected near a crack tip, while ensuring that the corresponding strains remain physically bounded. A loosely coupled system of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations governing the response of a thermo-mechanical transversely isotropic solid is formulated. We develop a robust numerical solution based on the finite element method, utilizing a conforming finite element discretization within a continuous Galerkin framework to solve the two-dimensional boundary value problem. The model is applied to analyze the stress and strain fields near an edge crack under severe thermo-mechanical loading. Our numerical results reveal a significant departure from classical predictions: while stress concentrates intensely at the crack tip, the strain grows at a substantially slower rate and remains bounded throughout the domain. This work validates the efficacy of the strain-limiting model in regularizing thermo-elastic crack-tip fields and establishes a reliable computational foundation for the predictive modeling of thermally driven crack initiation and evolution in advanced anisotropic materials.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Boundary Data in the Helmholtz Equation Using Particle Swarm Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the data completion problem related to the Helmholtz equation. The goal is to identify unknown boundary conditions on parts of the boundary that cannot be accessed directly, by making use of measurements collected from accessible regions. Such inverse problems are known to be ill-posed in the Hadamard sense, which makes finding stable and dependable solutions particularly difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a bio-inspired method that combines Particle Swarm Optimization with Tikhonov regularization. The results of our numerical experiments suggest that this approach can yield solutions that are both accurate and stable, converging reliably. Overall, this method provides a promising way to handle the inherent instability and sensitivity of these types of inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Generalized capillary-rise models: existence and fast solvers in integral H\"older spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of nonlinear Volterra integral equations that generalize the classical capillary rise models, allowing for nonsmooth kernels and nonlinearities. To accommodate such generalities, we work in two families of function spaces: spaces with prescribed modulus of continuity and integral H\"older spaces. We establish existence results for solutions within the integral H\"older space framework. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of linear interpolation in these spaces and provide, for the first time, sharp error estimates, demonstrating their optimality. Building on this foundation, we propose a piecewise linear collocation method tailored to solutions in integral H\"older spaces and prove its convergence. For problems admitting smoother solutions, we develop an efficient spectral collocation scheme based on Legendre nodes. Finally, several numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and highlight the performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>A Warm-basis Method for Bridging Learning and Iteration: a Case Study in Fluorescence Molecular Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a widely used non-invasive optical imaging technology in biomedical research. It usually faces significant accuracy challenges in depth reconstruction, and conventional iterative methods struggle with poor $z$-resolution even with advanced regularization. Supervised learning approaches can improve recovery accuracy but rely on large, high-quality paired training dataset that is often impractical to acquire in practice. This naturally raises the question of how learning-based approaches can be effectively combined with iterative schemes to yield more accurate and stable algorithms. In this work, we present a novel warm-basis iterative projection method (WB-IPM) and establish its theoretical underpinnings. The method is able to achieve significantly more accurate reconstructions than the learning-based and iterative-based methods. In addition, it allows a weaker loss function depending solely on the directional component of the difference between ground truth and neural network output, thereby substantially reducing the training effort. These features are justified by our error analysis as well as simulated and real-data experiments.</description>

      <title>A Geometrical Acoustics based Focusing Algorithm for Layered Media in Medical Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a widely used, non-invasive diagnostic tool in modern medicine. A crucial assumption is a constant sound speed in the observed medium. For large scale sound speed variations, this assumption leads to blurred and distorted images. In this paper, we present a Geometrical Acoustics based Focusing Algorithm (GOAT) which is able to correct for these aberrations, given a known layered medium setting with continuously differentiable medium boundaries. Existence and uniqueness conditions for a solution to the underlying system of equations are given. Using numerical simulations, the precision of our method is evaluated. Finally, the resulting image quality improvements are demonstrated in a phantom-based experimental setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic balancing domain decomposition by constraints (BDDC) algorithms are developed and analyzed for the sampling of the solutions of linear stochastic elliptic equations with random coefficients. Different from the deterministic BDDC algorithms, the stochastic BDDC algorithms have online and offline stages. At the offline stage, the Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansions of different components of the BDDC algorithms are constructed based on the subdomain local parametrization of the stochastic coefficients. During the online stage, the sample-dependent BDDC algorithm can be implemented with a small cost. Under some assumptions, the condition number of the stochastic BDDC preconditioned operator is estimated. Numerical experiments confirm the theory and show that the stochastic BDDC algorithm outperforms the BDDC preconditioner constructed using the mean value of the stochastic coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel Bayesian framework for inverse problems in which the pos terior distribution is interpreted as the intensity measure of a Poisson point process
  (PPP). The posterior density is approximated using kernel density estimation, and
  the superposition property of PPPs is then exploited to enable efficient sampling
  from each kernel component. This methodology offers a new means of exploring the
  posterior distribution and facilitates the generation of independent and identically
  distributed samples, thereby enhancing the analysis of inverse problem solutions.</description>

      <title>A curvilinear surface ALE formulation for self-evolving Navier-Stokes manifolds - Stabilized finite element formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a stabilized finite element formulation of the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) surface theory for Navier-Stokes flow on self-evolving manifolds developed in Sauer (2025). The formulation is physically frame-invariant, applicable to large deformations, and relevant to fluidic surfaces such as soap films, capillary menisci and lipid membranes, which are complex and inherently unstable physical systems. It is applied here to area-incompressible surface flows using a stabilized pressure-velocity (or surface tension-velocity) formulation based on quadratic finite elements and implicit time integration. The unknown ALE mesh motion is determined by membrane elasticity such that the in-plane mesh motion is stabilized without affecting the physical behavior of the system. The resulting three-field system is monolithically coupled, and fully linearized within the Newton-Rhapson solution method. The new formulation is demonstrated on several challenging examples including shear flow on self-evolving surfaces and inflating soap bubbles with partial inflow on evolving boundaries. Optimal convergence rates are obtained in all cases. Particularly advantageous are C1-continuous surface discretizations, for example based on NURBS.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo-Type Neural Operator for Differential Equations</title>

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).</description>

      <title>Time-reassigned synchrosqueezing frequency-domain chirplet transform for multicomponent signals with intersecting group delay curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To analyze signals with rapid frequency variations or transient components, the time-reassigned synchrosqueezing transform (TSST) and its variants have been recently proposed. Unlike the traditional synchrosqueezing transform, TSST squeezes the time-frequency (TF) coefficients along the group delay (GD) trajectories rather than the instantaneous frequency trajectories. Although TSST methods perform well in analyzing transient signals, they are fundamentally limited in processing multicomponent signals with intersecting GD curves. This limitation compromises the accuracy of both feature extraction and signal component recovery, thereby significantly reducing the interpretability of time-frequency representations (TFRs). This is particularly problematic in broadband signal processing systems, where the linearity of the phase response is critical and precise measurement of group delay dispersion (GDD) is essential.
  Motivated by the superior capability of frequency-domain signal modeling in characterizing rapidly frequency-varying signals, this paper proposes a novel three-dimensional time-frequency-group delay dispersion (TF-GDD) representation based on the frequency-domain chirplet transform. A subsequent time-reassigned synchrosqueezing frequency-domain chirplet transform (TSFCT) is introduced to achieve a sharper TF-GDD distribution and more accurate GD estimation. For mode retrieval, a novel frequency-domain group signal separation operation (FGSSO) is proposed.The theoretical contributions include a derivation of the approximation error for the GD and GDD reference functions and an establishment of the error bounds for FGSSO-based mode retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TSFCT and FGSSO effectively estimate GDs and retrieve modes--even for modes with intersecting GD trajectories.</description>

Abstract: We present an isogeometric mortar method for the discretization of the biharmonic equation posed on multi-patch domains. We assume only $C^0$-conformity at interfaces and employs a mortar approach to weakly enforce $C^1$-continuity across patch interfaces. Discrete inf-sup stability is ensured by selecting a Lagrange multiplier space consisting of splines of degree reduced by two compared to the primal space, with increased smoothness or merged elements near vertices. We prove optimal a priori error estimates and confirm the theoretical findings with a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>High-Order Integration on regular triangulated manifolds reaches Super-Algebraic Approximation Rates through Cubical Re-parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for deriving high-order volume elements (HOVE) designed for the integration of scalar functions over regular embedded manifolds. For constructing HOVE we introduce square-squeezing --a homeomorphic multilinear hypercube-simplex transformation reparametrizing an initial flat triangulation of the manifold to a cubical mesh. By employing square-squeezing, we approximate the integrand and the volume element for each hypercube domain of the reparameterized mesh through interpolation in Chebyshev-Lobatto grids. This strategy circumvents the Runge phenomenon, replacing the initial integral with a closed-form expression that can be precisely computed by high-order quadratures.
  We prove novel bounds of the integration error in terms of the $r^\text{th}$-order total variation of the integrand and the surface parameterization, predicting high algebraic approximation rates that scale solely with the interpolation degree and not, as is common, with the average simplex size. For smooth integrals whose total variation is constantly bounded with increasing $r$, the estimates prove the integration error to decrease even exponentially, while mesh refinements are limited to achieve algebraic rates. The resulting approximation power is demonstrated in several numerical experiments, particularly showcasing $p$-refinements to overcome the limitations of $h$-refinements for highly varying smooth integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent developments in subdivision schemes founded on the Weighted Least Squares technique, we construct linear approximants for noisy data in which the weighting strategy minimizes the output variance, thereby establishing a direct correspondence with the Generalized Least Squares and the Minimum-Variance Formulas methodologies. By introducing annihilation-operators for polynomial spaces, we derive usable formulas that are optimal for general correlated non-uniform noise. We show that earlier subdivision rules are optimal for uncorrelated non-uniform noise and, finally, we present numerical evidence to confirm that, in the correlated case, the proposed approximants are better than those currently used in the subdivision literature.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Preserving Encoder/Decoder in Latent Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative modeling aims to generate new data samples that resemble a given dataset, with diffusion models recently becoming the most popular generative model. One of the main challenges of diffusion models is solving the problem in the input space, which tends to be very high-dimensional. Recently, solving diffusion models in the latent space through an encoder that maps from the data space to a lower-dimensional latent space has been considered to make the training process more efficient and has shown state-of-the-art results. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is the most commonly used encoder/decoder framework in this domain, known for its ability to learn latent representations and generate data samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel encoder/decoder framework with theoretical properties distinct from those of the VAE, specifically designed to preserve the geometric structure of the data distribution. We demonstrate the significant advantages of this geometry-preserving encoder in the training process of both the encoder and decoder. Additionally, we provide theoretical results proving convergence of the training process, including convergence guarantees for encoder training, and results showing faster convergence of decoder training when using the geometry-preserving encoder.</description>

      <title>SDFs from Unoriented Point Clouds using Neural Variational Heat Distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational approach for computing neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF) from unoriented point clouds. To this end, we replace the commonly used eikonal equation with the heat method, carrying over to the neural domain what has long been standard practice for computing distances on discrete surfaces. This yields two convex optimization problems for whose solution we employ neural networks: We first compute a neural approximation of the gradients of the unsigned distance field through a small time step of heat flow with weighted point cloud densities as initial data. Then we use it to compute a neural approximation of the SDF. We prove that the underlying variational problems are well-posed. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method provides state-of-the-art surface reconstruction and consistent SDF gradients. Furthermore, we show in a proof-of-concept that it is accurate enough for solving a PDE on the zero-level set.</description>

      <title>Neural semi-Lagrangian method for high-dimensional advection-diffusion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the numerical approximation of high-dimensional advection-diffusion equations. It is well-known that classical methods, such as the finite volume method, suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and that their time step is constrained by a stability condition. The semi-Lagrangian method is known to overcome the stability issue, while recent time-discrete neural network-based approaches overcome the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we propose a novel neural semi-Lagrangian method that combines these last two approaches. It relies on projecting the initial condition onto a finite-dimensional neural space, and then solving an optimization problem, involving the backwards characteristic equation, at each time step. It is particularly well-suited for implementation on GPUs, as it is fully parallelizable and does not require a mesh. We provide rough error estimates present several high-dimensional numerical experiments to assess the performance of our approach, and compare it to other neural methods.</description>

      <title>A Nonconforming Finite Element Method for Elliptic Interface Problems on Locally Anisotropic Meshes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new nonconforming \(P_1\) finite element method for elliptic interface problems. The method is constructed on a locally anisotropic mixed mesh, which is generated by fitting the interface through a simple connection of intersection points on an interface-unfitted background mesh, as introduced in \cite{Hu2021optimal}. We first establish interpolation error estimates on quadrilateral elements satisfying the regular decomposition property (RDP). Building on this, the main contribution of this work is a novel consistency error analysis for nonconforming elements, which removes the quasi-regularity assumption commonly required in existing approaches. Numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence rates and demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Learning Neural Pushforward Samplers for Distributions from Fokker-Planck Equations by Weak Adversarial Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for solving Fokker-Planck equations (FPE) by learning a neural sampler for the distribution given by the FPE via an adversarial training based on a weak formulation of the FPE where the adjoint operator of FPE acts on the test function. Such a weak formulation transforms the PDE solution problem into a Monte Carlo importance sampling problem where the FPE solution-distribution is learned through a neural pushforward map, avoiding some of the limitations of direct PDE based methods. Moreover, by using simple plane-wave test functions, derivatives on the test functions can be explicitly computed. This approach produces a natural importance sampling strategy for the FPE solution distribution with probability conservation, from which the FPE solution can be easily constructed.</description>

      <title>Fully discrete finite element methods for the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with multiplicative noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a fully discrete finite element approximation for the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, combining the standard finite element methods in spatial discretization with the implicit Euler-Maruyama scheme in time. Rigorous error estimates are established for two distinct noise regimes. In the case of bounded multiplicative noise, we prove optimal strong convergence rates in full expectation. The analysis relies crucially on a stochastic Gronwall inequality and an exponential stability estimate for the PDE solution, which together control the interplay between the nonlinear drift and the multiplicative stochastic forcing. For general multiplicative noise, where boundedness no longer holds, we derive sub-optimal convergence rates in probability by introducing a localization technique based on carefully constructed subsets of the sample space. This dual framework demonstrates that the proposed fully discrete scheme achieves strong convergence under bounded noise and probabilistic convergence under general multiplicative noise, thus providing the first comprehensive error analysis for numerical approximations of the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates for the Trotter Splitting for Unbounded Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study convergence rates of the Trotter splitting $e^{A+L} = \lim_{n \to \infty} (e^{L/n} e^{A/n})^n$ in the strong operator topology. In the first part, we use complex interpolation theory to treat generators $L$ and $A$ of contraction semigroups on Banach spaces, with $L$ relatively $A$-bounded. In the second part, we study unitary dynamics on Hilbert spaces and develop a new technique based on the concept of energy constraints. Our results provide a complete picture of the convergence rates for the Trotter splitting for all common types of Schr\"odinger and Dirac operators, including singular, confining and magnetic vector potentials, as well as molecular many-body Hamiltonians in dimension $d=3$. Using the Brezis-Mironescu inequality, we derive convergence rates for the Schr\"odinger operator with $V(x)=\pm |x|^{-a}$ potential. In each case, our conditions are fully explicit.</description>

      <title>BC-ADMM: An Efficient Non-convex Constrained Optimizer with Robotic Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-convex constrained optimizations are ubiquitous in robotic applications such as multi-agent navigation, UAV trajectory optimization, and soft robot simulation. For this problem class, conventional optimizers suffer from small step sizes and slow convergence. We propose BC-ADMM, a variant of Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM), that can solve a class of non-convex constrained optimizations with biconvex constraint relaxation. Our algorithm allows larger step sizes by breaking the problem into small-scale sub-problems that can be easily solved in parallel. We show that our method has both theoretical convergence speed guarantees and practical convergence guarantees in the asymptotic sense. Through numerical experiments in a row of four robotic applications, we show that BC-ADMM has faster convergence than conventional gradient descent and Newton's method in terms of wall clock time.</description>

      <title>Analysis of kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo under the stochastic exponential Euler discretization from underdamped all the way to overdamped</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the kinetic Langevin dynamics is a popular approach for sampling from distributions, where only their unnormalized densities are available. Various discretizations of the kinetic Langevin dynamics have been considered, where the resulting algorithm is collectively referred to as the kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo (KLMC) or underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo. Specifically, the stochastic exponential Euler discretization, or exponential integrator for short, has previously been studied under strongly log-concave and log-Lipschitz smooth potentials via the synchronous Wasserstein coupling strategy. Existing analyses, however, impose restrictions on the parameters that do not explain the behavior of KLMC under various choices of parameters. In particular, all known results fail to hold in the overdamped regime, suggesting that the exponential integrator degenerates in the overdamped limit. In this work, we revisit the synchronous Wasserstein coupling analysis of KLMC with the exponential integrator. Our refined analysis results in Wasserstein contractions and bounds on the asymptotic bias that hold under weaker restrictions on the parameters, which assert that the exponential integrator is capable of stably simulating the kinetic Langevin dynamics in the overdamped regime, as long as proper time acceleration is applied.</description>
