      <title>On a problem of Erdos and Hajnal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing a question of Erdos and Hajnal we show that one can force a graph with no large independent sets and no monochromatic triples as successors of strong limit singular cardinals, even without assuming GCH. The result can be pushed down to $\aleph_\omega$.</description>

      <title>Strong Union Logic: A Superintuitionistic Logic Contained in Medvedev's Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\textbf{SU}$ be the superintuitionistic logic defined by the axiom $\boldsymbol{su} = ((\neg p\to q)\land(\neg q\to p) \rightarrow r \vee s) \to ( p \rightarrow r) \vee(q \rightarrow s)$, or equivalently, by Andrew's axiom. It is easy to check that $\textbf{SU}$ is contained in Medvedev's logic and contains both Kreisel-Putnam logic and Scott logic. We show that on reflexive transitive frames, $\boldsymbol{su}$ corresponds to a first-order property, termed the ``strong union'' property. The completeness of $\textbf{SU}$, with respect to the class of $\textbf{S4}$ frames enjoying this property, is proved. Furthermore, we demonstrate that \textbf{SU} has the disjunction property.</description>

      <title>Algebraic independence of the solutions of the classical Lotka-Volterra system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)$ be distinct non-constant and non-degenerate solutions of the classical Lotka-Volterra system \begin{equation}\notag \begin{split} x'&amp;= axy + bx\\ y'&amp;= cxy + dy, \end{split} \end{equation} where $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$. We show that if $\frac{d}{b}\not\in\mathbb{Q}$, then the solutions are algebraically independent over $\mathbb{C}$, that is $tr.deg_{\mathbb{C}}\mathbb{C}(x_1,y_1,\ldots,x_n,y_n)=2n$. As a main part of the proof, we show that the set defined by the system in universal differential fields, with $\frac{d}{b}\not\in\mathbb{Q}$, is strongly minimal and geometrically trivial. Our techniques also allows us to obtain partial results for some of the more general $2d$-Lotka-Volterra system.</description>

      <title>Universality properties of forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate forcing as a tool to construct universal models. In particular, we look at theories of initial segments of the universe and show that any model of a sufficiently rich fragment of those theories can be embedded into a model constructed by forcing. Our results rely on the model-theoretic properties of good ultrafilters, for which we provide a new existence proof on non-necessarily complete Boolean algebras.</description>

      <title>Endomorphisms of free Steiner quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A free Steiner quasigroup is a free object in the variety of Steiner quasigroups. Free Steiner quasigroups are characterised by the existence of a levelled construction that starts with a free base - that is, a set of elements none of which is a product of the others, and which generate the quasigroup. Then each element in a free Steiner quasigroup $M$ can be obtained as a term on the free base. We characterise homomorphisms between substructures of a free Steiner quasigroup where one generator is replaced by a term in the original generators. The characterisation depends on certain synctactic properties of the term in question.</description>

      <title>On Conway's Numbers and Games, the Von Neumann Universe, and Pure Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take up Dedekind's question ''Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?'' (''What are numbers, and would should they be?''), with the aim to describe the place that Conway's (Surreal) Numbers and Games take, or deserve to take, in the whole of mathematics. Rather than just reviewing the work of Conway, and subsequent one by Gonshor, Alling, Ehrlich, and others, we propose a new setting which puts the theory of surreal numbers onto the firm ground of ''pure'' set theory. This approach is closely related to Gonshor's one by ''sign expansions'', but appears to be significantly simpler and clearer, and hopefully may contribute to realizing that ''surreal'' numbers are by no means surrealistic, goofy or wacky. They could, and probably should, play a central role in mathematics. We discuss the interplay between the various approaches to surreal numbers, and analyze the link with Conway's original approach via Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT). To clarify this, we propose to call pure set theory the algebraic theory of pure sets, or in other terms, of the algebraic structures of the von Neumann universe. This topic may be interesting in its own right: it puts CGT into a broad context which has a strong ''quantum flavor'', and where Conway's numbers (as well as their analogue, the nimbers) arise naturally.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the ultrafilter number function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether the ultrafilter number function $\kappa \mapsto \mathfrak{u}(\kappa)$ on the cardinals is monotone, that is, $\mathfrak{u}(\lambda) \le \mathfrak{u}(\kappa)$ holds for all cardinals $\lambda &lt; \kappa$ or not. We show that monotonicity can fail, but the failure has a large cardinal strength. On the other hand, we prove that there are many restrictions of the failure of monotonicity. For instance, if $\kappa$ is a singular cardinal with countable cofinality or a strong limit singular cardinal, then $\mathfrak{u}(\kappa) \le \mathfrak{u}(\kappa^+)$ holds.</description>

      <title>Notes on ultrafilter extensions of almost bounded structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend some of our earlier results on the interconnection between ultrafilter extensions, and ultrapowers. Throughout we restrict ourselves to relational structures with one binary relation. Recently it was shown that for bounded structures, where a universal finite bound on the maximal in-and out-degree is given, ultrafilter extensions are elementary extensions of the original structures. Comparing the constructions, it seems that the real challenge is when the degree has no global finite bound, or there are elements with infinite degree. This is a first step towards this direction by slightly relaxing the notion of boundedness, called almost bounded structures. Among others, we show that members of this class are still elementary substructures of their extensions, elementary embeddings can be lifted up to the extensions, moreover for the countable case, the extensions are isomorphic to certain ultrapowers. We also comment on the modal logics they generate.</description>

      <title>Brooks' type theorems for coloring parameters of locally finite graphs and Konig's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past, analogues to Brooks' theorem have been found for various parameters of graph coloring for infinite locally finite connected graphs in ZFC. We prove these theorems are not provable in ZF (i.e. the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice (AC)). Moreover, such theorems follow from Konig's Lemma (every infinite locally finite connected graph has a ray-a weak form of AC) in ZF. In ZF, we formulate new conditions for the existence of the distinguishing chromatic number, the distinguishing chromatic index, the total chromatic number, the total distinguishing chromatic number, the odd chromatic number, and the neighbor-distinguishing index in infinite locally finite connected graphs, which are equivalent to Konig's Lemma. In this direction, we strengthen a recent result of Stawiski from 2023.
  We also figured out the upper bound for list-distinguishing chromatic number for infinite graphs in ZFC (i.e. the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (AC)).</description>

      <title>Coarse Set Theory for AI Ethics and Decision-Making: A Mathematical Framework for Granular Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) and decision-making systems, structured approximations are essential for balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy. Coarse Set Theory (CST) introduces a mathematical framework to formalize Coarse Ethics (CE), which models coarse-grained decision-making processes commonly used in human evaluations and AI classification systems. CST defines hierarchical relationships among sets using totally ordered structures and coarse mappings, enabling AI systems to adjust decision granularity dynamically. However, coarse evaluations inherently involve a trade-off between efficiency and information retention, as they simplify complex data representations at the cost of precision. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a measure of information loss in coarse evaluations, demonstrating the impact of coarse partitioning on decision accuracy. This study applies CST to grading systems, automated recommendations, and risk assessments, demonstrating its potential to enhance fairness, reduce bias, and improve transparency in AI-driven decision-making.</description>
