      <title>Many-Body Simulations of the Fast Flavor Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino fast flavor instability dominates the evolution of neutrino flavor within the engines of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. However, theoretical models of neutrino flavor change that include many-body quantum correlations can differ starkly from similar mean-field calculations. We demonstrate for the first time that the inhomogeneous fast flavor instability is disrupted by many-body correlations using a novel tensor network framework that allows a continuous transition between mean-field and many-body results by tuning the singular value decomposition cutoff value. Generalizing the forward-scattering Hamiltonian to spatially varying conditions, we demonstrate that the timescale of flavor transformation scales logarithmically with system size, suggesting that many-body effects could outpace mean-field instabilities even for realistic neutrino numbers. Our results have significant implications for astrophysical explosion dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and observable neutrino signatures.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers: synergies between the next generation gravitational wave interferometers and wide-field, high-multiplex spectroscopic facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Third-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) will detect hundreds of thousands of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, reaching redshifts beyond $z\sim3$. To fully exploit joint GW and electromagnetic (EM) detections, dedicated strategies and adapted EM facilities are essential. We investigate the role of Integral Field and Multi-Object Spectroscopy (IFS and MOS) with the Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) on next generation GW multi-messenger (MM) observations. We consider simulations of BNS populations, their GW detections with ET(+CE), and their EM counterparts: kilonovae (KNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We consider two strategies: one in synergy with wide-field photometric surveys, and a galaxy-targeted one exploiting WST high multiplexing. We estimate the number of galaxies in GW error volumes, and identify observational challenges and mitigation strategies. We find that WST can detect KNe up to $z\sim0.4$ and $m_{\mathrm{AB}}\sim25$, and GRB afterglows beyond $z&gt;1$ for $\Theta_{\mathrm{view}}\lesssim15^\circ$. KN observations are best scheduled 12-24 hours post-merger. For poorly localised GRBs, WST IFS can aid the identification. Mini-IFUs and galaxy catalogues complete to $z\leq0.5$ are key to EM counterpart detection. Even at low $z$, the number of galaxies can be huge-thousands at $z&lt;0.1$, tens of thousands at $z&lt;0.2$. Events at $z&lt;0.3$ with localisation $&lt;10$deg$^{2}$ are golden cases for WST, requiring few exposures to target all galaxies. Detecting and characterising EM counterparts of BNS detected in the extended volume explored by next-generation interferometers will be challenging. We show that high-sensitivity, wide-field, high-multiplex spectroscopic facilities are powerful instruments to fully exploit the new multi-messenger science opportunities enabled by next generation GW detectors.</description>

      <title>H.E.S.S. programme searching for VHE gamma rays associated with FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic, extremely short-lived bursts of radio flashes. Despite extensive research, the exact cause of these outbursts remains speculative. The high luminosity, short duration, and high dispersion measure of these events suggest they result from extreme, high-energy extragalactic sources, such as highly magnetized and rapidly spinning neutron stars known as magnetars. The number of detected FRBs, including repeating ones, has grown rapidly in recent years. Except for FRB 20200428D, and FRB-like radio burst that is associated to Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, no multi-wavelength counterpart to any FRB has been detected yet. The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescope has developed a {program} to follow up FRBs searching for their gamma-ray counterparts, helping to uncover the nature of FRBs and FRB sources. This paper provides an overview of the searches for FRB sources conducted by H.E.S.S., including follow-up observations and simultaneous multi-wavelength campaigns with radio and X-ray observatories. Among the FRB sources observed by H.E.S.S., nine are localized with redshifts ranging between 0.11 and 0.492 from 2015 to 2022. No significant very high energy (VHE) emission was detected during these observations. We report constraints on the VHE luminosity ranging from $10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$, placing limits on the FRB's region persistent VHE emission and potential FRB afterglow emission across timescales from hours to years.</description>

      <title>XRISM analysis of the complex Fe K$\alpha$ line in Centaurus A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the high-resolution XRISM/Resolve spectrum of the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line of the nearest active galactic nucleus, in Centaurus A. The line features two narrow and resolved peaks of Fe K$\alpha_1$, and Fe K$\alpha_2$ with a FWHM of $(4.8\pm0.2)\times10^2$ km/s each. A broad line with a FWHM of $(4.3\pm0.3)\times10^3$ km/s, and with a flux similar to the two narrow line cores, is also required. This broad component is not observed in the optical or IR spectra of Cen A. The line shape requires the existence of an emission region that extends from $\sim10^{-3}$ pc to $\sim10^1$ pc. Assuming that the emissivity follows a radial power-law profile of $r^{-q}$, we find $q\approx2$. This may indicate an extended corona, an emitting region that bends towards the corona, or a non-uniform density. When assuming $q=3$, the line shape can only be reproduced by including three emitting components in the model. The measured best-fit inclination is $24^{+13}_{-7}$ degrees, but higher inclinations are only slightly disfavored. A single blurred MYTorusL line profile can describe the line shape, but requires a large relative normalization. This could be due to past variability, modified abundances, or differing geometries. The line shape can be reproduced from the radii measured by reverberation mapping, but only if an additional extended emitting region at small radii is included.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Redshift for Rapidly Rotating Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Oblate Schwarzschild (OS) approximation is a method often used to compute the flux of X-rays emitted from a rapidly rotating neutron star. In this approximation, the oblate shape of the rotating star is embedded in the Schwarzschild metric, which is used to compute the redshift of photon energies as they propagate from the star to the telescope. In this paper, we demonstrate that there are small errors introduced by the standard treatment of photon redshift in the OS approximation and provide a simple method to correct these errors. These errors are constant in phase, so this results in a constant absolute reduction in the flux. For PSR J0740+6620, the most rapidly spinning of the pulsars observed by NICER, we estimate the flux errors are less than 1\%, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the uncertainty in the distance, so this does not affect the mass and radius constraints found for this pulsar. The errors for the other pulsars observed by NICER are even smaller. However, this correction should be included when analyzing data for more rapidly rotating X-ray pulsars with spin frequencies near 600 Hz.</description>

      <title>Prospects for PBR detection of KM3-230213A-like events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a scaled-down version of the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) design, optimized to be flown as a payload on one of NASA's sub-orbital super pressure balloons circling the Earth above the southern oceans for a mission duration of more than 20 days. One of the main science objectives of PBR is to follow up astrophysical event alerts in search of neutrinos with very high energy ($10^8 \lesssim E_\nu /{\rm GeV} \lesssim 10^{10}$). Of particular interest for anticipated PBR observations, the KM3NeT Collaboration has recently reported the detection of the neutrino KM3-230213A with $10^{8.1} \lesssim E_\nu/{\rm GeV} \lesssim 10^{8.9}$. Such an unprecedented event is in tension with upper limits on the cosmic neutrino flux from IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory: for a diffuse isotropic neutrino flux there is a $3.5\sigma$ tension between KM3NeT and IceCube measurements, and about $2.6\sigma$ if the neutrino flux originates in transient sources. Therefore, if KM3-230213A was not beginner's luck, it becomes compelling to consider beyond Standard Model (BSM) possibilities which could lead to a signal at KM3NeT-ARCA but not at IceCube/Auger. We calculate the PBR horizon-range sensitivity to probe BSM physics compatible with observation at KM3NeT-ARCA and non-observation at IceCube/Auger. As an illustration, we consider a particular class of BSM physics models which has been described in the literature as a possible explanation of KM3-230213A.</description>

      <title>Hadronic origin of the very high-energy gamma-ray emission from the low-luminosity AGN in NGC 4278</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory has detected very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from NGC 4278, which is known to host a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Having only very weak radio jets, the origin of its VHE gamma rays is unclear. In this paper we first show that NGC 4278 has a massive molecular cloud surrounding the nucleus by analyzing data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We then assume that cosmic ray protons are accelerated in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow around the supermassive black hole, which diffuse into the molecular cloud and produce gamma rays and neutrinos via $pp$ interactions. We model the gamma-ray spectra and find that the observations can be explained by such hadronic processes if the AGN activity was higher in the past than at present, and the diffusion coefficient in the molecular cloud is appreciably smaller than in the Milky Way interstellar medium. However, we also show that the high-energy neutrinos co-produced with the gamma rays are unlikely to be detectable even with IceCube-Gen2.</description>

      <title>Multi-year Polarimetric Monitoring of Four CHIME-Discovered Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we report multi-year polarization measurements of four repeating FRBs initially discovered by CHIME: FRBs~20190117A, 20190208A, 20190303A, and 20190417A. We observed the four repeating FRBs with FAST, detecting a total of 66 bursts. Two bursts from FRB~20190417A exhibit a circular polarization signal-to-noise ratio greater than 7, with the highest circular polarization fraction recorded at 35.7%. While the bursts from FRBs 20190208A and 20190303A are highly linearly polarized, those from FRBs~20190117A and 20190417A show depolarization due to multi-path propagation, with \sigma_{\mathrm{RM}} = 2.78 \pm 0.05 rad m$^{-2}$ and 5.19 \pm 0.09 rad m$^{-2}$, respectively. The linear polarization distributions among five repeating FRB--FRBs~20190208A, 20190303A, 20201124A, 20220912A, and 20240114A--are nearly identical but show distinct differences from those of non-repeating FRBs. FRBs~20190117A, 20190303A, and 20190417A exhibit substantial rotation measure (RM) variations between bursts, joining other repeating FRBs in this behavior. Combining these findings with published results, 64% of repeating FRBs show RM variations greater than 50 rad m$^{-2}$, and 21\% exhibit RM reversals. A significant proportion of repeating FRBs reside in a dynamic magneto-ionic environment. The structure function of RM variations shows a power-law index of $\gamma \sim (0-0.8)$, corresponding to a shallow power spectrum $\alpha = -(\gamma + 2) \sim -(2.0-2.8)$ of turbulence, if the RM variations are attributed to turbulence. This suggests that the variations are dominated by small-scale RM density fluctuations. We perform K-S tests comparing the RMs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs, which reveal a marginal dichotomy in the distribution of their RMs.We caution that the observed dichotomy may be due to the small sample size and selection biases.</description>

      <title>MeV cosmic-ray electrons modify the TeV pair-beam plasma instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic pair beams created in the intergalactic medium (IGM) by TeV gamma rays from blazars are expected to produce a detectable GeV-scale electromagnetic cascade, but the cascade component is absent in the spectra of many hard-spectrum TeV-emitting blazars. One common explanation is that weak intergalactic magnetic fields deflect the electron-positron pairs away from our line of sight. An alternative possibility is that electrostatic beam-plasma instabilities drain the energy of these pairs before a cascade can develop. Recent studies have shown that beam scattering by oblique electrostatic modes leads to minimal energy loss. But these modes might be suppressed by linear Landau damping (LLD) due to MeV-scale cosmic-ray electrons in the IGM. In this work, we explore the impact of LLD on the energy-loss efficiency of plasma instabilities in pair beams associated with 1ES 0229+200. We find that LLD effectively suppresses oblique electrostatic modes, while quasi-parallel ones grow to larger amplitudes. In this way, LLD enhances the energy-loss efficiency of the instability by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>X-ray observations of Nova Sco 2023: Spectroscopic evidence of charge exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The super-soft source (SSS) phase of a nova eruption, observed a few days after the outburst, usually displays an absorbed X-ray thermal continuum with absorption features, emitted by the white dwarf (WD) atmosphere. However, the X-ray spectra of many novae in this phase display additional emission lines which likely originate from shocks in the novae ejecta. When the shocked plasma interacts with cold gas, narrow radiative recombination continua (RRCs) and charge exchange (CX) emission are observed. We present the analysis of high-resolution ChandraLETG X-ray grating spectra of Nova Sco 2023, observed 128 and 183 days after the optical peak, on 2023 August and October. At both epochs, the absorbed X-ray thermal continuum is well described by a Non-Local Thermal Equilibrium atmosphere model with a temperature T=750,000 K (kT = 65 eV). On day 128, the atmosphere is found to be outflowing at v=-3500 km s^-1. On day 183, the atmosphere brightened by a factor of ~2 and slowed down to v=-1500$ km s^-1. The discrete emission features of the spectrum consist of the C^+5, N^+5, and N^+6 RRCs, indicating a cold electron temperature of kT_e=1 eV on day 128, and kT_e=20 eV on day 183. The observed line series of H-like and He-like C^+5, N^+5, N^+6, and O^+6 show enhanced intensities of high-n (principal quantum number) transitions, consistent with a CX model of hot ions at kT~100 eV. The velocity shift of the CX lines remained at v=+-3000 km s^-1, which can be explained by a bipolar outflow. After Nova Ret 2020 (YZ Ret), Nova Sco 2023 is yet another nova in which we have found exquisite evidence of CX in astrophysical ionized plasma.</description>

      <title>Tracing the light: Identification for the optical counterpart candidates of binary black-holes during O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are widely considered the ideal environments for binary black hole (BBH) mergers and the only plausible sites for their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. Graham et al.(2023) identified seven AGN flares that are potentially associated with gravitational-wave (GW) events detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration during the third observing run. In this article, utilizing an additional three years of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public data after their discovery, we conduct an updated analysis and find that only three flares can be identified. By implementing a joint analysis of optical and GW data through a Bayesian framework, we find two flares exhibit a strong correlation with GW events, with no secondary flares observed in their host AGN up to 2024 October 31. Combining these two most robust associations, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of $H_{0}= 72.1^{+23.9}_{-23.1} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ and incorporating the multi-messenger event GW170817 improves the precision to $H_{0}=73.5^{+9.8}_{-6.9} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. Both results are consistent with existing measurements reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Measuring the muon content of inclined air showers using AERA and the water-Cherenkov detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for assessing the muon content of air showers with large zenith angles on a combined analysis of their radio emission and particle footprint. We use the radiation energy reconstructed by the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) as an energy estimator and determine the muon number independently with the water-Cherenkov detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory, deployed on a 1500 m grid. We focus our analysis on air showers with primary energy above 4 EeV to ensure full detection efficiency. Over approximately ten years of accumulated data, we identify a set of 40 high-quality events that are used in the analysis. The estimated muon contents in data are compatible with those for iron primaries as predicted by current-generation hadronic interaction models. This result can be interpreted as a deficit of muons in simulations as a lighter mass composition has been established from Xmax measurements. This muon deficit was already observed in previous analyses of the Auger Collaboration and is confirmed using hybrid events that include radio measurements for the first time.</description>

      <title>Measuring black hole spins with X-ray reflection spectroscopy: A GRMHD outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray reflection spectroscopy has evolved as one of the leading methods to measure black hole spins. However, the question is whether its measurements are subjected to systematic biases, especially considering the possible discrepancy between the spin measurements inferred with this technique and those from gravitational wave observations. In this work, we use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of thin accretion disks around spinning black holes for modeling the accretion process, and then we simulate NuSTAR observations to test the capability of modern reflection models in recovering the input spins. For the first time, we model the electron density and ionization profiles from GRMHD-simulated disks. Our study reveals that current reflection models work well only for fast-rotating black holes. We model the corona as the base of the jet and we find that reflection models with lamppost emissivity profiles fail to recover the correct black hole spins. Reflection models with broken power-law emissivity profiles perform better. As we increase the complexity of the simulated models, it is more difficult to recover the correct input spins, pointing towards the need to update our current reflection models with more advanced accretion disks and coronal geometries.</description>

      <title>Spherically Symmetric Accretion with Self-Gravity: Analytical Formulae and Numerical Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherically symmetric accretion incorporating self-gravity constitutes a three-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) governed by constraints at the outer boundary, sonic point, and accretor surface. Previous studies have two limitations: either employing an incorrect formula for self-gravity potential in analytical treatments, or introducing additional input parameters in numerical implementations to circumvent solving the full TPBVP. To address these issues, we present a self-consistent TPBVP formulation, solved using the relaxation method. We also derive approximate analytical formulae that enable rapid estimates of self-gravity effects. Our analysis identifies a dimensionless parameter $\beta \equiv 2G \bar{\rho} r_\mathrm{out}^2/a_\mathrm{out}^2$ that characterizes the strength of self-gravity, where $\bar{\rho}$ and $r_\mathrm{out}$ are the mean density and outer radius of the flow, respectively, and $a_\mathrm{out}$ is the adiabatic sound speed of the external medium. For practical estimation, $\bar{\rho}$ may be approximated by the external medium density $\rho_\mathrm{out}$. We identify an upper limit for $\beta$, beyond which steady accretion becomes unsustainable -- a behavior consistent with classical gravitational instability that previous studies failed to capture. The accretion rate enhancement decreases monotonically as the adiabatic index $\gamma$ increases. For $\gamma=5/3$, self-gravity ceases to augment the accretion rate. These theoretical predictions are validated by our numerical solutions. We further apply our results to two astrophysical scenarios: hyper-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black hole seeds in the early Universe, where self-gravity is significant; and accretion onto stellar-mass objects embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks, where self-gravity is non-negligible under certain conditions and should be evaluated using $\beta$.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for Spectral Hardening in Blazar Flares with the Fermi-Large Area Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that emit non-thermal radiation through relativistic jets, characterized by rapid flux and polarization variability. Extreme high synchrotron-peaked blazars (EHSPs), with synchrotron peaks exceeding 10$^{17}$ Hz, are essential for understanding the full range of blazar phenomena and testing jet physics models. However, the number of known extreme blazars is small, so this class of objects remains poorly studied. This work aims to systematically identify and characterize the most extreme $\gamma$-ray blazars using data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The focus is on spectral hardening, where the $\gamma$-ray spectrum becomes harder at higher energies, particularly during flaring episodes. This represents the first dedicated analysis of spectral hardening across a population of EHSPs, as previous studies explored it only in individual sources. We analyze 138 blazars selected from the 4FGL-DR2 catalog with high synchrotron peak frequencies and well-sampled light curves. Flaring periods are automatically identified, and each flare is analyzed, with the significance of spectral hardening assessed through a test statistic based on the likelihood ratio of two spectral models. We identify two flaring episodes with indications of spectral hardening, in 4FGL J0238.4$-$3116 and PKS 2155$-$304, the latter detected independently by both methods but referring to the same period. These events are consistent with expectations from statistical fluctuations, suggesting that spectral hardening is a rare occurrence (&lt; 0.1 %). These results constrain its frequency and support a smoothly varying power-law blazar emission model, motivating future multi-wavelength studies to clarify whether these rare flares reflect distinct physical processes within blazar jets.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the X-ray emission surrounding PSR B0656+14 in the eROSITA Cal-PV data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cautionary assessment of the extended X-ray emission around PSR B0656+14 in eROSITA Cal-PV data in response to the work of Niu et al. 2025 (arXiv:2501.17046). The eROSITA PSF model is known to underestimate emission in the wings beyond 1'. This prevents a reliable detection of faint nebular emission around PSR B0656+14 as claimed in arXiv:2501.17046. In addition, spectral analysis shows the surrounding diffuse X-rays can be fitted with the same 2BB+PL model as the pulsar's emission itself. This strongly invalidates the interpretation by the authors of arXiv:2501.17046 that the X-ray emission in the (4-10)' region is associated with the degree-scale gamma-ray halo recently found by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), and shows that it originates from the pulsar due to the wings of the PSF.</description>

      <title>A Leptonic Interpretation of the UHE Gamma-ray Emission from V4641 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the microquasar V4641 Sgr and its surrounding is detected at TeV-PeV gamma-ray band. Interestingly, the spectrum follows a power-law function continuing up to 0.8 PeV as reported by LHAASO, and the morphology of the emission appears a puzzling elongated structure. In this work, we propose that the elongated UHE emission from V4641 Sgr could originate from the inverse Compton radiation of electrons with a very hard spectrum, which may result from shear acceleration mechanism in the jets driven by V4641 Sgr. We also calculate the corresponding X-ray synchrotron emission from the same electron population, predicting the potential range of non-thermal X-ray flux of the source. The recent observation by XRISM toward the central part of the UHE source could pose a constraint on the model parameters. In the future, a full coverage of the source by sensitive X-ray instrument and high-resolution TeV-PeV gamma-ray instrument may provide a critical test of the model.</description>

      <title>Advanced techniques of searching for flares of ultra-high-energy photons from point sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical flares are one of the possible prominent source classes of ultra-high-energy (UHE, $E &gt; 10^{17}$ eV) cosmic rays, which can be detected by recording clusters of extensive air showers in arrays of detectors. The search for sources of neutral particles offers distinct advantages over searching for sources of charged particles, as the former traverse cosmic distances undeflected by magnetic fields. While no cosmic-ray photons exceeding $10^{17}$ eV have been definitively detected, identifying the clustering of events in cosmic-ray data would provide compelling evidence for their existence. We compare two analysis methods for detecting direction-time clustering in UHE extensive air showers: an approach that examines multiplets, and the stacking method, which analyzes sets of doublets that are not necessarily consecutive, thus making it sensitive to multiple flares. Both techniques combine time-clustering algorithms with unbinned likelihood study. Background events (initiated by hadrons) can be more efficiently distinguished from photon-induced events (signals) by using a photon tag that employs probability distribution functions to classify each event as more likely to be initiated by either a photon or a hadron. We demonstrate that these methods can effectively distinguish between events initiated by photons and those initiated by hadrons (background), and can accurately reproduce both the number of photon events within flares and their duration. We calculate the discovery potentials, i.e., the number of events required to identify a photon flare. The methods discussed can be used to search for cosmic ray sources and/or improve limits on the fluxes of UHE photons.</description>

      <title>GRB 240825A: Early Reverse Shock and Its Physical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early multi-wavelength observations offer crucial insights into the nature of the relativistic jets responsible for gamma-ray bursts and their interaction with the surrounding medium.We present data of GRB 240825A from 17 space- and ground-based telescopes/instruments, covering wavelengths from NIR/optical to X-ray and GeV, and spanning from the prompt emission to the afterglow phase triggered by Swift and Fermi. The early afterglow observations were carried out by SVOM/C-GFT, and spectroscopic observations of the afterglow by GTC, VLT, and TNG determined the redshift of the burst ($z = 0.659$) later.A comprehensive analysis of the prompt emission spectrum observed by Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM/LAT reveals a rare and significant high-energy cutoff at ~76 MeV. Assuming this cutoff is due to $\gamma\gamma$ absorption allows us to place an upper limit on the initial Lorentz factor, $\Gamma_0 &lt; 245$. The optical/NIR and GeV afterglow light curves be described by the standard external shock model, with early-time emission dominated by a reverse shock (RS) and a subsequent transition to forward shock (FS) emission. Our afterglow modelling yields a consistent estimate of the initial Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{\rm 0} \sim 234$). Furthermore, the RS-to-FS magnetic field ratio ($\mathcal{R}_B \sim 302$) indicates that the reverse shock region is significantly more magnetized than the FS region. An isotropic-equivalent kinetic energy of $E_{\text{k,iso}} = 5.25 \times 10^{54}$ erg is derived, and the corresponding $\gamma$-ray radiation efficiency is estimated to be $\eta_{\gamma}$ = 3.1%. On the other hand, the standard afterglow model can not reproduce the X-ray light curve of GRB 240825A, calling for improved models to characterize all multi-wavelength data.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in Simulated Local Cluster Analogs: one-to-one comparisons between SLOW and XRISM/Hitomi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The XRISM Resolve X-ray spectrometer allows to gain detailed insight into gas motions of the intra cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. Current simulation studies focus mainly on statistical comparisons, making the comparison to the currently still small number of clusters difficult due to unknown selection effects. This study aims to bridge this gap, using simulated counterparts of Coma, Virgo, and Perseus from the SLOW constrained simulations. These clusters show excellent agreement in their properties and dynamical state with observations, thus providing an ideal testbed to understand the processes shaping the properties of the ICM. We find that the simulations match the order of the amount of turbulence for the three considered clusters, Coma being the most active, followed by Perseus, while Virgo is very relaxed. Typical turbulent velocities are a few $\approx100$ km s$^{-1}$, very close to observed values. The resulting turbulent pressure support is $\approx1\%$ for Virgo and $\approx 3-4\%$ for Perseus and Coma within the central $1-2\%$ of $R_{200}$. Compared to previous simulations and observations, measured velocities and turbulent pressure support are consistently lower, in line with XRISM findings, thus indicating the importance of selection effects.</description>

      <title>Primordial high energy neutrinos: theoretical/observational constraints and sharp spectral features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the few ways that allow or could allow us to probe the early Universe from the observation of a flux of primordial particles, there is one possibility which has been little studied: the observation today of high energy neutrinos which could have been emitted shortly after the Big Bang, from the decay or annihilation of early universe relics. We perform a general study of such a possibility. To this end we first emphasise that these neutrinos could display various kinds of sharp spectral features, resulting from the primary energy spectrum at emission, and from how this spectrum is smoothed by redshift and radiative correction effects. Next we determine the ranges of mass (from a fraction of eV all the way to the Planck scale) and lifetime of the source particles along which we do not/we do expect that the sharp spectral feature will be altered by interactions of the neutrinos on their way to the detector, mainly with the cosmic neutrino background or between themselves. We also study the theoretical (i.e. mainly BBN and CMB) and observational constraints which hold on such a possibility. This allows us to delineate the regions of parameter space (mass, lifetime and abundance) that are already excluded, hopeless for future observation or, instead, which could lead to the observation of such neutrinos in the near future.</description>

      <title>A search for extra polarisations using a Gaussian process in Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogue 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity predicts that gravitational waves are described by two polarisation states: the plus $+$ state and cross $\times$ state. However, alternate theories of gravity allow up to six polarisations. We employ the gravitational-wave null stream, a linear combination of three or more detectors where the $+$ and $\times$ signals add to zero, leaving behind noise and potentially gravitational waves in non-standard polarisation states. We develop a Gaussian process model to search for extra polarisations beyond general relativity. Using data from 42 three-detector events from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogue, we find no evidence of non-standard polarisations. We set upper limits on the fractional deviation in gravitational-wave strain to be as low as 0.39 at 90% credibility for the event GW190602_175927.</description>

      <title>An extended MDI interaction for transport models and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The momentum-dependent interaction (MDI) model, which has been widely used in microscopic transport models for heavy-ion collisions (HICs), is extended to include three different momentum-dependent terms and three zero-range density-dependent terms, dubbed as MDI3Y model. Compared to the MDI model, the single-nucleon potential in the MDI3Y model exhibits more flexible momentum-dependent behaviors. Furthermore, the inclusion of three zero-range density-dependent interactions follows the idea of Fermi momentum expansion, allowing more flexible variation for the largely uncertain high-density behaviors of nuclear matter equation of state (EOS), especially the symmetry energy. Moreover, we also obtain the corresponding Skyrme-like energy density functional through density matrix expansion of the finite-range exchange interactions. Based on the MDI3Y model, we construct four interactions with the same symmetry energy slope parameter $L=35$ MeV but different momentum dependence of $U_{\mathrm{sym}}$, by fitting the empirical nucleon optical potential, the empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter, the microscopic calculations of pure neutron matter EOS and the astrophysical constraints on neutron stars. In addition, two interactions with $L=55$ and $75$ MeV are also constructed for comparison. Using these MDI3Y interactions, we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. These MDI3Y interactions, especially those with non-monotonic momentum dependence of $U_{\mathrm{sym}}$, will be potentially useful in transport model analyses of HICs data to extract nuclear matter EOS and the isospin splitting of nucleon effective masses.</description>

      <title>Gas Pressure Driven Screening Forces and Pebble Aggregation: A Pathway for Growth in Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of planetesimals from cm-sized pebbles in protoplanetary disks faces significant barriers, including fragmentation and radial drift. We identify a previously unaccounted screening force, arising from mutual shielding of thermal gas particles between pebbles when their separation falls below the gas mean free path. This force facilitates pebble binding, overcoming key growth barriers under turbulent disk conditions. Unlike conventional mechanisms, screening forces operate independently of surface adhesion and complement streaming instability and pressure traps by enhancing aggregation in high-density regions. Our analysis predicts that screening interactions are most effective in the {middle disk regions ($ \sim 0.3$ to few AU),} consistent with ALMA observations (e.g., TW Hya) of enhanced dust concentrations. {Furthermore, we find that screening-induced pebble growth from centimeter to kilometer scales can occur on timescales significantly shorter than the disk lifetime ($\sim 10^5$ years). Importantly, this growth naturally terminates when particles smaller than the local gas mean free path are depleted, thereby avoiding runaway accretion.} Beyond planetary science, the screening forces have {potential} implications for high-energy astrophysics, dusty plasmas, confined particle suspensions and other relevant areas, suggesting a broader fundamental significance.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency, wideband study of an active repeater, FRB 20240114A, with the GMRT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of 167 bursts from an active repeater, FRB 20240114A, using the uGMRT. The observations were carried over a frequency range of 300 $-$ 750 MHz, and on 4 different dates over a period of 6 months. Our analysis indicates that the FRB's emission properties are evolving, with both the median flux and emission rate of the bursts decreasing over time. The properties of the bursts also vary widely, with a wide range of intrinsic widths (0.246 to 39.364 ms), scattering timescales (0.004 to 28.289 ms), dispersion measures (524.07 to 533.56 pc cm$^{-3}$), and band occupancies (9 to 180 MHz). The distribution for the waiting time, $t_{\mathrm{wait}}$, is bi-modal, and follows a Weibull distribution, with a shape parameter $k = 0.33$; however, when the two distributions are fit separately, they follow a Weibull distribution with $k = 0.63$ for $t_{\mathrm{wait}} &lt; 1$ s, and a log-normal distribution with a width of $\sigma = 1.28$ for $t_{\mathrm{wait}} &gt; 1$ s. The isotropic energy distribution is seen to follow a log-normal distribution as well, with a width of $\sigma = 0.83$.</description>

      <title>A kinematically constrained kick distribution for isolated neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnitudes of the velocity kicks that neutron stars (NSs) obtain at their formation have long been a topic of discussion. In previous work, a novel method was proposed to determine kicks based on the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories. We applied this method to the isolated pulsars with known parallax in order to kinematically constrain the NS natal kick distribution. We assumed the velocity vectors of the pulsars to be distributed isotropically in the local standard of rest frame, and for each pulsar we sampled 100 velocities taking into account this assumption. These velocity vectors were used to trace back the trajectories of the NSs through the Galaxy and estimate their eccentricity. Then, we simulated kicked objects in order to evaluate the relationship between kick magnitude and Galactic eccentricity, which was used to infer the kicks corresponding to the estimated eccentricities. The resulting kick distributions indeed show a bimodal structure for young pulsars and our fits resemble the ones from literature well. However, for older pulsars the bimodality vanishes and instead we find a log-normal kick distribution peaking at ~200 km/s and a median of ~400 km/s. We also compare our methods to literature that suggests natal kicks are significantly higher and follow a Maxwellian with $\sigma=265$ km/s. We cannot reproduce these results using their sample and distance estimates, and instead find kicks that are consistent with our proposed distribution. We conclude that our kinematically constrained kick distribution is well-described by a log-normal distribution with $\mu=6.38$ and $\sigma=1.01$, normalised between 0 and 1000 km/s. This analysis reveals no evidence for bimodality in the larger sample, and we suggest that the bimodality found by existing literature may be caused by their relatively small sample size.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Reflection Signatures of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary signatures and the feasibility of identifying them through X-ray reflection spectra. The X-ray emitting region is modeled as a set of two mini-disks bound to the individual SMBHs separated by 100 $GM/c^2$ and the spectra calculated as a function of the mass, mass ratio, and total accretion rate of the binary. The X-ray reflection features are strongly influenced by the accretion-inversion phenomenon expected in SMBH binaries, which results in a wide range of ionization conditions in the two mini-disks. These are imprinted in the resulting composite spectra and the double-peaked and time-variable relativistic Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles. To test whether these features can be used as evidence for the presence of an SMBH binary, we fit mock 100 ks observations with a single AGN model. For a $10^9$ $M_\odot$ binary targeted by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs), at $z=0.1$ the single AGN model clearly fails to fit the data, while at $z=1$ the fit is acceptable but unable to converge on the SMBH spin. For a $10^6$ $M_\odot$ binary, a progenitor of a Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) source, spectral fitting is only possible at $z=0.1$, with the outcomes similar to the PTA binary at $z=1$. We also find that PTA binaries can be expected to show a distinct X-ray spectral variability in multi-epoch observations, whereas for LISA precursors, orbital averaging results in the loss of spectral variability signatures.</description>

      <title>Delving into the depths of NGC 3783 with XRISM. I. Kinematic and ionization structure of the highly ionized outflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present our study of the XRISM observation of the Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC 3783. XRISM's Resolve microcalorimeter has enabled, for the first time, a detailed characterization of the highly ionized outflows in this active galactic nucleus. Our analysis constrains their outflow and turbulent velocities, along with their ionization parameter ($\xi$) and column density ($N_{\rm H}$). The high-resolution Resolve spectrum reveals a distinct series of Fe absorption lines between 6.4 and 7.8 keV, ranging from Fe XVIII to Fe XXVI. At lower energies, absorption features from Si, S, and Ar are also detected. Our spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of the time-averaged Resolve spectrum uncovers six outflow components, five of which exhibit relatively narrow absorption lines with outflow velocities ranging from 560 to 1170 km/s. In addition, a broad absorption feature is detected, which is consistent with Fe XXVI outflowing at 14,300 km/s (0.05 $c$). The kinetic luminosity of this component is 0.8-3% of the bolometric luminosity. Our analysis of the Resolve spectrum shows that more highly ionized absorption lines are intrinsically broader than those of lower-ionization species, indicating that the turbulent velocity of the six outflow components (ranging from 0 to 3500 km/s) increases with $\xi$. Furthermore, we find that the $N_{\rm H}$ of the outflows generally declines with $\xi$ up to $\log \xi = 3.2$ but rises beyond this point, suggesting a complex ionization structure. The absorption profile of the Fe XXV resonance line is intriguingly similar to UV absorption lines (Ly$\alpha$ and C IV) observed by the HST, from which we infer that the outflows are clumpy in nature. Our XRISM/Resolve results support a "hybrid wind" scenario in which the observed outflows have multiple origins and driving mechanisms. We explore various interpretations of our findings within AGN wind models.</description>

      <title>Probing the Cosmic Neutrino Background and New Physics with TeV-Scale Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use recent evidence of TeV neutrino events from the most significant astrophysical sources detected by IceCube -- NGC 1068, TXS 0506+056, PKS 1424+240 -- to constrain the local and global overdensity of relic neutrinos and to explore potential new neutrino self-interactions. Assuming a relic neutrino overdensity, such high-energy neutrinos have travelled considerable distances through a sea of relic neutrinos and could have undergone scattering, altering their observed flux on Earth. Considering only Standard Model interactions, we constrain the relic overdensity to $\eta \leq 2 \times 10^{14}$ at the 90$\%$ confidence level, assuming the sum of neutrino masses saturates the cosmological bound, $\sum_i m_i = 0.13$ eV. We demonstrate that this limit improves for larger neutrino masses and study how it depends on the scale of the overdensity region. Considering new interactions between TeV-scale neutrinos and relic neutrinos, mediated by a light boson, we probe couplings of approximately $g \sim 10^{-2}$ with current data for a boson mass around the MeV scale. We demonstrate that this limit improves with larger neutrino masses and the scale of the overdensity region.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Heavy Asymmetric and Symmetric Dark Matter from the Glashow Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of asymmetric dark matter (ADM) can lead to distinct neutrino signatures characterized by an asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos. In the high-energy regime, the Glashow resonant interaction $\bar{\nu}_{e} + e^{-} \rightarrow W^{-}$ yields an increase in sensitivity to the neutrino flux, and stands out as the only way of discerning the antineutrino component in the diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux. This offers a unique opportunity in the search for dark matter with masses above the PeV scale. We examine the neutrino signal stemming from ADM decay and set the first stringent constraints on ADM lifetime $\tau_X$. For ADM with mass $m_X\gtrsim 10$~PeV, we {exclude} $\tau_X\lesssim 10^{29}$s using the data from the recent IceCube search for Glashow resonance events. Our projections further show that sensitivities at the forthcoming IceCube-Gen2 could approach $10^{30}$s, depending on the decay channel. The current constraints on symmetric dark matter decay to neutrinos are also improved by up to a factor of 3 thanks to the Glashow resonance.</description>

      <title>Improved inspiral-merger-ringdown model for BBHs on elliptical orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waveforms capturing binary evolution through the early-inspiral phase play a critical role in extracting orbital features that nearly disappear during the late-inspiral and subsequent merger phase due to radiation reaction forces; for instance, the effect of orbital eccentricity. Phenomenological approaches that model compact binary mergers rely heavily on combining inputs from both analytical and numerical approaches to reduce the computational cost of generating templates for data analysis purposes. In a recent work, Chattaraj et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 124008 (2022) constructed a dominant ($\ell=2$, $|m|=2$) mode model for nonspinning binary black holes (BBHs) on elliptical orbits. The model was constructed in time domain and is fully analytical. The current work is an attempt to improve this model by making a few important changes in our approach. The most significant of those involves identifying initial values of orbital parameters with which the inspiral part of the model is evolved. While the ingredients remain the same as in the previous work, the resulting (new) model, when compared against a set of target waveforms constructed here, produces match values better than 96.5% for systems heavier than $80M_\odot$, while with the old model this limit on the total mass is $115M_\odot$. The updated model is validated against an independent eccentric waveform family (TEOBResumS-Dali) for an initial eccentricity ($e_0$), mass ratio ($q$) and mean anomaly ($l_0$) in the range $0\lesssim e_0\lesssim0.3$, $1\lesssim q\lesssim3$ and $-\pi\leq l_0\leq\pi$, respectively. Further, an alternate model including the effect of higher order modes is also provided. Finally, while our model assumes nonspinning components, we show that it could also be used for systems with component spin vectors (anti-) aligned w.r.t. the orbital angular momentum and small spin magnitudes.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Powered Numerical Relativity Surrogate for Binary Black Hole Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave approximants are essential for gravitational-wave astronomy, allowing the coverage binary black hole parameter space for inference or match filtering without costly numerical relativity (NR) simulations, but generally trading some accuracy for computational efficiency. To reduce this trade-off, NR surrogate models can be constructed using interpolation within NR waveform space. We present a 2-stage training approach for neural network-based NR surrogate models. Initially trained on approximant-generated waveforms and then fine-tuned with NR data, these dual-stage artificial neural surrogate (\texttt{DANSur}) models offer rapid and competitively accurate waveform generation, generating millions in under 20ms on a GPU while keeping mean mismatches with NR around $10^{-4}$. Implemented in the \textsc{bilby} framework, we show they can be used for parameter estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Follow-Up of Gravitational-Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX) is a wide-field ultraviolet space telescope selected as a NASA Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission for launch in 2030. UVEX will undertake deep, cadenced surveys of the entire sky to probe low mass galaxies and explore the ultraviolet (UV) time-domain sky, and it will carry the first rapidly deployable UV spectroscopic capability for a broad range of science applications. One of UVEX's prime objectives is to follow up gravitational wave (GW) binary neutron star mergers as targets of opportunity (ToOs), rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their kilonova (KN) counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of KNe are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary neutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and the variation of GW distance estimates over the sky, the sensitivity to kilonovae can vary significantly across the GW localization and even across the footprint of a single image given UVEX's large field of view. Good ToO observing strategies to trade off between area and depth are neither simple nor obvious. We present an optimal strategy for GW follow-up with UVEX in which exposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individually to maximize the overall probability of detection. We model the scheduling problem using the expressive and powerful mathematical framework of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and employ a state-of-the-art MILP solver to automatically generate observing plan timelines that achieve high probabilities of kilonova detection. We have implemented this strategy in an open-source astronomical scheduling software package called the Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger Observation Planning Toolkit, on GitHub at https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field solver for QED polarization in super-strong magnetic fields of magnetar and laser plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super-strongly magnetized plasmas play a crucial role in extreme environments of magnetar and laboratory laser experiments, demanding comprehensive understanding of how quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects influence plasma behaviour. Earlier analytical and semi-analytical calculations have shown that QED effects can significantly modify the plasma polarization mode behaviour around magnetars using analytical and semi-analytical calculations. In this work, we present the first electromagnetic field solver that is valid beyond the Schwinger limit. QED vacuum polarization in super-strong magnetic fields are modeled with nonlinear Maxwell equations. We show that electromagnetic waves in simulations follow the analytical solutions well and reproduce the birefringence effects of electromagnetic wave modes between the $O$ and $X$ polarizations of perpendicular electromagnetic waves and those between $L$ and $R$ polarizations of parallel waves. This new framework can be applied to kinetic as well as in other types of computer simulations. The solver's key advantage lies in its versatility, allowing it to be used in gyro-motion, gyro-center, and gyro-kinetic simulations, which do not resolve the cyclotron motion, or in plasma studies with ground-level Landau quantization.</description>

      <title>Trinity of black hole correspondences: Shadows, quasinormal modes, graybody factors, and cautionary remarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01909v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correspondences between apparently distant concepts are ubiquitous in theoretical physics. In the context of black holes (BHs), quasinormal modes (QNMs) were shown to be linked to both shadows, in the so-called eikonal limit, and graybody factors (GBFs), using the WKB approximation. We test the accuracy of the QNM-GBF correspondence in the context of the Hawking radiation for static and rotating black hole configurations, with particular attention to the superradiant regime. Our analysis reveals the correspondence failure to accurately reproduce the Hawking spectrum due to divergences. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between BH shadows and GBFs by drawing a correspondence between such quantities in the case of generic static and spherically symmetric spacetime configurations. The shadow-GBF correspondence is tested for some case studies, including regular BHs, and its limitations and applicability are discussed. This study opens new perspectives by introducing a new correspondence and remarking on the caution needed when considering these connections.</description>

      <title>Disruptions of stars and binary systems on chaotic orbits in an axisymmetric Milky Way center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-spherical potentials allow a wide range of trajectories, both regular and chaotic, whose periapse distances can vary orbit to orbit. In particular chaotic trajectories can bring a system arbitrarily close to the central massive black hole leading to a disruption. In this paper, we work with an observationally benchmarked model of the innermost 200 pc of the Milky Way and show that low z-angular momentum trajectories are commonly chaotic. We compute the timescales and properties of close pericenter passages, and compare the implied collisionless disruption rate to the well-studied collisional rate from 2-body scatterings. We find that the relative collisionless rate can dominate by orders of magnitude. Our calculations are relevant for a wide range of disruption phenomena, including the production of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). Most of these disruptions involve stars come from the Nuclear Stellar Cluster, with a pericenter distribution that strongly favours shallow encounters, and a preference for high inclination interactions. The latter implies that unbound disrupted material - whether ejected stars or stellar debris - would be preferentially directed towards the galactic poles. Many of our conclusions apply generally to any galaxy with a non-spherical galactic centre potential and central massive black hole.</description>
