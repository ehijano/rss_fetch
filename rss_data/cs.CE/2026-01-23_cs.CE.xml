      <title>ManuRAG: Multi-modal Retrieval Augmented Generation for Manufacturing Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of digital manufacturing requires intelligent Question Answering (QA) systems that can seamlessly integrate and analyze complex multi-modal data, such as text, images, formulas, and tables. Conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methods often fall short in handling this complexity, resulting in subpar performance. We introduce ManuRAG, an innovative multi-modal RAG framework designed for manufacturing QA, incorporating specialized techniques to improve answer accuracy, reliability, and interpretability. To benchmark performance, we evaluate ManuRAG on three datasets comprising a total of 1,515 QA pairs, corresponding to mathematical, multiple-choice, and review-based questions in manufacturing principles and practices. Experimental results show that ManuRAG consistently outperforms existing methods across all evaluated datasets. Furthermore, ManuRAG's adaptable design makes it applicable to other domains, including law, healthcare, and finance, positioning it as a versatile tool for domain-specific QA.</description>

      <title>MuSAlS: A Fast Multiple Sequence Alignment Approach Using Hierarchical Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) problem has been extensively studied, with numerous approaches developed over recent years. With the rapid growth of sequence data, there is an increasing need for fast and accurate MSA tools that scale effectively to large datasets. Building on our previous work on CLAM, we are able to use exact dynamic programming (Needleman-Wunsch) while scaling to large datasets. We introduce MuSAlS (Multiple Sequence Alignment at Scale), a fast and scalable de novo MSA aligner. MuSAlS uses hierarchical clustering to construct a guide tree based on the Levenshtein distance metric, enabling efficient and accurate alignment through a bottom-up approach. Results: MuSAlS achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving runtime performance. This makes it a valuable tool for researchers analyzing large-scale genomic and metagenomic datasets, addressing the growing demand for scalable bioinformatics solutions. Availability and Implementation: MuSAlS is implemented in the Rust programming language, and available at https://github.com/URI-ABD/clam</description>

      <title>zkFinGPT: Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Financial Generative Pre-trained Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial Generative Pre-trained Transformers (FinGPT) with multimodal capabilities are now being increasingly adopted in various financial applications. However, due to the intellectual property of model weights and the copyright of training corpus and benchmarking questions, verifying the legitimacy of GPT's model weights and the credibility of model outputs is a pressing challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel zkFinGPT scheme that applies zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to high-value financial use cases, enabling verification while protecting data privacy. We describe how zkFinGPT will be applied to three financial use cases. Our experiments on two existing packages reveal that zkFinGPT introduces substantial computational overhead that hinders its real-world adoption. E.g., for LLama3-8B model, it generates a commitment file of $7.97$MB using $531$ seconds, and takes $620$ seconds to prove and $2.36$ seconds to verify.</description>

      <title>NMRGym: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Based Molecular Structure Elucidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the cornerstone of small-molecule structure elucidation. While deep learning has demonstrated significant potential in automating structure elucidation and spectral simulation, current progress is severely impeded by the reliance on synthetic datasets, which introduces significant domain shifts when applied to real-world experimental spectra. Furthermore, the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and rigorous data splitting strategies frequently leads to unfair comparisons and data leakage. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{NMRGym}, the largest and most comprehensive standardized dataset and benchmark derived from high-quality experimental NMR data to date. Comprising \textbf{269,999} unique molecules paired with high-fidelity $^1$H and $^{13}$C spectra, NMRGym bridges the critical gap between synthetic approximations and real-world diversity. We implement a strict quality control pipeline and unify data formats to ensure fair comparison. To strictly prevent data leakage, we enforce a scaffold-based split. Additionally, we provide fine-grained peak-atom level annotations to support future usage. Leveraging this resource, we establish a comprehensive evaluation suite covering diverse downstream tasks, including structure elucidation, functional group prediction from NMR, toxicity prediction from NMR, and spectral simulation, benchmarking representative state-of-the-art methodologies. Finally, we release an open-source leadboard with an automated leaderboard to foster community collaboration and standardize future research. The dataset, benchmark and leaderboard are publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://AIMS-Lab-HKUSTGZ.github.io/NMRGym/}.</description>

      <title>Endowing Molecular Language with Geometry Perception via Modality Compensation for High-Throughput Quantum Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Hamiltonian is a fundamental property that governs a molecule's electronic structure and behavior, and its calculation and prediction are paramount in computational chemistry and materials science. Accurate prediction is highly reliant on extensive training data, including precise molecular geometries and the Hamiltonian matrices, which are expensive to acquire via either experimental or computational methods. Towards a fast yet accurate method for Hamiltonian prediction, we first introduce a geometry information-aware molecular language model to bypass the use of expensive molecular geometries by only using the readily available molecular language -- simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES). Our method employs multimodal alignment to bridge the relationship between SMILES strings and their corresponding molecular geometries. Recognizing that the molecular language inherently lacks explicit geometric information, we propose a geometry modality compensation strategy to imbue molecular language representations with essential geometric features, thereby enabling accurate predictions using SMILES. In addition, given the high cost of acquiring Hamiltonian data, we devise a weakly supervised strategy to fine-tune the molecular language model, thus improving the data efficiency. Theoretically, we prove that the prediction generalization error without explicit molecular geometry can be bounded through our modality compensation scheme. Empirically, our method achieves superior computational efficiency, providing up to 100x speedup over conventional quantum mechanical methods while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy. We further demonstrate the practical case study of our approach in the screening of electrolyte formulations.</description>

      <title>FUGC: Benchmarking Semi-Supervised Learning Methods for Cervical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cervical structures in transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is critical for assessing the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (PTB), yet the scarcity of labeled data limits the performance of supervised learning approaches. This paper introduces the Fetal Ultrasound Grand Challenge (FUGC), the first benchmark for semi-supervised learning in cervical segmentation, hosted at ISBI 2025. FUGC provides a dataset of 890 TVS images, including 500 training images, 90 validation images, and 300 test images. Methods were evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HD), and runtime (RT), with a weighted combination of 0.4/0.4/0.2. The challenge attracted 10 teams with 82 participants submitting innovative solutions. The best-performing methods for each individual metric achieved 90.26\% mDSC, 38.88 mHD, and 32.85 ms RT, respectively. FUGC establishes a standardized benchmark for cervical segmentation, demonstrates the efficacy of semi-supervised methods with limited labeled data, and provides a foundation for AI-assisted clinical PTB risk assessment.</description>

      <title>UniField: Joint Multi-Domain Training for Universal Surface Pressure Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24106v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of surface pressure fields around objects is fundamental to aerodynamic analysis and design. While neural networks have shown promise as efficient alternatives to expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, their applicability is often constrained by data scarcity and poor generalization across different aerodynamic domains. To address these challenges, we propose UniField, a unified framework that enables joint training across multiple aerodynamic domains including automobiles, trains, aircraft. UniField employs a shared geometry encoder to extract domain-agnostic representations from surface point clouds, and integrates domain-specific flow information through Parallel Flow-Conditioned Adaptive LayerNorm (PFC-AdaLN). In addition to consolidating existing datasets from specialized research field including automobiles, trains and aircraft, we further introduce ThingiCFD, a large-scale CFD dataset constructed from Thingi10k geometries with extensive flow condition randomization, substantially expanding geometric and flow diversity during training. UniField achieves SOTA performance on the public DrivAerNet++ benchmark. In addition, our experiments demonstrate that joint multi-domain training consistently improves surface pressure prediction accuracy, particularly in data-scarce domains. These results highlight the potential of UniField as a foundation model for data-driven aerodynamic modeling. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/zoujunhong/UniField.</description>

      <title>A Domain Decomposition-based Solver for Acoustic Wave propagation in Two-Dimensional Random Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An acoustic wave propagation problem with a log normal random field approximation for wave speed is solved using a sampling-free intrusive stochastic Galerkin approach. The stochastic partial differential equation with the inputs and outputs expanded using polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is transformed into a set of deterministic PDEs and further to a system of linear equations. Domain decomposition (DD)-based solvers are utilized to handle the overwhelming computational cost for the resulting system with increasing mesh size, time step and number of random parameters. A conjugate gradient iterative solver with a two-level Neumann-Neumann preconditioner is applied here showing their efficient scalabilities.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of multi-path propagation artefacts in acoustic targets with adaptive cepstral filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive acoustic sensing is a cost-effective solution for monitoring moving targets such as vessels and aircraft, but its performance is hindered by complex propagation effects like multi-path reflections and motion-induced artefacts. Existing filtering techniques do not properly incorporate the characteristics of the environment or account for variability in medium properties, limiting their effectiveness in separating source and reflection components. This paper proposes a method for separating target signals from their reflections in a spectrogram. Temporal filtering is applied to cepstral coefficients using an adaptive band-stop filter, which dynamically adjusts its bandwidth based on the relative intensity of the quefrency components. The method improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and log-spectral distance (LSD) across velocities ranging from 10 to 100 metres per second in aircraft noise with simulated motion. It also enhanced the performance of ship-type classification in underwater tasks by 2.28 and 2.62 Matthews Correlation Coefficient percentage points for the DeepShip and VTUAD v2 datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed pipeline to improve acoustic target classification and time-delay estimation in multi-path environments, with future work aimed at amplitude preservation and multi-sensor applications.</description>
