      <title>The Non-Orientable Four-Ball Genus of a New Infinite Family of Torus Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend previous work by using a combination of band surgeries and known bounds to compute $\gamma_4(T_{4n, (2n\pm1)^2 + 4n-2}) = 2n-1$ for all $n \geq 1$. We further generalize this result by showing that $\gamma_4(T_{4n + 2k, n(4n + 2k) - 1}) = \gamma_4(T_{4n + 2k, (n+2)(4n + 2k) - 1}) = 2n-1 + k$ for all $n \geq 1$ and $k \geq 0$. All knots in this family are counterexamples to Batson's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Oriented graphs on curve complex I: hyperbolic and extremal length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate oriented graphs based on the curve complex $C(S)$ of a closed surface $S$ and induced by functions on the vertex set of $C(S)$. In particular, we introduce the Dehn quasi-homothetic functions, which behave similarly to homotheties under repeated Dehn twists. We prove that any two positive such functions of the same type induce different oriented graphs unless they are proportional. This leads to a new rigidity result for closed hyperbolic surfaces -- distinct from the $9g-9$ theorem and length spectrum rigidity -- knowing only for any two disjoint simple closed curves which one is longer (in terms of hyperbolic or extremal length) suffices to determine the hyperbolic metric on the surface. We also prove that each automorphism of the oriented graph induced by a function with sublevel sets finite is induced by a self-homeomorphism of $S$.</description>

      <title>The link surgery formula and equivariant surgeries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an equivariant version of the Heegaard Floer link surgery formula. As a special case, this gives an equivariant knot surgery formula for equivariant knots in $S^3$. Our proof goes by way of a naturality theorem for certain bordered modules described by the last author. As a sample application, we prove the kernel of the forgetful map from the equivariant homology cobordism group to the homology cobordism group contains a $\Z^\infty$-summand.</description>

      <title>The HOMFLYPT skein module of $S^1 \times S^2$ via braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the HOMFLYPT skein module of $S^1 \times S^2\, \cong \, L(0, 1)$, denoted $\mathcal{S}(S^1 \times S^2)$, using braid-theoretic techniques. We extend the Lambropoulou invariant, $X$, for links in the solid torus ST to links in $S^1 \times S^2$, by solving an infinite system of equations of the form $X_{\widehat{a}} = X_{\widehat{bbm(a)}}$, where $bbm(a)$ denotes all possible band moves applied to $a$, for all $a$ in a basis of $\mathcal{S}(ST)$. We show that the free part of $\mathcal{S}(S^1 \times S^2)$ is generated by the empty link, while all other elements are torsion.</description>

      <title>Transverse invariant as Khovanov skein spectrum at its extreme Alexander grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a space-level formulation of Khovanov skein homology by constructing a stable homotopy type for annular links. We explicitly define a cover functor from the skein flow category to the cube flow category, thereby establishing the Khovanov skein spectrum. This spectrum extends the framework of Lipshitz and Sarkar's Khovanov spectrum and provides new avenues for understanding transverse link invariants in the annular setting. Furthermore, we establish a map from the Khovanov spectrum to the Khovanov skein spectrum, which, at extreme gradings, recovers the cohomotopy transverse invariant defined by Lipshitz, Ng, and Sarkar.</description>

      <title>A basis and Schur-Weyl duality for the loop Hecke algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The loop Hecke algebra is a generalization of the Hecke algebra to the loop braid group, introduced by Damiani, Martin and Rowell. We give a new presentation of the loop Hecke algebra provided a mild condition on the parameter and give a basis. We use higher linear rewriting theory to show linear independence and the combinatorics of Dyck paths to compute the cardinality of the basis. This yields a conjecture of Damiani-Martin-Rowel. We also give a representation theoretic interpretation of the loop Hecke algebra in terms of (non-semisimple) Schur-Weyl duality involving the negative half of quantum $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:0808.1199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any collection of graphs we find the minimal dimension d such that the product of these graphs is embeddable into the d-dimensional Euclidean space. In particular, we prove that the n-th powers of the Kuratowsky graphs are not embeddable into the 2n-dimensional Euclidean space. This is a solution of a problem of Menger from 1929. The idea of the proof is the reduction to a problem from so-called Ramsey link theory: we show that any embedding of L into the (2n-1)-dimensional sphere, where L is the join of n copies of a 4-point set, has a pair of linked (n-1)-dimensional spheres.</description>

      <title>On quasi-arithmeticity of hyperbolic gluings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a more general version of the gluings of hyperbolic orbifolds in the spirit of Gromov and Piatetski-Shapiro, where the gluing pieces, called the building blocks, are no longer assumed to be arithmetic or incommensurable.
  We prove that if such a general hyperbolic gluing along a common finite-volume totally geodesic hypersurface is quasi-arithmetic (this is a broader notion than that of arithmeticity) then each building block must be quasi-arithmetic as well and, moreover, with the same ambient group and adjoint trace field. We also show that there exist arithmetic gluings whose building blocks are incommensurable even despite the reflection with respect to the lift of the gluing locus commensurates the fundamental group of the gluing. On the other hand, we provide an example of nonarithmetic but quasi-arithmetic orbifolds such that a specific gluing of such an orbifold with itself along the boundary gives rise to an arithmetic hyperbolic orbifold.
  We illustrate the above results in the setting of reflection groups and hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra and apply them to rule out the (quasi-)arithmeticity of a family of ideal hyperbolic right-angled $3$-polyhedra, namely, certain ``twisted'' ideal right-angled antiprisms, which play an important role in low-dimensional geometry and topology.</description>

      <title>The genus 1 bridge number of satellite knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a satellite knot, link, or spatial graph in a 3-manifold $M$ that is either $S^3$ or a lens space. Let $\mathfrak{b}_0$ and $\mathfrak{b}_1$ denote genus 0 and genus 1 bridge number, respectively. Suppose that $T$ has a companion knot $K$ (necessarily not the unknot) and wrapping number $\omega$ with respect to $K$. When $K$ is not a torus knot, we show that $\mathfrak{b}_1(T)\geq \omega \mathfrak{b}_1(K)$. There are previously known counter-examples if $K$ is a torus knot. Along the way, we generalize and give a new proof of Schubert's result that $\mathfrak{b}_0(T) \geq \omega \mathfrak{b}_0(K)$. We also prove versions of the theorem applicable to when $T$ is a ``lensed satellite'' and when there is a torus separating components of $T$.</description>

      <title>Trigonometry of partially truncated triangles and tetrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first main results of this note establish forms of the hyperbolic laws of cosines and sines for certain classes of quadrilaterals and pentagons in the hyperbolic plane, having at least one ideal vertex and right angles at non-ideal vertices, in which the length of a horocyclic cross-section at an ideal vertex plays the role filled by the dihedral angle in the usual versions of these laws. The second set of main results concern transversal length, meaning the distance from a designated internal edge to its opposite, of partially truncated tetrahedra in three-dimensional hyperbolic space whose non-truncated vertices are ideal. Transversal lengths of such tetrahedra are proved to depend only on the entire collection of internal edge lengths (interpreted at ideal vertices in terms of horospherical cross-sections), and bounds on these lengths are established. The case of ideal tetrahedra (no truncated vertices) is also considered. All main results are established using the unifying perspective of the hyperboloid model and Lorentzian geometry. A thorough introduction to this perspective is provided, with references as appropriate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any infinite-type surface $S$, a natural question is whether the homology of its mapping class group contains any non-trivial classes that are supported on (i) a compact subsurface or (ii) a finite-type subsurface. Our purpose here is to study this question, in particular giving an almost-complete answer when the genus of $S$ is positive (including infinite) and a partial answer when the genus of $S$ is zero. Our methods involve the notion of shiftable subsurfaces as well as homological stability for mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color Lie algebras, which were introduced by Ree, are a graded extension of Lie (super)algebras by an abelian group. We show that the color Lie algebras can be used to construct universal weight systems for knot invariants of of Vassiliev and Kontsevich. As a simple example, we take $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ as the grading group and consider the four-dimensional color Lie algebra called $A1_{\epsilon}$. The weight system constructed from $A1_{\epsilon}$ is studied in some detail and some relations between the weights, such as the recurrence relation for chord diagrams, are derived. These relations show that the weight system from $A1_{\epsilon}$ is a hybrid of those from $sl(2)$ and $gl(1|1)$.</description>

Abstract: We partially determine grid homology (combinatorial knot Floer homology) of diagonal knots, which are conjectured to be equivalent to positive braid knots, by exploiting nice grid diagrams. Its next-to-top term detects the number of prime factors, and the $\text{top}-2$ term corresponds to the decompositions of the knot into two non-integer tangles. We compare diagonal knots to various classes of knots, such as positive braids, fibered positive knots, and $L$-space knots.</description>

Abstract: We study algebraic aspects of generalized Legendrian racks, which are nonassociative structures based on the Legendrian Reidemeister moves.
  We answer an open question characterizing the group of GL-structures on a given rack. As applications, we classify several infinite families of GL-racks. We also compute automorphism groups of dihedral GL-quandles.
  Then we compute the centers of the category of GL-racks and several of its full subcategories. We also construct an equivalence of categories between racks and GL-quandles.
  We also study tensor products of racks and GL-racks coming from universal algebra. Surprisingly, the categories of racks and GL-racks have tensor units. The induced symmetric monoidal structure on medial racks is closed, and similarly for medial GL-racks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Patterson--Sullivan systems, which consist of a group action on a compact metrizable space and a quasi-invariant measure which behaves like a classical Patterson--Sullivan measure. For such systems we prove a generalization of Tukia's measurable boundary rigidity theorem. We then apply this generalization to (1) study the singularity conjecture for Patterson--Sullivan measures (or, conformal densities) and stationary measures of random walks on isometry groups of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, mapping class groups, and discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups; (2) prove versions of Tukia's theorem for word hyperbolic groups, Teichm\"uller spaces, and higher rank symmetric spaces; and (3) prove an entropy rigidity result for pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <title>Arnold Strangeness of surface immersions</title>

Abstract: It is known that for any smooth sphere eversion, the number of quadruple point jumps is always odd. In this paper, we define an integer-valued function that detects and classifies jumps involving quadruple points and triple-line tangencies. Our function provides a higher-dimensional analogue of the Arnold strangeness invariant for plane curves. It classifies quadruple point jumps into the five geometrically distinct cases based on coorientation data and reflects finer geometric features for generic immersions of closed surfaces into the 3-space.</description>
