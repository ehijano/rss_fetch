      <title>Skew derivations of quantum tori and quantum spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the $\sigma$-derivations of quantum tori and quantum affine spaces for a toric automorphism $\sigma$. By standard results, every toric automorphism $\sigma$ of a quantum affine space $\mathcal{A}$ and every $\sigma$-derivation of $\mathcal{A}$ extend uniquely to the corresponding quantum torus $\mathcal{T}$. We shall see that, for a toric automorphism $\sigma$, every $\sigma$-derivation of $\mathcal{T}$ is a unique sum of an inner $\sigma$-derivation and a $\sigma$-derivation that is conjugate to a derivation and that the latter is non-zero only if $\sigma$ is an inner automorphism of $\mathcal{T}$. This is applied to determine the $\sigma$-derivations of $\mathcal{A}$ for a toric automorphism $\sigma$, generalizing results of Alev and Chamarie for the derivations of quantum affine spaces and of Almulhem and Brzezi\'{n}ski for $\sigma$-derivations of the quantum plane.
  We apply the results to iterated Ore extensions $A$ of the base field for which all the defining endomorphisms are automorphisms and each of the adjoined indeterminates is an eigenvector for all the subsequent defining automorphisms. We present an algorithm which, in characteristic zero, will, for such an algebra $A$, either construct a quantum torus between $A$ and its quotient division algebra or show that no such quantum torus exists.
  Also included is a general section on skew derivations which become inner on localization at the powers of a normal element which is an eigenvector for the relevant automorphism. This section explores a connection between such skew derivations and normalizing sequences of length two. This connection is illustrated by known examples of skew derivations and by the construction of a family of skew derivations for the parametric family of subalgebras of the Weyl algebra that has been studied in three papers by Benkart, Lopes and Ondrus.</description>

      <title>Gray categories with duals and their diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0529</link>
      <description>arXiv:1211.0529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric and algebraic properties of Gray categories with duals are investigated by means of a diagrammatic calculus. The diagrams are three-dimensional stratifications of a cube, with regions, surfaces, lines and vertices labelled by Gray category data. These can be viewed as a generalisation of ribbon diagrams. The Gray categories present two types of duals, which are extended to functors of strict tricategories with natural isomorphisms, and correspond directly to symmetries of the diagrams. It is shown that these functors can be strictified so that the symmetries of a cube are realised exactly. A new condition on Gray categories with duals called the spatial condition is defined. A class of diagrams for which the evaluation for spatial Gray categories is invariant under homeomorphisms is exhibited. This relation between the geometry of the diagrams and structures in the Gray categories proves useful in computations and has potential applications in topological quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Indecomposable involutive set-theoretical solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation of size $p^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Yang-Baxter equation is a braiding condition on vector spaces which is of high relevance in several fields of mathematics, such as knot theory and quantum group theory. Their combinatorial counterpart are set-theoretic solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation, whose investigation is strongly driven by the study of algebraic objects called (skew) braces. In this article, we focus on indecomposable involutive non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. More specifically, through a thorough analysis of their associated braces, we give a full classification of those which are of size $p^2$, for $p$ a prime.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Dualities and Asymptotics of Dynamic Stochastic Higher Spin Vertex Models, using the Drinfeld Twister</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new, algebraic method to construct duality functions for integrable dynamic models. This method will be implemented on dynamic stochastic higher spin vertex models, where we prove the duality functions are the $ _3 \varphi_2$ functions. A degeneration of these duality functions are orthogonal polynomial dualities of Groenevelt--Wagener arXiv:2306.12318. The method involves using the universal twister of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, viewed as a quasi--triangular, quasi--$^*$--Hopf algebra. The algebraic method is presented very generally and is expected to produce duality functions for other dynamic integrable models. As an application of the duality, we prove that the asymptotic fluctuations of the dynamic stochastic six vertex model with step initial conditions are governed by the Tracy--Widom distribution.</description>
