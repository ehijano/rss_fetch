      <title>Tapes as Stochastic Matrices of String Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tape diagrams provide a graphical notation for categories equipped with two monoidal products, $\otimes$ and $\oplus$, where $\oplus$ is a biproduct. Recently, they have been generalised to handle Kleisli categories of arbitrary monoidal monads. In this work, we show that for the subdistribution monad, tapes are isomorphic to stochastic matrices of subdistributions of string diagrams. We then exploit this result to provide a complete axiomatisation of probabilistic Boolean circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relational semantics of linear logic is a powerful framework for defining resource-aware models of the $\lambda$-calculus. However, its quantitative aspects are not reflected in the preorders and equational theories induced by these models. Indeed, they can be characterized in terms of (in)equalities between B\"ohm trees up to extensionality, which are qualitative in nature. We employ the recently introduced checkers calculus to provide a quantitative and contextual interpretation of the preorder associated to the relational semantics. This way, we show that the relational semantics refines the contextual preorder constraining the number of interactions between the related terms and the context.</description>

      <title>Satisfiability in {\L}ukasiewicz logic and its unbounded relative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unbounded {\L}ukasiewicz logic is a substructural logic that combines features of infinite-valued {\L}ukasiewicz logic with those of abelian logic. The logic is finitely strongly complete w.r.t.~the additive $\ell$-group on the reals expanded with a distinguished element $-1$. We show that the existential theory of this structure is NP-complete. This provides a complexity upper bound for the set of theorems and the finite consequence relation of unbounded {\L}ukasiewicz logic. The result is obtained by reducing the problem to the existential theory of the MV-algebra on the reals, the standard semantics of {\L}ukasiewicz logic. This provides a new connection between both logics. The result entails a translation of the existential theory of the standard MV-algebra into itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Heraclitean Dialectical Concept Spaces (HDCS), a topological framework for modelling how concepts evolve. Concepts are represented as open regions generated by neighbourhoods in a feasible family, and their relationships are organised through overlaps and channel ideals. New concepts emerge from remainders where existing structures fail to fit together, and inherit their topology from these parent regions. HDCS extends across developmental stages using carry maps and a colimit topology, giving a global picture of conceptual change. Short case studies from economic exchange, biology, and the history of the zero symbol illustrate the scope of the framework.</description>

      <title>A formal query language and automata model for aggregation in complex event recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex Event Recognition (CER) systems are used to identify complex patterns in event streams, such as those found in stock markets, sensor networks, and other similar applications. An important task in such patterns is aggregation, which involves summarizing a set of values into a single value using an algebraic function, such as the maximum, sum, or average, among others. Despite the relevance of this task, query languages in CER typically support aggregation in a restricted syntactic form, and their semantics are generally undefined.
  In this work, we present a first step toward formalizing a query language with aggregation for CER. We propose to extend Complex Event Logic (CEL), a formal query language for CER, with aggregation operations. This task requires revisiting the semantics of CEL, using a new semantics based on bags of tuples instead of sets of positions. Then, we present an extension of CEL, called Aggregation CEL (ACEL), which introduces an aggregation operator for any commutative monoid operation. The operator can be freely composed with previous CEL operators, allowing users to define complex queries and patterns. We showcase several queries in practice where ACEL proves to be natural for specifying them. From the computational side, we present a novel automata model, called Aggregation Complex Event Automata (ACEA), that extends the previous proposal of Complex Event Automata (CEA) with aggregation and filtering features. Moreover, we demonstrate that every query in ACEL can be expressed in ACEA, illustrating the effectiveness of our computational model. Finally, we study the expressiveness of ACEA through the lens of ACEL, showing that the automata model is more expressive than ACEL.</description>

      <title>KOS-TL (Knowledge Operation System Type Logic)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces KOS-TL (Knowledge Operation System Type Logic), a novel constructive framework designed to provide a rigorous logical foundation for autonomous and executable knowledge systems. Traditional knowledge representation models often suffer from a gap between static symbolic logic and dynamic system execution. To bridge this divide, KOS-TL leverages Dependent Type Theory to unify data, logic, and proof into a singular computational substrate.The architecture of KOS-TL is organized into three hierarchical layers: the Core Layer, which defines the static type universe and constructive primitives; the Kernel Layer, which governs state evolution through an event-driven mechanism characterized by the triple $\langle \Sigma, \textsf{Ev}, \Delta \rangle$; and the Runtime Layer, responsible for the bidirectional refinement of physical signals into logical evidence. We formally define the operational semantics of the system and prove key meta-theoretical properties, including Progress and Evolutionary Consistency, ensuring that the system remains logically self-consistent and free from stuck states during continuous state transitions.By integrating Davidsonian event semantics with Martin-L\"of type theory, KOS-TL enables the construction of "proof-carrying knowledge," where every state change in the knowledge base is accompanied by a formal witness of its validity. We demonstrate the practical utility of this logic through application examples in industrial traceability and cross-border financial compliance. Our results suggest that KOS-TL provides a robust, formally verifiable basis for the next generation of intelligent, autonomous operating systems.</description>

      <title>Deciding Serializability in Network Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02251v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the SER modeling language for automatically verifying serializability of concurrent programs, i.e., whether every concurrent execution of the program is equivalent to some serial execution. SER programs are suitably restricted to make this problem decidable, while still allowing for an unbounded number of concurrent threads of execution, each potentially running for an unbounded number of steps. Building on prior theoretical results, we give the first automated end-to-end decision procedure that either proves serializability by producing a checkable certificate, or refutes it by producing a counterexample trace. We also present a network-system abstraction to which SER programs compile. Our decision procedure then reduces serializability in this setting to a Petri net reachability query. Furthermore, in order to scale, we curtail the search space via multiple optimizations, including Petri net slicing, semilinear-set compression, and Presburger-formula manipulation. We extensively evaluate our framework and show that, despite the theoretical hardness of the problem, it can successfully handle various models of real-world programs, including stateful firewalls, BGP routers, and more.</description>

      <title>A syntactic proof of decidability for the logic of bunched implication BI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.05847v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logic of bunched implication BI provides a framework for reasoning about resource composition and forms the basis for an assertion language of separation logic which is used to reason about software programs. Propositional BI is obtained by freely combining propositional intuitionistic logic and multiplicative intuitionistic linear logic. It possesses an elegant proof theory: its bunched calculus combines the sequent calculi for these logics. Several natural extensions of BI have been shown as undecidable, e.g. Boolean BI which replaces intuitionistic logic with classical logic. This makes the decidability of BI, proved recently via an intricate semantical argument, particularly noteworthy. However, a syntactic proof of decidability has thus far proved elusive. We obtain such a proof here using a proof-theoretic argument. The proof is technically interesting, accessible as it uses the usual bunched calculus (it does not require any knowledge of the semantics of BI), yields an implementable decision procedure and implies an upper bound on the complexity of the logic.</description>

Abstract: We develop Boolean-valued domain theory and show how the lambda-calculus can be interpreted in using domain-valued random variables. We focus on the reflexive domain construction rather than the language and its semantics. The notion of equality has to be interpreted in the Boolean algebra and when we say that an equation is valid in the model we mean that its interpretation is the top element of the Boolean algebra.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Universes in Homotopy Type Theory</title>

Abstract: Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial functors with extra structure (termed ``natural models'') hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to a particular \emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely within this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key additional condition on polynomial functors -- \emph{univalence} -- which is sufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent polynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic structures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of dependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition \emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory of natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial universe being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a distributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of dependent products over dependent sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14283v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the relationships between axiomatic and cyclic proof systems for the partial and total versions of Hoare logic and those of its dual, known as reverse Hoare logic (or sometimes incorrectness logic). In the axiomatic proof systems for these logics, the proof rules for looping constructs involve an explicit loop invariant, which in the case of the total versions additionally require a well-founded termination measure. In the cyclic systems, these are replaced by rules that simply unroll the loops, together with a principle allowing the formation of cycles in the proof, subject to a global soundness condition that ensures the well-foundedness of the circular reasoning. Interestingly, the cyclic soundness conditions for partial Hoare logic and its reverse are similar and essentially coinductive in character, while those for the total versions are also similar and essentially inductive. We show that these cyclic systems are sound, by direct argument, and relatively complete, by translation from axiomatic to cyclic proofs.</description>

Abstract: Partial Markov categories are a recent framework for categorical probability theory that provide an abstract account of partial probabilistic computation with updating semantics. In this article, we discuss two order relations on the morphisms of a partial Markov category. In particular, we prove that every partial Markov category is canonically preorder-enriched, recovering several well-known order enrichments. We also demonstrate that the existence of codiagonal maps (comparators) is closely related to order properties of partial Markov categories. Finally, we introduce a synthetic version of the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality and, from it, we prove that updating increases validity.</description>

      <title>Initial Algebras of Domains via Quotient Inductive-Inductive Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain theory has been developed as a mathematical theory of computation and to give a denotational semantics to programming languages. It helps us to fix the meaning of language concepts, to understand how programs behave and to reason about programs. At the same time it serves as a great theory to model various algebraic effects such as non-determinism, partial functions, side effects and numerous other forms of computation.
  In the present paper, we present a general framework to construct algebraic effects in domain theory, where our domains are DCPOs: directed complete partial orders. We first describe so called DCPO algebras for a signature, where the signature specifies the operations on the DCPO and the inequational theory they obey. This provides a method to represent various algebraic effects, like partiality. We then show that initial DCPO algebras exist by defining them as so called Quotient Inductive-Inductive Types (QIITs), known from homotopy type theory. A quotient inductive-inductive type allows one to simultaneously define an inductive type and an inductive relation on that type, together with equations on the type. We illustrate our approach by showing that several well-known constructions of DCPOs fit our framework: coalesced sums, smash products and free DCPOs (partiality and power domains). Our work makes use of various features of homotopy type theory and is formalized in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Continuation Semantics for Fixpoint Modal Logic and Computation Tree Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce continuation semantics for both fixpoint modal logic (FML) and Computation Tree Logic* (CTL*), parameterised by a choice of branching type and quantitative predicate lifting. Our main contribution is proving that they are equivalent to coalgebraic semantics, for all branching types. Our continuation semantics is defined over coalgebras of the continuation monad whose answer type coincides with the domain of truth values of the formulas. By identifying predicates and continuations, such a coalgebra has a canonical interpretation of the modality by evaluation of continuations. We show that this continuation semantics is equivalent to the coalgebraic semantics for fixpoint modal logic. We then reformulate the current construction for coalgebraic models of CTL*. These models are usually required to have an infinitary trace/maximal execution map, characterized as the greatest fixpoint of a special operator. Instead, we allow coalgebraic models of CTL* to employ non-maximal fixpoints, which we call execution maps. Under this reformulation, we establish a general result on transferring execution maps via monad morphisms. From this result, we obtain that continuation semantics is equivalent to the coalgebraic semantics for CTL*. We also identify a sufficient condition under which CTL can be encoded into fixpoint modal logic under continuation semantics.</description>

      <title>Reversible computations are computations</title>

Abstract: Causality serves as an abstract notion of time for concurrent systems. A computation is causal, or simply valid, if each observation of a computation event is preceded by the observation of its causes. The present work establishes that this simple requirement is equally relevant when the occurrence of an event is invertible. We propose a conservative extension of causal models for concurrency that accommodates reversible computations. We first model reversible computations using a symmetric residuation operation in the general model of configuration structures. We show that stable configuration structures, which correspond to prime algebraic domains, remain stable under the action of this residuation. We then derive a semantics of reversible computations for prime event structures, which is shown to coincide with a switch operation that dualizes conflict and causality.</description>

      <title>Strong Dinatural Transformations and Generalised Codensity Monads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce dicodensity monads: a generalisation of pointwise codensity monads generated by functors to monads generated by mixed-variant bifunctors. Our construction is based on the notion of strong dinaturality (also known as Barr dinaturality), and is inspired by denotational models of certain types in polymorphic lambda calculi - in particular, a form of continuation monads with universally quantified variables, such as the Church encoding of the list monad in System F. Extending some previous results on Cayley-style representations, we provide a set of sufficient conditions to establish an isomorphism between a monad and the dicodensity monad for a given bifunctor. Then, we focus on the class of monads obtained by instantiating our construction with hom-functors and, more generally, bifunctors given by objects of homomorphisms (that is, internalised hom-sets between Eilenberg--Moore algebras). This gives us, for example, novel presentations of monads generated by different kinds of semirings and other theories used to model ordered nondeterministic computations.</description>

Abstract: Traces form a coarse notion of semantic equivalence between states of a process, and have been studied coalgebraically for various types of system. We instantiate the finitary coalgebraic trace semantics framework of Hasuo et al. for controller-versus-environment games, encompassing both nondeterministic and probabilistic environments. Although our choice of monads is guided by the constraints of this abstract framework, they enable us to recover familiar game-theoretic concepts. Concretely, we show that in these games, each element in the trace map corresponds to a collection (a subset or distribution) of plays the controller can force. Furthermore, each element can be seen as the outcome of following a controller strategy. Our results are parametrised by a weak distributive law, which computes what the controller can force in a single step.</description>

      <title>Bridge and Bound: A Logic-Based Framework for Abstracting (Extended Report)</title>

Abstract: At its core, abstraction is the process of generalizing from specific instances to broader concepts or models, with the primary objective of reducing complexity while preserving properties essential to the intended purpose. It is a~fundamental, often implicit, principle that structures the understanding, communication, and development of both scientific knowledge and everyday beliefs. Studies on abstraction have evolved from its origins in Ancient Greek philosophy through methodological approaches in psychological and philosophical theories to modern computational frameworks.
  This paper presents a novel logic-based framework for modeling abstraction processes in which all components are expressed within logic. The framework extends beyond the traditional focus on the entailment of necessary conditions by making sufficient conditions first-class citizens as well. We define approximate abstractions, study their tightest and exact forms, and extend the approach to layered abstractions, enabling hierarchical simplification of complex systems and models. The computational complexity of the related reasoning tasks is also discussed.
  For clarity, our framework is developed within classical logic, chosen for its simplicity, expressiveness, and computational friendliness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of compact quantitative equational theory. A quantitative equational theory is defined to be compact if all its consequences are derivable by means of finite proofs. We prove that the theory of interpolative barycentric (also known as convex) quantitative algebras of Mardare et. al. is compact. This serves as a paradigmatic example, used to obtain other compact quantitative equational theories of convex algebras, each axiomatizing some distance on finitely supported probability distributions.</description>

      <title>Compositional Inference for Bayesian Networks and Causality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference is a fundamental reasoning technique in probability theory. When applied to a large joint distribution, it involves updating with evidence (conditioning) in one or more components (variables) and computing the outcome in other components. When the joint distribution is represented by a Bayesian network, the network structure may be exploited to proceed in a compositional manner -- with great benefits. However, the main challenge is that updating involves (re)normalisation, making it an operation that interacts badly with other operations.
  String diagrams are becoming popular as a graphical technique for probabilistic (and quantum) reasoning. Conditioning has appeared in string diagrams, in terms of a disintegration, using bent wires and shaded (or dashed) normalisation boxes. It has become clear that such normalisation boxes do satisfy certain compositional rules. This paper takes a decisive step in this development by adding a removal rule to the formalism, for the deletion of shaded boxes. Via this removal rule one can get rid of shaded boxes and terminate an inference argument. This paper illustrates via many (graphical) examples how the resulting compositional inference technique can be used for Bayesian networks, causal reasoning and counterfactuals.</description>

      <title>Hardness of monadic second-order formulae over succinct graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04522v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our main result is a succinct counterpoint to Courcelle's meta-theorem as follows: every cw-nontrivial monadic second-order (MSO) property is either NP-hard or coNP-hard over graphs given by succinct representations. Succint representations are Boolean circuits computing the adjacency relation. Cw-nontrivial properties are those which have infinitely many models and infinitely many countermodels with bounded cliquewidth. Moreover, we explore what happens when the cw-nontriviality condition is dropped and show that, under a reasonable complexity assumption, the previous dichotomy fails, even for questions expressible in first-order logic.</description>

      <title>Di- is for Directed: First-Order Directed Type Theory via Dinaturality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how dinaturality plays a central role in the interpretation of directed type theory where types are interpreted as (1-)categories and directed equality is represented by $\hom$-functors. We present a general elimination principle based on dinaturality for directed equality which very closely resembles the $J$-rule used in Martin-L\"of type theory, and we highlight which syntactical restrictions are needed to interpret this rule in the context of directed equality. We then use these rules to characterize directed equality as a left relative adjoint to a functor between (para)categories of dinatural transformations which contracts together two variables appearing naturally with a single dinatural one, with the relative functor imposing the syntactic restrictions needed. We then argue that the quantifiers of such a directed type theory should be interpreted as ends and coends, which dinaturality allows us to present in adjoint-like correspondences to a weakening functor. Using these rules we give a formal interpretation to Yoneda reductions and (co)end calculus, and we use logical derivations to prove the Fubini rule for quantifier exchange, the adjointness property of Kan extensions via (co)ends, exponential objects of presheaves, and the (co)Yoneda lemma. We show transitivity (composition), congruence (functoriality), and transport (coYoneda) for directed equality by closely following the same approach of Martin-L\"of type theory, with the notable exception of symmetry. We formalize our main theorems in Agda.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1997, Hofmann and Streicher introduced an explicit construction to lift a Grothendieck universe from the category of sets into the category of set-valued presheaves on a small category. More recently, Awodey presented an elegant functorial analysis of this construction in terms of the categorical nerve, the right adjoint to the functor that takes a presheaf to its category of elements; in particular, the categorical nerve's functorial action on the universal small discrete fibration gives the generic family of the universe's Hofmann-Streicher lifting. Inspired by Awodey's analysis, we define a relative version of Hofmann-Streicher lifting in terms of the right pseudo-adjoint to the 2-functor given by postcomposition with a fibration. Finally, we construct a new 2-bifibration of fibrations in which the opcartesian and cartesian lifts arise from these pseudo-adjunctions.</description>

      <title>Functoriality of Enriched Data Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06059v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, categories of algebras of endofunctors were shown to be enriched in categories of coalgebras of the same endofunctor, and the extra structure of that enrichment was used to define a generalization of inductive data types. These generalized inductive data types are parametrized by a coalgebra $C$, so we call them $C$-inductive data types; we call the morphisms induced by their universal property $C$-inductive functions. We extend that work by incorporating natural transformations into the theory: given a suitable natural transformation between endofunctors, we show that this induces enriched functors between their categories of algebras which preserve $C$-inductive data types and $C$-inductive functions. Such $C$-inductive data types are often finite versions of the corresponding inductive data type, and we show how our framework can extend classical initial algebra semantics to these types. For instance, we show that our theory naturally produces partially inductive functions on lists, changes in list element types, and tree pruning functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Harder-Narasimhan theory provides a canonical filtration of a vector bundle on a projective curve whose successive quotients are semistable with strictly decreasing slopes. In this article, we present the formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory in the proof assistant Lean 4 with Mathlib. This formalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen and Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids the classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize the uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-H\"older filtration of a semistable Harder-Narasimhan game.

      <title>The Functional Machine Calculus III: Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Functional Machine Calculus (Heijltjes 2022) is a new approach to unifying the imperative and functional programming paradigms. It extends the lambda-calculus, preserving the key features of confluent reduction and typed termination, to embed computational effects, evaluation strategies, and control flow operations. The first instalment modelled sequential higher-order computation with global store, input/output, probabilities, and non-determinism, and embedded both the call-by-name and call-by-value lambda-calculus, as well as Moggi's computational metalanguage and Levy's call-by-push-value. The present paper extends the calculus from sequential to branching and looping control flow. This allows the faithful embedding of a minimal but complete imperative language, including conditionals, exception handling, and iteration, as well as constants and algebraic data types.
  The calculus is defined through a simple operational semantics, extending the (simplified) Krivine machine for the lambda-calculus with multiple operand stacks to model effects and a continuation stack to model sequential, branching, and looping computation. It features a confluent reduction relation and a system of simple types that guarantees termination of the machine and strong normalization of reduction (in the absence of iteration). These properties carry over to the embedded imperative language, providing a unified functional-imperative model of computation that supports simple types, a direct and intuitive operational semantics, and a confluent reduction semantics.</description>
