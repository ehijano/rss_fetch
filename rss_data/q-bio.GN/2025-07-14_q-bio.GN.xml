      <title>Topological Sequence Analysis of Genomes: Category Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequence data, such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, exhibit intricate, multi-scale structures that pose significant challenges for conventional analysis methods, particularly those relying on alignment or purely statistical representations. In this work, we introduce category-based topological sequence analysis (CTSA ) of genomes. CTSA models a sequence as a resolution category, capturing its hierarchical structure through a categorical construction. Substructure complexes are then derived from this categorical representation, and their persistent homology is computed to extract multi-scale topological features. Our models depart from traditional alignment-free approaches by incorporating structured mathematical formalisms rooted in sequence topology. The resulting topological signatures provide informative representations across a variety of tasks, including the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the prediction of protein-nucleic acid binding affinities. Comparative studies were carried out against six state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that CTSA achieves excellent and consistent performance in these tasks, suggesting its general applicability and robustness. Beyond sequence analysis, the proposed framework opens new directions for the integration of categorical and homological theories for biological sequence analysis.</description>

      <title>HybridQC: Machine Learning-Augmented Quality Control for Single-Cell RNA-seq Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HybridQC is an R package that streamlines quality control (QC) of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data by combining traditional threshold-based filtering with machine learning-based outlier detection. It provides an efficient and adaptive framework to identify low-quality cells in noisy or shallow-depth datasets using techniques such as Isolation Forest, while remaining compatible with widely adopted formats such as Seurat objects.
  The package is lightweight, easy to install, and suitable for small-to-medium scRNA-seq datasets in research settings. HybridQC is especially useful for projects involving non-model organisms, rare samples, or pilot studies, where automated and flexible QC is critical for reproducibility and downstream analysis.</description>

      <title>MicroTrace: A Lightweight R Tool for SNP-Based Pathogen Clustering in Outbreak Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MicroTrace is an open-source R tool that performs SNP-based hierarchical clustering to detect potential transmission clusters from pathogen whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Designed for epidemiologists, microbiologists, and genomic surveillance teams, it processes SNP distance matrices and outputs dendrograms and cluster tables with optional metadata integration. MicroTrace enables reproducible outbreak detection workflows with minimal setup.</description>

      <title>AMRScan: A hybrid R and Nextflow toolkit for rapid antimicrobial resistance gene detection from sequencing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AMRScan is a hybrid bioinformatics toolkit implemented in both R and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) for the rapid and reproducible detection of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The toolkit enables users to identify AMR gene hits in sequencing reads by aligning them against reference databases such as CARD using BLAST.
  The R implementation provides a concise, script-based approach suitable for single-sample analysis, teaching, and rapid prototyping. In contrast, the Nextflow implementation enables reproducible, scalable workflows for multi-sample batch processing in high-performance computing (HPC) and containerized environments. It leverages modular pipeline design with support for automated database setup, quality control, conversion, BLAST alignment, and results parsing.
  AMRScan helps bridge the gap between lightweight exploratory analysis and production-ready surveillance pipelines, making it suitable for both research and public health genomics applications.</description>

      <title>On learning functions over biological sequence space: relating Gaussian process priors, regularization, and gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mappings from biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) to quantitative measures of sequence functionality play an important role in contemporary biology. We are interested in the related tasks of (i) inferring predictive sequence-to-function maps and (ii) decomposing sequence-function maps to elucidate the contributions of individual subsequences. Because each sequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in multiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires "gauge-fixing," i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique solutions to $L_2$-regularized regression in an overparameterized "weight space" where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in "function space," i.e. the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge. We also show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary explicit Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges. Next, we derive the distribution of gauge-fixed weights implied by the Gaussian process posterior and demonstrate that even for long sequences this distribution can be efficiently computed for product-kernel priors using a kernel trick. Finally, we characterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most common weight space regularizers. Overall, our framework unifies and extends our ability to infer and interpret sequence-function relationships.</description>
