      <title>Bitcoin and Shadow Exchange Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research expands the existing literature on Bitcoin (BTC) price misalignments by incorporating transaction-level data from a peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange, LocalBitcoins.com (LB). It examines how broader economic and regulatory factors influence cryptocurrency markets and highlights the role of cryptocurrencies in facilitating international capital movements. By constructing shadow exchange rates (SERs) for national currencies against the US dollar based on BTC prices, we calculate discrepancies between these SERs and their official exchange rates (OERs), referred to as BTC premiums. We analyze various factors driving the BTC premiums on LB, including those sourced from the BTC blockchain, mainstream centralized BTC exchanges, and international capital transfer channels. Unlike in centralized markets, our results indicate that the microstructure of the BTC blockchain does not correlate with BTC premiums in the P2P market. Regarding frictions from international capital transfers, we interpret remittance costs as indicators of inefficiencies in traditional capital transfer systems. For constrained currencies subject to severe capital controls and managed exchange rate regimes, increased transaction costs in conventional currency exchange channels almost entirely translate into higher BTC premiums. Additionally, our analysis suggests that BTC premiums can serve as short-term predictors of future exchange rate depreciation for unconstrained currencies.</description>

      <title>Price Regulation, Technology and Provider Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do price regulations lead to inefficiencies and trade loss? The answer depends on the type of regulation, monetary and non-monetary factors influencing demand, technological factors affecting supply elasticities, difference between pre-regulation and expected post-regulation prices, and geographical area. State-level variations in telehealth parity laws provide a unique opportunity to study the effects of Price Controls and Cost Controls on healthcare service quantity, proxied by physician count, across metro and non-metro areas, with broadband as a technological mediator. At the micro level, Price Controls distort the input mix, causing production inefficiency and rotating the supply curve. Cost Controls change the consumption mix, causing consumption inefficiency and rotating the demand curve. This results in equilibrium quantity shifts causing allocative inefficiency in healthcare provision, signified by physician redistribution at the macro level. The micro-founded non-price competition models predicts shifts from unregulated to regulated equilibrium quantities under various combinations of Price Control and Cost Control types. Empirical analysis supports these predictions, showing that a Price Ceiling or Price Floor positively affects physician count in metro areas but negatively in non-metro areas. Conversely, Cost Parity has a negative effect in metro areas, while a Cost Ceiling positively impacts physician count in both regions. When examining combinations of different types of Price and Cost Controls, Cost Parity tends to dominate with a net negative effect, whereas a Cost Ceiling amplifies the positive effect of a Price Ceiling. The findings challenge the conventional narratives and underscore the role of regional disparities and technology in shaping policy outcomes.</description>

      <title>Inequality in a model of capitalist economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze inequality aspects of the agent-based model of capitalist economy named it Social Architecture of Capitalism that has been introduced by Ian Wright. The model contemplates two main types of agents, workers and capitalists, which can also be unemployed. Starting from a state where all agents are unemployed and possess the same initial wealth, the system, governed by a few simple rules, quickly self-organizes into two classes. After a transient, the model reproduces the statistics of many relevant macroeconomic quantities of real economies worldwide, notably the Boltzmann-Pareto regimes of the distributions of wealth and income. We perform extensive simulations testing the role of the model parameters (number of agents, total wealth, and salary range) on the resulting distribution of wealth and income, the social distribution of agents, and other stylized facts of the dynamics. Our main finding is that, according to the model, in an economy where total wealth is conserved and with a fixed average wage, the increase in wealth per capita comes with more inequality.</description>

      <title>Learning to Adopt Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI, exemplified by ChatGPT, have dramatically transformed how people access information. Despite its powerful capabilities, the benefits it provides may not be equally distributed among individuals - a phenomenon referred to as the digital divide. Building upon prior literature, we propose two forms of digital divide in the generative AI adoption process: (i) the learning divide, capturing individuals' heterogeneous abilities to update their perceived utility of ChatGPT; and (ii) the utility divide, representing differences in individuals' actual utility derived from per use of ChatGPT. To evaluate these two divides, we develop a Bayesian learning model that incorporates demographic heterogeneities in both the utility and signal functions. Leveraging a six-month clickstream dataset, we estimate the model and find significant learning and utility divides across various demographic attributes. Interestingly, lower-educated and non-white individuals derive higher utility gains from ChatGPT but learn about its utility at a slower rate. Furthermore, males, younger individuals, and those with an IT background not only derive higher utility per use from ChatGPT but also learn about its utility more rapidly. Besides, we document a phenomenon termed the belief trap, wherein users underestimate ChatGPT's utility, opt not to use the tool, and consequently lack new experiences to update their perceptions, leading to continued underutilization. Our simulation further demonstrates that the learning divide can significantly affect the probability of falling into the belief trap, another form of the digital divide in adoption outcomes (i.e., outcome divide); however, offering training programs can alleviate the belief trap and mitigate the divide.</description>
