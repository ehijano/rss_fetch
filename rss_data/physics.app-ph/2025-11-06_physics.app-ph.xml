      <title>Force-Based Reading and Writing of Individual Single-Atom Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of single-atom bits enables the realization of the highest data-density memory. Reading and writing information to these bits through mechanical interactions opens the possibility of operating the magnetic devices with low heat generation and high density recording. To achieve this visionary goal, we demonstrate the use of magnetic exchange force microscopy to read and write the spin orientation of individual holmium adatoms on MgO thin films. The spin orientation of the holmium adatom is stabilized by the strong uniaxial anisotropy of the adsorption site and can be read out by measuring the exchange forces between the magnetic tip and the atom. The spin orientation can be written by approaching the tip closer to the holmium adatom.We explain this writing mechanism by the symmetry reduction of the adsorption site of the Ho adatom. These findings demonstrate the potential for information storage with minimal energy loss and pave the way for a new field of atomic-scale mechano-spintronics.</description>

      <title>ENDF/B-VIII.1: Updated Nuclear Reaction Data Library for Science and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ENDF/B-VIII.1 library is the newest recommended evaluated nuclear data file by the Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) for use in nuclear science and technology applications, and incorporates advances made in the six years since the release of ENDF/B-VIII.0. Among key advances made are that the $^{239}$Pu file was reevaluated by a joint international effort and that updated $^{16,18}$O, $^{19}$F, $^{28-30}$Si, $^{50-54}$Cr, $^{55}$Mn, $^{54,56,57}$Fe, $^{63,65}$Cu, $^{139}$La, $^{233,235,238}$U, and $^{240,241}$Pu neutron nuclear data from the IAEA coordinated INDEN collaboration were adopted. Over 60 neutron dosimetry cross sections were adopted from the IAEA's IRDFF-II library. In addition, the new library includes significant changes for $^3$He, $^6$Li,$^9$Be, $^{51}$V, $^{88}$Sr, $^{103}$Rh, $^{140,142}$Ce, Dy, $^{181}$Ta, Pt, $^{206-208}$Pb, and $^{234,236}$U neutron data, and new nuclear data for the photonuclear, charged-particle and atomic sublibraries. Numerous thermal neutron scattering kernels were reevaluated or provided for the very first time. On the covariance side, work was undertaken to introduce better uncertainty quantification standards and testing for nuclear data covariances. The significant effort to reevaluate important nuclides has reduced bias in the simulations of many integral experiments with particular progress noted for fluorine, copper, and stainless steel containing benchmarks. Data issues hindered the successful deployment of the previous ENDF/B-VIII.0 for commercial nuclear power applications in high burnup situations. These issues were addressed by improving the $^{238}$U and $^{239,240,241}$Pu evaluated data in the resonance region. The new library performance as a function of burnup is similar to the reference ENDF/B-VII.1 library. The ENDF/B-VIII.1 data are available in ENDF-6 and GNDS format at https://doi.org/10.11578/endf/2571019.</description>

      <title>Graphene-enabled coherent terahertz wave detection and thickness determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent detection and interferometry in the terahertz (THz) regime are key capabilities that enable applications ranging from astronomy to non-destructive testing. Phase-sensitive THz detection is currently achieved using nonlinear crystals or external interferometers and photomixers. However, the former approach requires femtosecond pulsed radiation, and all approaches suffer from a large footprint and sensitive alignment. Here, we demonstrate a graphene-enabled, on-chip, integrated THz detector-interferometer with optical cavity and antenna, exhibiting high sensitivity to the phase of incident THz light. We exploit this by determining the thickness of thin films placed in front of the detector-interferometer, obtaining a strongly sub-wavelength thickness accuracy of $\sim$5 $\mu$m, while we predict that an accuracy of 10 nm is within reach. This is relevant for a range of industrial application domains, including automotive, construction, and health. The detector-interferometer moreover exhibits a record-high external responsivity - without any normalization to a diffraction-limited spot size - of 73 mA/W and a noise-equivalent power of 79 pW$~\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. This performance is due to enhanced absorption at the cavity mode around 89 GHz, in agreement with multi-physics simulations. These results pave the way to exploiting coherent wave detection in the THz regime with utility in spectroscopy, next-generation wireless communication, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Conventional Scintillation Statistics with Turbulence Impacted Coupled Dipole Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of optical fields through polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) rods under atmospheric turbulence conditions, employing a generalized Lorentz dipole oscillator model with nonlinear restoring forces and dipole-dipole coupling. The theoretical framework incorporates second- and third-order anharmonic terms ($\beta_i|r_i|r_i$ and $\alpha_i|r_i|^2r_i$) alongside dyadic Green's function-mediated coupling between localized dipoles. Gradient forces arising from spatially non-uniform field distributions and Lorentz force perturbations are incorporated through d'Alembert's principle, revealing an effective inertia mechanism that opposes rapid field redistribution. Modal diagonalization demonstrates that synchronized dipole oscillations can compensate turbulence-induced wavefront distortions, with the perturbation force $\delta F_{\text{Pert}}(t) = F'_{\text{Inertia}} - F_{\text{Inertia}}$ governing the compensation efficacy. Experimental verification employs a pseudo-random phase plate (PRPP) generating Kolmogorov-spectrum turbulence, with 200 frames recorded across four configurations: baseline, turbulence-only, and turbulence with one or two PMMA rods. Statistical analysis quantifies scintillation index variations. Results indicate that dipole-dipole coupling energy transitions enable partial turbulence compensation when stronger suppression observed for longer propagation paths through increased synchronization.</description>

      <title>Far-UVC Field Emission Device at 226 nm and its Sub-Nanometer thick GaN/AlN Quantum Well Anode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on unique features of ultra-thin GaN/AlN quantum wells and demonstrate a new field emission device for human-safe disinfection with an external quantum efficiency of 18% and superior reliability, as compared to far-UVC LEDs. We investigate the behavior of a Shockley-Read-Hall recombination via Al vacancies-oxygen complexes in AlN barriers as a function of GaN well thickness and come to the conclusion that direct relaxation of confined states via mid-gap traps is prohibited and the main mechanism limiting the quantum efficiency (QE) is the carrier escape followed by non-radiative SRH recombination in the AlN barriers. As a consequence, the QE is highly dependent on the defect density, QW width and temperature which allowed us to reach a descent emissions at 226 nm wavelength although at wall plug efficiency being low, at 0.02%. We build a complete Light-Current-Voltage model and find that present device performance is limited by the self-heating and by the Child's space charge effect, both limitations can be easily addressed with some additional engineering efforts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of artificial intelligence has triggered exponential growth in data volume, demanding rapid and efficient processing. High-speed, energy-efficient, and parallel-scalable computing hardware is thus increasingly critical. We demonstrate a wafer-scale non-volatile topological photonic computing chip using topological modulators. Leveraging the GHz-speed electro-optic response and nonvolatility of ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films via topological photonic confinement, Our chip enables thousand-fold faster reconfiguration, zero-static-power operation, and a computational density of 266 trillion operations per second per square millimeter . This density surpasses that of silicon photonic reconfigurable computing chips by two orders of magnitude and thin-film lithium niobate platforms by four orders of magnitude. A 16-channel wavelength-space multiplexed chip delivers 1.92 TOPS throughput with 95.64% digit-recognition accuracy and 94.5% precision for solving time-varying partial differential equations. Additionally, the chip supports functional reconfiguration for high bandwidth density optical I/O. This work establishes ferroelectric topological photonics for efficient high-speed photonic tensor processing.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking and Mie-tronic Supermodes in Nonlocal Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breaking symmetry in Mie-resonant metasurfaces challenges the conventional view that it weakens optical confinement. Within the Mie-tronics framework, we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. Through diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses, we demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronic supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, reversing the trend predicted by infinite-lattice theory. We further show that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These findings establish a unified wave picture linking scattering and diffraction theories and outline design principles for multifunctional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.</description>

      <title>Mid-Air Single-Sided Acoustic Levitation in High-Pressure Regions of Zero-Order Bessel Beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic levitation enables non-contact manipulation using sound waves. While conventional methods entrap particles at pressure nodes (zero-pressure region surrounded by high-pressure), we demonstrate stable acoustic levitation and translation in mid-air within a high-pressure axial core of a single-sided zero-order Bessel beam for the first time. The trap operates at a long working distance, up to 397 mm ($46.6 \lambda$), supports simultaneous multi-particle levitation, and maintains stability over obstacles. Our work establishes a new paradigm for single-sided acoustic manipulation in mid-air.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of isotropic viscoelastic microstructures based on periodic homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mitigating low-frequency noise is particularly challenging due to its limited natural attenuation. This study aims to design viscoelastic composite microstructures that achieve both low acoustic reflection and high internal damping by simultaneously enhancing their effective acoustic impedance and attenuation characteristics. Using complex-valued periodic homogenization theory and density-based topology optimization, viscoelastic and impedance-matching materials are designed within a highly symmetric unit cell to manipulate these isotropic properties. Numerical results show that the optimized isotropic design robustly outperforms its constituent materials and simple anisotropic laminate structures, exhibiting performance that is stable across a wide frequency band and independent of orientation. This demonstrates the potential of microstructural engineering for effective low-frequency noise mitigation.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Magnon Engineering Enabling Significant Thermal Transport Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal conductivity, a fundamental parameter characterizing thermal transport in solids, is typically determined by electron and phonon transport. Although other transport properties including electrical conductivity and thermoelectric conversion coefficients have material-specific values, it is known that thermal conductivity can be modulated artificially via phonon engineering techniques. Here, we demonstrate another way of artificially modulating the heat conduction in solids: magnonic thermal transport engineering. The time-domain thermoreflectance measurements using ferromagnetic metal/insulator junction systems reveal that the thermal conductivity of the ferromagnetic metals and interfacial thermal conductance vary significantly depending on the spatial distribution of nonequilibrium spin currents. Systematic measurements of the thermal transport properties with changing the boundary conditions for spin currents show that the observed thermal transport modulation stems from magnon origin. This observation unveils that magnons significantly contribute to the heat conduction even in ferromagnetic metals at room temperature, upsetting the conventional wisdom that the thermal conductivity mediated by magnons is very small in metals except at low temperatures. The magnonic thermal transport engineering offers a new principle and method for active thermal management.</description>
