      <title>Colored Multiset Eulerian Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colored multiset Eulerian polynomials are a common generalization of MacMahon's multiset Eulerian polynomials and the colored Eulerian polynomials, both of which are known to satisfy well-studied distributional properties including real-rootedness, log-concavity and unimodality. The symmetric colored multiset Eulerian polynomials are characterized and used to prove sufficient conditions for a colored multiset Eulerian polynomial to be self-interlacing. The latter property implies the aforementioned distributional properties as well as others, including the alternatingly increasing property and bi-$\gamma$-positivity. To derive these results, multivariate generalizations of an identity due to MacMahon are deduced. The results are applied to a pair of questions, both previously studied in several special cases, that are seen to admit more general answers when framed in the context of colored multiset Eulerian polynomials. The first question pertains to $s$-Eulerian polynomials, and the second to interpretations of $\gamma$-coefficients.</description>

      <title>Defective eigenvalues of the non-backtracking matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider graphs for which the non-backtracking matrix has defective eigenvalues, or graphs for which the matrix does not have a full set of eigenvectors. The existence of these values results in Jordan blocks of size greater than one, which we call nontrivial. We show a relationship between the eigenspaces of the non-backtracking matrix and the eigenspaces of a smaller matrix, completely classifying their differences among graphs with at most one cycle. Finally, we provide several constructions of infinite graph families that have nontrivial Jordan blocks for both this smaller matrix and the non-backtracking matrix.</description>

      <title>The maximum sum of the sizes of all intersections within $m$-size families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$, let $\omega(\mathcal{F}):=\sum_{\{A,B\}\subset \mathcal{F}}|A\cap B|$. In this paper, we prove that provided $n$ is sufficiently large, for any $\mathcal{F}\subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ with $|\mathcal{F}|=m$, $\omega(\mathcal{F})$ is maximized by the family consisting of the first $m$ sets in the lexicographical ordering on $\binom{[n]}{k}$. Compared to the maximum number of adjacent pairs in families, determined by Das, Gan and Subakov in 2016, $\omega(\mathcal{F})$ distinguishes the contributions of intersections of different sizes. Then our results is a extension of Ahlswede and Katona's results in 1978, which determine the maximum number of adjacent edges in graphs. Besides, since $\omega(\mathcal{F})=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{x\in [n]}|\{F\in \mathcal{F}:x\in F\}|^2-km\right)$ for $k$-uniform family with size $m$, our results also give a sharp upper bound of the sum of squares of degrees in a hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Exploring Werner Krandick's Binary Tree Jump Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twenty years ago, Werner Krandick defined two statistics on binary trees. The first one determines the number of jumps, when traversing the tree in depth-first-search, from a vertex to one closer to the root, and the second keeps tracks of the sum of the jump-distances. He used clever but ad hoc human-generated arguments to find explicit expressions for their expectations. In this methodological note, we illustrate the power of experimental mathematics and symbolic computation to do much more. We derive closed-form expressions for the actual weight-enumerators according to these statistics (from which not only the expectations, but also the variances, and as many higher moments as desired, can be obtained). We also actually give the first eight moments, and conjecture that the first statistic (number of jumps) is asymptotically normal, and prove that the second one (sum of jump distances) is definitely not.</description>

      <title>Digraph Placement Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a natural ruleset for playing a partisan combinatorial game on a directed graph, which we call Digraph Placement. Given a digraph $G$ with a not necessarily proper $2$-coloring of $V(G)$, the Digraph Placement game played on $G$ by the players Left and Right, who play alternately, is defined as follows. On her turn, Left chooses a blue vertex which is deleted along with all of its out-neighbours. On his turn Right chooses a red vertex, which is deleted along with all of its out-neighbours. A player loses if on their turn they cannot move. We show constructively that Digraph Placement is a universal partisan ruleset; for all partisan combinatorial games $X$ there exists a Digraph Placement game, $G$, such that $G = X$. Digraph Placement and many other games including Nim, Poset Game, Col, Node Kayles, Domineering, and Arc Kayles are instances of a class of placement games that we call conflict placement games. We prove that $X$ is a conflict placement game if and only if it has the same literal form as a Digraph Placement game. A corollary of this is that deciding the winner of a Digraph Placement game is PSPACE-hard. Next, for a game value $X$ we prove bounds on the order of a smallest Digraph Placement game $G$ such that $G = X$.</description>

      <title>On intersecting families of subgraphs of perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seminal Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado (EKR) theorem states that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of $k$-subsets of an $n$-element set $X$ for $k\leq n/2$ such that every pair of subsets in $\mathcal{F}$ has a nonempty intersection, then $\mathcal{F}$ can be no bigger than the trivially intersecting family obtained by including all $k$-subsets of $X$ that contain a fixed element $x\in X$. This family is called the star centered at $x$. In this paper, we formulate and prove an EKR theorem for intersecting families of subgraphs of the perfect matching graph, the graph consisting of $n$ disjoint edges. This can be considered a generalization not only of the aforementioned EKR theorem but also of a signed variant of it, first stated by Meyer (1974), and proved separately by Deza--Frankl (1983) and Bollob\'as--Leader (1997). The proof of our main theorem relies on a novel extension of Katona's beautiful cycle method.</description>

      <title>Rainbow connectivity of multilayered random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-colored multigraph $G$ is rainbow connected if every pair of vertices is joined by at least one rainbow path, i.e., a path where no two edges are of the same color.
  In the context of multilayered networks we introduce the notion of multilayered random geometric graphs, from $h\ge 2$ independent random geometric graphs $G(n,r)$ on the unit square. We define an edge-coloring by coloring the edges according to the copy of $G(n,r)$ they belong to and study the rainbow connectivity of the resulting edge-colored multigraph. We show that $r(n)=\left(\frac{\log n}{n}\right)^{\frac{h-1}{2h}}$ is a threshold of the radius for the property of being rainbow connected. This complements the known analogous results for the multilayerd graphs defined on the Erd\H{o}s-R\' enyi random model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A seed is a PL sphere that is not obtainable by a wedge operation from any other PL sphere. In this paper, we study two operations on PL spheres, known as the stellar subdivision and the wedge, that preserve the maximality of Buchstaber numbers and polytopality. We construct a new polytopal toric colorable seed from these two operations. As a corollary, we prove that the toric colorable seed inequality established by Choi and Park is tight.</description>

      <title>On Isomorphisms of Tetravalent Cayley Digraphs over Dihedral Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m$ be a positive integer. A group $G$ is said to be an $m$-DCI-group or an $m$-CI-group if $G$ has the $k$-DCI property or $k$-CI property for all positive integers $k$ at most $m$, respectively. Let $G$ be a dihedral group of order $2n$ with $n\geq 3$. Qu and Yu proved that $G$ is an $m$-DCI-group or $m$-CI-group, for every $m\in \{1,2,3\}$, if and only if $n$ is odd. In this paper, it is shown that $G$ is a $4$-DCI-group if and only if $n$ is odd and not divisible by $9$, and $G$ is a $4$-CI-group if and only if $n$ is odd.</description>

Abstract: We count numbers of tame frieze patterns with entries in a finite commutative local ring. For the ring $\mathbb{Z}/p^r\mathbb{Z}$, $p$ a prime and $r\in\mathbb{N}$ we obtain closed formulae for all heights. These may be interpreted as formulae for the numbers of certain relations in quotients of the modular group.</description>

      <title>A concentration inequality for random combinatorial optimisation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite set $S$, i.i.d. random weights $\{X_i\}_{i\in S}$, and a family of subsets $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^S$, we consider the minimum weight of an $F\in \mathcal{F}$: \[ M(\mathcal{F}):= \min_{F\in \mathcal{F}} \sum_{i\in F}X_i. \] In particular, we investigate under what conditions this random variable is sharply concentrated around its mean.
  We define the patchability of a family $\mathcal{F}$: essentially, how expensive is it to finish an almost-complete $F$ (that is, $F$ is close to $\mathcal{F}$ in Hamming distance) if the edge weights are re-randomized? Combining the patchability of $\mathcal{F}$, applying the Talagrand inequality to a dual problem, and a sprinkling-type argument, we prove a concentration inequality for the random variable $M(\mathcal{F})$.</description>

      <title>Growth Rates Of Permutations With Given Descent Or Peak Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set of $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, consider the sequences $\{d_n(I)\},\{p_n(I)\}$ where for any $n$, $d_n(I)$ and $p_n(I)$ respectively count the number of permutations in the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ whose descent set (respectively peak set) is $I \cap [n-1]$. We investigate the growth rates $\text{gr} \ d_n(I) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(d_n(I)/n!\right)^{1/n}$ and $\text{gr} \ p_n(I) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(p_n(I)/n!\right)^{1/n}$ over all $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Our main contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we prove that the numbers $\text{gr} \ d_n(I)$ over all $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ are exactly the interval $\left[0,2/\pi\right]$. To do so, we construct an algorithm that explicitly builds $I$ for any desired limit $L$ in the interval. Secondly, we prove the numbers $\text{gr} \ p_n(I)$ for periodic sets $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ form a dense set in $\left[0,1/\sqrt[3]{3}\right]$. We do this by explicitly finding, for any prescribed limit $L$ in the interval, a set $I$ whose corresponding growth rate is arbitrarily close to $L$.</description>

      <title>On the existence of reflecting $n$-queens configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1967, Klarner proposed a problem concerning the existence of reflecting $n$-queens configurations. The problem considers the feasibility of placing $n$ mutually non-attacking queens on the reflecting chessboard, an $n\times n$ chessboard with a $1\times n$ "reflecting strip" of squares added along one side of the board. A queen placed on the reflecting chessboard can attack the squares in the same row, column, and diagonal, with the additional feature that its diagonal path can be reflected via the reflecting strip. Klarner noted the equivalence of this problem to a number theory problem proposed by Slater, which asks: for which $n$ is it possible to pair up the integers 1 through $n$ with the integers $n+1$ through $2n$ such that no two of the sums or differences of the $n$ pairs of integers are the same. We prove the existence of reflecting $n$-queens configurations for all sufficiently large $n$, thereby resolving both Slater's and Klarner's questions for all but a finite number of integers.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Automorphism of Nonseparable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The monography examines the problem of constructing a group of automorphisms of a graph. A graph automorphism is a mapping of a set of vertices onto itself that preserves adjacency. The set of such automorphisms forms a vertex group of a graph or simply a graph group. The basis for constructing a group of graph automorphisms is the concept of orbit. The construction of an orbit is closely related to the quantitative assessment of a vertex or edge of a graph, called weight. To determine the weight of an element, graph invariants built on the spectrum of edge cuts and the spectrum of edge cycles are used. The weight of the graph elements allows identifying generating cycles and forming orbits. Examples are given of constructing a group of automorphisms for some types of graphs.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model of Congestion Games with Priorities: Two-Sided Markets with Ties, Finite and Non-Affine Delay Functions, and Pure Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of equilibrium concepts in congestion games and two-sided markets with ties has been a primary topic in game theory, economics, and computer science. Ackermann, Goldberg, Mirrokni, R\"oglin, V\"ocking (2008) gave a common generalization of these two models, in which a player more prioritized by a resource produces an infinite delay on less prioritized players. While presenting several theorems on pure Nash equilibria in this model, Ackermann et al.\ posed an open problem of how to design a model in which more prioritized players produce a large but finite delay on less prioritized players. In this paper, we present a positive solution to this open problem by combining the model of Ackermann et al.\ with a generalized model of congestion games due to Bil\`o and Vinci (2023). In the model of Bil\`o and Vinci, the more prioritized players produce a finite delay on the less prioritized players, while the delay functions are of a specific kind of affine function, and all resources have the same priorities. By unifying these two models, we achieve a model in which the delay functions may be finite and non-affine, and the priorities of the resources may be distinct. We prove some positive results on the existence and computability of pure Nash equilibria in our model, which extend those for the previous models and support the validity of our model.</description>

      <title>Sharp isoperimetric inequalities on the Hamming cube near the critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An isoperimetric inequality on the Hamming cube for exponents $\beta\ge 0.50057$ is proved, achieving equality on any subcube. This was previously known for $\beta\ge \log_2(3/2)\approx 0.585$. Improved bounds are also obtained at the critical exponent $\beta=0.5$, including a bound that is asymptotically sharp for small subsets. A key ingredient is a new Bellman-type function involving the Gaussian isoperimetric profile which appears to be a good approximation of the true envelope function. Verification uses computer-assisted proofs and interval arithmetic. Applications include progress towards a conjecture of Kahn and Park as well as sharp Poincar\'e inequalities for Boolean-valued functions near $L^1$.</description>

Abstract: The simplest way to make a dynamical system out of a finite connected graph $G$ is to give it a polarization, that is to say a cyclic ordering of the edges incident to a vertex, for each vertex. The phase space $\mathcal{P}(G)$ then consists of all pairs $(v,e)$ where $v$ is a vertex and $e$ is an edge incident to $v$. Such an initial condition gives a position and a momentum. The data $(v,e)$ is of course equivalent to an edge endowed with an orientation $e_{\mathcal O}$. With the polarization, each initial data leads to a leftward walk defined by turning left at each vertex, or making a rebound if there is no other edge. A leftward walk is called complete if it goes through all edges of $G$, not necessarily in both directions. As usual, we define the valence of a vertex as the number of edges incident to it, and we define the valence of a graph as the average of the valences of its vertices. In this article, we prove that if a graph which is embedded in a closed oriented surface of genus $g$ admits a complete leftward walk, then its valence is at most $1 + \sqrt{6g+1}$. We prove furthermore that this result is sharp for infinitely many genera $g$, and that it is asymptotically optimal as $g \to + \infty$. This leads to obstructions for the embeddability of graphs on a surface in a way which admits a complete leftward walk. Since checking that a polarized graph admits a complete leftward walk or not is done in time $4N$, where $N$ is the cardinality of the edges, this obstruction is particularly efficient in terms of computability. This problem has its origins in interesting consequences for what we will call here the topological ergodicity of conservative systems, especially Hamiltonian systems $H$ in two dimensions where the existence of a complete leftward walk corresponds to a topologically ergodic orbit of the system, i.e. an orbit of $H$ visiting all the topology of the surface.</description>

      <title>String attractors of Rote sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00850v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe minimal string attractors (of size two) of pseudopalindromic prefixes of standard complementary-symmetric Rote sequences. Such a class of Rote sequences forms a subclass of binary generalized pseudostandard sequences, i.e., of sequences obtained when iterating palindromic and antipalindromic closures. When iterating only palindromic closure, palindromic prefixes of standard Sturmian sequences are obtained and their string attractors are of size two. However, already when iterating only antipalindromic closure, antipalindromic prefixes of binary pseudostandard sequences are obtained and we prove that the minimal string attractors are of size three in this case. We conjecture that the pseudopalindromic prefixes of any binary generalized pseudostandard sequence have a minimal string attractor of size at most four.</description>

      <title>Concatenation trees: A framework for efficient universal cycle and de Bruijn sequence constructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classic cycle-joining techniques have found widespread application in creating universal cycles for a diverse range of combinatorial objects, such as shorthand permutations, weak orders, orientable sequences, and various subsets of $k$-ary strings, including de Bruijn sequences. In the most favorable scenarios, these algorithms operate with a space complexity of $O(n)$ and require $O(n)$ time to generate each symbol in the sequences. In contrast, concatenation-based methods have been developed for a limited selection of universal cycles. In each of these instances, the universal cycles can be generated far more efficiently, with an amortized time complexity of $O(1)$ per symbol, while still using $O(n)$ space.
  This paper introduces $\mathit{concatenation~trees}$, which serve as the fundamental structures needed to bridge the gap between cycle-joining constructions based on the pure cycle register and corresponding concatenation-based approaches. They immediately demystify the relationship between the classic Lyndon word concatenation construction of de Bruijn sequences and a corresponding cycle-joining based construction. To underscore their significance, concatenation trees are applied to construct universal cycles for shorthand permutations and weak orders in $O(1)$-amortized time per symbol. Moreover, we provide insights as to how similar results can be obtained for other universal cycles including cut-down de Bruijn sequences and orientable sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We came across an unexpected connection between a remarkable grammar of Dumont for the joint distribution of $(\exc, \fix)$ over $S_n$ and a beautiful theorem of Diaconis-Evans-Graham on successions and fixed points of permutations. With the grammar in hand, we demonstrate the advantage of the grammatical calculus in deriving the generating functions, where the constant property plays a substantial role. On the grounds of left successions of a permutation, we present a grammatical treatment of the joint distribution investigated by Roselle. Moreover, we obtain a left succession analogue of the Diaconis-Evans-Graham theorem, exemplifying the idea of a grammar assisted bijection. The grammatical labelings give rise to an equidistribution of $(\jump, \des)$ and $(\exc, \drop)$ restricted to the set of left successions and the set of fixed points, {where $\jump$ is defined to be the number of ascents minus the number of left successions.}</description>

      <title>Representation of Context-Specific Causal Models with Observational and Interventional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.09271v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of representing context-specific causal models based on both observational and experimental data collected under general (e.g. hard or soft) interventions by introducing a new family of context-specific conditional independence models called CStrees. This family is defined via a novel factorization criterion that allows for a generalization of the factorization property defining general interventional DAG models. We derive a graphical characterization of model equivalence for observational CStrees that extends the Verma and Pearl criterion for DAGs. This characterization is then extended to CStree models under general, context-specific interventions. To obtain these results, we formalize a notion of context-specific intervention that can be incorporated into concise graphical representations of CStree models. We relate CStrees to other context-specific models, showing that the families of DAGs, CStrees, labeled DAGs and staged trees form a strict chain of inclusions. We end with an application of interventional CStree models to a real data set, revealing the context-specific nature of the data dependence structure and the soft, interventional perturbations.</description>

      <title>Towards Lower Bounds on the Depth of ReLU Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.14835v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute to a better understanding of the class of functions that can be represented by a neural network with ReLU activations and a given architecture. Using techniques from mixed-integer optimization, polyhedral theory, and tropical geometry, we provide a mathematical counterbalance to the universal approximation theorems which suggest that a single hidden layer is sufficient for learning any function. In particular, we investigate whether the class of exactly representable functions strictly increases by adding more layers (with no restrictions on size). As a by-product of our investigations, we settle an old conjecture about piecewise linear functions by Wang and Sun (2005) in the affirmative. We also present upper bounds on the sizes of neural networks required to represent functions with logarithmic depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to determine the ring structure of the graph equivariant cohomology of the GKM graph induced from the even-dimensional complex quadrics. We show that the graph equivariant cohomology is generated by two types of subgraphs in the GKM graph, which are subject to four different types of relations. By utilizing this ring structure, we establish the multiplicative relation for the generators of degree 2n and provide an alternative computation of the ordinary cohomology ring of 4n-dimensional complex quadrics, as previously computed by H. Lai. Additionally, we provide a combinatorial explanation for why the square of the 2n degree generator x vanishes when n is odd and is non-vanishing when n is even.</description>

      <title>Local limits in $p$-adic random matrix theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of singular numbers of products of certain classes of $p$-adic random matrices, as both the matrix size and number of products go to $\infty$ simultaneously. In this limit, we prove convergence of the local statistics to a new random point configuration on $\mathbb{Z}$, defined explicitly in terms of certain intricate mixed $q$-series/exponential sums. This object may be viewed as a nontrivial $p$-adic analogue of the interpolating distributions of Akemann-Burda-Kieburg arXiv:1809.05905, which generalize the sine and Airy kernels and govern limits of complex matrix products. Our proof uses new Macdonald process computations and holds for matrices with iid additive Haar entries, corners of Haar matrices from $\mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, and the $p$-adic analogue of Dyson Brownian motion studied in arXiv:2112.03725.</description>

      <title>When can an expander code correct $\Omega(n)$ errors in $O(n)$ time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tanner codes are graph-based linear codes whose parity-check matrices can be characterized by a bipartite graph $G$ together with a linear inner code $C_0$. Expander codes are Tanner codes whose defining bipartite graph $G$ has good expansion property. This paper is motivated by the following natural and fundamental problem in decoding expander codes:
  What are the sufficient and necessary conditions that $\delta$ and $d_0$ must satisfy, so that \textit{every} bipartite expander $G$ with vertex expansion ratio $\delta$ and \textit{every} linear inner code $C_0$ with minimum distance $d_0$ together define an expander code that corrects $\Omega(n)$ errors in $O(n)$ time?
  For $C_0$ being the parity-check code, the landmark work of Sipser and Spielman (IEEE-TIT'96) showed that $\delta&gt;3/4$ is sufficient; later Viderman (ACM-TOCT'13) improved this to $\delta&gt;2/3-\Omega(1)$ and he also showed that $\delta&gt;1/2$ is necessary. For general linear code $C_0$, the previously best-known result of Dowling and Gao (IEEE-TIT'18) showed that $d_0=\Omega(c\delta^{-2})$ is sufficient, where $c$ is the left-degree of $G$.
  In this paper, we give a near-optimal solution to the above question for general $C_0$ by showing that $\delta d_0&gt;3$ is sufficient and $\delta d_0&gt;1$ is necessary, thereby also significantly improving Dowling-Gao's result. We present two novel algorithms for decoding expander codes, where the first algorithm is deterministic, and the second one is randomized and has a larger decoding radius.</description>

      <title>Constant Degree Direct Product Testers with Small Soundness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $d$-dimensional simplicial complex. A function $F\colon X(k)\to \{0,1\}^k$ is said to be a direct product function if there exists a function $f\colon X(1)\to \{0,1\}$ such that $F(\sigma) = (f(\sigma_1), \ldots, f(\sigma_k))$ for each $k$-face $\sigma$. In an effort to simplify components of the PCP theorem, Goldreich and Safra introduced the problem of direct product testing, which asks whether one can test if $F\colon X(k)\to \{0,1\}^k$ is correlated with a direct product function by querying $F$ on only $2$ inputs. Dinur and Kaufman conjectured that there exist bounded degree complexes with a direct product test in the small soundness regime. We resolve their conjecture by showing that for all $\delta&gt;0$, there exists a family of high-dimensional expanders with degree $O_{\delta}(1)$ and a $2$-query direct product tester with soundness $\delta$.
  We use the characterization given by a subset of the authors and independently by Dikstein and Dinur, who showed that some form of non-Abelian coboundary expansion (which they called "Unique-Games coboundary expansion") is a necessary and sufficient condition for a complex to admit such direct product testers. Our main technical contribution is a general technique for showing coboundary expansion of complexes with coefficients in a non-Abelian group. This allows us to prove that the high dimensional expanders constructed by Chapman and Lubotzky satisfies the necessary conditions, thus admitting a 2-query direct product tester with small soundness.</description>

Abstract: A function is boundedly finite-to-one if there is a natural number $k$ such that each point has at most $k$ inverse images. In this paper, we prove in $\mathsf{ZF}$ (without the axiom of choice) several results concerning this notion, among which are the following:
  (1) For each infinite set $A$ and natural number $n$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{S}(A)$ to $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$, where $\mathcal{S}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ and $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ moving at most $n$ points.
  (2) For each infinite set $A$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{B}(A)$ to $\mathrm{fin}(A)$, where $\mathcal{B}(A)$ is the set of all partitions of $A$ whose blocks are finite and $\mathrm{fin}(A)$ is the set of all finite subsets of $A$.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $q$-step walks on random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cumulants of $q$-step closed and non-closed walks on the Erd\H os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants represent terms of cumulant expansion of the free energy of discrete analogs of matrix models widely known in theoretical and mathematical physics. Using a diagram technique, we show that the leading term $F_k^{(q)}$ of the normalized cumulant of $k$-th order can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for closed walks, respectively. Adapting the Pr\"ufer codification procedure to such diagrams, we get explicit expressions for the number of tree-type diagrams of $k$ elements and show that in certain cases, $F_k^{(q)}$ can be bounded from above by the $k$-th moment of the sum of $k(q-1)+1$ independent Bernoulli random variables. These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the numbers of $q$-step walks in random graphs and to show that in the additional limiting transition of infinite $q$, the term $F_k^{(q)}$, considered for large values of $k$, admits an upper bound that asymptotically coincides with that of the $k$-th moment of the Compound Poisson distribution.</description>
