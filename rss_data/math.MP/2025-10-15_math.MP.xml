      <title>Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory And A Reduced Formulation Of Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical framework for reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) is proposed. The work is inspired by and generalizes the work by E.H.~Lieb [E.H. Lieb, Int. J. Quant. Chem. 24(1983), pp.243--277] on density-functional theory (DFT). We introduce a Banach space for density matrices with finite kinetic energy. The dual space is a rich class of single-particle potentials, i.e., Hermitian forms. The ground state energy of an $N$-fermion system with external forces given by any such Hermitian form is expressed as the Legendre--Fenchel transform of a convex and lower semicontinuous ``universal'' reduced density matrix functional. The formalism is employed to provide a mathematical framework for density-functional theory (DFT). The main tool here is a rigorous definition of diagonals of reduced density matrices. The result is a refinement of Lieb's results on DFT applicable to a wide variety of models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study several polynomial Hamiltonian systems of $\text{P}_{\text{IV}}$-type (including the mixed case quasi-$\text{P}_{\text{IV}}$), and show that via the iterative process of polynomial regularisation, it is possible to identify the "minimal" Hamiltonian system. The selected Hamiltonian function is associated with the Newton polygon with minimal area and smallest highest total degree.</description>

      <title>Robust Areal Thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild Black Hole with Robin Boundary Conditions and Weyl Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.09128v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate an areal thermodynamics for the Schwarzschild black hole that takes the horizon area as the sole macroscopic variable. Quantizing ultrarelativistic interior modes on a regular spacelike slice with a Robin boundary at a stretched horizon leads to a self-adjoint Laplace-Beltrami problem with Heun-type quantization. A maximum-entropy area ensemble introduces an intensive areal temperature $T_A$, and Weyl/heat-kernel asymptotics control the resulting statistical mechanics. The leading equations of state follow universally from the spatial Weyl volume coefficient: in a canonical ensemble of $N$ ultrarelativistic bosons one finds $A = 3 N k_B T_A$ up to a boundary-dependent constant, while in the massless grand-canonical sector $A \propto T_A^{4}$ with a generalized Planck spectrum and a Wien displacement relation. These scaling exponents are insensitive to Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin data and to the foliation; only numerical prefactors vary. Embedding the construction into a static four-dimensional background via Matsubara factorization reproduces the 4D Weyl law and yields a finite matter entropy $S_{\mathrm{rad}} \propto A^{3/4}$, parametrically subleading to the Bekenstein-Hawking term after standard renormalization. The framework provides a concise, mathematically controlled bridge between interior spectral data and macroscopic area relations, clarifying the scope and limitations of areal thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>The Effective Radius of an Electric Point Charge in Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the century-old problem of modeling the electron as a pointlike particle with finite self energy, we develop a new class of nonlinear perturbations of Maxwell's electrodynamics inspired by, but distinct from, the Born--Infeld theory. A hallmark of our construction is that the effective radius of an electric point charge can be reduced arbitrarily by tuning a coupling parameter, thereby achieving scales far below the Born--Infeld bound and consistent with the experimentally undetected size of the electron. The models preserve finite self energy for point charges while energetically excluding monopoles and dyons, a robustness that appears intrinsic to this class of nonlinear theories. Two complementary behaviors are uncovered: In the non-polynomial perturbations, the Maxwell limit is not recovered as the coupling vanishes, whereas in polynomial models the self energy diverges correctly, meaning that the Maxwellian ultraviolet structure is reinstated. A further subtlety emerges in the distinction between the prescribed source charge, imposed through the displacement field, and the measurable free charge arising from the induced electric field. In particular, the free charge and the self energy contained within any ball around the point charge tend to zero in the strong-nonlinearity or zero effective-radius limit, rendering a pointlike structure locally undetectable, both electrically and energetically. These findings highlight how nonlinear field equations reconcile theoretical prescription with experimental measurement and suggest a classical rationale for the effective invisibility of the electron substructure.</description>

      <title>Thinned COE random matrix models for DNA replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper details an observation that for more primitive organisms, such as some yeasts, the statistical distribution of the origins of replication sometimes looks remarkably like the distribution of eigenvalues from the Circular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE) of random matrices. This does not hold for more complex organisms, but a uniform thinning of the COE eigenvalues (which interpolates between the COE and uncorrelated, Poisson statistics) gives a platform to investigate characteristics of replication origin distribution in other species where data is available.</description>

      <title>Adjoint ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the phase structure and thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of elementary magnets carrying the adjoint representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through two-body quadratic interactions. Such systems have a continuous $SU(N)$ symmetry as well as a discrete conjugation symmetry. We uncover a rich spectrum of phases and transitions, involving a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist as stable and metastable states in different combinations over a range of temperatures. The ferromagnetic phases break $SU(N)$ invariance in various channels, leading to spontaneous magnetization. Interestingly, the conjugation symmetry also breaks over a range of temperatures and group ranks $N$, providing a realization of a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry.</description>

      <title>Scattering Theory and dispersive estimates for general $1$d Charge Transfer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our study of scattering theory and dispersive properties for one-dimensional charge transfer models, namely linear Schr\"odinger equations with multiple moving potentials. By the discovery of a refined structure of the construction of distorted Fourier transforms adapted to the multi-potential framework, we remove the large-velocity separation assumption imposed in [8]. This work thus completes the full scattering theory and dispersive analysis for general one-dimensional charge transfer models. These dispersive estimates provide the foundation for analyzing asymptotic stability and collision phenomena for multi-solitons in a general setting.</description>

      <title>Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbatively slow spread of quantum correlations in non-resonant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong disorder often has drastic consequences for quantum dynamics. This is best illustrated by the phenomenon of Anderson localization in non-interacting systems, where destructive quantum wave interference leads to the complete absence of particle and information transport over macroscopic distances. In this work, we investigate the extent to which strong disorder leads to provably slow dynamics in many-body quantum lattice models. We show that in any spatial dimension, strong disorder leads to a non-perturbatively small velocity for ballistic information transport under unitary quantum dynamics, almost surely in the thermodynamic limit, in every many-body state. In these models, we also prove the existence of a "prethermal many-body localized regime", where entanglement spreads logarithmically slowly, up to non-perturbatively long time scales. More generally, these conclusions hold for all models corresponding to quantum perturbations to a classical Hamiltonian obeying a simple non-resonant condition. Deterministic non-resonant models are found, including spin systems in strong incommensurate lattice potentials. Consequently, quantum dynamics in non-resonant potentials is asymptotically easier to simulate on both classical or quantum computers, compared to a generic many-body system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Floquet Hamiltonian of a quantum particle driven by a general time-periodic imaginary potential is exactly equivalent, at stroboscopic times, to the Hamiltonian of a free particle constrained to a curved Riemannian manifold with fixed embedding. We illustrate the construction for a sinusoidal drive and for the torus of revolution, and outline how the framework can guide experimental design of curved-space quantum dynamics. Our results unify non-Hermitian Floquet physics with spectral geometry and provide a general recipe for engineering quantum dynamics on embedded manifolds.</description>

      <title>Quenched and Annealed CLTs for the one-periodic Aztec diamond in random environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of random dimer coverings of the one-periodic Aztec diamond in random environment. We investigate quenched limit theorems for the height function and we extend annealed limit theorems that were recently studied in [arXiv:2507.08560]. We consider more general choices of random edge weights (independence is not assumed) and we distinguish two cases where the random edge weights satisfy the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) under different scalings. For both cases, we prove convergence to the Gaussian Free Field for the quenched fluctuations. For the annealed version, it had been shown in [arXiv:2507.08560], that Gaussian Free Field fluctuations can be dominated by the much larger fluctuations of the random environment. To access quenched fluctuations we analyze the Schur process with random parameters in a way that allows to prove the annealed CLT for the height function for non i.i.d. weights. We consider specific examples where we determine the asymptotic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Non-spherical minimizers in the generalized liquid drop model for Yukawa and truncated Coulomb potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate generalized liquid drop models with screened Riesz-type interactions, focusing in particular on truncated Coulomb and Yukawa potentials in three dimensions. While the classical Gamow model with Coulomb interaction is conjectured to admit only spherical minimizers below a critical mass and no minimizer above, we show that this conjecture fails if the interaction is screened. In the case of truncated Coulomb and Yukawa potentials, we establish the existence of non-spherical minimizers for some values of the screening parameter. This gives the first evidence of such minimizers in the class of repulsive, radial, and radially nonincreasing kernels in three dimensions. Our approach relies on a comparison of the energy-per-mass ratios of balls and cylinders, in contrast with recent two-dimensional results obtained via $\Gamma$-convergence. We further show that in the unscreened Riesz case, the conjecture remains consistent, though delicate. Indeed we observe that the energy-per-mass ratios of balls and of cylinders are surprisingly close.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly connect (discrete-time) quantum walks on Z with a four-state Markov additive process via a Feynman-type formula (2.5). Using this representation, we derive a relation between the spectral decomposition of the Markov additive process and the limiting density of the homogeneous quantum walk. In addition, we consider a space-time rescaling of quantum walks, which leads to a system of quantum transport PDEs in continuous time and space with a phase interaction term. Our probabilistic representation for this type of PDE offers an efficient Monte Carlo computational technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we primarily focus on the two-phase solutions and their stability to the focusing mKdV equation. By employing the algebro-geometric approach in combination with an effective integration method, we construct explicit two-phase solutions and their corresponding wave-functions expressed in terms of the Riemann theta function. The spectral stability of two-phase solutions is examined via a modified squared-eigenfunction approach, and their stability with respect to subharmonic perturbations is further analyzed under spectrally unstable conditions. In addition, the orbital stability of the two-phase solutions is investigated. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first rigorous stability theory for the two-phase solutions of the focusing mKdV equation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of vector multi-solitons in coupled NLS and modified KdV equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the $N$-solitons, including breathers and multi-hump solitons, of the coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger (CNLS) equations are nonlinearly stable in the Sobolev space $H^{N}$. Moreover, $(N_{1},N_{2})$-solitons of the coupled modified Korteweg--de Vries (CmKdV) equations are shown to be nonlinearly stable in the Sobolev space $H^{2N_{1}+N_{2}}$. The number of negative eigenvalues of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional is $N$ for $N$-solitons of the CNLS equations, and $N_{1}+\lfloor (N_{2}+1)/2 \rfloor$ for $(N_{1},N_{2})$-solitons of the CmKdV equations, which is obtained by exploiting integrable properties. The stability of solitons for the classical NLS and mKdV equations also follows from the same method. In addition, we show that solutions to the linearized spectral problem of the mixed flow equation can be constructed from solutions of the stationary zero curvature equations in a large class of Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Classification and Birational Equivalence of Dimer Integrable Systems for Reflexive Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brane tilings are bipartite periodic graphs on the 2-torus and realize a large family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds. We present a complete classification of dimer integrable systems corresponding to the 30 brane tilings whose toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds are given by the 16 reflexive polygons in 2 dimensions. For each dimer integrable system associated to a reflexive polygon, we present the Casimirs, the single Hamiltonian built from 1-loops, the spectral curve, and the Poisson commutation relations. We also identify all birational equivalences between dimer integrable systems in this classification by presenting the birational transformations that match the Casimirs and the Hamiltonians as well as the spectral curves and Poisson structures between equivalent dimer integrable systems. In total, we identify 16 pairs of birationally equivalent dimer integrable systems which combined with Seiberg duality between the corresponding brane tilings form 5 distinct equivalence classes. Echoing phenomena observed for brane brick models realizing a family of 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds, we illustrate that deformations of brane tilings, including mass deformations, correspond to the birational transformations we discover in this work, and leave invariant the number of generators of the mesonic moduli space as well as the corresponding U(1)R-refined Hilbert series.</description>

      <title>Semi-Global Existence and Trapped Surface Formation for the Einstein-Vlasov System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a large-data semi-global existence theorem and the dynamical formation of trapped surfaces for the Einstein-massless Vlasov system in 3+1 dimensions, without any symmetry assumptions. The analysis critically hinges on a finely calibrated hierarchy of estimates for the Weyl curvature, Ricci coefficients, and velocity moments of the distribution function, designed to capture the delicate interaction between the geometric and kinetic structures of the coupled system. The presence of the Vlasov field introduces significant analytic challenges, both in terms of integrability and regularity. These are circumvented through a refined renormalization of the Ricci coefficients, a strategic restriction of the need for the elliptic estimates to a minimal number of Ricci coefficients, and a precise commutator calculus adapted to the geometry of the mass-shell of the tangent bundle of the dynamical spacetime. The results constitute the first large-data, symmetry-free construction of dynamical black hole formation in the context of kinetic matter. Beyond its immediate application to the Einstein-Vlasov system in regimes of strong gravitational interaction and absence of symmetry, we anticipate that this framework will prove useful in a broader context, including, for instance, simplified approaches to the proof of nonlinear stability of Minkowski spacetime with massless Vlasov matter</description>

      <title>A q-analogue of Mirzakhani's recursion for Weil-Petersson volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define q-analogues of Mirzakhani's recursion for Weil-Petersson volumes and the Stanford-Witten recursion for super Weil-Petersson volumes. Okuyama recently introduced a q-deformation of the Gaussian Hermitian matrix model which produces quasi-polynomials that recover the Weil-Petersson volumes via a rescaled q to 1 limit. The q-deformations of the Weil-Petersson volumes produced here agree with the top degree terms of Okuyama's quasi-polynomials and suggest a variation of Okuyama's methods to the super setting.</description>

      <title>Two-temperature fluid models for a polyatomic gas based on kinetic theory for nearly resonant collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A polyatomic ideal gas with weak interaction between the translational and internal modes is considered. For the purpose of describing the behavior of such a gas, a Boltzmann equation is proposed in the form that the collision integral is a linear combination of inelastic and elastic (or resonant) collisions, and its basic properties are discussed. Then, in the case where the elastic collisions are dominant, fluid dynamic equations of Euler and Navier--Stokes type including two temperatures, i.e., translational and internal temperatures, as well as relaxation terms are systematically obtained by means of the Chapman--Enskog expansion. The obtained equations are different depending on the degree of weakness of the interaction between the translational and internal modes.</description>

      <title>The logic of quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum logic program originated in a 1936 article by G. Birkhoff and J. von Neumann. This program is generally disregarded due to no-go theorems restricting the existence of the tensor product of elementary quantum logics and, above all, the impossibility of considering entangled states and Bell non-local states within the framework of these composite quantum logics. We revisit this study from the beginning and reverse the perspective. Here, the existence of a tensor product and a star involution are the only prerequisites for the definition of the state spaces. Surprisingly, the quantum logics constructed in this way turn out to have a close connection with irreducible Hilbert geometries, even though we did not impose this sort of structure ab initio. Endly, the existence of some basic quantum-like properties is explicitly proven in our framework : contextuality, no-broadcasting theorem, and Bell non-locality. These elements demonstrate that our quantum logic program is capable of achieving G. Birkhoff and J. von Neumann's initial ambition of founding quantum theory.</description>

      <title>A universal approach to saddle-point methods in attosecond science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions within the strong-field regime, where intense laser fields can ionise a target via tunnelling, give rise to fascinating phenomena such as the generation of high-order harmonic radiation (HHG). On the atomic scale, these strong-field processes are described in terms of highly-oscillatory time integrals which are often approximated using saddle-point methods. These methods simultaneously simplify the calculations and let us understand the physical processes in terms of semi-classical electron trajectories, or quantum orbits. However, applying saddle-point methods for HHG driven by polychromatic laser fields without clear dynamical symmetries has remained challenging. Here we introduce Picard-Lefschetz theory as a universal and robust link between the time integrals and the semi-classical trajectories. The continuous deformation of the integration contour towards so-called Lefschetz thimbles allows an exact evaluation of the integral, as well as the identification of relevant quantum orbits, for arbitrary driving fields. The latter is realised via the ``necklace algorithm'', a novel solution to the open problem of determining the relevance of saddle points for a two-dimensional integral, which we introduce here. We demonstrate the versatility and rigour of Picard-Lefschetz methods by studying Stokes transitions and spectral caustics arising in HHG driven by two-colour laser fields. For example, we showcase a quantum-orbit analysis of the colour switchover, which links the regime of perturbative two-colour fields with that of fully bichromatic driving fields. With this work, we set the foundation for a rigorous application of quantum-orbit based approaches in attosecond science that enables the interpretation of state-of-the-art experimental setups, and guides the design of future ones.</description>

      <title>On dynamical invariants of coadjoint orbits of 3D volume-preserving diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The helicity, or asymptotic linking number, is a functional of exact volume-preserving vector fields on 3-manifolds, invariant under volume-preserving transformations. It is known to exhibit remarkable uniqueness properties: many invariant functionals reduce to functions of helicity. We examine how severely this uniqueness can fail. On integral homology spheres with the $C^{1}$-topology, the failure is extreme: for every $C^{1}$-open set of nonvanishing exact fields of fixed helicity, some other global dynamical invariant is continuous and non-constant in that set; the Ruelle invariant if some field is non-Anosov, and topological entropy otherwise. In particular, on the three-sphere, the Ruelle invariant is everywhere independent of helicity. This implies, in a very strong sense, a negative answer to a question of Arnold and Khesin on the density of coadjoint orbits, when considered for the $C^1$-topology. On arbitrary three-manifolds, we also answer the question in the negative using local rather than global invariants.</description>

Abstract: The aim of these notes is to present an accessible overview of some topics in classical algebraic geometry which have applications to aspects of discrete integrable systems. Precisely, we focus on surface theory on the algebraic geometry side, which is applied to differential and discrete Painlev\'e equations on the integrable systems side. Along the way we also discuss the theory of resolution of indeterminacies, which is applied to the cohomological computation of algebraic entropy of birational transformations of projective spaces, which is closely related to the integrability of the discrete systems they define.</description>

Abstract: We consider the asymmetric version of the Popkov-Sch\"{u}tz two-lane lattice gas with general jump rates, subject to the stationary measure being of product form. This still leaves five free parameters. At density $\tfrac{1}{2}$ the eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian are degenerate. We compute the second order expansion of the average fluxes at density $\tfrac{1}{2}$ and thereby identify the universality classes.</description>

      <title>Hessian in the spinfoam models with cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general method to prove the non-degeneracy of the Hessian in the spinfoam vertex amplitude for quantum gravity and apply it to the spinfoam models with a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$-SF models). By reformulating the problem in terms of the transverse intersection of some submanifolds in the phase space of flat ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ connections, we demonstrate that the Hessian is non-degenerate for critical points corresponding to non-degenerate, geometric 4-simplices in de Sitter or anti-de Sitter space. Non-degeneracy of the Hessian is an important necessary condition for the stationary phase method to be applicable. With a non-degenerate Hessian, this method not only confirms the connection of the $\Lambda$-SF model to semiclassical gravity, but also shows that there are no dominant contributions from exceptional configurations as in the Barrett-Crane model. Given its general nature, we expect our criterion to be applicable to other spinfoam models under mild adjustments.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of quantum processes: An operational framework for free energy and reversible athermality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities.</description>

Abstract: A previous construction of regular rational extensions of the trigonometric Darboux-P\"oschl-Teller potential, obtained by one-step Darboux transformations using seed functions associated with the para-Jacobi polynomials of Calogero and Yi, is generalized by considering $m$-step Darboux transformations. As a result, some novel families of exceptional orthogonal polynomials depending on $m$ discrete parameters, as well as $m$ continuous real ones $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, \ldots, $\lambda_m$, are obtained. The restrictions imposed on these parameters by the rational extensions regularity conditions are studied in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Throughout this paper, we comprehensively study instantons with every kind of continuous conformal symmetry. Examples of these objects are hard to come by due to non-linear constraints. However, by applying previous work on moduli spaces, we introduce a linear constraint, whose solution greatly simplifies these non-linear constraints. This simplification not only allows us to easily find a plethora of novel instantons with various continuous conformal symmetries and higher rank structure groups, it also provides a framework for classifying such symmetric objects. We also prove that the basic instanton is essentially the only instanton with two particular kinds of conformal symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the connections between instantons with continuous symmetries and other gauge-theoretic objects: hyperbolic and singular monopoles as well as hyperbolic analogues to Higgs bundles and Nahm data.</description>

Abstract: To compare two Gaussian states of the Weyl-CCR algebra of a free scalar QFT we study three closely related perspectives: (i) quasi-equivalence of the GNS-representations, (ii) differences of the total energy (on some Cauchy surface), and (iii) differences between functions of the modular Hamiltonians. (For perspective (ii) we will only consider real linear free scalar quantum fields on ultrastatic spacetimes.) These three perspectives are known to be related qualitatively, due to work of Araki and Yamagami, Verch and Longo. Our aim is to investigate quantitative relations, including in particular estimates of differences between functions of modular Hamiltonians in terms of energy differences.</description>

      <title>The Kirkwood closure point process: A solution of the Kirkwood-Salsburg equations for negative activities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kirkwood superposition is a well-known tool in statistical physics to approximate the $n$-point correlation functions for $n\geq 3$ in terms of the density $\rho $ and the radial distribution function $g$ of the underlying system. However, it is unclear whether these approximations are themselves the correlation functions of some point process. If they are, this process is called the Kirkwood closure process. For the case that $g$ is the negative exponential of some nonnegative and regular pair potential $u$ existence of the the Kirkwood closure process was proved by Ambartzumian and Sukiasian. This result was generalized to the case that $u$ is a locally stable and regular pair potential by Kuna, Lebowitz and Speer, provided that $\rho$ is sufficiently small. In this work, it is shown that it suffices for $u$ to be stable and regular to ensure the existence of the Kirkwood closure process. Furthermore, for locally stable $u$ it is proved that the Kirkwood closure process is Gibbs and that the kernel of the GNZ-equation satisfies a Kirkwood-Salsburg type equation.</description>

      <title>An efficient and exact noncommutative quantum Gibbs sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing thermal and ground states is an essential quantum algorithmic task for quantum simulation. In this work, we construct the first efficiently implementable and exactly detailed-balanced Lindbladian for Gibbs states of arbitrary noncommutative Hamiltonians. Our construction can also be regarded as a continuous-time quantum analog of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. To prepare the quantum Gibbs state, our algorithm invokes Hamiltonian simulation for a time proportional to the mixing time and the inverse temperature $\beta$, up to polylogarithmic factors. Moreover, the gate complexity reduces significantly for lattice Hamiltonians as the corresponding Lindblad operators are (quasi-) local (with radius $\sim\beta$) and only depend on local Hamiltonian patches. Meanwhile, purifying our Lindbladians yields a temperature-dependent family of frustration-free "parent Hamiltonians", prescribing an adiabatic path for the canonical purified Gibbs state (i.e., the Thermal Field Double state). These favorable features suggest that our construction serves as a quantum algorithmic counterpart to classical Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.</description>

      <title>A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11630v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations amongst subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations amongst subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new kind of measures, called projection families, which generalize the classical notion of vector and operator-valued measures. The maximal class of reasonable functions admits an integral with respect to a projection family, where the integral is defined as an element of the second dual instead of the original space. We show that projection families possess strong enough properties to satisfy the theorems of Monotone Convergence and Dominated convergence, but are much easier to come by than the more restrictive operator-valued measures.</description>

      <title>Galerkin Formulation of Path Integrals in Lattice Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a mathematical framework for Galerkin formulations of path integrals in lattice field theory. The framework is based on using the degrees of freedom associated to a Galerkin discretization as the fundamental lattice variables. We formulate standard concepts in lattice field theory, such as the partition function and correlation functions, in terms of the degrees of freedom. For example, using continuous finite element spaces, we show that the two-point spatial correlation function can be defined between any two points on the domain (as opposed to at just lattice sites) and furthermore, that this satisfies a weak propagator (or Green's function) identity, in analogy to the continuum case. Furthermore, this framework leads naturally to higher-order formulations of lattice field theories by considering higher-order finite element spaces for the Galerkin discretization. We consider analytical and numerical examples of scalar field theory to investigate how increasing the order of piecewise polynomial finite element spaces affect the approximation of lattice observables. Finally, we sketch an outline of this Galerkin framework in the context of gauge field theories.</description>

      <title>Regularity lost: the fundamental limitations and constraint qualifications in the problems of elastoplasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and non-existence of a function-valued strain solution in various models of elastoplasticity from the perspective of the constraint-based ``dual'' formulations. We describe abstract frameworks for linear elasticity, elasticity-perfect plasticity and elasticity-hardening plasticity in terms of adjoint linear operators and convert them to equivalent formulations in terms of differential inclusions (the sweeping process in particular). Within such frameworks we consider several manually solvable examples of discrete and continuous models. Despite their simplicity, the examples show how for discrete models with perfect plasticity it is possible to find the evolution of stress and strain (elongation), yet continuum models within the same framework may not possess a function-valued strain. Although some examples with such phenomenon are already known, we demonstrate that it may appear due to displacement loading. The central idea of the paper is to explain the loss of strain regularity in the dual formulation by the lack of additivity of the normal cones and the failure of Slater's constraint qualification.
  In contrast to perfect plasticity, models with hardening are known to be well-solvable for strains. We show that more advanced constraint qualifications can help to distinguish between those cases and, in the case of hardening, ensure the additivity of the normal cones, which means the existence of a function-valued strain rate.</description>

      <title>Stable bi-frequency spinor modes as Dark Matter candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spinor systems with scalar self-interaction, such as the Dirac--Klein--Gordon system with Yukawa coupling or the Soler model, generically have bi-frequency solitary wave solutions. We develop the approach to stability properties of such waves and use the radial reduction to show that indeed the (linear) stability is available for a wide range of parameters. We show that only bi-frequency modes can be dynamically stable and suggest that stable bi-frequency modes can serve as storages of the Dark Matter. The approach is based on linear stability results of one-frequency solitary waves in (3+1)D Soler model, which we obtain as a by-product.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Discretization of Yang-Baxter Maps, Probability Distributions and Independence Preserving Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between Yang-Baxter maps and the independence preserving (IP) property, motivated by their role in integrable systems, from the perspective of ultra-discretization. Yang-Baxter maps satisfy the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, while the IP property ensures independence of transformed random variables. The relationship between these two seemingly unrelated properties has recently started to be studied by Sasada and Uozumi (2024). Ultra-discretization is a concept primarily used in the context of integrable systems and is an area of active research, serving as a method for exploring the connections between different integrable systems. However, there are few studies on how the stationary distribution for integrable systems changes through ultra-discretization. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ultra-discretization for probability distributions, and prove that the properties of being a Yang-Baxter map and having the IP property are both preserved under ultra-discretization. Applying this to quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps, we confirm that their ultra-discrete versions retain these properties, yielding new examples of piecewise linear maps having the IP property. We also explore implications of our results for stationary distributions of integrable systems and pose several open questions.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a summary of discussions at the recent ITEP-JINR-YerPhI workshop on Vogel theory in Dubna. We consider relation between Vogel divisor(s) and the old Dynkin classification of simple Lie algebras. We consider application to knot theory and the hidden role of Jacobi identities in the definition/invariance of Kontsevich integral, which is the knot polynomial with the values in diagrams, capable of revealing all Vassiliev invariants -- including the ones, not visible in other approaches. Finally we comment on the possible breakdown of Vogel universality after the Jack/Macdonald deformation. Generalizations to affine, Yangian and DIM algebras are also mentioned. Especially interesting could be the search for universality in ordinary Yang-Mills theory and its interference with confinement phenomena.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations. We give conditions for the synchronous collision of these $N$ solitons. When the solitons velocities are well separated and the solitons have equal amplitude, we show that the local wave profile at the collision point scales as the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function. We show that this behaviour persists when the amplitudes of the solitons are i.i.d. sub-exponential random variables. Namely the central collision peak exhibits universality: its spatial profile converges to the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function, independently of the distribution. We derive Central Limit Theorems for the fluctuations of the profile in the near-field regime (near the collision point) and in the far-regime.</description>

Abstract: We present a proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality -- a central conjecture in extended black hole thermodynamics -- for black holes in Einstein gravity with $D \geq 4$, employing a two-pronged geometric-analytic method. Our analysis shows that the reversal of the usual isoperimetric inequality originates from the structure of curved backgrounds governed by Einstein's equations, thereby underscoring the fundamental role of gravity in the reverse isoperimetric property of AdS black hole horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalisation of Sch\"{u}tz and Trimper's elephant random walk to finitely generated groups. We focus on the simplest non-abelian setting, i.e. groups whose Cayley graphs are homogeneous trees of degree $d \ge 3$. We show that the asymptotic speed of the walk does not depend on the memory parameter $p \in [0, 1)$ and equals $\frac{d - 2}{d}$, the asymptotic speed of simple random walk on these graphs. We also establish upper bounds on the rate of convergence to the limiting speed. These upper bounds depend on $p$ and exhibit a phase transition at the critical value $p_d = \frac{d + 1}{2d}$. Numerical experiments suggest that these upper bounds are tight. Along the way, we also obtain estimates on the return probability.</description>

      <title>Geometric optimization for quantum communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the ultimate limits of quantum communication, such as the quantum capacity of a channel and the distillable entanglement of a shared state, remains a central challenge in quantum information theory, primarily due to the phenomenon of superadditivity. This work develops Riemannian optimization methods to establish significantly tighter, computable two-sided bounds on these fundamental quantities. For upper bounds, our method systematically searches for state and channel extensions that minimize known information-theoretic bounds. We achieve this by parameterizing the space of all possible extensions as a Stiefel manifold, enabling a universal search that overcomes the limitations of ad-hoc constructions. Combined with an improved upper bound on the one-way distillable entanglement based on a refined continuity bound on quantum conditional entropy, our approach yields new state-of-the-art upper bounds on the quantum capacity of the qubit depolarizing channel for large values of the depolarizing parameter, strictly improving the previously best-known bounds. For lower bounds, we introduce Riemannian optimization methods to compute multi-shot coherent information. We establish lower bounds on the one-way distillable entanglement by parameterizing quantum instruments on the unitary manifold, and on the quantum capacity by parameterizing code states with a product of unitary manifolds. Numerical results for noisy entangled states and different channels demonstrate that our methods successfully unlock superadditive gains, improving previous results. Together, these findings establish Riemannian optimization as a principled and powerful tool for navigating the complex landscape of quantum communication limits. Furthermore, we prove that amortization does not enhance the channel coherent information, thereby closing a potential avenue for improving capacity lower bounds in general.</description>

Abstract: We derive an explicit formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the orthogonal Stiefel manifold, viewed as a constraint submanifold of the Euclidean space of real matrices equipped with the Frobenius metric. Using the general framework of Laplace operators on constraint manifolds, we provide the formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator in terms of the ambient Euclidean coordinates. The result extends previously known cases, recovering the formulas for the sphere and the special orthogonal group as particular instances.</description>

      <title>Quantum $f$-divergences and Their Local Behaviour: An Analysis via Relative Expansion Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any reasonable measure of distinguishability of quantum states must satisfy a data processing inequality, that is, it must not increase under the action of a quantum channel. We can ask about the proportion of information lost or preserved and this leads us to study contraction and expansion coefficients respectively, which can be combined into a single \emph{relative expansion coefficient}. We focus on two prominent families: (i) standard quantum $f$ divergences and (ii) their local (second-order) behaviour, which induces a monotone Riemannian semi-norm (that is linked to the $\chi^2$ divergence). Building on prior work, we identify new families of $f$ for which the global ($f$ divergence) and local (Riemannian) relative expansion coefficients coincide for every pair of channels, and we clarify how exceptional such exact coincidences are. Beyond equality, we introduce an \emph{equivalence} framework that transfers qualitative properties such as strict positivity uniformly across different relative expansion coefficients.
  Leveraging the link between equality in the data processing inequality (DPI) and channel reversibility, we apply our framework of relative expansion coefficients to approximate recoverability of quantum information. Using our relative expansion results for primitive channels, we prove a reverse quantum Markov convergence theorem, converting positive expansion coefficients into quantitative lower bounds on the convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Analytic results in conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the 1980s, many exact results have been discovered in $2d$ CFT, from critical exponents to correlation functions to complete solutions of certain models. In $d&gt;2$, there is a wealth of numerical results as well as promising analytic approaches, but comparably fewer exact answers.
  The aim of this conference was to review the most promising analytic methods and results in CFT in any dimension. In particular we tried to understand to which extent the $2d$ methods can be extended to $d&gt;2$, and what is missing to exactly solve $d&gt;2$ CFTs.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Love number of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal deformation of compact objects, characterised by their Love numbers, provides insights into the internal structure of neutron stars and black holes. While bosonic tidal Love numbers vanish for black holes in general relativity, it has been recently revealed that fermionic tidal perturbations can induce non-zero Love numbers for Kerr black holes. In this paper, we investigate the response of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole to the fermionic Weyl field. As a result, we find that the corresponding fermionic tidal Love numbers are also non-vanishing for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes except for the extremal ones, which highlights the universal distinct behavior of the fermionic tidal Love numbers compared to the bosonic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Approximating the coefficients of the Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the type A, BC, and D root systems, we determine equivalent conditions between the coefficients of an exponential holomorphic function and the asymptotic values taken by the Dunkl bilinear form when one of its entries is the function. We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>
