      <title>A matrix form solution of the multi-dimensional generalized Langevin equation in the quadratic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research paper, we present an exact matrix form analytical solution of the multi-dimensional generalized Langevin equation with quadratic potentials. Our investigation provides detailed expressions for the two-dimensional probability distribution and extends the understanding of the dynamics governed by harmonic potentials. By utilizing the inverse Laplace transformation, we offer a precise method to solve these equations, corroborated by specific examples. This study contributes to the fundamental understanding of stochastic processes in multi-dimensional systems with harmonic potentials and clarifies the limitations of our approach. While the findings are specific to quadratic potentials, they provide a robust framework for exploring related phenomena within this context.</description>

      <title>A Single--Index Theory of Optimal Branching: Murray Laws, Gilbert Networks, and Young--Herring Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Murray-type flux-radius laws, Gilbert-type concave transport costs, and Young-Herring triple-junction angle balances are usually treated as separate theories. This work shows that, within a natural class of quadratic, scale-free ledgers for branched networks, all three are different faces of a single structure controlled by one dimensionless index chi. Each edge carries a flux Q, an effective radius r, and a per-length ledger P(Q,r) encoding transport dissipation and structural burden. Under locality, evenness in Q, linear-response (quadratic) dependence, and an exact homogeneity ansatz in (Q,r), any admissible ledger reduces in the scale-free regime to the two-term form P(Q,r) = a Q^2 r^{-p} + b r^m. Local optimality then implies simultaneously: (i) a flux-radius power law with generalized Murray closures at degree-3 nodes; (ii) a Young-Herring-type vector balance with radius weights r^m and a fixed symmetric Y-junction angle; and (iii) an effective flux-only cost of Gilbert/branched-transport type with exponent beta. The exponents alpha and beta, the symmetric angle, and the split between transport and structural cost are all set by chi = m/(m+p) = beta/2. A rigidity theorem shows conversely that any quadratic ledger that yields power-law optimal radii and power-law flux-only cost on an open scaling cone must belong to this two-term family and obey the same Murray-Gilbert-Young dictionary. Examples for Poiseuille, diffusive, and geophysical trees illustrate how chi can be inferred from geometry and used as a falsifiable order parameter for scale-free branching architectures.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the spin glass transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently showed that the two-dimensional Ising spin glass allows for a line of renormalization group fixed points. We observe that this exact result corresponds to enhancement to a one-generator continuous internal symmetry. This finally explains why no finite temperature transition to a spin glass phase is observed in two dimensions. In more than two dimensions, instead, the continuous symmetry can be broken spontaneously and yields a spin glass order parameter which, for fixed temperature and disorder strength, takes continuous values in an interval. Such a feature is shared by the order parameter of the known mean field solution of the model with infinite-range interactions, which corresponds to infinitely many dimensions.</description>

      <title>Moderate-to-large deviation asymptotics for real eigenvalues of the elliptic Ginibre matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics of the number of real eigenvalues in the elliptic deformation of the real Ginibre ensemble. As the matrix dimension grows, the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the number of real eigenvalues are well understood, but the probabilities of rare events remain largely unexplored. Large deviation type results have been obtained only in extreme cases, when either a vanishingly small proportion of eigenvalues are real or almost all eigenvalues are real. Here, in both the strong and weak asymmetry regimes, we derive the probabilities of rare events in the moderate-to-large deviation regime, thereby providing a natural connection between the previously known regime of Gaussian fluctuations and the large deviation regime. Our results are new even for the classical real Ginibre ensemble.</description>

      <title>Cross-linked pair of polymer chains under strong tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two cross-linked polymer systems in the strong stretching regime. The first consists of two polymers sharing one endpoint, with the other two endpoints coupled by a harmonic potential. Within the weakly bending approximation, we analyze the tensile elastic response for freely jointed or wormlike chains; for the latter, the approximation applies either at large tension or at moderate tension with large persistence length (rodlike limit). We obtain analytic expressions for the force--extension relation and for the longitudinal and transverse mismatch of the cross-linked endpoints. In the thermodynamic limit, the cross-link does not affect the tensile elasticity, but it significantly suppresses transverse fluctuations, effectively forming a loop structure. The second system is a polymer necklace in the thermodynamic limit, composed of two strongly stretched polymers interconnected by a regular sequence of reversible cross-links. Using an analogy with a two-dimensional system of concatenated Gaussian loops ("Gaussian slinky"), we calculate the mean fraction of cross-linked sites as a function of the tensile force and find weak and strong binding regimes connected by a crossover. For shallow binding potential wells (compared with $k_{\rm{B}}T$), we employ a continuum description and exploit the mapping between directed polymers and a two-dimensional quantum particle to determine the crossover behavior and the mean transverse separation between the two polymer chains.</description>

      <title>Topological BF Theory construction of twisted dihedral quantum double phases from spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonabelian topological orders host exotic anyons central to quantum computing, yet established realizations rely on case-by-case constructions that are often conceptually involved. In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further indicates a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.</description>

      <title>Holographic duality between bulk topological order and boundary mixed-state order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a holographic framework for analyzing the steady states of repeated quantum channels with strong symmetries. Using channel-state duality, we show that the steady state of a $d$-dimensional quantum channel is holographically mapped to the boundary reduced density matrix of a $(d+1)$-dimensional wavefunction generated by a sequential unitary circuit. From this perspective, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in the steady state arises from the anyon condensation on the boundary of a topological order in one higher dimension. The conditional mutual information (CMI) associated with SWSSB is then inherited from the bulk topological entanglement entropy. We make this duality explicit using isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) by identifying the channel's time evolution with the transfer matrix of a higher-dimensional isoTNS. Built on isoTNS, we further construct continuously tunable quantum channels that exhibit distinct mixed-state phases and transitions in the steady states.</description>

      <title>Entropy Flow and Exceptional-Point Structure in Two-Mode Squeezed-Bath Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed reservoirs provide a powerful means of engineering nonclassical noise and controlling irreversible dynamics in open quantum systems. Here we develop a comprehensive analysis of two coupled harmonic oscillators driven by independent squeezed baths, focusing on the emergence of coherence-driven entropy flow and the structure of exceptional points (EPs) in the corresponding Lindblad dynamics. Working entirely within the Gaussian formalism, we derive closed-form evolution equations for the covariance matrix and show that squeezing induces entropy generation only at *second order* in the anomalous correlations, a nonlinear mechanism absent in thermal environments. This entropy flow is accompanied by a rich non-Hermitian structure: by scanning the squeezing parameters we uncover a characteristic "exceptional-point fan" in the (M1, M2) plane, which separates a narrow PT-unbroken region of oscillatory dynamics from broad PT-broken sectors in which one normal mode becomes purely overdamped. This geometric organization of EPs reveals that PT symmetry survives only when the two reservoirs squeeze opposite quadratures, and is generically broken for in-phase squeezing. Our analysis establishes squeezed reservoirs as a natural setting where information-bearing noise drives irreversible behavior through coherent pathways, and lays the groundwork for experimentally accessible probes of entropy flow and critical mode behavior in more complex open systems.</description>

      <title>Localization and Delocalization of Quantum Trajectories in the Liouvillian Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an approach for understanding the dynamics of open quantum systems by analyzing individual quantum trajectories in the eigenbasis of the Liouvillian superoperator. From trajectory-eigenstate overlaps, we construct a quasiprobability distribution that characterizes the degree of localization of the trajectories in the Liouvillian eigenbasis. Contrary to the common wisdom that late-time dynamics are governed solely by the steady state and the slowest-decaying modes, we show that trajectories can remain well spread over transient eigenstates deep within the bulk of the Liouvillian spectrum even at late times. We demonstrate this explicitly using numerical simulations of interacting spin chains and bosonic systems. Moreover, we find that the delocalization of the trajectory strongly correlates with the purity of the trajectory-averaged steady state, establishing a further link between the trajectory and ensemble pictures of open quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Universal Critical Scaling and Phase Diagram of the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect under Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard scaling theory dictates that disorder leads to immediate localization in one-dimensional Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology fundamentally alters this paradigm, protecting transport up to a substantial critical disorder strength. By employing a numerically stable log-space transfer matrix approach up to thermodynamic scales (N=1000), we identify a sharp phase transition from the topological skin phase to the Anderson localized phase. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals that this transition belongs to a unique universality class with critical exponents \nu\approx1.50 and \beta\approx0.65. Furthermore, we map the global phase diagram, confirming that the critical disorder scales as W_c\propto\sqrt\gamma, consistent with localization suppression by an imaginary vector potential. Our results establish the rigorous limits of non-Hermitian topological protection in imperfect media.</description>

      <title>Learning Degenerate Manifolds of Frustrated Magnets with Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a flexible generative framework for modeling spin configurations in disordered yet strongly correlated phases of frustrated magnets. As a benchmark, we first demonstrate that an RBM can learn the zero-temperature ground-state manifold of the one-dimensional ANNNI model at its multiphase point, accurately reproducing its characteristic oscillatory and exponentially decaying correlations. We then apply RBMs to kagome spin ice and show that they successfully learn the local ice rules and short-range correlations of the extensively degenerate ice-I manifold. Correlation functions computed from RBM-generated configurations closely match those from direct Monte Carlo simulations. For the partially ordered ice-II phase -- featuring long-range charge order and broken time-reversal symmetry -- accurate modeling requires RBMs with uniform-sign bias fields, mirroring the underlying symmetry breaking. These results highlight the utility of RBMs as generative models for learning constrained and highly frustrated magnetic states.</description>

      <title>Largest eigenvalue statistics of wavefront shaping in complex media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In wavefront shaping, waves are focused through complex media onto one or more target points, and the resulting intensity enhancement is quantified by the enhancement factor. While reproducible enhancement is crucial in experiments, the fluctuations of the enhancement factor remain largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments, simulations, and exact analytical results using random matrix theory to determine its full distribution in multi-point focusing. Our theoretical framework goes beyond the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur law-valid only in the limit of a large number of channels-by accurately predicting the mean enhancement in finite-channel experiments and its fluctuations whenever long-range mesoscopic correlations are negligible (e.g., in weakly scattering media or under limited wavefront control). Notably, in the strongly scattering regime, experiments and simulations reveal giant fluctuations in the enhancement factor, which we attribute directly to long-range mesoscopic correlations. From a fundamental perspective, our results provide a direct method for quantifying long-range correlations in wavefront-shaping-based focusing, even with a limited number of input control channels. On the applied side, they enable the accurate prediction of the enhancement factor and a lower bound on its fluctuations, which are crucial for biomedical imaging, optical metrology, optical trapping, and communication through scattering media.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of the Cleaning Process of Microchannel by an External Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the problem of drift of solid non-interacting particles in a microchannel, which can stick to its walls under the action of the van der Waals forces and break away from the wall due to thermal noise and viscous stresses arising from the flow. The pressure drop is given between the channel inlet and outlet. At the initial moment of time, the channel walls are contaminated with adhered particles, i.e. the walls are uneven, which affects the formation of the flow structure through the channel. Over time, under the action of viscous stresses and thermal noise, the particles break away from the channel walls, causing its cleaning. The interaction of the detached particles with the flow is taken into account in the Stokes approximation. In addition, the model takes into account random particle motion caused by diffusion. The problem is solved numerically within the framework of the random walk model. The evolution of the liquid flow in the channel during its cleaning is obtained: stream function, pressure, and vorticity fields. The dependencies of the volume occupied by settled particles, the flow rate through the channel and the channel gap on time are determined for different values of the interaction force between particles and channel wall. The estimations of the channel cleaning time are obtained and discussed. The possibility of control the cleaning process by the modulation of liquid flux through the channel is investigated. It is shown that resonance phenomena can be observed. The dependencies of cleaning time on the modulation amplitude and frequency is obtained and studied. It is shown that changing the modulation parameters leads to a significant change in the cleaning time and helps control the cleaning process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the beginning of the 70's, Baxter introduced a multiparametric generalization of the six-vertex model. This integrable system has been found to exhibit a remarkable variety of critical behaviors. The work is part of a series of papers devoted to their systematic study. We focus on the case when the lattice model possesses an additional ${\cal Z}_r$ symmetry and consider the critical behavior near the so-called free fermion point. Among other things, discussed is the algebra of extended conformal symmetry underlying the universal behavior. The main result of the paper is the class of differential equations that describe the scaling limit of the solutions to the Bethe Ansatz equations. This is an instance of the correspondence between Ordinary Differential Equations and Integrable Quantum Field Theory (ODE/IQFT correspondence).</description>

Abstract: Given a tensor network state, how can we determine conserved operators (including Hamiltonians) for which the state is an eigenstate? We answer this question by presenting a method to extract geometrically $k$-local conserved operators that have the given infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS) in 2D as an (approximate) eigenstate. The key ingredient is the evaluation of the static structure factors of multi-site operators through differentiating the generating function. Despite the approximation errors, we show that our method is still able to extract from exact or variational iPEPS to good precision both frustration-free and non-frustration-free parent Hamiltonians that are beyond the standard construction and obtain better locality. In particular, we find a 4-site-plaquette local Hamiltonian that approximately has the short-range RVB state as the ground state. Moreover, we find a Hamiltonian that has the deformed toric code state at any string tension as excited eigenstates at the same energy, which might be potential candidates for quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic active Brownian particle in two dimensions under stochastic resetting</title>

Abstract: We analytically investigate the dynamic behavior of an an-isotropic active Brownian particle under various stochastic resetting protocols in two dimensions. The motion of shape-asymmetric active Brownian particles in two dimensions leads to an-isotropic diffusion at short times, whereas rotational diffusion causes the transport to become isotropic at longer times. We have considered three different resetting protocols: (a) complete resetting, when both position and orientation are reset to their initial states, (b) only position is reset to its initial state, (c) only orientation is reset to its initial state. We reveal that orientation resetting sustains asymmetry even at late times. When both the spatial position and orientation are subject to resetting, a complex position probability distribution forms in the steady state. All the analytical findings are thoroughly validated by corresponding simulation results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design a thermal bath that preserves the conservation of a system's angular momentum or allows it to fluctuate around a specified nonzero mean while maintaining a Boltzmann distribution of energy in the steady state. We demonstrate that classical particles immersed in such baths exhibit position-momentum uncertainties with a strictly positive lower bound proportional to the absolute value of the mean angular momentum. The proportionality constant, $c$, is dimensionless and does not depend explicitly on the system's parameters. Remarkably, while $c$ is universally bounded by unity, it attains the exact value $c=1/2$ for particles in central potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, the theory of cross phenomena (TCP) proposed by the present author is revised by starting from the first law of thermodynamics instead of the combined law of thermodynamics in the previous publication because the potentials in the latter are not independent of each other. TCP aims to derive the flux equations with respect to independent driving forces from the fundamental laws of thermodynamics rather than the phenomenological Onsager flux equations, which are flawed as shown by the revised TCP.</description>

      <title>Effects of Non-reciprocity on Coupled Kuramoto Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All the fundamental interactions (such as gravity or electromagnetic interactions) are reciprocal in nature. However, in the macroscopic world, in particular outside equilibrium, non-reciprocal or non-mutual interactions are quite ubiquitous. Understanding the impact of such non-reciprocal interactions has drawn a significant amount of interest in physics and other fields of sciences in recent years. We explore a non-reciprocal version of coupled oscillators (known as the Kuramoto model) with the aim of understanding the role of non-reciprocity, particularly in relation to chimera states, where oscillators spontaneously break into mutually synchronous and asynchronous groups. Our findings suggest that non-reciprocity not only alters the state diagram of the chimera state significantly but can also lead to new dynamical states, such as traveling chimera, run-and-chase and coexistence phases.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger Entanglement in Monitored Random Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03206v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions in Many-body systems are typically short-range and few-body. We investigate how such local interactions build up long-range and intrinsically multipartite entanglement by studying the $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ($\text{GHZ}_n$) entanglement in monitored random Clifford circuits, which is well-known for a measurement-induced transition between phases of volume-law and area-law (bipartite) entanglement. We obtain a series of results: (1) About 1.25 $|\text{GHZ}_3\rangle$ can be extracted from states in the volume-law phase. This value is remarkably universal, independent of both the measurement rate and partitioning details, until a phase transition (either measurement-induced or a newly identified partitioning-induced transition) is approached. (2) Dynamically, The creation (sometimes also the annihilation) of $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement occur suddenly via dynamical phase transitions (DPTs). The critical points of these DPTs are governed by the entanglement speed ($v_E$) of biaprtite entanglement. (3) In stark contrast to $\text{GHZ}_{n\leq 3}$, $\text{GHZ}_{n\geq 4}$ entanglement is statistically significant only at the measurement-induced critical point, not in the bulk of the volume-law phase. Our results uncover a rich and previously overlooked hierarchy of multipartite entanglement structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians is a fundamental task for which it is believed that quantum computers can be helpful. Several approaches have been proposed toward this goal, including algorithms based on quantum phase estimation and hybrid quantum-classical optimizers involving parameterized quantum circuits, the latter falling under the umbrella of the variational quantum eigensolver. Here, we analyze the performance of quantum Boltzmann machines for this task, which is a less explored ansatz based on parameterized thermal states and which is not known to suffer from the barren-plateau problem. We delineate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for this task and rigorously prove that it converges to an $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary point of the energy function optimized over parameter space, while using a number of parameterized-thermal-state samples that is polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, the number of parameters, and the norm of the Hamiltonian being optimized. Our algorithm estimates the gradient of the energy function efficiently by means of a quantum circuit construction that combines classical random sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. Additionally, supporting our main claims are calculations of the gradient and Hessian of the energy function, as well as an upper bound on the matrix elements of the latter that is used in the convergence analysis.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Fast and direct preparation of a genuine lattice BEC via the quantum Mpemba effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dissipative state preparation protocols in many-body systems can be substantially accelerated via the quantum Mpemba effect. Our approach exploits weak symmetries to analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. In particular, we study the preparation of a lattice Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of a dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Finding the right path: statistical mechanics of connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a statistical mechanics ensemble that characterizes connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Built around a well-known local entropy bias, it allows us to better identify hardness transitions in problems where the energy landscape is dominated by isolated solutions. We apply this new device to the symmetric binary perceptron model (SBP), and study how its manifold of connected solutions behaves. We choose this particular problem because, while its typical solutions are isolated, it can be solved using local algorithms for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. With this new ensemble, we unveil the presence of a cluster composed of delocalized connected solutions. In particular, we demonstrate its stability until a critical threshold $\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$ (dependent on $\alpha$). This transition appears as paths of solutions shatter, a phenomenon that more conventional statistical mechanics approaches fail to grasp. Finally, we compared our predictions to simulations. For this, we used a modified Monte-Carlo algorithm, designed specifically to target these delocalized solutions. We obtained, as predicted, that the algorithm finds solutions until $\kappa\approx\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Spin Dynamics and Supersolid Excitations in the Triangular-Lattice XXZ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\Gamma$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\Gamma$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $\Gamma$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and at each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise by averaging their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, then consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps, provided the initial opinions are in a general position. The number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that the smallest number of steps is $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$ when the initial opinions are in a general position. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps. In particular, we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural flocks (aligned) and swarms (non-aligned) both exhibit features of near-criticality, challenging their treatment as two ends of the same phase transition. We present a model for the aggregation of active individuals, in which their velocities align as a byproduct of achieving stable cohesion. In our framework, individuals move in open space and possess differing self-propelling velocities. Furthermore, velocity fluctuations are triggered by individual errors when following the aggregation rules. Notably, the system exhibits scale invariance, which is shown to be rooted in the model's definition -- a feature that we label as structural criticality. Finally, we show the emergence of a striking regime where spatial and orientational coherence decouple. That is, the system can achieve states of high and low polarization while maintaining spatial homogeneity.</description>

      <title>Effective delocalization in the one-dimensional Anderson model with stealthy disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the Anderson model in one dimension with "stealthy" disorder, defined as having a power spectrum that vanishes in a continuous band of wave numbers. Motivated by recent studies on the optical transparency properties of stealthy hyperuniform layered media, we compute the localization length using a perturbative expansion of the self-energy. We find that, for fixed energy and small but finite disorder strength $W$, there exists for any finite length system a range of stealthiness $\chi$ for which the localization length exceeds the system size. This kind of "effective delocalization" is the result of the novel kind of correlated disorder that spans a continuous range of length scales, a defining characteristic of stealthy systems. Unlike uncorrelated disorder, for which the localization length $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2}$ to leading order for small W, the leading order terms in the perturbation expansion of $\xi$ for stealthy disordered systems vanish identically for a progressively large number of terms as $\chi$ increases such that $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2n}$ with arbitrarily large $n$. Moreover, we support our analytical results with numerical simulations. Our results introduce stealthy disorder into quantum tight-binding models and show that enforcing a low-$k$ spectral gap markedly alters the scattering landscape, enabling localization lengths that exceed the system size at fixed disorder strength. Since this mechanism relies only on the spectral properties of the disorder, it carries over directly to photonic and phononic wave systems.</description>

      <title>Linear Viscoelasticity of Semiflexible Polymers with Hydrodynamic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear viscoelastic response of single semiflexible polymer chains in the infinite-dilution limit is studied using Brownian dynamics simulations of coarse-grained bead-spring chains. The springs obey the FENE-Fraenkel force law, a bending potential is used to capture chain stiffness and hydrodynamic interactions are included through the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor. By calculating the relaxation modulus following a step strain, we demonstrate that the bead-spring chain behaves like an inextensible semiflexible rod over a wide time window with an appropriate choice of spring stiffness and chain extensibility. In the absence of hydrodynamic interactions, our results agree with the existing theoretical predictions for the linear viscoelastic response of free-draining, inextensible, semiflexible rods in the limit of infinite dilution. It is shown that at intermediate times, the stress relaxation modulus exhibits power law behaviour, with the exponent ranging from $(-1/2)$ for flexible chains to $(-5/4)$ for highly rigid chains. At long times, rigid chains undergo orientational relaxation, while flexible chains exhibit Rouse relaxation. Hydrodynamic interactions are found to effect the behaviour at intermediate and long times, with the difference from free-draining behaviour increasing with increasing chain flexibility. Computations of the frequency dependence of loss and storage moduli are found to be in good agreement with experimental data for a wide variety of systems involving semiflexible polymers of varying stiffness across a broad frequency range.</description>

Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.</description>
