      <title>A Heterogeneous Multimodal Graph Learning Framework for Recognizing User Emotions in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media platforms has provided unprecedented access to massive amounts of multimodal user-generated content. Comprehending user emotions can provide valuable insights for improving communication and understanding of human behaviors. Despite significant advancements in Affective Computing, the diverse factors influencing user emotions in social networks remain relatively understudied. Moreover, there is a notable lack of deep learning-based methods for predicting user emotions in social networks, which could be addressed by leveraging the extensive multimodal data available. This work presents a novel formulation of personalized emotion prediction in social networks based on heterogeneous graph learning. Building upon this formulation, we design HMG-Emo, a Heterogeneous Multimodal Graph Learning Framework that utilizes deep learning-based features for user emotion recognition. Additionally, we include a dynamic context fusion module in HMG-Emo that is capable of adaptively integrating the different modalities in social media data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of HMG-Emo and verify the superiority of adopting a graph neural network-based approach, which outperforms existing baselines that use rich hand-crafted features. To the best of our knowledge, HMG-Emo is the first multimodal and deep-learning-based approach to predict personalized emotions within online social networks. Our work highlights the significance of exploiting advanced deep learning techniques for less-explored problems in Affective Computing.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Policy Effects through Network Dynamics and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the process of enacting or introducing a new policy, policymakers frequently consider the population's responses. These considerations are critical for effective governance. There are numerous methods to gauge the ground sentiment from a subset of the population; examples include surveys or listening to various feedback channels. Many conventional approaches implicitly assume that opinions are static; however, in reality, the population will discuss and debate these new policies among themselves, and reform new opinions in the process. In this paper, we pose the following questions: Can we quantify the effect of these social dynamics on the broader opinion towards a new policy? Given some information about the relationship network that underlies the population, how does overall opinion change post-discussion? We investigate three different settings in which the policy is revealed: respondents who do not know each other, groups of respondents who all know each other, and respondents chosen randomly. By controlling who the policy is revealed to, we control the degree of discussion among the population. We quantify how these factors affect the changes in policy beliefs via the Wasserstein distance between the empirically observed data post-discussion and its distribution pre-discussion. We also provide several numerical analyses based on generated network and real-life network datasets. Our work aims to address the challenges associated with network topology and social interactions, and provide policymakers with a quantitative lens to assess policy effectiveness in the face of resource constraints and network complexities.</description>

      <title>HyperQuery: Beyond Binary Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Groups with complex set intersection relations are a natural way to model a wide array of data, from the formation of social groups to the complex protein interactions which form the basis of biological life. One approach to representing such higher order relationships is as a hypergraph. However, efforts to apply machine learning techniques to hypergraph structured datasets have been limited thus far. In this paper, we address the problem of link prediction in knowledge hypergraphs as well as simple hypergraphs and develop a novel, simple, and effective optimization architecture that addresses both tasks. Additionally, we introduce a novel feature extraction technique using node level clustering and we show how integrating data from node-level labels can improve system performance. Our self-supervised approach achieves significant improvement over state of the art baselines on several hyperedge prediction and knowledge hypergraph completion benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Social Media Data Mining With Natural Language Processing on Public Dream Contents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly transformed global lifestyles, enforcing physical isolation and accelerating digital adoption for work, education, and social interaction. This study examines the pandemic's impact on mental health by analyzing dream content shared on the Reddit r/Dreams community. With over 374,000 subscribers, this platform offers a rich dataset for exploring subconscious responses to the pandemic. Using statistical methods, we assess shifts in dream positivity, negativity, and neutrality from the pre-pandemic to post-pandemic era. To enhance our analysis, we fine-tuned the LLaMA 3.1-8B model with labeled data, enabling precise sentiment classification of dream content. Our findings aim to uncover patterns in dream content, providing insights into the psychological effects of the pandemic and its influence on subconscious processes. This research highlights the profound changes in mental landscapes and the role of dreams as indicators of public well-being during unprecedented times.</description>

      <title>TriMod Fusion for Multimodal Named Entity Recognition in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms serve as invaluable sources of user-generated content, offering insights into various aspects of human behavior. Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a crucial role in analyzing such content by identifying and categorizing named entities into predefined classes. However, traditional NER models often struggle with the informal, contextually sparse, and ambiguous nature of social media language. To address these challenges, recent research has focused on multimodal approaches that leverage both textual and visual cues for enhanced entity recognition. Despite advances, existing methods face limitations in capturing nuanced mappings between visual objects and textual entities and addressing distributional disparities between modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates textual, visual, and hashtag features (TriMod), utilizing Transformer-attention for effective modality fusion. The improvements exhibited by our model suggest that named entities can greatly benefit from the auxiliary context provided by multiple modalities, enabling more accurate recognition. Through the experiments on a multimodal social media dataset, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1 score.</description>

      <title>Exact Label Recovery in Euclidean Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a family of label recovery problems on weighted Euclidean random graphs. The vertices of a graph are embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$ according to a Poisson point process, and are assigned to a discrete community label. Our goal is to infer the vertex labels, given edge weights whose distributions depend on the vertex labels as well as their geometric positions. Our general model provides a geometric extension of popular graph and matrix problems, including submatrix localization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-synchronization, and includes the Geometric Stochastic Block Model (proposed by Sankararaman and Baccelli) as a special case. We study the fundamental limits of exact recovery of the vertex labels. Under a mild distinctness of distributions assumption, we determine the information-theoretic threshold for exact label recovery, in terms of a Chernoff-Hellinger divergence criterion. Impossibility of recovery below the threshold is proven by a unified analysis using a Cram\'er lower bound. Achievability above the threshold is proven via an efficient two-phase algorithm, where the first phase computes an almost-exact labeling through a local propagation scheme, while the second phase refines the labels. The information-theoretic threshold is dictated by the performance of the so-called genie estimator, which decodes the label of a single vertex given all the other labels. This shows that our proposed models exhibit the local-to-global amplification phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Language-Agnostic Modeling of Source Reliability on Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last few years, content verification through reliable sources has become a fundamental need to combat disinformation. Here, we present a language-agnostic model designed to assess the reliability of sources across multiple language editions of Wikipedia. Utilizing editorial activity data, the model evaluates source reliability within different articles of varying controversiality such as Climate Change, COVID-19, History, Media, and Biology topics. Crafting features that express domain usage across articles, the model effectively predicts source reliability, achieving an F1 Macro score of approximately 0.80 for English and other high-resource languages. For mid-resource languages, we achieve 0.65 while the performance of low-resource languages varies; in all cases, the time the domain remains present in the articles (which we dub as permanence) is one of the most predictive features. We highlight the challenge of maintaining consistent model performance across languages of varying resource levels and demonstrate that adapting models from higher-resource languages can improve performance. This work contributes not only to Wikipedia's efforts in ensuring content verifiability but in ensuring reliability across diverse user-generated content in various language communities.</description>

      <title>GraphC: Parameter-free Hierarchical Clustering of Signed Graph Networks v2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral clustering methodologies, when extended to accommodate signed graphs, have encountered notable limitations in effectively encapsulating inherent grouping relationships. Recent findings underscore a substantial deterioration in the efficacy of spectral clustering methods when applied to expansive signed networks. We introduce a scalable hierarchical Graph Clustering algorithm denominated GraphC. This algorithm excels at discerning optimal clusters within signed networks of varying magnitudes. GraphC aims to preserve the positive edge fractions within communities during partitioning while concurrently maximizing the negative edge fractions between communities. Importantly, GraphC does not require a predetermined cluster count (denoted as k). Empirical substantiation of GraphC 's efficacy is provided through a comprehensive evaluation involving fourteen datasets juxtaposed against ten baseline signed graph clustering algorithms. The algorithm's scalability is demonstrated through its application to extensive signed graphs drawn from Amazon-sourced datasets, each comprising tens of millions of vertices and edges. A noteworthy accomplishment is evidenced, with an average cumulative enhancement of 18.64% (consisting of the summation of positive edge fractions within communities and negative edge fractions between communities) over the second-best baseline for each respective signed graph. It is imperative to note that this evaluation excludes instances wherein all baseline algorithms failed to execute comprehensively.</description>

      <title>Know Your Account: Double Graph Inference-based Account De-anonymization on Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scaled Web 3.0 digital economy, represented by decentralized finance (DeFi), has sparked increasing interest in the past few years, which usually relies on blockchain for token transfer and diverse transaction logic. However, illegal behaviors, such as financial fraud, hacker attacks, and money laundering, are rampant in the blockchain ecosystem and seriously threaten its integrity and security. In this paper, we propose a novel double graph-based Ethereum account de-anonymization inference method, dubbed DBG4ETH, which aims to capture the behavioral patterns of accounts comprehensively and has more robust analytical and judgment capabilities for current complex and continuously generated transaction behaviors. Specifically, we first construct a global static graph to build complex interactions between the various account nodes for all transaction data. Then, we also construct a local dynamic graph to learn about the gradual evolution of transactions over different periods. Different graphs focus on information from different perspectives, and features of global and local, static and dynamic transaction graphs are available through DBG4ETH. In addition, we propose an adaptive confidence calibration method to predict the results by feeding the calibrated weighted prediction values into the classifier. Experimental results show that DBG4ETH achieves state-of-the-art results in the account identification task, improving the F1-score by at least 3.75% and up to 40.52% compared to processing each graph type individually and outperforming similar account identity inference methods by 5.23% to 12.91%.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous graph trend filtering via a l2,0 cardinality penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05223v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study estimation of piecewise smooth signals over a graph. We propose a $\ell_{2,0}$-norm penalized Graph Trend Filtering (GTF) model to estimate piecewise smooth graph signals that exhibit inhomogeneous levels of smoothness across the nodes. We prove that the proposed GTF model is simultaneously a k-means clustering on the signal over the nodes and a minimum graph cut on the edges of the graph, where the clustering and the cut share the same assignment matrix. We propose two methods to solve the proposed GTF model: a spectral decomposition method and a method based on simulated annealing. In the experiment on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that the proposed GTF model has a better performances compared with existing approaches on the tasks of denoising, support recovery and semi-supervised classification. We also show that the proposed GTF model can be solved more efficiently than existing models for the dataset with a large edge set.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Block Hypergraph model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic block model is widely used to generate graphs with a community structure, but no simple alternative currently exists for hypergraphs, in which more than two nodes can be connected together through a hyperedge. We discuss here such a hypergraph generalization, based on the clustering connection probability $P_{ij}$ between nodes of communities $i$ and $j$, and that uses an explicit and modulable hyperedge formation process. We focus on the standard case where $P_{ij}=p\delta_{ij}+q(1-\delta_{ij})$ when $0\leq q\leq p$. We propose a simple model that satisfies three criteria: it should be as simple as possible, when $p = q$ the model should be equivalent to the standard hypergraph random model, and it should use an explicit and modulable hyperedge formation process so that the model is intuitive and can easily express different real-world formation processes. We first show that for such a model the degree distribution and hyperedge size distribution can be approximated by binomial distributions with effective parameters that depend on the number of communities and $q/p$. Also, the composition of hyperedges goes for $q=0$ from `pure' hyperedges (comprising nodes belonging to the same community) to `mixed' hyperedges that comprise nodes from different communities for $q=p$. We test various formation processes and our results suggest that when they depend on the composition of the hyperedge, they tend to favor the dominant community and lead to hyperedges with a smaller diversity. In contrast, for formation processes that are independent from the hyperedge structure, we obtain hyperedges comprising a larger diversity of communities. The advantages of the model proposed here are its simplicity and flexibility that make it a good candidate for testing community-related problems, such as their detection, impact on various dynamics, and visualization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has challenged the widespread belief that gender inequities in academia would disappear simply by increasing the number of women. More complex causes might be at play, embodied in the networked structure of scientific collaborations. Here, we aim to understand the structural inequality between male and female scholars in the dissemination of scientific knowledge. We use a large-scale dataset of academic publications from the American Physical Society (APS) to build a time-varying network of collaborations from 1970 to 2020. We model knowledge dissemination as a contagion process in which scientists become informed based on the propagation of knowledge through their collaborators. We quantify the fairness of the system in terms of how women acquire and diffuse knowledge compared to men. Our results indicate that knowledge acquisition and diffusion are slower for women than expected. We find that the main determinant of women's disadvantage is the gap in the cumulative number of collaborators, highlighting how time creates structural disadvantages that contribute to marginalize women in physics. Our work sheds light on how the dynamics of scientific collaborations shape gender disparities in knowledge dissemination and calls for a deeper understanding on how to intervene to improve fairness and diversity in the scientific community.</description>

      <title>AdaSociety: An Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03865v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.</description>

      <title>Correlation-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks for Multi-Label Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-label node classification is an important yet under-explored domain in graph mining as many real-world nodes belong to multiple categories rather than just a single one. Although a few efforts have been made by utilizing Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) to learn node representations and model correlations between multiple labels in the embedding space, they still suffer from the ambiguous feature and ambiguous topology induced by multiple labels, which reduces the credibility of the messages delivered in graphs and overlooks the label correlations on graph data. Therefore, it is crucial to reduce the ambiguity and empower the GCNs for accurate classification. However, this is quite challenging due to the requirement of retaining the distinctiveness of each label while fully harnessing the correlation between labels simultaneously. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Correlation-aware Graph Convolutional Network (CorGCN) for multi-label node classification. By introducing a novel Correlation-Aware Graph Decomposition module, CorGCN can learn a graph that contains rich label-correlated information for each label. It then employs a Correlation-Enhanced Graph Convolution to model the relationships between labels during message passing to further bolster the classification process. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CorGCN.</description>
