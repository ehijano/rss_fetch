      <title>Extracting the geometric backbone of bipartite networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real bipartite networks combine degree-constrained random mixing with structured, locality-like rules. We introduce a statistical filter that benchmarks node-level bipartite clustering against degree-preserving randomizations to classify nodes as geometric (signal) or random-like (noise). In synthetic mixtures with known ground truth, the filter achieves high F-scores and sharpens inference of latent geometric parameters. Applied to four empirical systems --metabolism, online group membership, plant-pollinator interactions, and languages-- it isolates recurrent neighborhoods while removing ubiquitous or weakly co-occurring entities. Filtering exposes a compact geometric backbone that disproportionately sustains connectivity under percolation and preserves downstream classifier accuracy in node-feature tasks, offering a simple, scalable way to disentangle structure from noise in bipartite networks.</description>

      <title>Bunching of extreme events on complex network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme events such as earthquakes, floods, and power blackouts often display burst phenomena where multiple extreme events occur in quick succession or in bunches. This study examines bunching of extreme events on a complex network using a random walk transport model. We find that in a modular network, a small cluster sparsely connected with the rest, shows bunching and correlations among extreme events. The bunching and correlations emerge naturally in our system. We use several characterization techniques, namely the recurrence time distribution, autocorrelation function, bursty trains, burstiness parameter and memory coefficient to quantify the bunching and correlations of extreme events. Our study shows that the network structure plays a significant role in the bunching of extreme events.</description>

      <title>Emergence of power laws in hierarchical dynamics on multi-level graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power-law distributions are widely recognized in complex systems physics as indicative of underlying complexity in interaction networks and critical macroscopic behavior. Previous studies, notably those of Newman and others, have emphasized the importance of network structure and dynamics in understanding the emergence of such statistical patterns and predicting extreme events. In this study, we investigate the emergence of power-law behavior in delay distributions within a multi-level hierarchical network of agents governed by simple priority rules. Using railway systems as a case study, we model the dynamics of high-speed and local trains agents assigned distinct priority levels-operating within a simplified hierarchical network framework. By introducing Laplacian-distributed stochastic fluctuations into scheduled travel times, derived from empirical data, we observe that local trains exhibit a markedly higher incidence of higher delays than high-speed trains. To account for this phenomenon, we propose a queue-based dynamical model, calibrated using Italian railway data, and validate our findings through comparative analysis with both Italian and German datasets. The model accurately reproduces the empirically observed power-law exponent associated with the Italian local train delays. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of operational policies, such as priority assignment and delay compensation thresholds, revealing distinct cut-offs in delay distributions at 30 and 60 minutes for high-speed and local trains, respectively-corresponding to refund eligibility criteria in Italy. Such cut-offs are absent in the German case, where no comparable priority-change policies are in effect. These results underscore the capacity of simple hierarchical structures and rule-based dynamics to generate complex statistical behaviors without necessitating intricate interaction networks.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Neural-Network-Entropy model of vital node identification on network attack and propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vital nodes usually play a key role in complex networks. Uncovering these nodes is an important task in protecting the network, especially when the network suffers intentional attack. Many existing methods have not fully integrated the node feature, interaction and state. In this article, we propose a novel method (GNNE) based on graph neural networks and information entropy. The method employs a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn the nodes' features, which are input into a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to obtain the influence factor of nodes, and the node influence factors are used to calculate the nodes' entropy to evaluate the node importance. The GNNE takes advantage of the GCN and GAT, with the GCN well extracting the nodes' features and the GAT aggregating the features of the nodes' neighbors by using the attention mechanism to assign different weights to the neighbors with different importance, and the nodes' entropy quantifies the nodes' state in the network. The proposed method is trained on a synthetic Barabasi-Albert network, and tested on six real datasets. Compared with eight traditional topology-based methods and four graph-machine-learning-based methods, the GNNE shows an advantage for the vital node identification in the perspectives of network attack and propagation.</description>

      <title>Graph entropy, degree assortativity, and hierarchical structures in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We connect several notions relating the structural and dynamical properties of a graph. Among them are the topological entropy coming from the vertex shift, which is related to the spectral radius of the graph's adjacency matrix, the Randi\'c index, and the degree assortativity. We show that, among all connected graphs with the same degree sequence, the graph having maximum entropy is characterized by a hierarchical structure; namely, it satisfies a breadth-first search ordering with decreasing degrees (BFD-ordering for short). Consequently, the maximum-entropy graph necessarily has high degree assortativity; furthermore, for such a graph the degree centrality and eigenvector centrality coincide. Moreover, the notion of assortativity is related to the general Randi\'c index. We prove that the graph that maximizes the Randi\'{c} index satisfies a BFD-ordering. For trees, the converse holds as well. We also define a normalized Randi\'c function and show that its maximum value equals the difference of Shannon entropies of two probability distributions defined on the edges and vertices of the graph based on degree correlations.</description>

      <title>Homophily Within and Across Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homophily -- the tendency of individuals to interact with similar others -- shapes how networks form and function. Yet existing approaches typically collapse homophily to a single scale, either one parameter for the whole network or one per community, thereby detaching it from other structural features. Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy random graph model that moves beyond these limits, capturing homophily across all social scales in the network, with parameters for each group size. The framework decomposes homophily into within- and across-group contributions, recovering the stochastic block model as a special case. As an exponential-family model, it fits empirical data and enables inference of group-level variation of homophily that aggregate metrics miss. The group-dependence of homophily substantially impacts network percolation thresholds, altering predictions for epidemic spread, information diffusion, and the effectiveness of interventions. Ignoring such heterogeneity risks systematically misjudging connectivity and dynamics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Geological CO2 storage assessment in emerging CCS regions: Review of sequestration potential, policy development, and socio-economic factors in Poland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging carbon capture and storage (CCS) markets face critical challenges in developing systematic methodologies to assess geological CO2 storage potential under conditions of limited data availability, evolving regulatory frameworks, and nascent infrastructure development. This study establishes an assessment framework designed for lower-maturity CCS regions, using Poland as a representative case study to demonstrate methodology application and validate framework effectiveness. The framework integrates geological characterization, storage capacity assessment, regulatory analysis, and socio-economic evaluation through a structured approach adaptable to diverse global contexts. Poland's coal-reliant economy exemplifies the decarbonization challenges facing emerging CCS regions while meeting European Union climate mandates. The country's geological setting offers substantial sequestration opportunities across three major sedimentary regions. Through multidisciplinary analysis synthesizing scattered geological data, policy developments, CCUS value chain, and stakeholder perspectives, we systematically evaluate CO2 storage potential. Onshore saline aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon fields provide significant storage capacity, while offshore Baltic Basin sites face logistical and environmental regulatory constraints. Current assessments encounter critical limitations, including sparse data, restricted research access, and inadequate industry-academia collaboration, preventing basin-scale analyses from advancing to higher storage readiness levels and undermining business decision-making reliability. This study contributes a replicable methodology extending beyond Poland to lower-maturity CCS regions worldwide. The framework provides decision-makers with systematic tools for storage assessment, policy development, and stakeholder engagement, supporting evidence-based CCS deployment strategies.</description>

      <title>Social influence on complex networks as a perturbation to individual behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperation is fundamental to the functioning of biological and social systems in both human and animal populations, with the structure of interactions playing a crucial role. Previous studies have used networks to describe interactions and explore the evolution of cooperation, but with limited transposability to social settings due to biologically relevant assumptions. Exogenous processes -- that affect the individual and are not derived from social interactions -- even if unbiased, have a role in supporting cooperation over defection, and this role has been largely overlooked in the context of network-based interactions. Here, we show that selection can favor either cooperation or defection depending on the frequency of exogenous, even if neutral, processes in any population structure. Our framework allows for deriving analytically the conditions for favoring a specific behavior in any network structure strongly affected by non-social environments (frequent exogenous forcing, FEF), which contrasts with previous computationally prohibitive methods. Our results demonstrate that the requirements for favoring cooperation under FEF do not match those in the rare-mutation limit, establishing that underlying neutral processes can be considered a mechanism for cooperation. We reveal that, under FEF, populations are less cooperative, and network heterogeneity can provide an advantage only if targeting specific network properties, clarifying seemingly contradictory experimental results and evolutionary predictions. While focused on cooperation, our assumptions generalize to any decision-making process involving a choice between alternative options. Our framework is particularly applicable to non-homogeneous human populations, offering a new perspective on cooperation science in the context of cultural evolution, where neutral and biased processes within structured interactions are abundant.</description>

      <title>Multi-set spectral clustering of time-evolving networks using the supra-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11984v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for learning communities in time-evolving networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We consider the supra-Laplacian for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the supra-Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.</description>
