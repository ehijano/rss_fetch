      <title>Refusal-Trained LLMs Are Easily Jailbroken As Browser Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For safety reasons, large language models (LLMs) are trained to refuse harmful user instructions, such as assisting dangerous activities. We study an open question in this work: does the desired safety refusal, typically enforced in chat contexts, generalize to non-chat and agentic use cases? Unlike chatbots, LLM agents equipped with general-purpose tools, such as web browsers and mobile devices, can directly influence the real world, making it even more crucial to refuse harmful instructions. In this work, we primarily focus on red-teaming browser agents, LLMs that manipulate information via web browsers. To this end, we introduce Browser Agent Red teaming Toolkit (BrowserART), a comprehensive test suite designed specifically for red-teaming browser agents. BrowserART is consist of 100 diverse browser-related harmful behaviors (including original behaviors and ones sourced from HarmBench [Mazeika et al., 2024] and AirBench 2024 [Zeng et al., 2024b]) across both synthetic and real websites. Our empirical study on state-of-the-art browser agents reveals that, while the backbone LLM refuses harmful instructions as a chatbot, the corresponding agent does not. Moreover, attack methods designed to jailbreak refusal-trained LLMs in the chat settings transfer effectively to browser agents. With human rewrites, GPT-4o and o1-preview-based browser agents attempted 98 and 63 harmful behaviors (out of 100), respectively. We publicly release BrowserART and call on LLM developers, policymakers, and agent developers to collaborate on improving agent safety</description>

      <title>S$^4$ST: A Strong, Self-transferable, faSt, and Simple Scale Transformation for Transferable Targeted Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transferable targeted adversarial attacks (TTAs) against deep neural networks have been proven significantly more challenging than untargeted ones, yet they remain relatively underexplored. This paper sheds new light on performing highly efficient yet transferable targeted attacks leveraging the simple gradient-based baseline. Our research underscores the critical importance of image transformations within gradient calculations, marking a shift from the prevalent emphasis on loss functions to address the gradient vanishing problem. Moreover, we have developed two effective blind estimators that facilitate the design of transformation strategies to enhance targeted transferability under black-box conditions. The adversarial examples' self-transferability to geometric transformations has been identified as strongly correlated with their black-box transferability, featuring these basic operations as potent yet overlapped proxies for facilitating targeted transferability. The surrogate self-alignment assessments further highlight simple scaling transformation's exceptional efficacy, which rivals that of most advanced methods. Building on these insights, we introduce a scaling-centered transformation strategy termed Strong, Self-transferable, faSt, and Simple Scale Transformation (S4ST) to enhance transferable targeted attacks. In experiments conducted on the ImageNet-Compatible benchmark dataset, our proposed S4ST attains a SOTA average targeted transfer success rate across various challenging black-box models, outperforming the previous leading method by over 14% while requiring only 25% of the execution time. Additionally, our approach eclipses SOTA attacks considerably and exhibits remarkable effectiveness against real-world APIs. This work marks a significant leap forward in TTAs, revealing the realistic threats they pose and providing a practical generation method for future research.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs be Scammed? A Baseline Measurement Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the importance of developing generative AI models that can effectively resist scams, current literature lacks a structured framework for evaluating their vulnerability to such threats. In this work, we address this gap by constructing a benchmark based on the FINRA taxonomy and systematically assessing Large Language Models' (LLMs') vulnerability to a variety of scam tactics. First, we incorporate 37 well-defined base scam scenarios reflecting the diverse scam categories identified by FINRA taxonomy, providing a focused evaluation of LLMs' scam detection capabilities. Second, we utilize representative proprietary (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) and open-source (Llama) models to analyze their performance in scam detection. Third, our research provides critical insights into which scam tactics are most effective against LLMs and how varying persona traits and persuasive techniques influence these vulnerabilities. We reveal distinct susceptibility patterns across different models and scenarios, underscoring the need for targeted enhancements in LLM design and deployment.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based XIoT Malware Analysis: A Comprehensive Survey, Taxonomy, and Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the fastest-growing computing industries. By the end of 2027, more than 29 billion devices are expected to be connected. These smart devices can communicate with each other with and without human intervention. This rapid growth has led to the emergence of new types of malware. However, traditional malware detection methods, such as signature-based and heuristic-based techniques, are becoming increasingly ineffective against these new types of malware. Therefore, it has become indispensable to find practical solutions for detecting IoT malware. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches have proven effective in dealing with these new IoT malware variants, exhibiting high detection rates. In this paper, we bridge the gap in research between the IoT malware analysis and the wide adoption of deep learning in tackling the problems in this domain. As such, we provide a comprehensive review on deep learning based malware analysis across various categories of the IoT domain (i.e. Extended Internet of Things (XIoT)), including Industrial IoT (IIoT), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT).</description>

      <title>A Formal Framework for Assessing and Mitigating Emergent Security Risks in Generative AI Models: Bridging Theory and Dynamic Risk Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative AI systems, including large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, advance rapidly, their growing adoption has led to new and complex security risks often overlooked in traditional AI risk assessment frameworks. This paper introduces a novel formal framework for categorizing and mitigating these emergent security risks by integrating adaptive, real-time monitoring, and dynamic risk mitigation strategies tailored to generative models' unique vulnerabilities. We identify previously under-explored risks, including latent space exploitation, multi-modal cross-attack vectors, and feedback-loop-induced model degradation. Our framework employs a layered approach, incorporating anomaly detection, continuous red-teaming, and real-time adversarial simulation to mitigate these risks. We focus on formal verification methods to ensure model robustness and scalability in the face of evolving threats. Though theoretical, this work sets the stage for future empirical validation by establishing a detailed methodology and metrics for evaluating the performance of risk mitigation strategies in generative AI systems. This framework addresses existing gaps in AI safety, offering a comprehensive road map for future research and implementation.</description>

      <title>Voting by mail: a Markov chain model for managing the security risks of election systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scrutiny surrounding vote-by-mail (VBM) in the United States has increased in recent years, raising concerns about the integrity and security of absentee voting. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a dynamic mathematical modeling framework for performing a risk assessment of VBM processes. We introduce a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) to model the VBM process and assess election performance and risk with a novel layered network approach that considers the interplay between VBM processes, malicious and non-malicious threats, and security mitigations. The time-inhomogeneous DTMC framework captures dynamic risks and evaluates performance over time. The DTMC model accounts for a spectrum of outcomes, from unintended voter errors to sophisticated, targeted attacks, representing a significant advancement in the risk assessment of VBM planning and protection. A case study based on real-world data from Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, is used to evaluate the DTMC model. The analysis includes the development of attack scenarios to assess the system's resilience and the evaluation of security measures. The analysis suggests that ballot drop boxes and automatic ballot notification systems are crucial for ensuring secure and reliable operations.</description>

      <title>SoK: Prompt Hacking of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safety and robustness of large language models (LLMs) based applications remain critical challenges in artificial intelligence. Among the key threats to these applications are prompt hacking attacks, which can significantly undermine the security and reliability of LLM-based systems. In this work, we offer a comprehensive and systematic overview of three distinct types of prompt hacking: jailbreaking, leaking, and injection, addressing the nuances that differentiate them despite their overlapping characteristics. To enhance the evaluation of LLM-based applications, we propose a novel framework that categorizes LLM responses into five distinct classes, moving beyond the traditional binary classification. This approach provides more granular insights into the AI's behavior, improving diagnostic precision and enabling more targeted enhancements to the system's safety and robustness.</description>

      <title>CoreGuard: Safeguarding Foundational Capabilities of LLMs Against Model Stealing in Edge Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proprietary large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional generalization ability across various tasks. Additionally, deploying LLMs on edge devices is trending for efficiency and privacy reasons. However, edge deployment of proprietary LLMs introduces new security threats: attackers who obtain an edge-deployed LLM can easily use it as a base model for various tasks due to its high generalization ability, which we call foundational capability stealing. Unfortunately, existing model protection mechanisms are often task-specific and fail to protect general-purpose LLMs, as they mainly focus on protecting task-related parameters using trusted execution environments (TEEs). Although some recent TEE-based methods are able to protect the overall model parameters in a computation-efficient way, they still suffer from prohibitive communication costs between TEE and CPU/GPU, making it impractical to deploy for edge LLMs. To protect the foundational capabilities of edge LLMs, we propose CoreGuard, a computation- and communication-efficient model protection approach against model stealing on edge devices. The core component of CoreGuard is a lightweight and propagative authorization module residing in TEE. Extensive experiments show that CoreGuard achieves the same security protection as the black-box security guarantees with negligible overhead.</description>

      <title>NSmark: Null Space Based Black-box Watermarking Defense Framework for Pre-trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as critical intellectual property (IP) assets that necessitate protection. Although various watermarking strategies have been proposed, they remain vulnerable to Linear Functionality Equivalence Attacks (LFEA), which can invalidate most existing white-box watermarks without prior knowledge of the watermarking scheme or training data. This paper further analyzes and extends the attack scenarios of LFEA to the commonly employed black-box settings for PLMs by considering Last-Layer outputs (dubbed LL-LFEA). We discover that the null space of the output matrix remains invariant against LL-LFEA attacks. Based on this finding, we propose NSmark, a task-agnostic, black-box watermarking scheme capable of resisting LL-LFEA attacks. NSmark consists of three phases: (i) watermark generation using the digital signature of the owner, enhanced by spread spectrum modulation for increased robustness; (ii) watermark embedding through an output mapping extractor that preserves PLM performance while maximizing watermark capacity; (iii) watermark verification, assessed by extraction rate and null space conformity. Extensive experiments on both pre-training and downstream tasks confirm the effectiveness, reliability, fidelity, and robustness of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/dongdongzhaoUP/NSmark.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Backdoor Effect for Multi-Task Model Merging via Safety-Aware Subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging has gained significant attention as a cost-effective approach to integrate multiple single-task fine-tuned models into a unified one that can perform well on multiple tasks. However, existing model merging techniques primarily focus on resolving conflicts between task-specific models, they often overlook potential security threats, particularly the risk of backdoor attacks in the open-source model ecosystem. In this paper, we first investigate the vulnerabilities of existing model merging methods to backdoor attacks, identifying two critical challenges: backdoor succession and backdoor transfer. To address these issues, we propose a novel Defense-Aware Merging (DAM) approach that simultaneously mitigates task interference and backdoor vulnerabilities. Specifically, DAM employs a meta-learning-based optimization method with dual masks to identify a shared and safety-aware subspace for model merging. These masks are alternately optimized: the Task-Shared mask identifies common beneficial parameters across tasks, aiming to preserve task-specific knowledge while reducing interference, while the Backdoor-Detection mask isolates potentially harmful parameters to neutralize security threats. This dual-mask design allows us to carefully balance the preservation of useful knowledge and the removal of potential vulnerabilities. Compared to existing merging methods, DAM achieves a more favorable balance between performance and security, reducing the attack success rate by 2-10 percentage points while sacrificing only about 1% in accuracy. Furthermore, DAM exhibits robust performance and broad applicability across various types of backdoor attacks and the number of compromised models involved in the merging process. We will release the codes and models soon.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Fine-Tuned Language Models for Efficient and Accurate Smart Contract Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of blockchain technologies has greatly accelerated the development and deployment of smart contracts. However, their inherent vulnerabilities and susceptibility to bugs have led to significant financial losses, underscoring the challenges in securing smart contracts. While traditional auditing methods are crucial, they often fall short in addressing the increasing complexity and volume of smart contracts. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for enhancing software auditing by automatically identifying security vulnerabilities. Despite their potential, the practical application of these models is hindered by substantial computational demands. This paper investigates the feasibility of using smaller, fine-tuned models to achieve comparable or even superior results in smart contract auditing. We introduce the FTSmartAudit framework, which is designed to develop cost-effective, specialized models for smart contract auditing through the fine-tuning of LLMs. Our contributions include: (1) a single-task learning framework that streamlines data preparation, training, evaluation, and continuous learning; (2) a robust dataset generation method utilizing domain-special knowledge distillation to produce high-quality datasets from advanced models like GPT-4o; (3) an adaptive learning strategy to maintain model accuracy and robustness; (4) the proven effectiveness of fine-tuned models in detecting specific vulnerabilities and complex logical errors; and (5) a framework that can be extended to other domains requiring LLM solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that smaller models can surpass state-of-the-art commercial models and tools in detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the LLM Honeypot, a system for monitoring autonomous AI hacking agents. We deployed a customized SSH honeypot and applied prompt injections with temporal analysis to identify LLM-based agents among attackers. Over a trial run of a few weeks in a public environment, we collected 800,000 hacking attempts and 6 potential AI agents, which we plan to analyze in depth in future work. Our objectives aim to improve awareness of AI hacking agents and enhance preparedness for their risks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Dataset Watermarking: Model-Level Copyright Protection for Code Summarization Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code Summarization Model (CSM) has been widely used in code production, such as online and web programming for PHP and Javascript. CSMs are essential tools in code production, enhancing software development efficiency and driving innovation in automated code analysis. However, CSMs face risks of exploitation by unauthorized users, particularly in an online environment where CSMs can be easily shared and disseminated. To address these risks, digital watermarks offer a promising solution by embedding imperceptible signatures within the models to assert copyright ownership and track unauthorized usage. Traditional watermarking for CSM copyright protection faces two main challenges: 1) dataset watermarking methods require separate design of triggers and watermark features based on the characteristics of different programming languages, which not only increases the computation complexity but also leads to a lack of generalization, 2) existing watermarks based on code style transformation are easily identifiable by automated detection, demonstrating poor concealment. To tackle these issues, we propose ModMark , a novel model-level digital watermark embedding method. Specifically, by fine-tuning the tokenizer, ModMark achieves cross-language generalization while reducing the complexity of watermark design. Moreover, we employ code noise injection techniques to effectively prevent trigger detection. Experimental results show that our method can achieve 100% watermark verification rate across various programming languages' CSMs, and the concealment and effectiveness of ModMark can also be guaranteed.</description>

      <title>DMGNN: Detecting and Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that GNNs are highly susceptible to multiple adversarial attacks. Among these, graph backdoor attacks pose one of the most prominent threats, where attackers cause models to misclassify by learning the backdoored features with injected triggers and modified target labels during the training phase. Based on the features of the triggers, these attacks can be categorized into out-of-distribution (OOD) and in-distribution (ID) graph backdoor attacks, triggers with notable differences from the clean sample feature distributions constitute OOD backdoor attacks, whereas the triggers in ID backdoor attacks are nearly identical to the clean sample feature distributions. Existing methods can successfully defend against OOD backdoor attacks by comparing the feature distribution of triggers and clean samples but fail to mitigate stealthy ID backdoor attacks. Due to the lack of proper supervision signals, the main task accuracy is negatively affected in defending against ID backdoor attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose DMGNN against OOD and ID graph backdoor attacks that can powerfully eliminate stealthiness to guarantee defense effectiveness and improve the model performance. Specifically, DMGNN can easily identify the hidden ID and OOD triggers via predicting label transitions based on counterfactual explanation. To further filter the diversity of generated explainable graphs and erase the influence of the trigger features, we present a reverse sampling pruning method to screen and discard the triggers directly on the data level. Extensive experimental evaluations on open graph datasets demonstrate that DMGNN far outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) defense methods, reducing the attack success rate to 5% with almost negligible degradation in model performance (within 3.5%).</description>

      <title>Modelling 1/f Noise in TRNGs via Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the foundational work of atomic clock physicists Barnes and Allan, this paper presents a highly scalable and numerically exact framework for modeling \(1/f\) noise in oscillatory True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) and assessing their cryptographic security. By employing Fractional Brownian Motion, the framework constructs Gaussian non-stationary processes that represent these noise spectra accurately and in a mathematically sound way. Furthermore, it establishes several critical properties, including optimal bounds on the achievable generation rate of cryptographically secure bits.</description>

      <title>Good Parenting is all you need -- Multi-agentic LLM Hallucination Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the ability of Large Language Model (LLM) agents to detect and correct hallucinations in AI-generated content. A primary agent was tasked with creating a blog about a fictional Danish artist named Flipfloppidy, which was then reviewed by another agent for factual inaccuracies. Most LLMs hallucinated the existence of this artist. Across 4,900 test runs involving various combinations of primary and reviewing agents, advanced AI models such as Llama3-70b and GPT-4 variants demonstrated near-perfect accuracy in identifying hallucinations and successfully revised outputs in 85% to 100% of cases following feedback. These findings underscore the potential of advanced AI models to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated content, providing a promising approach to improving AI workflow orchestration.</description>

      <title>Not Sure Your Car Withstands Cyberwarfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data and derived information about target victims has always been key for successful attacks, both during historical wars and modern cyber wars. Ours turns out to be an era in which modern cars generate a plethora of data about their drivers, and such data could be extremely attractive for offenders. This paper seeks to assess how well modern cars protect their drivers' data. It pursues its goal at a requirement level by analysing the gaps of the privacy policies of chief automakers such as BMW and Mercedes with respect to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is found that both brands are still imprecise about how they comply with a number of GDPR articles, hence compliance often results non-verifiable. Most importantly, while BMW exhibits slightly broader compliance, both brands still fail to comply with a number of relevant articles of the regulation. An interpretation of these findings is a non-negligible likelihood that your car may turn against you should cyberwarfare break out.</description>

      <title>From Solitary Directives to Interactive Encouragement! LLM Secure Code Generation by Natural Language Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in code generation, making them increasingly important in the field. However, the security issues of generated code have not been fully addressed, and the usability of LLMs in code generation still requires further exploration.
  This work introduces SecCode, a framework that leverages an innovative interactive encouragement prompting (EP) technique for secure code generation with \textit{only NL} prompts. This approach ensures that the prompts can be easily shared and understood by general users. SecCode functions through three stages: 1) Code Generation using NL Prompts; 2) Code Vulnerability Detection and Fixing, utilising our proposed encouragement prompting; 3) Vulnerability Cross-Checking and Code Security Refinement. These stages are executed in multiple interactive iterations to progressively enhance security. By using both proprietary LLMs (i.e., GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 and GPT-4o) and open-source LLMs (i.e., Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, DeepSeek Coder V2 Lite Instruct) evaluated on three benchmark datasets, extensive experimental results show that our proposed SecCode greatly outperforms compared baselines, generating secure code with a high vulnerability correction rate. For example, SecCode exhibits a high fix success rate of over 76\% after running 5 automated EP interactive iterations and over 89\% after running 10 automated EP interactive iterations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to formulate secure code generation with NL prompts only. We have open-sourced our code and encourage the community to focus on secure code generation.</description>

      <title>Design and Prototype of a Unified Framework for Error-robust Compression and Encryption in IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) relies on resource-constrained devices for data acquisition, but the vast amount of data generated and security concerns present challenges for efficient data handling and confidentiality. Conventional techniques for data compression and secrecy often lack energy efficiency for these devices. Compressive sensing has the potential to compress data and maintain secrecy, but many solutions do not address the issue of packet loss or errors caused by unreliable wireless channels. To address these issues, we have developed the ENCRUST scheme, which combines compression, secrecy, and error recovery. In this paper, we present a prototype of ENCRUST that uses energy-efficient operations, as well as a lighter variant called L-ENCRUST. We also perform security analysis and compare the performance of ENCRUST and L-ENCRUST with a state-of-the-art solution in terms of memory, encryption time, and energy consumption on a resource-constrained TelosB mote. Our results show that both ENCRUST and L-ENCRUST outperform the state-of-the-art solution in these metrics.</description>

      <title>Backdoored Retrievers for Prompt Injection Attacks on Retrieval Augmented Generation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent text but remain limited by the static nature of their training data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by combining LLMs with up-to-date information retrieval, but also expand the attack surface of the system. This paper investigates prompt injection attacks on RAG, focusing on malicious objectives beyond misinformation, such as inserting harmful links, promoting unauthorized services, and initiating denial-of-service behaviors. We build upon existing corpus poisoning techniques and propose a novel backdoor attack aimed at the fine-tuning process of the dense retriever component. Our experiments reveal that corpus poisoning can achieve significant attack success rates through the injection of a small number of compromised documents into the retriever corpus. In contrast, backdoor attacks demonstrate even higher success rates but necessitate a more complex setup, as the victim must fine-tune the retriever using the attacker poisoned dataset.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding Blockchain Ecosystem: Understanding and Detecting Attack Transactions on Cross-chain Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-chain bridges are essential decentralized applications (DApps) to facilitate interoperability between different blockchain networks. Unlike regular DApps, the functionality of cross-chain bridges relies on the collaboration of information both on and off the chain, which exposes them to a wider risk of attacks. According to our statistics, attacks on cross-chain bridges have resulted in losses of nearly 4.3 billion dollars since 2021. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to understand and detect attacks on cross-chain bridges. In this paper, we collect the largest number of cross-chain bridge attack incidents to date, including 49 attacks that occurred between June 2021 and September 2024. Our analysis reveal that attacks against cross-chain business logic cause significantly more damage than those that do not. These cross-chain attacks exhibit different patterns compared to normal transactions in terms of call structure, which effectively indicates potential attack behaviors. Given the significant losses in these cases and the scarcity of related research, this paper aims to detect attacks against cross-chain business logic, and propose the BridgeGuard tool. Specifically, BridgeGuard models cross-chain transactions from a graph perspective, and employs a two-stage detection framework comprising global and local graph mining to identify attack patterns in cross-chain transactions. We conduct multiple experiments on the datasets with 203 attack transactions and 40,000 normal cross-chain transactions. The results show that BridgeGuard's reported recall score is 36.32\% higher than that of state-of-the-art tools and can detect unknown attack transactions.</description>

      <title>When LLMs Go Online: The Emerging Threat of Web-Enabled LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have established them as agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with various tools. These LLM agents are often paired with web-based tools, enabling access to diverse sources and real-time information. Although these advancements offer significant benefits across various applications, they also increase the risk of malicious use, particularly in cyberattacks involving personal information. In this work, we investigate the risks associated with misuse of LLM agents in cyberattacks involving personal data. Specifically, we aim to understand: 1) how potent LLM agents can be when directed to conduct cyberattacks, 2) how cyberattacks are enhanced by web-based tools, and 3) how affordable and easy it becomes to launch cyberattacks using LLM agents. We examine three attack scenarios: the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the generation of impersonation posts, and the creation of spear-phishing emails. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of LLM agents in these attacks: LLM agents achieved a precision of up to 95.9% in collecting PII, up to 93.9% of impersonation posts created by LLM agents were evaluated as authentic, and the click rate for links in spear phishing emails created by LLM agents reached up to 46.67%. Additionally, our findings underscore the limitations of existing safeguards in contemporary commercial LLMs, emphasizing the urgent need for more robust security measures to prevent the misuse of LLM agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber attacks have become a vital threat to connected autonomous vehicles in intelligent transportation systems. Cyber threat intelligence, as the collection of cyber threat information, provides an ideal approach for responding to emerging vehicle cyber threats and enabling proactive security defense. Obtaining valuable information from enormous cybersecurity data using knowledge extraction technologies to achieve cyber threat intelligence modeling is an effective means to ensure automotive cybersecurity. Unfortunately, there is no existing cybersecurity dataset available for cyber threat intelligence modeling research in the automotive field. This paper reports the creation of a cyber threat intelligence corpus focusing on vehicle cybersecurity knowledge mining. This dataset, annotated using a joint labeling strategy, comprises 908 real automotive cybersecurity reports, containing 3678 sentences, 8195 security entities and 4852 semantic relations. We further conduct a comprehensive analysis of cyber threat intelligence mining algorithms based on this corpus. The proposed dataset will serve as a valuable resource for evaluating the performance of existing algorithms and advancing research in cyber threat intelligence modeling within the automotive field.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Privacy Measures in Healthcare Apps Predominantly Used by Older Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of telehealth systems has led to a significant increase in the use of healthcare apps among older adults, but this rapid growth has also heightened concerns about the privacy of their health information. While HIPAA in the US and GDPR in the EU establish essential privacy protections for health information, limited research exists on the effectiveness of healthcare app privacy policies, particularly those used predominantly by older adults. To address this, we evaluated 28 healthcare apps across multiple dimensions, including regulatory compliance, data handling practices, and privacy-focused usability. To do this, we created a Privacy Risk Assessment Framework (PRAF) and used it to evaluate the privacy risks associated with these healthcare apps designed for older adults. Our analysis revealed significant gaps in compliance with privacy standards to such, only 25% of apps explicitly state compliance with HIPAA, and only 18% mention GDPR. Surprisingly, 79% of these applications lack breach protocols, putting older adults at risk in the event of a data breach.</description>

      <title>Trojan Prompt Attacks on Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has been introduced as a promising approach that uses prompts to adapt pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks without requiring fine-tuning of the entire model. Despite the advantages of GPL, little attention has been given to its vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where an adversary can manipulate the model's behavior by embedding hidden triggers. Existing graph backdoor attacks rely on modifying model parameters during training, but this approach is impractical in GPL as GNN encoder parameters are frozen after pre-training. Moreover, downstream users may fine-tune their own task models on clean datasets, further complicating the attack. In this paper, we propose TGPA, a backdoor attack framework designed specifically for GPL. TGPA injects backdoors into graph prompts without modifying pre-trained GNN encoders and ensures high attack success rates and clean accuracy. To address the challenge of model fine-tuning by users, we introduce a finetuning-resistant poisoning approach that maintains the effectiveness of the backdoor even after downstream model adjustments. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of TGPA in compromising GPL models with fixed GNN encoders.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Inception for Bounded Backdoor Poisoning in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the vulnerability of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms against training-time, backdoor poisoning attacks. These attacks induce pre-determined, adversarial behavior in the agent upon observing a fixed trigger during deployment while allowing the agent to solve its intended task during training. Prior attacks rely on arbitrarily large perturbations to the agent's rewards to achieve both of these objectives - leaving them open to detection. Thus, in this work, we propose a new class of backdoor attacks against DRL which achieve state of the art performance while minimally altering the agent's rewards. These ``inception'' attacks train the agent to associate the targeted adversarial behavior with high returns by inducing a disjunction between the agent's chosen action and the true action executed in the environment during training. We formally define these attacks and prove they can achieve both adversarial objectives. We then devise an online inception attack which significantly out-performs prior attacks under bounded reward constraints.</description>

More precisely, all values occur on supersingular K3 surfaces, with exceptions only at Artin invariants 1 and 10, while on K3 surfaces of finite height, only $n=8$ is possible.</description>

      <title>Elements of disinformation theory: cyber engagement via increasing adversary information consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the case where an adversary is conducting a surveillance campaign against a networked control system (NCS), and take the perspective of a defender/control system operator who has successfully isolated the cyber intruder. To better understand the adversary's intentions and to drive up their operating costs, the defender directs the adversary towards a ``honeypot" that emulates a real control system and without actual connections to a physical plant. We propose a strategy for adversary engagement within the ``honey" control system to increase the adversary's costs of information processing. We assume that, based on an understanding of the adversary's control theoretic goals, cyber threat intelligence (CTI) provides the defender knowledge of the adversary's preferences for information acquisition. We use this knowledge to spoof sensor readings to maximize the amount of information the adversary consumes while making it (information theoretically) difficult for the adversary to detect that they are being spoofed. We discuss the case of imperfect versus perfect threat intelligence and perform a numerical comparison.</description>

      <title>REEF: Representation Encoding Fingerprints for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protecting the intellectual property of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) is very important, because training LLMs costs extensive computational resources and data. Therefore, model owners and third parties need to identify whether a suspect model is a subsequent development of the victim model. To this end, we propose a training-free REEF to identify the relationship between the suspect and victim models from the perspective of LLMs' feature representations. Specifically, REEF computes and compares the centered kernel alignment similarity between the representations of a suspect model and a victim model on the same samples. This training-free REEF does not impair the model's general capabilities and is robust to sequential fine-tuning, pruning, model merging, and permutations. In this way, REEF provides a simple and effective way for third parties and models' owners to protect LLMs' intellectual property together.

      <title>Unlearning Backdoor Attacks for LLMs with Weak-to-Strong Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can bridge the gap between large language models (LLMs) and downstream tasks. However, PEFT has been proven vulnerable to malicious attacks. Research indicates that poisoned LLMs, even after PEFT, retain the capability to activate internalized backdoors when input samples contain predefined triggers. In this paper, we introduce a novel weak-to-strong unlearning algorithm to defend against backdoor attacks based on feature alignment knowledge distillation, named W2SDefense. Specifically, we first train a small-scale language model through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the clean teacher model. Then, this teacher model guides the large-scale poisoned student model in unlearning the backdoor, leveraging PEFT. Theoretical analysis suggests that W2SDefense has the potential to enhance the student model's ability to unlearn backdoor features, preventing the activation of the backdoor. We conduct experiments on text classification tasks involving three state-of-the-art language models and three different backdoor attack algorithms. Our empirical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of W2SDefense in defending against backdoor attacks without compromising model performance.</description>

      <title>$\pi$QLB: A Privacy-preserving with Integrity-assuring Query Language for Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increase in the adoption of blockchain technology in different application domains e.g., healthcare systems, supplychain management, has raised the demand for a data query mechanism on blockchain. Since current blockchain systems lack the support for querying data with embedded security and privacy guarantees, there exists inherent security and privacy concerns on those systems. In particular, existing systems require users to submit queries to blockchain operators (e.g., a node validator) in plaintext. This directly jeopardizes users' privacy as the submitted queries may contain sensitive information, e.g., location or gender preferences, that the users may not be comfortable sharing. On the other hand, currently, the only way for users to ensure integrity of the query result is to maintain the entire blockchain database and perform the queries locally. Doing so incurs high storage and computational costs on the users, precluding this approach to be practically deployable on common light-weight devices (e.g., smartphones). To this end, this paper proposes $\pi$QLB, a query language for blockchain systems that ensures both confidentiality of query inputs and integrity of query results. Additionally, $\pi$QLB enables SQL-like queries over the blockchain data by introducing relational data semantics into the existing blockchain database. $\pi$QLB has applied the recent cryptography primitive, i.e., function secret sharing (FSS), to achieve confidentiality. To support integrity, we extend the traditional FSS setting in such a way that integrity of FSS results can be efficiently verified. Successful verification indicates absence of malicious behaviors on the servers, allowing the user to establish trust from the result. To the best of our knowledge, $\pi$QLB is the first query model designed for blockchain databases with support for confidentiality, integrity, and SQL-like queries.</description>

      <title>WaterMax: breaking the LLM watermark detectability-robustness-quality trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Watermarking is a technical means to dissuade malfeasant usage of Large Language Models. This paper proposes a novel watermarking scheme, so-called WaterMax, that enjoys high detectability while sustaining the quality of the generated text of the original LLM. Its new design leaves the LLM untouched (no modification of the weights, logits, temperature, or sampling technique). WaterMax balances robustness and complexity contrary to the watermarking techniques of the literature inherently provoking a trade-off between quality and robustness. Its performance is both theoretically proven and experimentally validated. It outperforms all the SotA techniques under the most complete benchmark suite.

      <title>Oblivious Monitoring for Discrete-Time STL via Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When monitoring a cyber-physical system (CPS) from a remote server, keeping the monitored data secret is crucial, particularly when they contain sensitive information, e.g., biological or location data. Recently, Banno et al. (CAV'22) proposed a protocol for online LTL monitoring that keeps data concealed from the server using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). We build on this protocol to allow arithmetic operations over encrypted values, e.g., to compute a safety measurement combining distance, velocity, and so forth. Overall, our protocol enables oblivious online monitoring of discrete-time real-valued signals against signal temporal logic (STL) formulas. Our protocol combines two FHE schemes, CKKS and TFHE, leveraging their respective strengths. We employ CKKS to evaluate arithmetic predicates in STL formulas while utilizing TFHE to process them using a DFA derived from the STL formula. We conducted case studies on monitoring blood glucose levels and vehicles' behavior against the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) rules. Our results suggest the practical relevance of our protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) have been proposed as an alternative solution to the scalability, throughput, and cost overhead problems associated with blockchain transactions. By facilitating offchain execution of transactions, PCNs significantly reduce the burden on the blockchain, leading to faster transaction processing, reduced transaction fees, and enhanced privacy. Despite these advantages, the current state-of-the-art in PCNs presents a variety of challenges that require further exploration. In this paper, we survey several fundamental aspects of PCNs, such as pathfinding and routing, virtual channels, state channels, payment channel hubs, and rebalancing protocols. We aim to provide the reader with a detailed understanding of the various aspects of PCN research, highlighting important advancements. Additionally, we highlight the various unresolved challenges in this area. Specifically, this paper seeks to answer the following crucial question: What are the various interesting and non-trivial challenges in fundamental infrastructure design leading to efficient transaction processing in PCN research that require immediate attention from the academic and research community? By addressing this question, we aim to identify the most pressing problems and future research directions, and we hope to inspire researchers and practitioners to tackle these challenges to make PCNs more secure and versatile</description>

      <title>DomainLynx: Leveraging Large Language Models for Enhanced Domain Squatting Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain squatting poses a significant threat to Internet security, with attackers employing increasingly sophisticated techniques. This study introduces DomainLynx, an innovative compound AI system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced domain squatting detection. Unlike existing methods focusing on predefined patterns for top-ranked domains, DomainLynx excels in identifying novel squatting techniques and protecting less prominent brands. The system's architecture integrates advanced data processing, intelligent domain pairing, and LLM-powered threat assessment. Crucially, DomainLynx incorporates specialized components that mitigate LLM hallucinations, ensuring reliable and context-aware detection. This approach enables efficient analysis of vast security data from diverse sources, including Certificate Transparency logs, Passive DNS records, and zone files. Evaluated on a curated dataset of 1,649 squatting domains, DomainLynx achieved 94.7\% accuracy using Llama-3-70B. In a month-long real-world test, it detected 34,359 squatting domains from 2.09 million new domains, outperforming baseline methods by 2.5 times. This research advances Internet security by providing a versatile, accurate, and adaptable tool for combating evolving domain squatting threats. DomainLynx's approach paves the way for more robust, AI-driven cybersecurity solutions, enhancing protection for a broader range of online entities and contributing to a safer digital ecosystem.</description>

      <title>DomainDynamics: Lifecycle-Aware Risk Timeline Construction for Domain Names</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The persistent threat posed by malicious domain names in cyber-attacks underscores the urgent need for effective detection mechanisms. Traditional machine learning methods, while capable of identifying such domains, often suffer from high false positive and false negative rates due to their extensive reliance on historical data. Conventional approaches often overlook the dynamic nature of domain names, the purposes and ownership of which may evolve, potentially rendering risk assessments outdated or irrelevant. To address these shortcomings, we introduce DomainDynamics, a novel system designed to predict domain name risks by considering their lifecycle stages. DomainDynamics constructs a timeline for each domain, evaluating the characteristics of each domain at various points in time to make informed, temporal risk determinations. In an evaluation experiment involving over 85,000 actual malicious domains from malware and phishing incidents, DomainDynamics demonstrated a significant improvement in detection rates, achieving an 82.58\% detection rate with a low false positive rate of 0.41\%. This performance surpasses that of previous studies and commercial services, improving detection capability substantially.</description>

      <title>DomainHarvester: Harvesting Infrequently Visited Yet Trustworthy Domain Names</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cybersecurity, allow lists play a crucial role in distinguishing safe websites from potential threats. Conventional methods for compiling allow lists, focusing heavily on website popularity, often overlook infrequently visited legitimate domains. This paper introduces DomainHarvester, a system aimed at generating allow lists that include trustworthy yet infrequently visited domains. By adopting an innovative bottom-up methodology that leverages the web's hyperlink structure, DomainHarvester identifies legitimate yet underrepresented domains. The system uses seed URLs to gather domain names, employing machine learning with a Transformer-based approach to assess their trustworthiness. DomainHarvester has developed two distinct allow lists: one with a global focus and another emphasizing local relevance. Compared to six existing top lists, DomainHarvester's allow lists show minimal overlaps, 4\% globally and 0.1\% locally, while significantly reducing the risk of including malicious domains, thereby enhancing security. The contributions of this research are substantial, illuminating the overlooked aspect of trustworthy yet underrepresented domains and introducing DomainHarvester, a system that goes beyond traditional popularity-based metrics. Our methodology enhances the inclusivity and precision of allow lists, offering significant advantages to users and businesses worldwide, especially in non-English speaking regions.</description>

      <title>Practical Light Clients for Committee-Based Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light clients are gaining increasing attention in the literature since they obviate the need for users to set up dedicated blockchain full nodes. While the literature features a number of light client instantiations, most light client protocols optimize for long offline phases and implicitly assume that the block headers to be verified are signed by highly dynamic validators.
  In this paper, we show that (i) most light clients are rarely offline for more than a week, and (ii) validators are unlikely to drastically change in most permissioned blockchains and in a number of permissionless blockchains, such as Cosmos and Polkadot. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel practical system that optimizes for such realistic assumptions and achieves minimal communication and computational costs for light clients when compared to existing protocols. By means of a prototype implementation of our solution, we show that our protocol achieves a reduction by up to $90$ and $40000\times$ (respectively) in end-to-end latency and up to $1000$ and $10000\times$ (respectively) smaller proof size when compared to two state-of-the-art light client instantiations from the literature.</description>

      <title>BlockFound: Customized blockchain foundation model for anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose BlockFound, a customized foundation model for anomaly blockchain transaction detection. Unlike existing methods that rely on rule-based systems or directly apply off-the-shelf large language models, BlockFound introduces a series of customized designs to model the unique data structure of blockchain transactions. First, a blockchain transaction is multi-modal, containing blockchain-specific tokens, texts, and numbers. We design a modularized tokenizer to handle these multi-modal inputs, balancing the information across different modalities. Second, we design a customized mask language learning mechanism for pretraining with RoPE embedding and FlashAttention for handling longer sequences. After training the foundation model, we further design a novel detection method for anomaly detection. Extensive evaluations on Ethereum and Solana transactions demonstrate BlockFound's exceptional capability in anomaly detection while maintaining a low false positive rate. Remarkably, BlockFound is the only method that successfully detects anomalous transactions on Solana with high accuracy, whereas all other approaches achieved very low or zero detection recall scores. This work not only provides new foundation models for blockchain but also sets a new benchmark for applying LLMs in blockchain data.</description>

      <title>How hard can it be? Quantifying MITRE attack campaigns with attack trees and cATM logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The landscape of cyber threats grows more complex by the day. Advanced Persistent Threats carry out systematic attack campaigns against which cybersecurity practitioners must defend. Examples of such organized attacks are operations Dream Job, Wocao, WannaCry or the SolarWinds Compromise. To evaluate which risks are most threatening, and which campaigns to prioritize against when defending, cybersecurity experts must be equipped with the right toolbox. In particular, they must be able to (a) obtain likelihood values for each attack campaign recorded in the wild and (b) reliably and transparently operationalize these values to carry out quantitative comparisons among campaigns. This will allow security experts to perform quantitatively-informed decision making that is transparent and accountable. In this paper we construct such a framework by: (1) quantifying the likelihood of attack campaigns via data-driven procedures on the MITRE knowledge base and (2) introducing a methodology for automatic modelling of MITRE intelligence data: this is complete in the sense that it captures any attack campaign via template attack tree models. (3) We further propose a computational framework to carry out this comparisons based on the cATM formal logic, and implement this into an open-source Python tool. Finally, we validate our approach by quantifying the likelihood of all MITRE campaigns, and comparing the likelihood of the Wocao and Dream Job MITRE campaigns -- generated with our proposed approach -- against "ad hoc" traditionally-built attack tree models, demonstrating how our methodology is substantially lighter in modelling effort, and still capable of capturing all the quantitative relevant data.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Attacks and Defenses in Secure Aggregation for Federated Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning enables the collaborative learning of a global model on diverse data, preserving data locality and eliminating the need to transfer user data to a central server. However, data privacy remains vulnerable, as attacks can target user training data by exploiting the updates sent by users during each learning iteration. Secure aggregation protocols are designed to mask/encrypt user updates and enable a central server to aggregate the masked information. MicroSecAgg (PoPETS 2024) proposes a single server secure aggregation protocol that aims to mitigate the high communication complexity of the existing approaches by enabling a one-time setup of the secret to be re-used in multiple training iterations. In this paper, we identify a security flaw in the MicroSecAgg that undermines its privacy guarantees. We detail the security flaw and our attack, demonstrating how an adversary can exploit predictable masking values to compromise user privacy. Our findings highlight the critical need for enhanced security measures in secure aggregation protocols, particularly the implementation of dynamic and unpredictable masking strategies. We propose potential countermeasures to mitigate these vulnerabilities and ensure robust privacy protection in the secure aggregation frameworks.</description>

      <title>BlackDAN: A Black-Box Multi-Objective Approach for Effective and Contextual Jailbreaking of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various tasks, they encounter potential security risks such as jailbreak attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to bypass security measures and generate harmful outputs. Existing jailbreak strategies mainly focus on maximizing attack success rate (ASR), frequently neglecting other critical factors, including the relevance of the jailbreak response to the query and the level of stealthiness. This narrow focus on single objectives can result in ineffective attacks that either lack contextual relevance or are easily recognizable. In this work, we introduce BlackDAN, an innovative black-box attack framework with multi-objective optimization, aiming to generate high-quality prompts that effectively facilitate jailbreaking while maintaining contextual relevance and minimizing detectability. BlackDAN leverages Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs), specifically the NSGA-II algorithm, to optimize jailbreaks across multiple objectives including ASR, stealthiness, and semantic relevance. By integrating mechanisms like mutation, crossover, and Pareto-dominance, BlackDAN provides a transparent and interpretable process for generating jailbreaks. Furthermore, the framework allows customization based on user preferences, enabling the selection of prompts that balance harmfulness, relevance, and other factors. Experimental results demonstrate that BlackDAN outperforms traditional single-objective methods, yielding higher success rates and improved robustness across various LLMs and multimodal LLMs, while ensuring jailbreak responses are both relevant and less detectable.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, cyber-attack prevention for the prosumer-based electric vehicle (EV) charging stations (EVCSs) is investigated, which covers two aspects: 1) cyber-attack detection on prosumers' network traffic (NT) data, and 2) cyber-attack intervention. To establish an effective prevention mechanism, several challenges need to be tackled, for instance, the NT data per prosumer may be non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), and the boundary between benign and malicious traffic becomes blurred. To this end, we propose an edge-assisted federated prototype knowledge distillation (E-FPKD) approach, where each client is deployed on a dedicated local edge server (DLES) and can report its availability for joining the federated learning (FL) process. Prior to the E-FPKD approach, to enhance accuracy, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient is adopted for feature selection. Regarding the proposed E-FPKD approach, we integrate the knowledge distillation and prototype aggregation technique into FL to deal with the non-IID challenge. To address the boundary issue, instead of directly calculating the distance between benign and malicious traffic, we consider maximizing the overall detection correctness of all prosumers (ODC), which can mitigate the computational cost compared with the former way. After detection, a rule-based method will be triggered at each DLES for cyber-attack intervention. Experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed E-FPKD can achieve the largest ODC on NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and IoTID20 datasets in both binary and multi-class classification, compared with baselines. For instance, the ODC for IoTID20 obtained via the proposed method is separately 0.3782% and 4.4471% greater than FedProto and FedAU in multi-class classification.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Decentralized AI with Confidential Computing</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses privacy protection in decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) using Confidential Computing (CC) within the Atoma Network, a decentralized AI platform designed for the Web3 domain. Decentralized AI distributes AI services among multiple entities without centralized oversight, fostering transparency and robustness. However, this structure introduces significant privacy challenges, as sensitive assets such as proprietary models and personal data may be exposed to untrusted participants. Cryptography-based privacy protection techniques such as zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) suffers prohibitive computational overhead. To address the limitation, we propose leveraging Confidential Computing (CC). Confidential Computing leverages hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to provide isolation for processing sensitive data, ensuring that both model parameters and user data remain secure, even in decentralized, potentially untrusted environments. While TEEs face a few limitations, we believe they can bridge the privacy gap in decentralized AI. We explore how we can integrate TEEs into Atoma's decentralized framework.</description>

      <title>PrE-Text: Training Language Models on Private Federated Data in the Age of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-device training is currently the most common approach for training machine learning (ML) models on private, distributed user data. Despite this, on-device training has several drawbacks: (1) most user devices are too small to train large models on-device, (2) on-device training is communication- and computation-intensive, and (3) on-device training can be difficult to debug and deploy. To address these problems, we propose Private Evolution-Text (PrE-Text), a method for generating differentially private (DP) synthetic textual data. First, we show that across multiple datasets, training small models (models that fit on user devices) with PrE-Text synthetic data outperforms small models trained on-device under practical privacy regimes ($\epsilon=1.29$, $\epsilon=7.58$). We achieve these results while using 9$\times$ fewer rounds, 6$\times$ less client computation per round, and 100$\times$ less communication per round. Second, finetuning large models on PrE-Text's DP synthetic data improves large language model (LLM) performance on private data across the same range of privacy budgets. Altogether, these results suggest that training on DP synthetic data can be a better option than training a model on-device on private distributed data.

      <title>Retraining with Predicted Hard Labels Provably Increases Model Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11206</link>

Abstract: The performance of a model trained with \textit{noisy labels} is often improved by simply \textit{retraining} the model with its own predicted \textit{hard} labels (i.e., $1$/$0$ labels). Yet, a detailed theoretical characterization of this phenomenon is lacking. In this paper, we theoretically analyze retraining in a linearly separable setting with randomly corrupted labels given to us and prove that retraining can improve the population accuracy obtained by initially training with the given (noisy) labels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such theoretical result. Retraining finds application in improving training with local label differential privacy (DP) which involves training with noisy labels. We empirically show that retraining selectively on the samples for which the predicted label matches the given label significantly improves label DP training at \textit{no extra privacy cost}; we call this \textit{consensus-based retraining}. As an example, when training ResNet-18 on CIFAR-100 with $\epsilon=3$ label DP, we obtain $6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy with consensus-based retraining.</description>
