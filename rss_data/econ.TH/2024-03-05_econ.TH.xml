      <title>Iterated Revelation: How to Incentive Experts to Complete Incomplete Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how a decision maker might incentivize an expert to reveal novel aspects of the decision problem, expanding the set of contracts from which the decision maker can choose. The chosen contract will determine, along with the resolution of uncertainty, the payoffs to both players. I show that the set of achievable outcomes under any (incentive compatible) mechanism is characterized by a small and tractable class of iterated revelation mechanisms (IRMs). An IRM is a dynamic interaction wherein each round the expert chooses to reveal some novel contingencies and the decision maker proposes a contract that the expert can accept or reject; the IRM ends after rejection or when nothing novel is revealed. I then consider the set of robust IRMs -- those that maximize the worst case outcome across all types of expert -- and show these are characterized by a principle of myopic optimality: at each round, the decision maker maximizes his payoff as if the expert had nothing further to reveal. The set of robust IRMs also delineate the payoffs achievable by any efficient mechanism.</description>

      <title>Incontestable Assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In school districts where assignments are exclusively determined by a clearinghouse students can only appeal their assignment with a valid reason. An assignment is incontestable if it is appeal-proof. We study incontestability when students do not observe the other students' preferences and assignments. Incontestability is shown to be equivalent to individual rationality, non-wastefulness, and respect for top-priority sets (a weakening of justified envy). Stable mechanisms and those Pareto dominating them are incontestable, as well as the Top-Trading Cycle mechanism (but Boston is not). Under a mild consistency property, incontestable mechanisms are i-indinstiguishable (Li, 2017), and share similar incentive properties.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Price Discrimination Under Privacy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a producer's problem of selling a product to a continuum of privacy-conscious consumers, where the producer can implement third-degree price discrimination, offering different prices to different market segments. In the absence of privacy constraints, Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris [2015] characterize the set of all possible consumer-producer utilities, showing that it is a triangle. We consider a privacy mechanism that provides a degree of protection by probabilistically masking each market segment, and we establish that the resultant set of all consumer-producer utilities forms a convex polygon, characterized explicitly as a linear mapping of a certain high-dimensional convex polytope into $\mathbb{R}^2$. This characterization enables us to investigate the impact of the privacy mechanism on both producer and consumer utilities. In particular, we establish that the privacy constraint always hurts the producer by reducing both the maximum and minimum utility achievable. From the consumer's perspective, although the privacy mechanism ensures an increase in the minimum utility compared to the non-private scenario, interestingly, it may reduce the maximum utility. Finally, we demonstrate that increasing the privacy level does not necessarily intensify these effects. For instance, the maximum utility for the producer or the minimum utility for the consumer may exhibit nonmonotonic behavior in response to an increase of the privacy level.</description>
