      <title>Going Beyond H&amp;E and Oncology: How Do Histopathology Foundation Models Perform for Multi-stain IHC and Immunology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the generalisation capabilities of state-of-the-art histopathology foundation models on out-of-distribution multi-stain autoimmune Immunohistochemistry datasets. We compare 13 feature extractor models, including ImageNet-pretrained networks, and histopathology foundation models trained on both public and proprietary data, on Rheumatoid Arthritis subtyping and Sjogren's Disease detection tasks. Using a simple Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning classifier, we assess the transferability of learned representations from cancer H&amp;E images to autoimmune IHC images. Contrary to expectations, histopathology-pretrained models did not significantly outperform ImageNet-pretrained models. Furthermore, there was evidence of both autoimmune feature misinterpretation and biased feature importance. Our findings highlight the challenges in transferring knowledge from cancer to autoimmune histopathology and emphasise the need for careful evaluation of AI models across diverse histopathological tasks. The code to run this benchmark is available at https://github.com/AmayaGS/ImmunoHistoBench.</description>

      <title>Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 offers an anti-inflammatory and antifungal method in the treatment of Aspergillus fungus keratitis in vitro and in vivo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00920</link>

Abstract: Background: Fungal keratitis is a serious blinding eye disease. Traditional drugs used to treat fungal keratitis commonly have the disadvantages of low bioavailability, poor dispersion, and limited permeability. Purpose: To develop a new method for the treatment of fungal keratitis with improved bioavailability, dispersion, and permeability. Purpose: To develop a new method for the treatment of fungal keratitis with improved bioavailability, dispersion, and permeability. Methods: Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 (ZIF-8) was formed by zinc ions and 2-methylimidazole linked by coordination bonds and characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Zeta potential. The safety of ZIF-8 on HCECs and RAW 264.7 cells was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). The anti-inflammatory effects of ZIF-8 on RAW 246.7 cells were evaluated by Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (qPCR) and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Clinical score, Colony-Forming Units (CFU). In vivo, treatment with ZIF-8 reduced corneal fungal load and mitigated neutrophil infiltration in fungal keratitis, which effectively reduced the severity of keratitis in mice and alleviated the infiltration of inflammatory factors in the mouse cornea. In addition, ZIF-8 reduces the inflammatory response by downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-{\alpha}, IL-6, and IL-1\b{eta} after Aspergillus fumigatus infection in vivo and in vitro. Conclusion: ZIF-8 has a significant anti-inflammatory and antifungal effect, which provides a new solution for the treatment of fungal keratitis.</description>
