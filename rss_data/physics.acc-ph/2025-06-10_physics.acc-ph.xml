      <title>High-precision Beam Optics Calculation of the HIAF-BRing Using Measured Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of the High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) has been completed, with current efforts focused on subsystem commissioning. Beam commissioning is scheduled for autumn 2025, marking a critical milestone in HIAF's operational readiness. This paper presents high-precision optics calculations for the Booster Ring (BRing) of HIAF, a key component for achieving stable heavy-ion beam acceleration. Leveraging high-precision magnetic field data, each magnet is divided into hundreds of segmentations, thus establishing a high-precision sliced optics model for BRing. Detailed calculations of BRing's optics are presented in this work. Critical parameters including tunes and betatron functions of the lattice based on the measured magnetic fields and those of the ideal lattice have been compared. The results highlight the impact of realistic magnetic field on beam dynamics and provide essential insights for accelerator tuning and optimization. These findings serve as a fundamental reference for BRing's commissioning and long-term operation, ensuring beam stability and performance reproducibility in HIAF.</description>

      <title>Full-scatter vector field analysis of an overmoded and periodically-loaded cylindrical structure for the transportation of THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full-scatter vector field analysis of a highly overmoded and periodically loaded cylindrical wavguiding structure (or "iris line") is presented. This type of structure is promising for the transportation of diffraction-prone short THz radiation pulses over hundreds of meters. The analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive screens. Its results are quite general, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence with slowly-varying envelope (parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while hosting hundreds of modes and formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory expands previously established methods, including Vainstein's limit and the forward-scatter approximation, and validates them (as they become special cases with respect to it). It also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure, and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>

      <title>High-Accuracy Schottky Diagnostics for Low-SNR Betatron Tune Measurement in Ramping Synchrotrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19171v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel real-time betatron tune measurement algorithm, utilizing Schottky signals and an FPGA-based backend architecture, specifically designed for rapidly ramping synchrotrons, with particular application to the Shanghai Advanced Proton Therapy (SAPT) facility. The developed algorithm demonstrates improved measurement accuracy under challenging operational conditions, especially in scenarios with limited sampling time and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) as low as \(-20\) dB. By applying Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) analysis, the algorithm effectively accommodates the rapid increase in revolution frequency from 4 MHz to 7.5 MHz over 0.35 seconds, along with tune shifts. A macro-particle simulation methodology is employed to generate Schottky signals, which are then combined with real noise collected from an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to simulate practical conditions. The proposed betatron tune measurement algorithm integrates advanced spectral processing techniques and an enhanced peak detection algorithm specifically tailored for low SNR conditions. Experimental validation confirms the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over conventional approaches in terms of measurement accuracy, stability, and system robustness, while meeting the stringent operational requirements of proton therapy applications. This innovative approach effectively addresses critical limitations associated with Schottky diagnostics for betatron tune measurement in rapidly ramping synchrotrons operating under low SNR conditions, laying a robust foundation and providing a viable solution for advanced applications in proton therapy and related accelerator physics fields.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We outline a method of beamed power for propulsion that utilizes relativistic electron beams. The physics of charged particle beam propagation in the space plasma environment is discussed and the long-range (&gt;100 A.U.) advantage of relativistic electron beams is emphasized. A preliminary statite based beam emitter for powering probes to ~0.1c is proposed and the challenges in beam-power uses are explored.</description>
