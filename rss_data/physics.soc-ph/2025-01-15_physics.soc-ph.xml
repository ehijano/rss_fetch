      <title>Pedestrian fluxes in confined geometric networks: entropic measures and robustness of accessibility in a university campus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When discussing urban life, pedestrian accessibility to all main services is crucial for fostering social interactions, promoting healthy lifestyles, and reducing pollution. This is especially relevant in coherent urban agglomerations like university campuses, which feature a high concentration of streets and social facilities. Using Wi-Fi data, we study pedestrian movements within a confined geometric network representing the pathways on a university campus. We estimate the level of crowding in each arc of the network and identify pedestrian flows along all possible paths, measuring the entropy and robustness of the network. In particular, we calculate the information gain achieved through the use of Wi-Fi data and we assess how pedestrian traffic redistributes within the network after the removal of individual arcs. Our results can be used to facilitate the investigation of the current state of walkability across the university campus while also testing a set of methods for analyzing urban complex networks, potentially allowing us to pinpoint areas in urgent need of road maintenance and enhancement.</description>

      <title>Towards high resolution, validated and open global wind power assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07937v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind power is expected to play a crucial role in future net-zero energy systems, but wind power simulations to support deployment strategies vary drastically in their results, hindering reliable design decisions. Therefore, we present a transparent, open source, validated and evaluated, global wind power simulation tool ETHOS.RESKit.Wind with high spatial resolution and customizable designs for both onshore and offshore wind turbines. The tool provides a comprehensive validation and calibration procedure using over 16 million global measurements from metrerological masts and wind turbine sites. We achieve a global average capacity factor mean error of 0.006 and Pearson correlation of 0.865. In addition, we evaluate its performance against several aggregated and statistical sources of wind power generation. The release of ETHOS.RESKit.Wind is a step towards a fully open source and open data approach to accurate wind power modeling by incorporating the most comprehensive simulation advances in one model.</description>

      <title>Using Gamified Experiments to Tame Complexity: the case of the Schelling Model of Segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs gamified experiments to investigate and refine the Schelling Model of Segregation, a framework that demonstrates how individual preferences can lead to systemic segregation. Using a movement selection algorithm derived from a board game adaptation of the classical Schelling Model, the research examines player strategies aimed at minimizing segregation and maximizing happiness within a controlled environment. Rooted in greedy optimization, the model balances these objectives through a tunable parameter. Empirical data from gameplay is analyzed using Approximate Bayesian Computation, providing insights into player strategies and their alignment with systemic outcomes. The findings highlight the potential of gamification as a tool for engaging with complex social phenomena, enhancing agent-based models, and fostering participatory approaches in the study of emergent behaviors. This dual-layered framework incorporates collective decision-making into micro-macro models, addressing critiques of oversimplification and expanding their utility in educational and policy contexts.</description>

      <title>Concise network models of memory dynamics reveal explainable patterns in path data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks are a powerful tool to model the structure and dynamics of complex systems across scales. Direct connections between system components are often represented as edges, while paths and walks capture indirect interactions. This approach assumes that flows in the system are sequences of independent transitions. Path data from real-world systems often have higher-order dependencies, which require more sophisticated models. In this work, we propose a method to construct concise networks from path data that interpolate between first and second-order models. We prioritise simplicity and interpretability by creating state nodes that capture latent modes of second-order effects and introducing an interpretable measure to balance model size and accuracy. In both synthetic and real-world applications, our method reveals large-scale memory patterns and constructs concise networks that provide insights beyond the first-order model at the fraction of the size of a second-order model.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Block Hypergraph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic block model is widely used to generate graphs with a community structure, but no simple alternative currently exists for hypergraphs, in which more than two nodes can be connected together through a hyperedge. We discuss here such a hypergraph generalization, based on the clustering connection probability $P_{ij}$ between nodes of communities $i$ and $j$, and that uses an explicit and modulable hyperedge formation process. We focus on the standard case where $P_{ij}=p\delta_{ij}+q(1-\delta_{ij})$ when $0\leq q\leq p$. We propose a simple model that satisfies three criteria: it should be as simple as possible, when $p = q$ the model should be equivalent to the standard hypergraph random model, and it should use an explicit and modulable hyperedge formation process so that the model is intuitive and can easily express different real-world formation processes. We first show that for such a model the degree distribution and hyperedge size distribution can be approximated by binomial distributions with effective parameters that depend on the number of communities and $q/p$. Also, the composition of hyperedges goes for $q=0$ from `pure' hyperedges (comprising nodes belonging to the same community) to `mixed' hyperedges that comprise nodes from different communities for $q=p$. We test various formation processes and our results suggest that when they depend on the composition of the hyperedge, they tend to favor the dominant community and lead to hyperedges with a smaller diversity. In contrast, for formation processes that are independent from the hyperedge structure, we obtain hyperedges comprising a larger diversity of communities. The advantages of the model proposed here are its simplicity and flexibility that make it a good candidate for testing community-related problems, such as their detection, impact on various dynamics, and visualization.</description>

      <title>Gender disparities in the dissemination and acquisition of scientific knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has challenged the widespread belief that gender inequities in academia would disappear simply by increasing the number of women. More complex causes might be at play, embodied in the networked structure of scientific collaborations. Here, we aim to understand the structural inequality between male and female scholars in the dissemination of scientific knowledge. We use a large-scale dataset of academic publications from the American Physical Society (APS) to build a time-varying network of collaborations from 1970 to 2020. We model knowledge dissemination as a contagion process in which scientists become informed based on the propagation of knowledge through their collaborators. We quantify the fairness of the system in terms of how women acquire and diffuse knowledge compared to men. Our results indicate that knowledge acquisition and diffusion are slower for women than expected. We find that the main determinant of women's disadvantage is the gap in the cumulative number of collaborators, highlighting how time creates structural disadvantages that contribute to marginalize women in physics. Our work sheds light on how the dynamics of scientific collaborations shape gender disparities in knowledge dissemination and calls for a deeper understanding on how to intervene to improve fairness and diversity in the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Recovery of contour nodes in interdependent directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive research has focused on studying the robustness of interdependent non-directed networks and the design of mitigation strategies aimed at reducing disruptions caused by cascading failures. However, real systems such as power and communication networks are directed, which underscores the necessity of broadening the analysis by including directed networks. In this work, we develop an analytical framework to study a recovery strategy in two interdependent directed networks in which a fraction $q$ of nodes in each network have single dependencies with nodes in the other network. Following the random failure of nodes that leaves a fraction $p$ intact, we repair a fraction of nodes that are neighbors of the giant strongly connected component of each network with probability or recovery success rate $\gamma$. Our analysis reveals an abrupt transition between total system collapse and complete recovery as $p$ is increased. As a consequence, we identify three distinct phases in the $(p, \gamma)$ parameter space: collapse despite intervention, recovery enabled by the strategy, and resilience without intervention. Moreover, we demonstrate our strategy on a system built from empirical data and find that it can save resources compared to a random recovery strategy. Our findings underscore the potential of targeted recovery strategies to enhance the robustness of real interdependent directed networks against cascading failures.</description>

      <title>The Norwegian-Polish CCS Network: A Case Study in Bilateral Collaboration for European Climate Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the face of escalating climate change, achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from hard-to-abate industrial sectors is imperative. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) represents an essential technological advancement to achieve sustainable decarbonization. This manuscript reports on the bilateral CCS network between Norway and Poland, designed and implemented to leverage their capabilities to expedite technology deployment via mutual cooperation and accelerate CCS initiatives targeted to member states' challenges across Europe, aiming for a meaningful contribution to climate goals. Norway is renowned for its operational acumen, as demonstrated by landmark projects like Sleipner and Snohvit, and its forward-looking initiatives, such as the open-source cross-border Northern Lights project, which offers advanced infrastructure and expertise. Conversely, Poland, characterized by its coal-dependent economy and the challenge of decarbonizing extensive industrial emissions, presents a significant geological CO$_2$ storage potential, estimated at over 200 gigatonnes. This study delves into the potential synergies derived from collaborative endeavors in academic education, research and development, industrial implementation, regulatory coherence, and public engagement. By underscoring the reciprocal benefits of such partnership, the study underscores the indispensable role of bilateral cooperation in harnessing CCS's capabilities to meet ambitious climate objectives, paving the way toward a sustainable and low-carbon future. Additionally, it outlines a scalable model for fostering and supporting broader bi- and multi-lateral collaborations, emphasizing the pivotal role of interconnected networks in shaping effective global climate action strategies.</description>

      <title>The improvement in transmission resilience metrics from reduced outages or faster restoration can be calculated by rerunning historical outage data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transmission utilities routinely collect detailed outage data, including resilience events in which outages bunch up due to weather. The resilience events and their resilience metrics can readily be extracted from this historical outage data. Improvements such as grid hardening or investments in restoration lead to reduced outages or faster restoration. We show how to rerun this history with the effects of the reduced outages or faster restoration included to find the resulting improvement in resilience metrics, thus quantifying the benefits of these investments. This is demonstrated with case studies for specific events (a derecho and a hurricane), and all large events or large thunderstorms in the Midwest USA. Instead of predicting future extreme events with models, which is very challenging, the historical rerun readily quantifies the benefits that a resilience investment would have had if it had been made in the past. The historical rerun is particularly vivid in making the case for resilience investments to stakeholders because it quantifies the benefits for events actually experienced by those stakeholders, rather than for future events predicted with uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Astronomy and Society: The Road Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astronomy, of all the sciences, is possibly the one with the most public appeal across all age groups. This is also evidenced by the existence of a large number of planetaria and amateur astronomy societies, which is unique to the field. Astronomy is known as a `gateway science', with an ability to attract students who then proceed to explore their interest in other STEM fields too. Astronomy's link to society is therefore substantive and diverse. In this white paper, six key areas are analysed, namely outreach and communication, astronomy education, history and heritage, astronomy for development, diversity, and hiring practices for outreach personnel.
  The current status of each of these areas is described, followed by an analysis of what is needed for the future. A set of recommendations for institutions, funding agencies, and individuals are evolved for each specific area. This work charts out the vision for how the astronomy-society connection should take shape in the future, and attempts to provide a road-map for the various stakeholders involved.</description>
