      <title>Lopsided Rigid Dumbbell Rheology from Langevin Equation: A Graduate Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modelling of symmetric rigid dumbbell particles suspended in a Newtonian fluid, as a model of a rigid-rod polymeric solution, has been accomplished exclusively through the diffusion equation, which has been detailed elegantly by Bird et al. [Chapter 14 of $Dynamics \ of \ Polymeric \ Liquids$, Vol 2, Ed 2, (1987)]. In this tutorial, a straightforward approach for modelling a lopsided rigid dumbbell particle is presented by the Langevin analysis. The connector force between the dumbbell beads is obtained through the rigidity constraint of the center-to-center vector of the dumbbell using its Langevin equation. By directly averaging via the Langevin equation, the evolution of the center-to-center vector, and the configuration tensor are derived. The stress expressions for the dumbbell from the Langevin equation, and the diffusion equation for the orientation distribution function of the center-to-center vector of the dumbbell are also derived, and the final expressions agree with established results from other methods.</description>

      <title>Active Young-Dupr\'e Equation: How Self-organized Currents Stabilize Partial Wetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Young-Dupr\'e equation is a cornerstone of the equilibrium theory of capillary and wetting phenomena. In the biological world, interfacial phenomena are ubiquitous, from the spreading of bacterial colonies to tissue growth and flocking of birds, but the description of such active systems escapes the realm of equilibrium physics. Here we show how a microscopic, mechanical definition of surface tension allows us to build an Active Young-Dupr\'e equation able to account for the partial wetting observed in simulations of active particles interacting via pairwise forces. Remarkably, the equation shows that the corresponding steady interfaces do not result from a simple balance between the surface tensions at play but instead emerge from a complex feedback mechanism. The interfaces are indeed stabilized by a drag force due to the emergence of steady currents, which are themselves a by-product of the symmetry breaking induced by the interfaces. These currents also lead to new physics by selecting the sizes and shapes of adsorbed droplets, breaking the equilibrium scale-free nature of the problem. Finally, we demonstrate a spectacular consequence of the negative value of the liquid-gas surface tensions in systems undergoing motility-induced phase separation: partially-immersed objects are expelled from the liquid phase, in stark contrast with what is observed in passive systems. All in all, our results lay the foundations for a theory of wetting in active systems.</description>

      <title>Borromean Hypergraph Formation in Dense Random Rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a minimal system to study the stochastic formation of Borromean links within topologically entangled networks without requiring the use of knot invariants. Borromean linkages may form in entangled solutions of open polymer chains or in Olympic gel systems such as kinetoplast DNA, but it is challenging to investigate this due to the difficulty of computing three-body link invariants. Here, we investigate randomly oriented rectangles densely packed within a volume, and evaluate them for Hopf linking and Borromean link formation. We show that dense packings of rectangles can form Borromean triplets and larger clusters, and that in high enough density the combination of Hopf and Borromean linking can create a percolating hypergraph through the network. We present data for the percolation threshold of Borromean hypergraphs, and discuss implications for the existence of Borromean connectivity within kinetoplast DNA.</description>

      <title>Activity-driven polymer knotting for macromolecular topology engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macromolecules can gain special properties by adopting knotted conformations, but engineering knotted macromolecules is a challenging task. Here we surprisingly observed that knotting can be very effectively produced in active polymers. When one end of an actively reptative polymer is anchored, it can undergo continual self-knotting as a result of intermittent giant conformation fluctuations and the outward reptative motion. Once a knot is formed, it migrates to the anchored point due to a non-equilibrium ratchet effect. Moreover, when the active polymer is grafted on the end of a passive polymer, it can function as a self-propelling soft needle to either transfer its own knots to the passive polymer or directly braid knots on the passive polymer. We further show that these active needles can create inter-molecular bridging knots between two passive polymers. Our finding highlights the non-equilibrium effects in modifying the dynamic pathways of polymer systems, which have potential applications in macromolecular topology engineering, e.g., manipulating topological states of proteins and nucleic acids, as well as macromolecular braiding.</description>

      <title>Programming evolution of geometry in shape-morphing sheets via spatiotemporal activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape-programmed sheets morph from one surface into another upon activation by stimuli such as illumination, and have attracted much interest for their potential engineering applications, especially in soft robotics. Complex shape changes can be achieved by patterning a simple local active deformation (e.g. isotropic swelling), to generate differential growth. Usually the material itself is designed $\unicode{x2014}$ for example by patterning a molecular director $\unicode{x2014}$ such that a particular shape change occurs upon exposure to a spatially uniform stimulus. A limitation of this paradigm is that typically only one target geometry can be attained as the stimulus is adjusted. Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by patterning the stimulus itself, thereby exercising spatiotemporal control over local deformation magnitudes. Thus a single physical sample can be induced to traverse a continuous family of target geometries, opening the door to precise shape adjustments, new functionalities, and designable non-reciprocal loops in shape space. We illustrate these possibilities with examples including active parabolic reflectors, chiral flow guides, and bending channels. Finding the necessary patterns of activation involves solving families of metric inverse problems; we solve these by reduction to ODEs in an axisymmetric setting, then present a novel numerical scheme to solve them in generality.</description>

      <title>Effects of degumming conditions on the structure of the regenerated silk fibroin and the properties of its film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional degumming method using sodium carbonate solution severely damages the structure of silk fibroin and results in low molecular weight, which limits the properties and applications of silk materials. In this study, we report a modified degumming method and compared it with the traditional one. The results indicate that compared with the traditional degumming method, the modified degumming method produces silk fibroin with higher \b{eta}-sheet content (53.43% vs 46.68%), higher crystallinity (44.92% vs 42.72%), and more concentrated molecular weight (100 ~ 300 kDa vs 72 ~ 300 kDa), while allowing for the same full removal of sericin. Correspondingly, the film of the silk fibroin prepared with the modified degumming method exhibits higher \b{eta}-sheet content (35.22% vs 32.82%), higher crystallinity (26.96% vs 25.53%), and higher tensile strength (87.91 MPa vs 72.62 MPa). This work provides a degumming method superior to the traditional one and lays a foundation for the development of high-performance silk materials.</description>

      <title>Bubbles enable volumetric negative compressibility in metastable elastocapillary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although coveted in applications, few materials expand when subject to compression or contract under decompression, i.e., exhibit the negative compressibility phenomenon. A key step to achieve such counterintuitive behaviour is the destabilisations of (meta)stable equilibria of the constituents. Here, we propose a simple strategy to obtain negative compressibility exploiting capillary forces both to precompress the elastic material and to release such precompression by a threshold phenomenon -- the reversible formation of a bubble in a lyophobic flexible cavity. We demonstrate that the solid part of such metastable elastocapillary systems displays negative compressibility across different scales: hydrophobic microporous materials, proteins, and millimetre-sized laminae. This concept is applicable to fields such as porous materials, biomolecules, sensors and may be easily extended to create unexpected material susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Buckling instability in a chain of sticky bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A slender object undergoing an axial compression will buckle to alleviate the stress. Typically the morphology of the deformed object depends on the bending stiffness for solids, or the viscoelastic properties for liquid threads. We study a chain of uniform sticky air bubbles that rise due to buoyancy through an aqueous bath. A buckling instability of the bubble chain with a characteristic wavelength is observed. If a chain of bubbles is produced faster than it is able to rise, the dominance of viscous drag over buoyancy results in a compressive stress that is alleviated by buckling the bubble chain. Using low Reynolds number hydrodynamics, we predict the critical buckling speed, the terminal speed of a buckled chain, and the geometry of the buckles.</description>

      <title>Advanced iontronic spiking modes with multiscale diffusive dynamics in a fluidic circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluidic iontronics is emerging as a distinctive platform for implementing neuromorphic circuits, characterized by its reliance on the same aqueous medium and ionic signal carriers as the brain. Drawing upon recent theoretical advancements in both iontronic spiking circuits and in dynamic conductance of conical ion channels, which form fluidic memristors, we expand the repertoire of proposed neuronal spiking dynamics in iontronic circuits. Through a modelled circuit containing channels that carry a bipolar surface charge, we extract phasic bursting, mixed-mode spiking, tonic bursting, and threshold variability, all with spike voltages and frequencies within the typical range for mammalian neurons. These features are possible due to the strong dependence of the typical conductance memory retention time on the channel length, enabling timescales varying from individual spikes to bursts of multiple spikes within a single circuit. These advanced forms of neuronal-like spiking support the exploration of aqueous iontronics as an interesting platform for neuromorphic circuits.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation-Driven Hysteretic Adhesion and Repulsion between Opposing Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes are widely used in biomaterials and nanotechnology to regulate surface properties and interactions. Here, we apply the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts hysteretic feature of the normal stress induced by strong ion correlations. In the presence of trivalent ions, the force profile is discontinuous: repulsive in the compression branch and adhesive in the separation branch. The molecular origin of the hysteretic force is the coexistence of two collapsed modes: two separated condensed layer on each surface in the compression and a single bundled condensed layer in the separation. With the systematic inclusion of ion correlations, our theory fully captures the hysteretic force, adhesive separation, ``jump-in'' and ``jump-out'' features, and the ``specific ion effect'', all in good agreement with the reported experimental results.</description>
