      <title>Self-guided Knowledgeable Network of Thoughts: Amplifying Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Knowledgeable Network of Thoughts (kNoT): a prompt scheme that advances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) beyond existing paradigms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree of Thoughts (ToT), and Graph of Thoughts (GoT). The key innovation of kNoT is the LLM Workflow Template (LWT), which allows for an executable plan to be specified by LLMs for LLMs. LWT allows these plans to be arbitrary networks, where single-step LLM operations are nodes, and edges correspond to message passing between these steps. Furthermore, LWT supports selection of individual elements through indexing, facilitating kNoT to produce intricate plans where each LLM operation can be limited to elementary operations, greatly enhancing reliability over extended task sequences. We demonstrate that kNoT significantly outperforms the state of the art on six use cases, while reducing the need for extensive prompt engineering. For instance, kNoT finds 92% accuracy for sorting 32 numbers over 12% and 31% for ToT and GoT, while utilizing up to 84.4% and 87.3% less task-specific prompts, respectively.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multi-Agent DRL Based Dynamic Cluster Reconfiguration for UAV Mobility Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-connectivity involves dynamic cluster formation among distributed access points (APs) and coordinated resource allocation from these APs, highlighting the need for efficient mobility management strategies for users with multi-connectivity. In this paper, we propose a novel mobility management scheme for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that uses dynamic cluster reconfiguration with energy-efficient power allocation in a wireless interference network. Our objective encompasses meeting stringent reliability demands, minimizing joint power consumption, and reducing the frequency of cluster reconfiguration. To achieve these objectives, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (H-MADRL) framework, specifically tailored for dynamic clustering and power allocation. The edge cloud connected with a set of APs through low latency optical back-haul links hosts the high-level agent responsible for the optimal clustering policy, while low-level agents reside in the APs and are responsible for the power allocation policy. To further improve the learning efficiency, we propose a novel action-observation transition-driven learning algorithm that allows the low-level agents to use the action space from the high-level agent as part of the local observation space. This allows the lower-level agents to share partial information about the clustering policy and allocate the power more efficiently. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed distributed algorithm achieves comparable performance to the centralized algorithm. Additionally, it offers better scalability, as the decision time for clustering and power allocation increases by only 10% when doubling the number of APs, compared to a 90% increase observed with the centralized approach.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Attention-Based Adaptive Pressure for Multi-Intersection Traffic Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) system is a critical component of intelligent transportation, with the capability to significantly alleviate urban traffic congestion. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have demonstrated promising performance in achieving ATSC, existing methods find it prone to convergence to local optima. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Attention-Based Adaptive Pressure (BCT-APRL) for multi-intersection signal control. In BCT-APRL, the Critique-Tune (CT) framework, a two-layer Bayesian structure is designed to refine the RL policies. Specifically, the Bayesian inference-based Critique layer provides effective evaluations of the credibility of policies; the Bayesian decision-based Tune layer fine-tunes policies by minimizing the posterior risks when the evaluations are negative. Furthermore, an attention-based Adaptive Pressure (AP) is designed to specify the traffic movement representation as an effective and efficient pressure of vehicle queues in the traffic network. Achieving enhances the reasonableness of RL policies. Extensive experiments conducted with a simulator across a range of intersection layouts show that BCT-APRL is superior to other state-of-the-art methods in seven real-world datasets. Codes are open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Agents Are Not Enough</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the midst of the growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into various aspects of our lives, agents are experiencing a resurgence. These autonomous programs that act on behalf of humans are neither new nor exclusive to the mainstream AI movement. By exploring past incarnations of agents, we can understand what has been done previously, what worked, and more importantly, what did not pan out and why. This understanding lets us to examine what distinguishes the current focus on agents. While generative AI is appealing, this technology alone is insufficient to make new generations of agents more successful. To make the current wave of agents effective and sustainable, we envision an ecosystem that includes not only agents but also Sims, which represent user preferences and behaviors, as well as Assistants, which directly interact with the user and coordinate the execution of user tasks with the help of the agents.</description>

      <title>Neural diversity is key to collective artificial learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many of the world's most pressing issues, such as climate change and global peace, require complex collective problem-solving skills. Recent studies indicate that diversity in individuals' behaviors is key to developing such skills and increasing collective performance. Yet behavioral diversity in collective artificial learning is understudied, with today's machine learning paradigms commonly favoring homogeneous agent strategies over heterogeneous ones, mainly due to computational considerations. In this work, we employ novel diversity measurement and control paradigms to study the impact of behavioral heterogeneity in several facets of collective artificial learning. Through experiments in team play and other cooperative tasks, we show the emergence of unbiased behavioral roles that improve team outcomes; how neural diversity synergizes with morphological diversity; how diverse agents are more effective at finding cooperative solutions in sparse reward settings; and how behaviorally heterogeneous teams learn and retain latent skills to overcome repeated disruptions. Overall, our results indicate that, by controlling diversity, we can obtain non-trivial benefits over homogeneous training paradigms, demonstrating that diversity is a fundamental component of collective artificial learning, an insight thus far overlooked.</description>

      <title>A Multi-AI Agent System for Autonomous Optimization of Agentic AI Solutions via Iterative Refinement and LLM-Driven Feedback Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems use specialized agents to handle tasks within complex workflows, enabling automation and efficiency. However, optimizing these systems often requires labor-intensive, manual adjustments to refine roles, tasks, and interactions. This paper introduces a framework for autonomously optimizing Agentic AI solutions across industries, such as NLP-driven enterprise applications. The system employs agents for Refinement, Execution, Evaluation, Modification, and Documentation, leveraging iterative feedback loops powered by an LLM (Llama 3.2-3B). The framework achieves optimal performance without human input by autonomously generating and testing hypotheses to improve system configurations. This approach enhances scalability and adaptability, offering a robust solution for real-world applications in dynamic environments. Case studies across diverse domains illustrate the transformative impact of this framework, showcasing significant improvements in output quality, relevance, and actionability.

      <description>arXiv:2412.17481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-generative agent systems (MGASs) have become a research hotspot since the rise of large language models (LLMs). However, with the continuous influx of new related works, the existing reviews struggle to capture them comprehensively. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these studies. We first discuss the definition of MGAS, a framework encompassing much of previous work. We provide an overview of the various applications of MGAS in (i) solving complex tasks, (ii) simulating specific scenarios, and (iii) evaluating generative agents. Building on previous studies, we also highlight several challenges and propose future directions for research in this field.</description>

      <title>Observation Interference in Partially Observable Assistance Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study partially observable assistance games (POAGs), a model of the human-AI value alignment problem which allows the human and the AI assistant to have partial observations. Motivated by concerns of AI deception, we study a qualitatively new phenomenon made possible by partial observability: would an AI assistant ever have an incentive to interfere with the human's observations? First, we prove that sometimes an optimal assistant must take observation-interfering actions, even when the human is playing optimally, and even when there are otherwise-equivalent actions available that do not interfere with observations. Though this result seems to contradict the classic theorem from single-agent decision making that the value of perfect information is nonnegative, we resolve this seeming contradiction by developing a notion of interference defined on entire policies. This can be viewed as an extension of the classic result that the value of perfect information is nonnegative into the cooperative multiagent setting. Second, we prove that if the human is simply making decisions based on their immediate outcomes, the assistant might need to interfere with observations as a way to query the human's preferences. We show that this incentive for interference goes away if the human is playing optimally, or if we introduce a communication channel for the human to communicate their preferences to the assistant. Third, we show that if the human acts according to the Boltzmann model of irrationality, this can create an incentive for the assistant to interfere with observations. Finally, we use an experimental model to analyze tradeoffs faced by the AI assistant in practice when considering whether or not to take observation-interfering actions.</description>

      <title>mABC: multi-Agent Blockchain-Inspired Collaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) in Micro-services architecture (MSA) with escalating complexity encounters complex challenges in maintaining system stability and efficiency due to fault propagation and circular dependencies among nodes. Diverse root cause analysis faults require multi-agents with diverse expertise. To mitigate the hallucination problem of large language models (LLMs), we design blockchain-inspired voting to ensure the reliability of the analysis by using a decentralized decision-making process. To avoid non-terminating loops led by common circular dependency in MSA, we objectively limit steps and standardize task processing through Agent Workflow. We propose a pioneering framework, multi-Agent Blockchain-inspired Collaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services architecture (mABC), where multiple agents based on the powerful LLMs follow Agent Workflow and collaborate in blockchain-inspired voting. Specifically, seven specialized agents derived from Agent Workflow each provide valuable insights towards root cause analysis based on their expertise and the intrinsic software knowledge of LLMs collaborating within a decentralized chain. Our experiments on the AIOps challenge dataset and a newly created Train-Ticket dataset demonstrate superior performance in identifying root causes and generating effective resolutions. The ablation study further highlights Agent Workflow, multi-agent, and blockchain-inspired voting is crucial for achieving optimal performance. mABC offers a comprehensive automated root cause analysis and resolution in micro-services architecture and significantly improves the IT Operation domain. The code and dataset are in https://github.com/zwpride/mABC.</description>

      <title>Multi-AUV Cooperative Underwater Multi-Target Tracking Based on Dynamic-Switching-enabled Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) swarms are gradually becoming popular and have been widely promoted in ocean exploration or underwater tracking, etc. In this paper, we propose a multi-AUV cooperative underwater multi-target tracking algorithm especially when the real underwater factors are taken into account. We first give normally modelling approach for the underwater sonar-based detection and the ocean current interference on the target tracking process. Then, based on software-defined networking (SDN), we regard the AUV swarm as a underwater ad-hoc network and propose a hierarchical software-defined multi-AUV reinforcement learning (HSARL) architecture. Based on the proposed HSARL architecture, we propose the "Dynamic-Switching" mechanism, it includes "Dynamic-Switching Attention" and "Dynamic-Switching Resampling" mechanisms which accelerate the HSARL algorithm's convergence speed and effectively prevents it from getting stuck in a local optimum state. Additionally, we introduce the reward reshaping mechanism for further accelerating the convergence speed of the proposed HSARL algorithm in early phase. Finally, based on a proposed AUV classification method, we propose a cooperative tracking algorithm called Dynamic-Switching-Based MARL (DSBM)-driven tracking algorithm. Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed DSBM tracking algorithm can perform precise underwater multi-target tracking, comparing with many of recent research products in terms of various important metrics.</description>

      <title>Bridging Training and Execution via Dynamic Directed Graph-Based Communication in Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems must learn to communicate and understand interactions between agents to achieve cooperative goals in partially observed tasks. However, existing approaches lack a dynamic directed communication mechanism and rely on global states, thus diminishing the role of communication in centralized training. Thus, we propose the Transformer-based graph coarsening network (TGCNet), a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. TGCNet learns the topological structure of a dynamic directed graph to represent the communication policy and integrates graph coarsening networks to approximate the representation of global state during training. It also utilizes the Transformer decoder for feature extraction during execution. Experiments on multiple cooperative MARL benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to popular MARL algorithms. Further ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our dynamic directed graph communication mechanism and graph coarsening networks.</description>

      <title>Incentivized Symbiosis: A Paradigm for Human-Agent Coevolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperation is vital to our survival and progress. Evolutionary game theory offers a lens to understand the structures and incentives that enable cooperation to be a successful strategy. As artificial intelligence agents become integral to human systems, the dynamics of cooperation take on unprecedented significance. Decentralized frameworks like Web3, grounded in transparency, accountability, and trust, offer a foundation for fostering cooperation by establishing enforceable rules and incentives for humans and AI agents. Guided by our Incentivized Symbiosis model, a paradigm aligning human and AI agent goals through bidirectional incentives and mutual adaptation, we investigate mechanisms for embedding cooperation into human-agent coevolution. We conceptualize Incentivized Symbiosis as part of a contemporary moral framework inspired by Web3 principles, encoded in blockchain technology to define and enforce rules, incentives, and consequences for both humans and AI agents. This study explores how these principles could be integrated into the architecture of human-agent interactions within Web3 ecosystems, creating a potential foundation for collaborative innovation. Our study examines potential applications of the Incentivized Symbiosis model, including decentralized finance, governance, and cultural adaptation, to explore how AI agents might coevolve with humans and contribute to shared, sustainable progress.</description>

      <title>From Intention To Implementation: Automating Biomedical Research via LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols averagely outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.</description>

      <title>Loosely Synchronized Rule-Based Planning for Multi-Agent Path Finding with Asynchronous Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) seeks collision-free paths for multiple agents from their respective starting locations to their respective goal locations while minimizing path costs. Although many MAPF algorithms were developed and can handle up to thousands of agents, they usually rely on the assumption that each action of the agent takes a time unit, and the actions of all agents are synchronized in a sense that the actions of agents start at the same discrete time step, which may limit their use in practice. Only a few algorithms were developed to address asynchronous actions, and they all lie on one end of the spectrum, focusing on finding optimal solutions with limited scalability. This paper develops new planners that lie on the other end of the spectrum, trading off solution quality for scalability, by finding an unbounded sub-optimal solution for many agents. Our method leverages both search methods (LSS) in handling asynchronous actions and rule-based planning methods (PIBT) for MAPF. We analyze the properties of our method and test it against several baselines with up to 1000 agents in various maps. Given a runtime limit, our method can handle an order of magnitude more agents than the baselines with about 25% longer makespan.</description>

      <title>MacLight: Multi-scene Aggregation Convolutional Learning for Traffic Signal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning methods have proposed promising traffic signal control policy that can be trained on large road networks. Current SOTA methods model road networks as topological graph structures, incorporate graph attention into deep Q-learning, and merge local and global embeddings to improve policy. However, graph-based methods are difficult to parallelize, resulting in huge time overhead. Moreover, none of the current peer studies have deployed dynamic traffic systems for experiments, which is far from the actual situation.
  In this context, we propose Multi-Scene Aggregation Convolutional Learning for traffic signal control (MacLight), which offers faster training speeds and more stable performance. Our approach consists of two main components. The first is the global representation, where we utilize variational autoencoders to compactly compress and extract the global representation. The second component employs the proximal policy optimization algorithm as the backbone, allowing value evaluation to consider both local features and global embedding representations. This backbone model significantly reduces time overhead and ensures stability in policy updates. We validated our method across multiple traffic scenarios under both static and dynamic traffic systems. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to general and domian SOTA methods, our approach achieves superior stability, optimized convergence levels and the highest time efficiency. The code is under https://github.com/Aegis1863/MacLight.</description>

      <title>Learning to Manipulate under Limited Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By classic results in social choice theory, any reasonable preferential voting method sometimes gives individuals an incentive to report an insincere preference. The extent to which different voting methods are more or less resistant to such strategic manipulation has become a key consideration for comparing voting methods. Here we measure resistance to manipulation by whether neural networks of various sizes can learn to profitably manipulate a given voting method in expectation, given different types of limited information about how other voters will vote. We trained over 100,000 neural networks of 26 sizes to manipulate against 8 different voting methods, under 6 types of limited information, in committee-sized elections with 5-21 voters and 3-6 candidates. We find that some voting methods, such as Borda, are highly manipulable by networks with limited information, while others, such as Instant Runoff, are not, despite being quite profitably manipulated by an ideal manipulator with full information. For the three probability models for elections that we use, the overall least manipulable of the 8 methods we study are Condorcet methods, namely Minimax and Split Cycle.</description>

      <title>Distributed Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the intersection of continual and federated learning, in which independent agents face unique tasks in their environments and incrementally develop and share knowledge. We introduce a mathematical framework capturing the essential aspects of distributed continual learning, including agent model and statistical heterogeneity, continual distribution shift, network topology, and communication constraints. Operating on the thesis that distributed continual learning enhances individual agent performance over single-agent learning, we identify three modes of information exchange: data instances, full model parameters, and modular (partial) model parameters. We develop algorithms for each sharing mode and conduct extensive empirical investigations across various datasets, topology structures, and communication limits. Our findings reveal three key insights: sharing parameters is more efficient than sharing data as tasks become more complex; modular parameter sharing yields the best performance while minimizing communication costs; and combining sharing modes can cumulatively improve performance.</description>

      <title>Reducing Leximin Fairness to Utilitarian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two prominent objectives in social choice are utilitarian - maximizing the sum of agents' utilities, and leximin - maximizing the smallest agent's utility, then the second-smallest, etc. Utilitarianism is typically computationally easier to attain but is generally viewed as less fair. This paper presents a general reduction scheme that, given a utilitarian solver, produces a distribution over states (deterministic outcomes) that is leximin in expectation. Importantly, the scheme is robust in the sense that, given an approximate utilitarian solver, it produces a lottery that is approximately-leximin (in expectation) - with the same approximation factor. We apply our scheme to several social choice problems: stochastic allocations of indivisible goods, giveaway lotteries, and fair lotteries for participatory budgeting.</description>

      <title>Regulator-Manufacturer AI Agents Modeling: Mathematical Feedback-Driven Multi-Agent LLM Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of regulatory updates from global authorities presents significant challenges for medical device manufacturers, necessitating agile strategies to sustain compliance and maintain market access. Concurrently, regulatory bodies must effectively monitor manufacturers' responses and develop strategic surveillance plans. This study employs a multi-agent modeling approach, enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), to simulate regulatory dynamics and examine the adaptive behaviors of key actors, including regulatory bodies, manufacturers, and competitors. These agents operate within a simulated environment governed by regulatory flow theory, capturing the impacts of regulatory changes on compliance decisions, market adaptation, and innovation strategies. Our findings illuminate the influence of regulatory shifts on industry behaviour and identify strategic opportunities for improving regulatory practices, optimizing compliance, and fostering innovation. By leveraging the integration of multi-agent systems and LLMs, this research provides a novel perspective and offers actionable insights for stakeholders navigating the evolving regulatory landscape of the medical device industry.</description>

      <title>Advanced Reasoning and Transformation Engine for Multi-Step Insight Synthesis in Data Analytics with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Advanced Reasoning and Transformation Engine for Multi-Step Insight Synthesis in Data Analytics (ARTEMIS-DA), a novel framework designed to augment Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex, multi-step data analytics tasks. ARTEMIS-DA integrates three core components: the Planner, which dissects complex user queries into structured, sequential instructions encompassing data preprocessing, transformation, predictive modeling, and visualization; the Coder, which dynamically generates and executes Python code to implement these instructions; and the Grapher, which interprets generated visualizations to derive actionable insights. By orchestrating the collaboration between these components, ARTEMIS-DA effectively manages sophisticated analytical workflows involving advanced reasoning, multi-step transformations, and synthesis across diverse data modalities. The framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmarks such as WikiTableQuestions and TabFact, demonstrating its ability to tackle intricate analytical tasks with precision and adaptability. By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with automated code generation and execution and visual analysis, ARTEMIS-DA offers a robust, scalable solution for multi-step insight synthesis, addressing a wide range of challenges in data analytics.</description>

      <title>Understanding Individual Agent Importance in Multi-Agent System via Counterfactual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explaining multi-agent systems (MAS) is urgent as these systems become increasingly prevalent in various applications. Previous work has proveided explanations for the actions or states of agents, yet falls short in understanding the black-boxed agent's importance within a MAS and the overall team strategy. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAI, a novel agent-level explanation approach that evaluates the individual agent's importance. Inspired by counterfactual reasoning, a larger change in reward caused by the randomized action of agent indicates its higher importance. We model it as a MARL problem to capture interactions across agents. Utilizing counterfactual reasoning, EMAI learns the masking agents to identify important agents. Specifically, we define the optimization function to minimize the reward difference before and after action randomization and introduce sparsity constraints to encourage the exploration of more action randomization of agents during training. The experimental results in seven multi-agent tasks demonstratee that EMAI achieves higher fidelity in explanations than baselines and provides more effective guidance in practical applications concerning understanding policies, launching attacks, and patching policies.</description>
