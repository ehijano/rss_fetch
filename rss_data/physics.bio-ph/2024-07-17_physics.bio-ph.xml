      <title>Dissociation of red blood cell aggregates in extensional flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11645v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood rheology and microcirculation are strongly influenced by red blood cell aggregation. We investigate the dissociation rates of red cell aggregates in extensional flow using hyperbolic microfluidic constrictions and image analysis by a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our findings reveal that aggregate dissociation increases sharply when a critical extension rate is reached which falls within the range of microcirculatory conditions, suggesting that large variations of aggregate sizes should be expected in-vivo. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the behavior of red blood cell aggregates in response to extensional stress in microcirculatory networks, provides crucial experimental data to validate theoretical and numerical models, and constitutes the basis for improved evaluation of blood aggregability in clinical contexts.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-driven self-assembly of emerin nanodomains at the nuclear envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerin, a nuclear membrane protein with important biological roles in mechanotransduction and nuclear shape adaptation, self-assembles into nanometer-size domains at the inner nuclear membrane. The size and emerin occupancy of these nanodomains change with applied mechanical stress as well as under emerin mutations associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). Through a combination of theory and experiment we show here that a simple reaction-diffusion model explains the self-assembly of emerin nanodomains. Our model yields quantitative agreement with experimental observations on the size and occupancy of emerin nanodomains for wild-type emerin and EDMD-associated mutations of emerin, with and without applied forces, and allows successful prediction of emerin diffusion coefficients from observations on the overall properties of emerin nanodomains. Our results provide a physical understanding of EDMD-associated defects in emerin organization in terms of changes in key reaction and diffusion properties of emerin and its nuclear binding partners.</description>

      <title>Unzipping of knotted DNA via nanopore translocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA unzipping by nanopore translocation has implications in diverse contexts, from polymer physics to single-molecule manipulation to DNA-enzyme interactions in biological systems. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations and a coarse-grained model of DNA to address the nanopore unzipping of DNA filaments that are knotted. This previously unaddressed problem is motivated by the fact that DNA knots inevitably occur in isolated equilibrated filaments and in vivo. We study how different types of tight knots in the DNA segment just outside the pore impact unzipping at different driving forces. We establish three main results. First, knots do not significantly affect the unzipping process at low forces. However, knotted DNAs unzip more slowly and heterogeneously than unknotted ones at high forces. Finally, we observe that the microscopic origin of the hindrance typically involves two concurrent causes: the topological friction of the DNA chain sliding along its knotted contour and the additional friction originating from the entanglement with the newly unzipped DNA. The results reveal a previously unsuspected complexity of the interplay of DNA topology and unzipping, which should be relevant for interpreting nanopore-based single-molecule unzipping experiments and improving the modeling of DNA transactions in vivo.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical dynamical low-rank algorithm for the stochastic description of large reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic description of chemical reaction networks with the kinetic chemical master equation (CME) is important for studying biological cells, but it suffers from the curse of dimensionality: The amount of data to be stored grows exponentially with the number of chemical species and thus exceeds the capacity of common computational devices for realistic problems. Therefore, time-dependent model order reduction techniques such as the dynamical low-rank approximation are desirable. In this paper we propose a dynamical low-rank algorithm for the kinetic CME using binary tree tensor networks. The dimensionality of the problem is reduced in this approach by hierarchically dividing the reaction network into partitions. Only reactions that cross partitions are subject to an approximation error. We demonstrate by two numerical examples (a 5-dimensional lambda phage model and a 20-dimensional reaction cascade) that the proposed method drastically reduces memory consumption and shows improved computational performance and better accuracy compared to a Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal dynamics of ionic reorganization near biological membrane interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical signals in excitable cells involve spatially localized ionic fluxes through ion channels and pumps on cellular lipid membranes. Common approaches to understand how these localized fluxes spread assume that the membrane and the surrounding electrolyte comprise an equivalent circuit of capacitors and resistors, which ignores the localized nature of transmembrane ion transport, the resulting ionic gradients and electric fields, and their spatiotemporal relaxation. Here, we consider a model of localized ion pumping across a lipid membrane, and use theory and simulation to investigate how the electrochemical signal propagates spatiotemporally in- and out-of-plane along the membrane. The localized pumping generates long-ranged electric fields with three distinct scaling regimes along the membrane: a constant potential near-field region, an intermediate "monopolar" region, and a far-field "dipolar" region. Upon sustained pumping, the monopolar region expands radially in-plane with a steady speed that is enhanced by the dielectric mismatch and the finite thickness of the lipid membrane. For unmyelinated lipid membranes in physiological settings, we find remarkably fast propagation speeds of $\sim\!40 \, \mathrm{m/s}$, allowing faster ionic reorganization compared to bare diffusion. Together, our work shows that transmembrane ionic fluxes induce transient long-ranged electric fields in electrolyte solutions, which may play hitherto unappreciated roles in biological signaling.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics and optimization studies of horse prion protein wild type and its S167D mutant</title>

Abstract: Prion diseases or called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are fatal neurodegenerative diseases characterised by the accumulation of an abnormal prion protein isoform (rich in beta-sheets - about 30% alpha-helix and 43% beta-sheet), which is converted from the normal prion protein (predominant in alpha-helix - about 42% alpha-helix and 3% beta-sheet). However, prion disease has not been reported in horses up to now; therefore, horses are known to be a species resistant to prion diseases. Residue S167 in horse has been cited as critical protective residue for encoding prion protein conformational stability in prion-resistance. According to the protein-only hypothesis, abnormal prion protein is responsible for both spongiform degeneration of the brain and disease transmissibility. Thus, understanding the conformational dynamics of abnormal prion protein from normal prion protein is a key to developing effective therapies. This article is to do molecular dynamics and optimization studies on the horse normal prion protein wild-type and its S167D mutant respectively to understand their conformational dynamics and optimized confirmation; interesting results will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and stability of biomolecules in C-H-O-N fluids at extreme pressure-temperature conditions</title>

Abstract: How life started on Earth is an unsolved mystery. There are various hypotheses for the location ranging from outer space to the seafloor, subseafloor or potentially deeper. Here, we applied extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study chemical reactions between NH$_3$, H$_2$O, H$_2$, and CO at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) approximating the conditions of Earth's upper mantle (i.e. 10-13 GPa, 1000-1400 K). Contrary to the previous assumptions that larger organic molecules might readily disintegrate in aqueous solutions at extreme P-T conditions, we found that many organic compounds formed without any catalysts and persisted in C-H-O-N fluids under these extreme conditions, including glycine, ribose, urea, and uracil-like molecules. Particularly, our free energy calculations showed that the C-N bond is thermodynamically stable at 10 GPa and 1400 K. Moreover, while the pyranose (six-membered-ring) form of ribose is more stable than the furanose (five-membered-ring) form at ambient conditions, we observed the predominant formation of the five-membered-ring form of ribose at extreme conditions, which is consistent with the exclusive incorporation of $\beta$-D-ribofuranose in RNA. We have uncovered a previously unexplored pathway through which the building blocks of biomolecules may have originated in early Earth and other planets. Our findings contribute to an evolving understanding of the fundamental conditions necessary for life to arise.</description>

      <title>Network analysis with quantum dynamics clarifies why photosystem II exploits both chlorophyll a and b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.04848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In green plants, chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b are the predominant pigments bound to light-harvesting proteins. While the individual characteristics of these chlorophylls are well understood, the advantages of their coexistence remain unclear. In this study, we establish a method to simulate excitation energy transfer within the entire photosystem II supercomplex by employing network analysis integrated with quantum dynamic calculations. We then investigate the effects of the coexistence of chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b by comparing various chlorophyll compositions. Our results reveal that the natural chlorophyll composition allows the excited energy to preferentially flow through specific domains that act as safety valves, preventing downstream overflow. Our findings suggest that the light-harvesting proteins in a photosystem II supercomplex achieve evolutionary advantages with the natural chlorophyll-a/b ratio, capturing light energy efficiently and safely across various light intensities. Using our framework, one can better understand how green plants harvest light energy and adapt to changing environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Epithelial Tissues as a Double Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11683v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do cells tune emergent properties at the scale of tissues? One class of such emergent behaviors are rigidity transitions, in which a tissue changes from a solid-like to a fluid-like state or vice versa. Here, we introduce a new way that cells can tune rigidity using "adaptive degrees of freedom." We study rigidity in vertex models, using the elastic energy as a cost function and the cell stiffnesses, target shapes, and target areas as sets of adaptive degrees of freedom that can be introduced to minimize the cost function. We show that the rigidity transition is unaffected when cell stiffnesses are treated as adaptive degrees of freedom. When preferred shapes or areas are treated as adaptive degrees of freedom, however, induced spatial correlations in target cell shapes or areas shift the rigidity transition. These observations suggest that tissues can tune properties at the cell-scale to obtain desired tissue-scale behaviors.</description>

      <title>Effective Single Particle Theory for Active Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a collection of active agents and present an effective single-particle theory to describe the dynamical behaviour of the system in the steady state. Unlike their equilibrium counterparts, active particles display phase separation at much lower packing densities, marked by continuous formation and dissolution of clusters. To model such behavior, we replace the effect of many-particle interactions by a time-dependent local density. Further we propose a unique auto-correlation of the local density with a characteristic correlation time. The correlation time monotonically increases with packing density and unveils a transition at a critical density. In experimental setups, this correlation time is easily quantifiable by monitoring changes in density around a tagged particle. By utilizing this local density and its correlation, we calculate the effective diffusivity of the particles. Finally, we compare the results of the effective single particle theory with numerical simulations and find good agreement between them across a range of packing densities.</description>
