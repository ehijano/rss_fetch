      <title>Unveiling Retention Loss Mechanism in FeFETs with Gate-side Interlayer by Decoupling Trapped Charges and Ferroelectric Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a direct experimental extraction technique for trapped charges and quantitative energy band diagrams in the FeFETs with metal-insulator-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MIFIS) structure, derived from the physical relationship between Vth and gate-side interlayer (G.IL) thickness. By decoupling trapped charges and ferroelectric polarization, we reveal that: (i) The gateinjected charges and channel-injected charges are excessive and maintain consistent ratios to ferroelectric polarization (~170% and ~130%, respectively). (ii) Retention loss originates from the detrapping of gate-injected charges rather than ferroelectric depolarization. (iii) As the G.IL thickens, the gate-injected charge de-trapping path transforms from gate-side to channel-side. To address the retention loss, careful material design, optimization, and bandgap engineering in the MIFIS structure are crucial. This work advances the understanding of high retention strategies for MIFIS-FeFETs in 3D FE NAND.</description>

      <title>Multiscale X-ray computed tomography of standard optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical fiber technologies enable high-speed communication, medical imaging, and advanced sensing. Among the techniques for the characterization of optical fibers, Xray computed tomography has recently emerged as a versatile non-destructive tool for mapping their refractive index variations in 3D. In this study, we present a multiscale characterization of standard optical fibers. We carry out an intercomparison of three tomography setups: classical computed microtomography, X-ray microscopy, and nanotomography. In each method, our analysis highlights the trade-offs between resolution, field of view, and segmentation efficiency. Additionally, we integrate deep learning segmentation thresholding to improve the image analysis process. Thanks to its large field of view, microtomography with classical sources is ideal for the analysis of relatively long fiber spans, where a low spatial resolution is acceptable. The other way around, nanotomography has the highest spatial resolution, but it is limited to very small fiber samples, e.g., fiber tapers and nanofibers, which have diameters of the order of a few microns. Finally, X-ray microscopy provides a good compromise between the sample size fitting the device's field of view and the spatial resolution needed for properly imaging the inner features of the fiber. Specifically, thanks to its practicality in terms of costs and cumbersomeness, we foresee that the latter will provide the most suitable choice for the quality control of fiber drawing in real-time, e.g., using the "One-Minute Tomographies with Fast Acquisition Scanning Technology" developed by Zeiss. In this regard, the combination of X-ray computed tomography and artificial intelligence-driven enhancements is poised to revolutionize fiber characterization, by enabling precise monitoring and adaptive control in fiber manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Integration of Porous Graphene and 3D-printed Piezopolymer for Flexible Ultrasound Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound technology is crucial in diagnostic imaging, making it widely used in medical applications. However, traditional ultrasound transducers face limitations in flexibility and ease of fabrication, leading to the exploration of thin-film and flexible piezoelectric materials. Here, we present a novel approach that combines laser graphitization with 3D printing to integrate flexible laser-induced porous graphene (LIG) with poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE), resulting in the development of flexible LIG/PVDF-TrFE ultrasound patches. The thickness of PVDF-TrFE is adjusted to tune the central frequency of the ultrasound transducer, allowing customization within a range of 10 to 28 MHz. LIG-based ultrasound transducer demonstrates a high signal amplitude of 6.72 V and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 433, along with a -6 dB bandwidth of 8.86 MHz (37%). The LIG-based transducer exhibits higher acoustic performance compared to the smooth silver-based transducer. A high-quality two-dimensional ultrasound image, including a B-mode image of a cyst phantom, demonstrates the transducer's imaging capabilities. The patterning of LIG-based electrodes facilitates the desired sensor configuration, demonstrating the suitability of our novel technique for producing flexible transducer arrays without dicing and cutting. The materials cost of our LIG/PVDF-TrFE transducer is under $5 per unit, making it a low-cost solution for ultrasound patches.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform pneumatic actuation switches macroscopic properties of elastomeric honeycombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Honeycomb microstructures with circular voids are well known to undergo pattern transformations under macroscopic strain loading. Depending on the biaxiality of the applied strain, they deform into three different patterns. Here we demonstrate that the same three patterns can be triggered also by pneumatic actuation of the voids, with resulting patterns depending on an applied pressurization scheme, i.e., the ratio of suction pressures introduced in different voids within the microstructure. Our numerically obtained findings are experimentally validated on two finite size samples made of silicone rubber cast in a 3D printed mold. In numerical studies, we first showcase the evolution of homogenized stiffness and its anisotropy during the genesis of pneumatically-induced patterns. Our loading schemes result in macroscopic stiffness varying by a factor of two with loading direction, chosen by a reversible actuation independent of the load itself. Second, we study the effect of the pneumatic actuation on acoustic properties of the microstructure, finding the proposed method viable to trigger different acoustic bandgaps.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Si into Sb2Se3: Tailoring Optical Phase Change Materials via Nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chalcogenide-based optical phase change materials (OPCMs) exhibit a large contrast in refractive index when reversibly switched between their stable amorphous and crystalline states. OPCMs have rapidly gained attention due to their versatility as nonvolatile amplitude or phase modulators in various photonic devices. However, open challenges remain, such as achieving reliable response and transparency spanning into the visible spectrum, a combination of properties in which current broadband OPCMs (e.g., Ge2Sb2Se4Te1, Sb2Se3, or Sb2S3) fall short. Discovering novel materials or engineering existing ones is, therefore, crucial in extending the application scope of OPCMs. Here, we use magnetron co-sputtering to study the effects of Si doping into Sb2Se3. We employ ellipsometry, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy to investigate the effects of Si doping on the optical properties and crystal structure and compare these results with those from first principles calculations. Moreover, we study the crystallization and melt-quenching of thin films via nano-differential scanning calorimetry (NanoDSC). Our experiments demonstrate that 20% Si doping increases the transparency window in both states, specifically to 800 nm (1.55 eV) in the amorphous phase, while reducing power consumption by lowering the melting temperature. However, this reduction comes at the cost of reducing the refractive index contrast between states and slowing the kinetics of the phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the control of neuronal survival and development using nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD). We highlight the role of N-UNCD in regulating neuronal activity via near-infrared illumination, demonstrating the generation of stable photocurrents that enhance neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth and foster a more active, synchronized neuronal network. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing reveals that diamond substrates improve cellular-substrate interaction by upregulating extracellular matrix and gap junction-related genes. Our findings underscore the potential of conductive diamond as a robust and biocompatible platform for noninvasive and effective neural tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Gap Engineering in Tantalum-Alloy-Based Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing tantalum (Ta) in superconducting circuits has led to significant improvements, such as high qubit lifetimes and quality factors in both qubits and resonators, underscoring the importance of material optimization in quantum device performance. In this work, we explore superconducting gap engineering in Ta-based devices as a strategy to expand the range of viable host materials. By alloying 20 atomic percent hafnium (Hf) into Ta thin films, we achieve a superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of 6.09~K, as measured by DC transport, reflecting an increased superconducting gap. We systematically vary deposition conditions to control film orientation and transport properties of the Ta-Hf alloy films. The enhancement in $T_c$ is further confirmed by microwave measurements at millikelvin temperatures. Despite the 40\% increase in $T_c$ relative to pure Ta, the loss contributions from two-level systems (TLS) and quasiparticles (QPs) remain unchanged in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the potential of material engineering to improve superconducting circuit performance and motivate further exploration of engineered alloys for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Automotive Crash Dynamics Modeling Accelerated with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design, traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.</description>

      <title>Investigating the performance of RPM JTWPAs by optimizing LC-resonator elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant phase-matched Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (RPM JTWPAs) play a key role in quantum computing and quantum information applications due to their low-noise, broadband amplification, and quadrature squeezing capabilities. This research focuses on optimizing RPM JTWPAs through numerical optimization of parametrized resonator elements to maximize gain, bandwidth and quadrature squeezing. Our results show that optimized resonators can increase the maximum gain and squeezing by more than 5 dB in the ideal noiseless case. However, introducing the effects of loss through a lumped-element model reveals that gain saturates with increasing loss, while squeezing modes degrade rapidly, regardless of resonator optimization. These results highlight the potential of resonator design to significantly improve amplifier performance, as well as the challenges posed by current fabrication technologies and inherent losses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a wideband dual-polarized phased array with ultra-wideband scattering cross section (SCS) reduction. The antenna elements are loaded on a bilateral stepped ground. This ground is carefully designed in terms of height difference, step number, and length to achieve phase cancellation near the normal direction. Wideband dipoles with vertical electric coupling are designed. The radiation frequency band covers the X-band (40%) under VSWR &lt; 2.8. Array patterns are synthesized with the two subarrays, covering the scanning range from -45 to +45 degrees. The monostatic SCSs of the proposed 17 x 8 array prototype have been reduced within 3.6 - 30 GHz, with an averaged reduction of over 19.4/18.9 dB and an averaged in-band reduction of over 15.4/16.6 dB, under the normal x/y polarized incident waves respectively.</description>

      <title>All-Dielectric Photo-thermo-optical Metasurfaces for Thermal Landscaping at the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control of temperature fields at the micro- and nanoscale is essential for emerging applications in nanophotonics, catalysis, and microfluidics, yet remains difficult due to the diffusive nature of heat. While inverse-design algorithms have advanced thermoplasmonic metasurfaces, their extension to all-dielectric systems has not been explored. Here, an inverse thermal design framework is introduced for dielectric metasurfaces composed of thermo-optical amorphous silicon (a-Si) nanoresonators. By leveraging a precomputed library of absorption spectra as a function of geometry and temperature, target thermal profiles are directly mapped onto metasurfaces, enabling both uniform and complex temperature shaping. Unlike plasmonic platforms that require multi-resonator unit cells for tunability, dielectric nanoresonators provide intrinsic reconfigurability: at wavelengths where the thermo-optical coefficient is negligible (e.g., ~500 nm), absorption is temperature-invariant, whereas at other wavelengths it becomes strongly temperature-dependent, allowing illumination intensity to reshape the thermal landscape. This multifunctionality permits a single metasurface to yield distinct profiles under different excitation conditions without added structural complexity. As a proof of concept, photothermal catalysis on such metasurfaces is modeled, predicting over 30% enhancement in reaction rates. The presented framework establishes a scalable strategy for engineering nanoscale temperature fields with broad implications for catalysis, thermal management, and photothermal energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Aiming for Proxima Centauri b: Gravitational effects on relativistic spacecraft trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How important are gravitational and relativistic effects for interstellar travel? We consider this question in the context of proposed laser-propelled spacecraft missions to neighboring stellar destinations. Our analysis applies to any spacecraft traveling at relativistic speeds. As a concrete example, we focus on a mission to Proxima Centauri b -- a terrestrial-sized planet in the habitable zone around our nearest stellar neighbor, Proxima Centauri. We employ a Julia reimplementation of the PoMiN code, an N-body code modeling relativistic gravitational dynamics in the first post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation to general relativity (valid to linear order in Newton's constant $G$). We compute the gravitational influence of seven different celestial bodies and find that the Sun has the greatest influence on the trajectory of the interstellar spacecraft. We also study the differences between Newtonian and PM gravity, and find that if mission planners wish to hit Proxima Centauri b with an accuracy of better than about 690,000 kilometers, relativistic effects must be taken into account. To solve for the precise initial data needed to hit an intended target, we develop numerical fine-tuning methods and demonstrate that these methods can (within a given model) be precise to about a femtometer over a travel distance of $\sim4.25$ light years. However, we find that for the spacecraft trajectories we consider, higher order general relativistic effects (beyond the first PM approximation) from the Sun can displace the final position of the spacecraft by tens of kilometers. We also consider the variation in the initial direction of the spacecraft velocity and find that, even with relativistic effects properly taken into account, the miss distances can be dominated by the variation in the initial velocity that could arise from errors during the launch and boost phase of the spacecraft mission.</description>

      <title>On the new and accurate (Goudsmit-Saunderson) model for describing e-/e+ multiple Coulomb scattering (Geant4 Technical Note)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new model, for the accurate simulation of multiple Coulomb scattering (MSC) of e-/e+, has been implemented in Geant4 recently and made available with version Geant4-10.4. The model is based on Goudsmit-Saunderson (GS) angular distributions computed by utilising the screen Rutherford (SR) DCS and follows very closely the formulation developed by Kawrakow [1, 2] and utilised in the EGSnrc toolkit [3]. Corrections, for taking into accountenergy loss [2] neglected by the GS theory, spin-relativistic effects [3] not included in the SR but might be accounted on the basis of Mott DCS as well as the so-called scattering power correction [4], i.e. appropriately incorporating deflections due to sub-threshold delta ray productions, are all included similarly to the EGSnrc model [3]. Furthermore, an accurate electron-step algorithm [5, 6, 2] is utilised for path length correction, i.e. for calculating the post-step position in each condensed history simulation steps such that the corresponding single-scattering longitudinal and lateral (post step point) distributions are very well reproduced. An e-/e+ stepping algorithm, including the simulation step-limit due to the MSC and boundary crossing [2]), free from step-size artefacts, makes the model complete. Details on this new model, including all the above-mentioned components and corrections, are provided in this Geant4 technical note.
  It must be noted, that a Goudsmit-Saunderson model for MSC was available before Geant4-10.4., documented in [7], that has been completely replaced by the model described in this technical note (keeping only the G4GoudsmitSaundersonMscModel name of the C++ class from that previous version)</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Light Coupling Control in Ultrathin Photonic Nanomembranes</title>

Abstract: Atomic-layer and two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as essential building blocks for next-generation quantum and semiconductor technologies, where atomic-scale control over light-matter interactions is critical. However, their inherently small interaction volume poses fundamental challenges for efficient integration into quantum and nanophotonic devices. Addressing this limitation requires the development of photonic platforms that can effectively enhance atomic-scale optical coupling. To this end, freestanding nanomembranes with extreme thinness and minimal radiative loss offer an ideal framework for integrating these materials into photonic systems. Here, we demonstrate an ultrathin photonic nanomembrane enabling atomic-scale control of light coupling. This architecture supports strong field confinement at the surface and significantly enhances light-matter interaction. Through the integration of atomic-layer dielectrics, we achieve {\AA}-level thickness modulation, where each deposition cycle leads to an ultrafine shift of the high-Q resonance. High-resolution spatial mapping further confirms uniform and deterministic resonance tuning across the nanomembrane surface. Furthermore, by integrating a WS2 monolayer with the photonic nanomembrane, strong field localization within the monolayer and a significant emission enhancement are achieved. This approach offers a scalable and versatile route for atomic-scale light coupling, helping to overcome the limitations of conventional photonics and opening opportunities in quantum photonics, optoelectronics, and advanced semiconductor technologies.</description>
