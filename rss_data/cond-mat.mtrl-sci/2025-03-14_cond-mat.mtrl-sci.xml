      <title>The role of effective mass and long-range interactions in the band-gap renormalization of photo-excited semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how to control changes in electronic structure and related dynamical renormalizations by external driving fields is the key for understanding ultrafast spectroscopy and applications in electronics. Here we focus on the band-gap's modulation by external electric fields and uncover the effect of band dispersion on the gap renormalization. We employ the Green's function formalism using the real-time Dyson expansion to account for dynamical correlations induced by photodoping. The many-body formalism captures the dynamics of systems with long-range interactions, carrier mobility, and variable electron and hole effective mass. We also demonstrate that mean-field simulations based on the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, which lacks dynamical correlations, yields a qualitatively incorrect picture of band-gap renormalization. We find the trend that increasing effective mass, thus decreasing mobility, leads to as much as a 6\% enhancement in band-gap renormalization. Further, the renormalization is strongly dependent on the degree of photodoping. As the screening induced by free electrons and holes effectively reduces any long-range and interband interactions for highly excited systems, we show that there is a specific turnover point with minimal band-gap. We further demonstrate that the optical gap renormalization follows the same trend though its magnitude is altered by the Moss-Burstein effect.</description>

      <title>Understanding phonon selection and interference in momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As momentum-resolved Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (q-EELS) becomes more widely used for phonon measurements, better understanding of the intricacies of the acquired signal becomes necessary. Selection rules limit the allowed scattering directions, which may prohibit the appearance of specific phonon branches, and features may appear with no clear explanation. To explore both, we perform frequency-resolved q-EELS simulations via the multislice method and compare results to Spectral Energy Density (SED) and Lattice Dynamics (LD) calculations. We discuss common misconceptions of phonon behavior and characterization generally and in the context of measured or simulated q-EELS signals. We highlight the presence of an ``interferometric Brillouin zone'' (closely related to the Dynamic Structure Factor), resulting from the simultaneous sampling of the lattice across each basis index. We also demonstrate the scattering selection rules on well-studied systems and explore the acquisition of a polarization-selective signal based on this phenomena. Finally, we identify thickness-dependent sensitivity effects, where the upper surface of a film is sampled at a disproportionate level. We show that this can yield sensitivity to through-plane vibrational modes, which may be measured experimentally assuming sufficient sensitivity can be achieved. Our work should serve as a road map to guide momentum-resolved vibrational EELS measurements in the future, particularly as ever-increasing energy and momentum resolution becomes available.</description>

      <title>Integrated Experiment and Simulation Co-Design: A Key Infrastructure for Predictive Mesoscale Materials Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of structural &amp; functional materials for specialized applications is being fueled by rapid advancements in materials synthesis, characterization, manufacturing, with sophisticated computational materials modeling frameworks that span a wide spectrum of length &amp; time scales in the mesoscale between atomistic &amp; continuum approaches. This is leading towards a systems-based design methodology that will replace traditional empirical approaches, embracing the principles of the Materials Genome Initiative. However, several gaps remain in this framework as it relates to advanced structural materials:(1) limited availability &amp; access to high-fidelity experimental &amp; computational datasets, (2) lack of co-design of experiments &amp; simulation aimed at computational model validation,(3) lack of on-demand access to verified and validated codes for simulation and for experimental analyses, &amp; (4) limited opportunities for workforce training and educational outreach. These shortcomings stifle major innovations in structural materials design. This paper describes plans for a community-driven research initiative that addresses current gaps based on best-practice recommendations of leaders in mesoscale modeling, experimentation &amp; cyberinfrastructure obtained at an NSF-sponsored workshop dedicated to this topic. The proposal is to create a hub for Mesoscale Experimentation and Simulation co-Operation (hMESO)-that will (I) provide curation and sharing of models, data, &amp; codes, (II) foster co-design of experiments for model validation with systematic uncertainty quantification, &amp; (III) provide a platform for education &amp; workforce development. It will engage experimental &amp; computational experts in mesoscale mechanics and plasticity, along with mathematicians and computer scientists with expertise in algorithms, data science, machine learning, &amp; large-scale cyberinfrastructure initiatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development and large body of literature on machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can make it difficult to know how to proceed for researchers who are not experts but wish to use these tools. The spirit of this review is to help such researchers by serving as a practical, accessible guide to the state-of-the-art in MLIPs. This review paper covers a broad range of topics related to MLIPs, including (i) central aspects of how and why MLIPs are enablers of many exciting advancements in molecular modeling, (ii) the main underpinnings of different types of MLIPs, including their basic structure and formalism, (iii) the potentially transformative impact of universal MLIPs for both organic and inorganic systems, including an overview of the most recent advances, capabilities, downsides, and potential applications of this nascent class of MLIPs, (iv) a practical guide for estimating and understanding the execution speed of MLIPs, including guidance for users based on hardware availability, type of MLIP used, and prospective simulation size and time, (v) a manual for what MLIP a user should choose for a given application by considering hardware resources, speed requirements, energy and force accuracy requirements, as well as guidance for choosing pre-trained potentials or fitting a new potential from scratch, (vi) discussion around MLIP infrastructure, including sources of training data, pre-trained potentials, and hardware resources for training, (vii) summary of some key limitations of present MLIPs and current approaches to mitigate such limitations, including methods of including long-range interactions, handling magnetic systems, and treatment of excited states, and finally (viii) we finish with some more speculative thoughts on what the future holds for the development and application of MLIPs over the next 3-10+ years.</description>

      <title>Beyond Epitaxy: Ion Implantation as a New Tool for Orbital Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating electronic orbital states in quantum materials provides a powerful means to control their physical properties and technological functionality. Here, we demonstrate that orbital populations in strongly correlated oxide thin films can be continuously and reversibly tuned through post-synthesis He ion implantation. Using LaNiO$_3$ as a model system, we show that the orbital preference can be systematically adjusted from favoring in-plane d$_{x^2-y^2}$ occupation toward out-of-plane d$_{z^2}$ states through precise control of ion fluence. X-ray linear dichroism measurements reveal this orbital reconstruction, while density functional theory calculations show the effect stems from ion implantation induced changes in unit cell tetragonality. Unlike conventional heteroepitaxial approaches that lock in orbital configurations during growth, this strain doping technique enables continuous orbital tuning and selective modification of specific film regions after device fabrication. We demonstrate the practical impact of this control by achieving a seven-fold enhancement in oxygen reduction reaction catalysis that can be reversibly tuned through the implantation process. This work establishes ion implantation as a powerful approach for orbital engineering that complements existing synthesis-based strategies while offering unique advantages for both basic research and device development.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional antiferromagnets with non-relativistic spin splitting switchable by electric polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-split antiferromagnets have significance for antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics due to their momentum dependent spin polarization which can be exploited for the control and detection of the AFM order parameter. Here, we explore the polar-layer stacking of AFM-ordered bilayers driving the emergence of reversable electric polarization and non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) of their band structure. Based on the spin-space group approach, we identify several representative two-dimensional AFM materials which exhibit different types of NRSS when stacked into a polar bilayer. We demonstrate that NRSS can have both altermagnetic and non-altermagnetic origins and elucidate symmetry requirements for NRSS to be switchable by electric polarization. We argue that the electric polarization switching of NRSS in polar AFM bilayers may be more practical for device applications than the current-induced N\'eel vector switching.</description>

      <title>Critical Structural Parameter Determining Magnetic Phases in the Fe2Mo3O8 Altermagnet System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic structural study of the Fe2Mo3O8 system as a function of pressure, temperature, and magnetic field reveals that the P63mc space group of this material remains stable for a broad range of these parameters. No changes are seen in the long-range structure for pressures between 0 and 10 GPa, temperatures between 11 K and 300 K, and magnetic fields up to 9 T. The magnetostructural response (delta c/c) for a magnetic field transverse to the c-axis displacement is determined. The system is found to exhibit strong magnetostructural coupling. The well-known magnetic field-induced first-order transition is found to be isostructural and accessible by fields in the a-b plane. In terms of the c/a ratio, the structures between ambient pressure and 10 GPa are found to map onto the full Zn doping range ((Fe1-yZny)2Mo3O8, for y=0 to y=1) in this system. The results show that the critical sensitive structural parameter for tuning the magnetic properties with pressure, temperature, and pressure is the c-axis length. The results indicate that the magnetic order found in this complex metal oxide system (A2Mo3O8, A=Co, Mn, and Ni) can be tuned cleanly with pressure, making this class of materials an excellent platform for magnetic order switching for films grown of piezoelectric substrates.</description>

      <title>Engineered substrates for domain control in CrSe thin-film growth: Single-domain formation on lattice-matched YSZ(111) substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial thin-film growth is a versatile and powerful technique for achieving a precise control of composition, stabilizing non-equilibrium phases, tailoring growth orientation, as well as forming heterointerfaces of various quantum materials. For synthesis of highly crystalline thin films, in-depth understanding of epitaxial relationship between the desired thin film and the single-crystalline substrates is necessary. In this study, we investigate epitaxial relationship in thin-film growth of triangular-lattice antiferromagnet CrSe on the (001) plane of Al2O3 and the lattice-matched (111) plane of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates. Structural characterization using out-of-plane and in-plane x-ray diffraction shows that the presence of 19.1o-twisted domains of CrSe significantly dominates the aligned domain on the Al2O3 substrate while it reveals a single-domain formation on the YSZ substrate. The stability of the 19.1o-twisted domain rather than the aligned domain can be explained by rotational commensurate epitaxy, which is well reproduced by density functional theory calculations. The single-domain CrSe thin film on the YSZ substrate exhibits a superior metallic conductivity compared to the twisted-domain thin film on the Al2O3 substrate, implying contribution of the grain boundary scattering mechanism to electrical transport.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Correlation Amplification Enables Macroscopic Detection of Atomic-Level Fatigue in Ferromagnetic Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural fatigue failures account for most of catastrophic metal component failures, annually causing thousands of accidents, tens of thousands of casualties, and $100 billion in global economic losses. Current detection methods struggle to identify early-stage fatigue damage characterized by sub-nanometer atomic displacements and localized bond rupture. Here we present a quantum-enhanced monitoring framework leveraging the fundamental symbiosis between metallic bonding forces and magnetic interactions. Through magnetic excitation of quantum spin correlation in metallic structures, we establish a macroscopic quantum spin correlation amplification technology that visualizes fatigue-induced magnetic flux variations corresponding to bond strength degradation. Our multi-scale analysis integrates fatigue life prediction with quantum mechanical parameters (bonding force constants, crystal orbital overlap population) and ferromagnetic element dynamics, achieving unprecedented prediction accuracy (R^2&gt;0.9, p&lt;0.0001). In comprehensive fatigue trials encompassing 193 ferromagnetic metal specimens across 3,700 testing hours, this quantum magnetic signature consistently provided macroscopic fracture warnings prior to failure - a critical advance enabling 100% early detection success. This transformative framework establishes the first operational platform for preemptive fatigue mitigation in critical infrastructure, offering a paradigm shift from post-failure analysis to quantum-enabled predictive maintenance.</description>

      <title>Locating the Atoms at the Hard-soft Interface of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface structure affects the growth, shape and properties of nanoparticles. In wet chemical syntheses, metal additives and surfactants are used to modify surfaces and guide nanocrystal growth. To understand this process, it is critical to understand how the surface structure is modified. However, measuring the type and arrangement of atoms at hard-soft interfaces on nanoscale surfaces, especially in the presence of surfactants, is extremely challenging. Here, we determine the atomic structure of the hard-soft interface in a metallic nanoparticle by developing low-dose imaging conditions in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy that are preferentially sensitive to surface adatoms. By revealing experimentally the copper additives and bromide surfactant counterion at the surface of a gold nanocuboid and quantifying their interatomic distances, our direct, low-dose imaging method provides atomic-level understanding of chemically sophisticated nanomaterial surface structures. These measurements of the atomic structure of the hard-soft interface provide the information necessary to understand and quantify surface chemistries and energies and their pivotal role in nanocrystal growth.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport evidence of a potential low-lying Dirac node in NbAl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NbAl$_3$ is a novel semimetal with a type-II Dirac node ~230 meV above the Fermi energy. We have performed both out-of-plane ($B\parallel c$) and in-plane magnetotransport measurements ($B\perp c$) on single-crystalline NbAl$_3$. In our out-of-plane data, we observe an interesting linear component in the transverse magnetoresistance, and the mobility spectrum analysis of the out-of-plane data reveals an emergence of high-mobility electrons at low temperatures. Near $B\parallel c$, Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are discerned in the magnetoresistance. The oscillation frequencies agree with the density functional theory calculation, the same theory that shows that the Dirac node is far above the Fermi energy. Therefore, the out-of-plane results cannot be attributed to the type-II Dirac node but suggest NbAl$_3$ has additional Dirac or Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy. To support this, we examine the in-plane data obtained with the magnetic field perpendicular to the tilting direction of the type-II Dirac cone. Such field direction excludes the possibility of chiral anomaly from the predicted type-II Dirac node. Remarkably, we observe the planar Hall effect, anisotropic magnetoresistance, and negative longitudinal magnetoresistance. These in-plane results are a strong indication of chiral anomaly unrelated to the previously established type-II Dirac node, pointing to the presence of additional Dirac or Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy. Our new density functional theory calculation reveals a type-I Dirac node ~50 meV below the Fermi energy that has previously been overlooked. We argue that the exotic transport phenomena observed in NbAl$_3$ can be attributed to the newly identified type-I Dirac node.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Framework of Electron-Phonon Coupling for Chiral Phonons with Giant Phonon Magnetic Moments in Magnetic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral phonons, characterized by nonzero angular momenta and magnetic moments, have attracted extensive attention. However, this field remains severely limited due to the inability to accurately account for electron-phonon-coupling (EPC) effects for chiral phonons. Here, we resolve this challenge through developing an ab initio framework for computing EPC-driven phonon magnetic properties, applicable to all insulating and metallic materials. Our theory predicts a dramatic enhancement of phonon magnetic moments exceeding classical predictions by multiple orders, accompanied by distinct Zeeman splitting. Interestingly, these splittings induce observable topological gaps in phonon spectra of magnets, generating intrinsic phonon Chern states. Through first-principles calculations, we identify five topological phonon magnets with intrinsic phonon Chern states and also propose to detect low-energy neutral particles such as dark matters. This research not only establishes a computational framework for investigating EPC-driven phonon magnetic properties, but also provides a material design strategy for realizing topological phonon states in quantum magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-Mediated Hybridization of Wannier-Mott and Frenkel Excitons in a Monolayer WS2 -- J-Aggregate Hybrid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tunable plasmonic platform that allows room temperature hybridization of dissimilar excitons, namely of Wannier-Mott excitons in monolayer (1L) WS2 and Frenkel excitons in molecular J-aggregates via simultaneous strong coupling to surface plasmon polaritons. It is based on a simple layered design consisting of a thin planar silver film and a dielectric spacer on which monolayer and the aggregates are assembled. Strong coupling is revealed by angle-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements in total internal reflection geometry by the observation of double Rabi splitting at the two excitonic resonances. We analyze the exciton-exciton-plasmon system with the coupled oscillator model and demonstrate modulation of polariton character and dynamics by the number of molecules participating in the coupling. Furthermore, we propose a route to remotely control the mode splitting at the Frenkel excitonic resonance via electrostatic gating of the 1L-WS2 and to switch the molecule-plasmon interaction between the weak and strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Prediction of two-dimensional ferromagnetic VO$_2$ layers in the hexagonal and tetragonal phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetism in the two-dimensional materials is of great significance and has become an emerging topic. The ferromagnetic VS$_2$ and VSe$_2$ monolayers have been experimentally synthesized, and O element belongs to the same group as S and Se elements. Thus, whether there exists the ferromagnetic VO$_2$ monolayer is a necessary and urgent question. Using first-principles methods within the framework of density functional theory, we predict two kinds of VO$_2$ monolayers with the hexagonal and tetragonal phases and investigate their structural stability, electronic and magnetic properties, and ferromagnetic phase transition. The computational results demonstrate that the two two-dimensional structural phases are stable and possess the ferromagnetic ground states, and they are half-metal with large energy gap. In addition, by solving the Heisenberg model with the Monte Carlo simulation methods, the ferromagnetic phase transition at 270 K in the hexagonal phase is determined. These findings not only predict a new type of intrinsic half-metallic ferromagnet with a high Curie temperature but also fill in an important gap that are lacking in the series of studies from VO$_2$, VS$_2$, VSe$_2$, to VTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Topotactic Reduction-Driven Crystal Field Excitations in Brownmillerite Manganite Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topotactic reduction of perovskite oxides offers a powerful approach for discovering novel phenomena, such as superconducting infinite-layer nickelates and polar metallicity, and is commonly accompanied by the emergence of multiple valence states and/or complex crystal fields of transition metals. However, understanding the complex interplay between crystal chemistry, electronic structure, and physical properties at the spin- and orbital-resolved levels in these reduced systems remains elusive. Here, we combine x-ray absorption spectroscopy, resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), and density functional theory calculations to uncover topotactic metal-insulator transition and orbital-specific crystal field excitations in brownmillerite La0.67Ca0.33MnO2.5 thin films. We reveal the Mn valence states to be predominantly Mn2+/Mn3+, along with their corresponding populations at octahedral and tetrahedral sites, which effectively weaken the Mn-O hybridization compared to the parent perovskite phase. As a result, La0.67Ca0.33MnO2.5 films exhibit an antiferromagnetic insulating ground state. Moreover, by combining the RIXS measurements on selected single-valence manganites, specifically MnO, LaMnO3, and CaMnO3, with orbital- and spin-resolved density-of-states calculations, we identify the dd excitations of octahedrally and tetrahedrally coordinated Mn2+/Mn3+ ions, directly linking the microscopic electronic structure to the macroscopic magnetic/electrical properties.</description>

      <title>Use of frit-disc crucible sets to make solution growth more quantitative and versatile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent availability of step-edge, frit-disc crucible sets (generally sold as Canfield Crucible Sets or CCS) has led to multiple innovations associated with our group's use of solution growth. Use of CCS allows for the clean separation of liquid from solid phases during the growth process. This clean separation enables the reuse of the decanted liquid, either allowing for simple, economic, savings associated with recycling expensive precursor elements or allowing for the fractionation of a growth into multiple, small steps, revealing the progression of multiple solidifications. Clean separation of liquid from solid phases also allows for the determination of the liquidus line (or surface) and the creation, or correction, of composition-temperature phase diagrams. The reuse of clean decanted liquid has also allowed us to prepare liquids ideally suited for the growth of large single crystals of specific phases by tuning the composition of the melt to the optimal composition for growth of the desired phase, often with reduced nucleation sites. Finally, we discuss how solution growth and CCS use can be harnessed to provide a plethora of composition-temperature data points defining liquidus lines or surfaces with differing degrees of precision to either test or anchor artificial intelligence and/or machine learning based attempts to augment and extend the limited experimentally determined data base.</description>

      <title>Reexamining Circular Dichroism in Photoemission From a Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of electron states is an essential ingredient for topological and quantum geometric quantities in solids. For example, Dirac surface states with helical spin- and orbital-angular momenta are a hallmark of a 3D topological insulator. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with variable circular light polarization, known as circular dichroism (CD), has been assumed to be a direct probe of OAM and, by proxy, of the Berry curvature of electronic bands in energy- and momentum-space. Indeed, topological surface states have been shown to exhibit angle-dependent CD (CDAD), and more broadly, CD is often interpreted as evidence of spin-orbit coupling. Meanwhile, it is well-established that CD originates from the photoemission matrix elements, which can have extrinsic contributions related to the experimental geometry and the inherently broken inversion symmetry at the sample surface. Therefore, it is important to broadly examine CD-ARPES to determine the scenarios in which it provides a robust probe of intrinsic material physics. We performed CD-ARPES on the canonical topological insulator $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Se}_3$ over a wide range of incident photon energies. Not only do we observe angle-dependent CD in the surface states, as expected, but we also find CD of a similar magnitude in virtually all bulk bands. Since OAM is forbidden by inversion symmetry in the bulk, we conclude this originates from symmetry-breaking in the photoemission process. Comparison with theoretical calculations supports this view and suggests that $\textit{hidden}$ OAM - localized to atomic sites within each unit cell - contributes significantly. Additional effects, including inter-atomic interference and final-state resonances, are responsible for the rapid variation of the CDAD signal with photon energy.</description>

      <title>Emerging orthorhombic two-dimensional van der Waals magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism realized in van der Waals (vdW) materials has expanded to include a great variety of magnetic phases, over a short decade since its first discovery in 2016-2017. However, most of the investigated vdW magnets so far have highly symmetric crystal fields and isotropic in-plane lattice structures, making their 2D magnetism robust but often classical and expected. In this Perspective, we highlight a family of vdW magnets that have distorted crystal fields with low symmetries and orthorhombic crystal lattices with strong anisotropy, and furthermore, show their prospects for realizing a much richer landscape of magnetic phases and phase transitions. First, we introduce the classification of 2D vdW magnets based on their crystal fields and make a contrast between the orthorhombic vdW magnets of focus here and other popular honeycomb/hexagonal/kagome vdW magnets. We then discuss the material candidates, the emergent properties, and the designed controls for these orthorhombic 2D vdW magnets, using the representative CrSBr as an example and extending beyond it. Finally, we discuss a few existing challenges in orthorhombic 2D vdW magnets, overcome which would pave the way towards magneto-optical, opto-magnetic, and spintronic devices based on orthorhombic 2D vdW magnetism.</description>

      <title>Imaging Ultrafast Dynamical Diffraction wavefronts of femtosecond laser-induced lattice distortions inside crystalline semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material processing with femtosecond lasers has attracted enormous attention because of its potential for technology and industry applications. In parallel, time-resolved x-ray diffraction has been successfully used to study ultrafast structural distortion dynamics in semiconductor thin films. Gracing incident x-ray geometry has been also used to look to distortion dynamics, but this technique is only sensitive to the surface of bulk materials with a limited temporal resolution. However, 'real-world' processing applications deal mostly with bulk materials, which prevent the use of such techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon single-pulse excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of the temporal evolution of ultrafast distortion depth profiles. Our measurements were obtained in a thin crystalline Si wafer upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation revealing that even below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions appear on ps time scales due to the formation and propagation of high-amplitude strain waves into the bulk.</description>

      <title>Siamese Foundation Models for Crystal Structure Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), which aims to generate stable crystal structures from compositions, represents a critical pathway for discovering novel materials. While structure prediction tasks in other domains, such as proteins, have seen remarkable progress, CSP remains a relatively underexplored area due to the more complex geometries inherent in crystal structures. In this paper, we propose Siamese foundation models specifically designed to address CSP. Our pretrain-finetune framework, named DAO, comprises two complementary foundation models: DAO-G for structure generation and DAO-P for energy prediction. Experiments on CSP benchmarks (MP-20 and MPTS-52) demonstrate that our DAO-G significantly surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all metrics. Extensive ablation studies further confirm that DAO-G excels in generating diverse polymorphic structures, and the dataset relaxation and energy guidance provided by DAO-P are essential for enhancing DAO-G's performance. When applied to three real-world superconductors ($\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, $ \text{Zr}_{16}\text{Rh}_8\text{O}_4$ and $\text{Zr}_{16}\text{Pd}_8\text{O}_4$) that are known to be challenging to analyze, our foundation models achieve accurate critical temperature predictions and structure generations. For instance, on $\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, DAO-G generates a structure close to the experimental one with an RMSE of 0.0085; DAO-P predicts the $T_c$ value with high accuracy (2.26 K vs. the ground-truth value of 2.30 K). In contrast, conventional DFT calculators like Quantum Espresso only successfully derive the structure of the first superconductor within an acceptable time, while the RMSE is nearly 8 times larger, and the computation speed is more than 1000 times slower. These compelling results collectively highlight the potential of our approach for advancing materials science research and development.</description>

      <title>Double-Crucible Vertical Bridgman Technique for Stoichiometry-Controlled Chalcogenide Crystal Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise stoichiometry control in single-crystal growth is essential for both technological applications and fundamental research. However, conventional growth methods often face challenges such as non-stoichiometry, compositional gradients, and phase impurities, particularly in non-congruent melting systems. Even in congruent melting systems like Bi2Se3, deviations from the ideal stoichiometric composition can lead to significant property degradation, such as excessive bulk conductivity, which limits its topological applications. In this study, we introduce the double-crucible vertical Bridgman (DCVB) method, a novel approach that enhances stoichiometry control through the combined use of continuous source material feeding, traveling-solvent growth, and liquid encapsulation, which suppresses volatile element loss under high pressure. Using Bi2Se3 as a model system, we demonstrate that crystals grown via DCVB exhibit enhanced stoichiometric control, significantly reducing defect density and achieving much lower carrier concentrations compared to those produced by conventional Bridgman techniques. Moreover, the continuous feeding of source material enables the growth of large crystals. This approach presents a promising strategy for synthesizing high-quality, large-scale crystals, particularly for metal chalcogenides and pnictides that exhibit challenging non-congruent melting behaviors.</description>

      <title>On the Automation of High Throughput Modeling of Adsorption In Porous Zeolytic Imidazolate Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) have emerged as a promising candidate for catalysis, carbon-dioxide (CO$_{2}$) capture and storage as well as flue gas separation due to their tunable porosity and chemical stability. ZIFs consists of transition metals in a tetrahedral coordination with imidazolate linkers, allowing for structural modifications that can enhance CO$_{2}$ adsorption and storage. To systematically design and optimize ZIFs for superior CO$_{2}$ capture performance, theoretical modelling provides an effective approach, though hindered by the sheer size of the search space, with hundred to thousands of possible sites per ZIF, and thousands of possible ZIF that can be synthesized. In this work, we employ a high-throughput techniques underpinned by first-principle Density Functional Theory (DFT) to develop a systematic automated method for characterizing adsorption energetics in ZIFs, guiding the rational design and selection of desirable ZIF structures. Using high-throughput computing tools, we perform pore and pore size analysis, and implement automated CO$_{2}$ molecule placement algorithm, accounting for positional symmetry, crystallographic orientation, and collision detection. The results obtained are in good agreement with previous studies, demonstrating the reliability of the approach in accelerating the discovery of next-generation ZIFs for CO$_{2}$ capture and storage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a multiscale approach to magnetoelectric effects, bridging atomistic and continuum models, with all parameters determined from ab initio electronic structure calculations. We show that the parameters of the model are equivalent to the electric field-induced Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interactions. After careful validation, we apply the models to study electric polarization and dipole moments carried by spin spirals and topological solitons, in the form of magnetic domain walls and Skyrmions, in the prototypical 2D magnet CrI$_3$. We show that the reduced symmetry of the material leads to additional magnetoelectric coupling terms, dominating over those expected in high symmetry (cubic) materials. An interesting consequence is that Skyrmions carry an out-of-plane electric dipole moment, while that of anti-Skyrmions is an order of magnitude larger and in-plane. Finally, we discuss the possibility to stabilize non-collinear spin states using electric fields.</description>

      <title>Simulating charging characteristics of lithium iron phosphate by electro-ionic optimization on a quantum annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of quantum computing hardware opens up new avenues in the simulation of energy materials. Today's quantum annealers are able to tackle complex combinatorial optimization problems. A formidable challenge of this type is posed by materials with site-occupational disorder for which atomic arrangements with a low, or lowest, energy must be found. In this article, a method is presented for the identification of the correlated ground-state distribution of both lithium ions and redox electrons in lithium iron phosphate (LFP), a widely employed cathode material in lithium-ion batteries. The point-charge Coulomb energy model employed correctly reproduces the LFP charging characteristics. As is shown, grand-canonical transformation of the energy cost function makes the combinatorial distribution problem solvable on quantum annealing (QA) hardware. The QA output statistics follow a pseudo-thermal behavior characterized by a problem-dependent effective sampling temperature, which has bearings on the estimated scaling of the QA performance with system size. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum computation for the joint optimization of electronic and ionic degrees of freedom in energy materials.</description>

      <title>Rouse Mode Analysis of Chain Relaxation in Reversibly Crosslinked Polymer Melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer melts with chains undergoing reversible crosslinking have distinctively favorable dynamic properties, e.g., self healing and reprocessability. In these situations there are two relevant elementary time scales: the segmental and the sticker association times. A convenient framework to model these situations is the sticky Rouse model and here we perform hybrid moleculear dynamics (MD) Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to examine its relevance. In agreement with the underpinning idea discussed above we find that reversibly crosslinked chains show two distinct modes of relaxation behavior depending on the magnitude of bond lifetimes. For bond lifetimes shorter than the chain end-to-end relaxation time, the polymers exhibit essentially Rouse like dynamics, but with an apparently increased local friction relative to the non-sticky analog. For longer bond lifetimes, the chains exhibit two modes of relaxation: the faster mode is independent of bond lifetime, but the slower mode is controlled by it. However, these slower mode results are not consistent with the predictions of the sticky Rouse model. Our Rouse mode analysis as a function of chain length, N, imply that this is likely a result of the relatively short chain length employed, but they nevertheless suggest that theories need to include these small chain effects if they are to be relevant to experimental systems with short chains following Rouse dynamics.</description>

      <title>A general formalism for machine-learning models based on multipolar-spherical harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formulation of descriptors of the local chemical environment, enabling the construction of machine-learning models, is usually obtained by studying the properties of the expansion coefficients of a neighborhood density. In this work, we show that all the transformation properties of the descriptors and their behaviour under rotation, inversion and complex conjugation, are derived from the choice of the basis over which the density is expanded. Furthermore, crucially they are independent from the explicit mathematical form of the neighborhood density. In particular, we show that all the descriptors investigated, can be obtained by an expansion in multipolar spherical harmonics, which constitutes the core of this work, and which is introduced and analysed in great detail. By exploiting the orthogonality and the transformation rules of the multipolar spherical harmonics, we show that several formulations are simplified, such as the one needed to obtain the $\lambda-$SOAP kernel and its properties. We close this work by applying our framework to several multi-body descriptors available in literature, providing an in-depth analysis of their main properties, as made clear from the vantage viewpoint of a basis-centered approach.</description>

      <title>Magnetism in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory, we show that the recently observed ferromagnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ [Nat. Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Kagome Origin of the Strange Metallicity in Ni$_3$In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong correlations promote singular properties such as strange metallicity, which shows considerable commonality across quantum materials platforms. Understanding the mechanism for such emerging universality is an outstanding challenge, given that the underlying degrees of freedom can be complex and varied. Progress may be made in flat band systems, especially kagome and other frustrated-lattice metals with active flat bands. These systems show strange metal behavior that bears a striking resemblance to what happens in heavy-fermion metals. Here, in scanning tunneling spectroscopy of kagome metal Ni$_3$In, we find a zero-bias peak-dip structure whose variation with magnetic field and temperature tracks the evolution of the strange metal properties. We identify the origin of the peak as compact molecular orbitals formed by destructive interference over the kagome sites, resulting in emergent $f$-shell-like localized moments. Using quasi-particle interference, we visualize their interaction with the Dirac light bands. We thus unveil the essential microscopic ingredients of the $d$-electron-based kagome metals that, while distinct from the atomic orbitals of the $f$-electron-based heavy fermion materials, are responsible for a shared phenomenology between the two types of systems. Our findings provide a new window to uncover and interconnect the essential and yet diverse microscopic building blocks in disparate families of quantum materials that drive a convergence towards a universal understanding in the regime of amplified quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Peierls substitution for Wannier obstructions: response to disorder and interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between quantum geometry, interactions, and external fields in complex band systems. When Wannier obstructions preclude a description based solely on atomic-like orbitals,this complicates the prediction of electromagnetic responses particularly in the presence of disorder and interactions. In this work, we introduce a generalized Peierls substitution framework based on Lagrange multipliers to enforce the constraints of the Wannier obstruction in the band of interest. Thus we obtain effective descriptions of interactions and disorder in the presence of non-trivial quantum geometry of that band. We apply our approach to examples including the diamagnetic response in flat-band superconductors and delocalization effects in flat-band metals caused by interactions and disorder.</description>

      <title>Crystal field splittings and magnetic ground state of the Jeff = 1/2 square lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the crystal field level splitting and magnetic ground state of the Jeff = 1/2 square lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 using powder inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and neutron diffraction measurements. Both compounds exhibit a well-isolated $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet ground state under a tetragonal crystal field environment, confirming a robust Jeff = 1/2 picture with slight XY-type anisotropic character in the g-tensor. Notably, the ground state wave functions closely resemble the $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet expected in the perfect cubic limit, consistent with the nearly cubic ligand configuration of eight O2- ions surrounding Yb3+. Below TN =0.21 K, YbBi2IO4 exhibits a stripe long-range magnetic order characterized by an ordering wave vector qm = (1/2, 0, 0) or its symmetry-equivalent (0, 1/2, 0), with magnetic moments aligned along qm. The ordered moment is approximately 79 % of the classical prediction, significantly larger than expected from the isotropic J1-J2 model, suggesting the possible involvement of exchange anisotropy in explaining this observation. We show that symmetry-allowed XXZ and bond-dependent anisotropic exchange terms in a square lattice can play a critical role in stabilizing the stripe order and suppressing the moment reduction as observed. These findings establish YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 as unique platforms for exploring rich Jeff = 1/2 magnetism from two less investigated perspectives: (i) on a square lattice and (ii) within a (nearly) cubic ligand environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A particular failure mode of highly porous brittle materials consists in the propagation of cracks under uniaxial compressive loads. Such 'anticracks' have been observed in a range of materials, from snow and porous sandstone to brittle foams. Here we present a computational model for the formation and propagation of anticrack-type failure in porous materials within the general computational framework of bond-based peridynamics. Random porosity is represented, on a scale well above the characteristic pore size, by random bond deletion (dilution disorder). We apply our framework to experimental data on anticrack propagation in silicate foams.</description>

      <title>Polarization-controlled strong light-matter interaction with templated molecular aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate strong light-matter interaction for a layer of templated merocyanine molecules in a planar microcavity. Using a single layer of graphene nanoribbons as a templating layer, we obtain an aligned layer of aggregated molecules. The molecular layer displays anisotropic optical properties resembling those of a biaxial crystal. The anisotropic excitonic component in the cavity results in strongly polarization-dependent light-matter interaction and in increased Rabi-energies. The increased light-matter interaction is possibly due to reduced molecular disorder in the templated molecular layer. This conclusion is supported by an analysis based on a multi-oscillator model. We further use photoluminescence microspectroscopy to demonstrate that the light-matter coupling is spatially homogeneous. Our study introduces molecular templating to strong light-matter studies. The reduced disorder of the system as a consequence of templating is highly beneficial for engineering light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Dielectrocapillarity for exquisite control of fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially varying electric fields are prevalent throughout nature and technology, arising from heterogeneity inherent to all physical systems. Inhomogeneous electric fields can originate naturally, such as in nanoporous materials and biological membranes, or be engineered, e.g., with patterned electrodes or layered van der Waals heterostructures. While uniform fields cause free ions to migrate, for polar fluids they simply act to reorient the constituent molecules. In contrast, electric field gradients (EFGs) induce a dielectrophoretic force, offering exquisite electrokinetic control of a fluid, even in the absence of free charge carriers. EFGs, therefore, offer vast potential for optimizing fluid behavior under confinement, such as in nanoporous electrodes, nanofluidic devices, and chemical separation materials. Yet, EFGs remain largely unexplored at the microscopic level owing to the absence of a rigorous, first principles theoretical treatment of electrostrictive effects. By integrating state-of-the-art advances in liquid state theory and deep learning, we reveal how EFGs modulate fluid structure and capillary phenomena. We demonstrate, from first principles, that dielectrophoretic coupling enables tunable control over the liquid-gas phase transition, capillary condensation, and fluid uptake into porous media. Our findings establish "dielectrocapillarity'' -- the use of EFGs to control confined fluids -- as a powerful tool for controlling volumetric capacity in nanopores, which holds immense potential for optimizing energy storage in supercapacitors, selective gas separation, and tunable hysteresis in neuromorphic nanofluidic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric (TE) materials can directly convert heat into electrical energy. However, they sustain costly production procedures and batch-to-batch performance variations. Therefore, developing scalable synthetic techniques for large-scale and reproducible quality TE materials is critical for advancing TE technology. This study developed a facile, high throughput, solution-chemical synthetic technique. Microwave-assisted thermolysis process, providing energy-efficient volumetric heating, was used for the synthesis of bismuth and antimony telluride (Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3). As-made materials were characterized using various techniques, including XRPD, SEM, TEM, XAS, and XPS. Detailed investigation of the local atomic structure of the synthesized Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 powder samples was conducted through synchrotron radiation XAS experiments. The sintered TE materials exhibited low thermal conductivity, achieving the highest TE figure-of-merit values of 0.7 (573 K) and 0.9 (523 K) for n-type Bi2Te3 and p-type Sb2Te3, respectively, shifted significantly to the high-temperature region when compared to earlier reports, highlighting their potential for power generation applications. The scalable, energyand time-efficient synthetic method developed, along with the demonstration of its potential for TE materials, opens the door for a wider application of these materials with minimal environmental impact.</description>

      <title>Flexoelectricity and surface ferroelectricity of water ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00323v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase diagram of ice is complex and contains many phases, but the most common (frozen water at ambient pressure, also known as Ih ice) is a non-polar material despite individual water molecules being polar1,2. Consequently, ice is not piezoelectric and cannot generate electricity under pressure3. On the other hand, the coupling between polarization and strain gradient (flexoelectricity) is universal4, so ice may in theory generate electricity under bending. Here we report the experimental demonstration that ice is flexoelectric, finding a coefficient of 1.14+-0.13 nC/m, comparable to that of ceramics such as SrTiO3, TiO2, or PbZrO3. Additionally, and unexpectedly, the sensitivity of flexoelectric measurements to surface boundary conditions has also revealed a ferroelectric phase transition around ~160K confined in the near-surface region of the ice slabs. The electromechanical properties of ice may find applications for low-cost transducers made in-situ in cold and remote locations. Importantly, there are also consequences for natural phenomena. In particular, we have calculated the flexoelectric charge density generated in ice-graupel collisions, and found it to be comparable to the experimental charge transferred in such events, suggesting a possible participation of ice flexoelectricity in the charging up of thunderstorms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous experiments in compensated magnets have demonstrated a potential for approaching the limit of fastest and least-dissipative operation of digital memory bits. However, the analog route has been virtually unexplored at (sub)ps time scales. In this paper, we report on experimental separation of heat-related and quench-switching-related resistance signal dynamics induced at room temperature by a single femtosecond-laser-pulse in memory devices made from a metallic antiferromagnetic CuMnAs. We show that the heat-related dynamics, on picosecond to hundreds of nanoseconds time scales, can be used as a short-term memory where information about input stimuli, represented by laser-pulses, is stored temporarily. When the quench-switching threshold is reached, information is transferred to the device's variable resistance, serving as a long-term memory, with time components of 10 ms and 10 s. The potentially appealing features of the heat-based memory for several distinct research fields, including bio-inspired analogue devices and heat-based logic, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Origin of $A$-type antiferromagnetism and chiral split magnons in altermagnetic $\alpha$-MnTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the $A$-type antiferromagnetic ordering, characterized by ferromagnetic layers coupling antiferromagnetically, in the prototype semiconductor altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe has been a topic of ongoing debate. Experimentally, $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits an in-plane ferromagnetic exchange interaction, whereas previous \emph{ab initio} calculations predicted an antiferromagnetic interaction. In this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by considering an expanded set of magnetic configurations, which reveals a ferromagnetic in-plane exchange interaction in agreement with experimental findings. Additionally, we demonstrate that the 10th nearest-neighbor exchange interaction is directionally dependent, inducing a nonrelativistic chiral splitting in the magnon bands, as recently observed experimentally. We further show that applying a compressive strain may significantly enhance both nonrelativistic spin and chiral magnon splittings. The strain can also change the sign of the in-plane exchange interaction. Computing magnetic susceptibility, we show that strain enhances the N{\'e}el temperature, significantly. Our results highlight the critical importance of convergence in the number of magnetic configurations for spin interactions in antiferromagnetic materials.</description>

Abstract: Twistronics has received much attention as a new method to manipulate the properties of 2D van der Waals structures by introducing moir\'e patterns through a relative rotation between two layers. Here we begin a theoretical exploration of twistronics beyond the realm of van der Waals materials by developing a first-principles description of the electronic structure and interlayer interactions of ultrathin perovskite bilayers. We construct both an ab initio tight-binding model as well as a minimal 3-band effective model for the valence bands of monolayers and bilayers of oxides derived from the Ruddlesden-Popper phase of perovskites, which is amenable to thin-layer formation. We illustrate the approach with the specific example of Sr$_2$TiO$_4$ layers but also provide model parameters for Ca$_2$TiO$_4$ and Ba$_2$TiO$_4$ .</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Massless Excitons and Linear Exciton Dispersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitons -- elementary excitations formed by bound electron-hole pairs -- govern the optical properties and excited-state dynamics of materials. In two-dimensions (2D), excitons are theoretically predicted to have a linear energy-momentum relation with a non-analytic discontinuity in the long wavelength limit, mimicking the dispersion of a photon. This results in an exciton that behaves like a massless particle, despite the fact that it is a composite boson composed of massive constituents. However, experimental observation of massless excitons has remained elusive. In this work, we unambiguously experimentally observe the predicted linear exciton dispersion in freestanding monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The experimental result is in excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction based on ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Additionally, we identify the lowest dipole-allowed transition in monolayer hBN to be at 6.6 eV, illuminating a long-standing debate about the band gap of monolayer hBN. These findings provide critical insights into 2D excitonic physics and open new avenues for exciton-mediated superconductivity, Bose-Einstein condensation, and high-efficiency optoelectronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Based on first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the polymerisation of the unsaturated cis dinitrogen-difluoride (cis-N2F2) molecular compound is investigated. The thermodynamic, dynamical and thermal stabilities of the nitrogen fluorine NF system are investigated at conditions of 0-3000 K and 0-200 GPa. The cis-N2F2 molecule is a suitable precursor to obtain one-dimensional polymerized nitrogen-fluorine (poly-NF) chains at a pressure above 90 GPa and at a temperature around 1900 K. Importantly, these poly-NF chains can be quenched to room conditions, and potentially serve as a High-energy-density materials (HEDM). It has been established that when Al is utilised as a reducing agent, poly-NF chains exhibit a gravimetric energy density of 13.55 kJ/g, which exceeds that of cubic gauche nitrogen (cg-N, 9.70 kJ/g). This is attributable to the presence of both polymerised nitrogen and strong oxidising F atoms.</description>

      <title>Materials Map Integrating Experimental and Computational Data through Graph-Based Machine Learning for Enhanced Materials Discovery</title>

Abstract: Materials informatics (MI), which emerges from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to greatly streamline the material discovery and development. The data used for MI are obtained from both computational and experimental studies, while their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that captures trends hidden in the experimental datasets to compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained data to construct materials maps, which visualize the relation in the structural features of materials, aiming to support study by the experimental researchers. The map is constructed using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements the graph-based representation of material structures, deep learning, and dimensional reduction for the map construction. We evaluate the obtained materials maps through statistical analysis and found that the MDL using message passing neural network (MPNN) enables efficient extraction of features that reflect the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we found that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in predicting material properties. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-entropy oxide (HEO) thermodynamics transcend temperature-centric approaches, spanning a multidimensional landscape where oxygen chemical potential plays a decisive role. Here, we experimentally demonstrate how controlling the oxygen chemical potential coerces multivalent cations into divalent states in rock salt HEOs. We construct a preferred valence phase diagram based on thermodynamic stability and equilibrium analysis, alongside a high throughput enthalpic stability map derived from atomistic calculations leveraging machine learning interatomic potentials. We identify and synthesize seven equimolar single-phase rock salt compositions that accommodate multivalent Mn, Fe, or both, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and fluorescence. X-ray absorption fine structure spectra reveal predominantly divalent cations. Ultimately, we introduce oxygen chemical potential overlap as a key complementary descriptor predicting HEO stability and synthesizability. Although we focus on rock salt HEOs, our methods are chemically and structurally agnostic, providing a broadly adaptable framework for navigating HEOs thermodynamics and enabling a broader compositional range with contemporary property interest.</description>

      <title>Large circular photogalvanic effect in non-centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal CeAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the Weyl semimetal CeAlSi with simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries has opened up new avenues for research into the interaction between light and topologically protected bands. In this work, we present a comprehensive examination of shift current and injection current responsible for the circular photogalvanic effect in CeAlSi using first-principles calculations. Our investigation identifies a significant injection current of 4 mA/V$^2$ over a broad range in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, exceeding previously reported findings. In addition, we explored several externally controllable parameters to further enhance the photocurrent. A substantial boost in the injection current is observed when applying uniaxial strain along the $c$-axis of the crystal - a 5% strain results in a remarkable 64% increment. The exceptional photocurrent response in CeAlSi suggests that magnetic non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals may provide promising opportunities for novel photogalvanic applications.</description>

      <title>Cascade of pressure induced competing CDWs in the kagome metal FeGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic ordering is prevalent in correlated systems, which commonly exhibit competing interactions. Here, we use x-ray diffraction to demonstrate a cascade of pressure induced order-disorder transformations, with propagation vectors $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CDW}$= $\left(\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ \frac{1}{2}\right)$, $\mathbf{q}^*$=$\left(\frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{2}\right)$ and $\mathbf{q}^\dagger$=$\left(\frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\right)$, in the kagome metal FeGe. In the pressure interval between 4$&lt;p&lt;$10 GPa, $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CDW}$ and $\mathbf{q}^*$ coexist and the spatial extent of the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ order is nearly long-range at $\sim$15 GPa, $\sim$30 unit cells. Above $\sim$25 GPa, the periodic lattice distortion has a propagation wavevector of $\mathbf{q}^\dagger$=$\left(\frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\right)$ at room temperature. The cascade of phase transitions are captured by the Ising model of frustrated triangular lattices and modeled by Monte Carlo simulations based on the dimerization of trigonal Ge$_1$. The pressure dependence of the integrated intensities and correlation lengths of $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CDW}$, $\mathbf{q}^*$ and $\mathbf{q}^\dagger$ demonstrate a competition between the 2$\times$2 and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ phases prove the tunability of order-disorder phase transitions under pressure and the rich landscape of metastable/fragile phases of FeGe.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure, spin-orbit interaction and electron-phonon coupling of triangular adatom lattices on semiconductor substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A one-third monolayer of the heavy metals Sn and Pb deposited on semiconductor substrates can lead to a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ surface reconstruction, constituting an exciting triangular lattice material platform. A long history of experiments identified charge-ordered and magnetic ground states. These discoveries were accompanied by a decades-long debate of whether electron correlations or other effects involving phonons are the driving force of the symmetry-broken states. The most recent discovery of superconductivity in boron-doped Sn/Si(111) with a $T_c$ between 5K and 9K led to a renewed excitement. Here we revisit the electronic and phononic properties of Sn and Pb adatom triangular lattices on Si(111) and SiC(0001). For all materials we compute relativistic bandstructures using DFT+$U$ where $U$ is only applied to the substrate atoms in order to adjust the band gap to match the experimental value; as a consequence, some of the resulting tight-binding parameters of the metallic surface band differ substantially compared to previous studies. Remarkably, for Pb/SiC(0001) we predict Rashba spin-orbit coupling as large as 45% of the nearest-neighbor hopping energy. In addition, we compute the phonon spectra and electron-phonon coupling constants for all materials, and for Pb/Si(111) even relativistically although the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling has surprisingly little effect on the electron-phonon coupling constant. We conclude that the resulting couplings are too weak to account for electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in any of these materials.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Path Planning for the Design of Compositional Gradients in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional gradients have recently experienced an explosion in activity due to advances in manufacturing, where compositions can now be spatially varied on-the-fly during fabrication. In addition, modern computational thermodynamics has reached sufficient maturity -- with respect to property databases and the availability of commercial software -- that gradients can be designed with specific sets of properties. Despite these successes, there are practical limitations on the calculation speeds of these thermodynamic tools that make it intractable to model every element in an alloy. As a result, most path planning is carried out via surrogate models on simplified systems (e.g., approximating Inconel 718 as Ni$_{59}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$ instead of Ni$_{53}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$Nb$_{3}$Mo$_{2}$Ti$_{1}$). In this work, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome using a combination of on-the-fly sampling and a conjectured corollary of the lever rule for transformations of isothermal paths in arbitrary compositional dimensions. We quantitatively benchmark the effectiveness of this new method and find that it can be as much as 106 times more efficient than surrogate modeling.</description>

      <title>The underappreciated role of nonspecific interactions in the crystallization of DNA-coated colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the field of programmable self-assembly has seen an explosion in the diversity of crystal lattices that can be synthesized from DNA-coated colloidal nanometer- and micrometer-scale particles. The prevailing wisdom has been that a particular crystal structure can be targeted by designing the DNA-mediated interactions, to enforce binding between specific particle pairs, and the particle diameters, to control the packing of the various species. In this article, we show that other ubiquitous nonspecific interactions can play equally important roles in determining the relative stability of different crystal polymorphs and therefore what crystal structure is most likely to form in an experiment. For a binary mixture of same-sized DNA-coated colloidal micrometer-scale particles, we show how changing the magnitudes of nonspecific steric and van der Waals interactions gives rise to a family of binary body-centered tetragonal crystals, including both cesium-chloride and copper-gold crystals. Simulations using pair potentials that account for these interactions reproduce our experimental observations quantitatively, and a theoretical model reveals how a subtle balance between specific and nonspecific forces determines the equilibrium crystal structure. These results highlight the importance of accounting for nonspecific interactions in the crystal-engineering design process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a numerical study of graphene heterostructures comprised of three individual layers twisted by either the magic angle of $\sim$1.1$^\circ$, or $\sim$$30^\circ$, corresponding to the graphene quasicrystal. The heterostack is modeled using realistic structural and tight-binding models, while transport properties are calculated in both clean and disordered systems containing up to $\sim$8 million atoms. The weak interaction between different layers allows us to scrutinize the electronic mixing of flat bands and quasicrystalline states, which are altered differently in the low- and high-energy regimes and provide a new type of hybrid physics to be explored.</description>

      <title>A low-background setup for in-situ X-ray total scattering combined with fast scanning calorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a setup combining fast scanning calorimetry with X-ray total scattering at a synchrotron beamline, allowing for \emph{in-situ} characterizations of the nano-scale structure of samples during and after temperature scans. The setup features a portable vacuum chamber giving high signal-to-background ratio even on amorphous samples, which enables the observation of detailed structural changes between different sample states. We show three use cases, including one which leverages the high cooling rate of 10$^4$\,K/s achievable by this setup. Our demonstration opens the door to various applications in materials science where it is important to understand the interplay between structure and thermodynamics.</description>
