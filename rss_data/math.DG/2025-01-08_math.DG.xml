      <title>Fibrations Over Singular K3 Surfaces and New Solutions to the Hull-Strominger System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using fibrations over K3 orbisurfaces we construct new smooth solutions to the Hull-Strominger system. In particular, we prove that, for $4 \leq k \leq 22$ and $5 \leq r\leq 22$, the smooth manifolds $S^1\times \sharp_k(S^2\times S^3)$ and $\sharp_r (S^2 \times S^4) \sharp_{r+1} (S^3 \times S^3)$, have a complex structure with trivial canonical bundle and admit a solution to the Hull-Strominger system.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Hessian quotient equations on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Hessian quotient equations in Riemannian setting related to a problem posed by Delano\"e and Urbas. We prove unobstructed second order a priori estimate for the real Hessian quotient equation via the maximum principle argument on Riemannian manifolds in dimension two. This is achieved by introducing new test function and exploiting some fine concavity properties of quotient operator. This result demonstrates that there is intriguing difference between the real case and the complex case, as there are known obstructions for $J$-equation in complex geometry.</description>

      <title>Para-Holomorphic Algebroids and Para-Complex Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop the theory of Courant algebroids with integrable para-Hermitian vector bundle structures by invoking the theory of Lie bialgebroids. We consider the case where the underlying manifold has an almost para-complex structure, and use this to define a notion of para-holomorphic algebroid. We investigate connections on para-holomorphic algebroids and determine an appropriate sense in which they can be para-complex. Finally, we show through a series of examples how the theory of exact para-holomorphic algebroids with a para-complex connection is a generalization of both para-K\"{a}hler geometry and the theory of Poisson-Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Prescribed Chern scalar curvature flow on compact Hermitian manifolds with negative Gauduchon degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified flow approach to prescribed Chern scalar curvature problem on compact Hermitian manifolds with negative Gauduchon degree. When the conformal class of its Hermitian metric contains a balanced metric, we give some sufficient conditions on the candidate curvature function $f$ which guaranties the convergence of the flow to a conformal Hermitian metric whose Chern scalar curvature is $f$.</description>

      <title>Darboux theorem for generalized complex structures on transitive Courant algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let E be a transitive Courant algebroid with scalar product of neutral signature. A generalized almost complex structure \mathcal J on E is a skew-symmetric smooth field of endomorphisms of E which squares to minus the identity. We say that \mathcal J is integrable (or is a generalized complex structure) if the space of sections of its (1,0) bundle is closed under the Dorfman bracket of E. In this paper we determine, under certain natural conditions, the local form of \mathcal J around regular points. This result is analogous to Gualtieri's Darboux theorem for generalized complex structures on manifolds and extends Wang's description of skew-symmetric left-invariant complex structures on compact semisimple Lie groups.</description>

      <title>On mixed curvature for Hermitian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider {\em mixed curvature} $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha,\beta}$ for Hermitian manifolds, which is a convex combination of the first Chern Ricci curvature and holomorphic sectional curvature introduced by Chu-Lee-Tam \cite{CLT}. We prove that if a compact Hermitian surface with constant mixed curvature $c$, then the Hermitian metric must be K\"{a}hler unless $c=0$ and $2\alpha+\beta=0$, which extends a previous result by Apostolov-Davidov-Mu\v{s}karov. For the higher-dimensional case, we also partially classify compact locally conformal K\"{a}hler manifolds with constant mixed curvature. Lastly, we prove that if $\beta\geq0, \alpha(n+1)+2\beta&gt;0$, then a compact Hermitian manifold with semi-positive but not identically zero mixed curvature has Kodaira dimension $-\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a torsion-free $G_2$ 7-manifold or a Calabi-Yau 6-manifold. We prove Hodge decomposition theorems for the $dd^\phi$ operators, introduced by Harvey and Lawson, which generalize the $i\partial\bar\partial$ operator used in classical pluripotential theory. We then obtain analogues of the $\partial\bar\partial$ lemma in this context. We formalize this by defining cohomology spaces analogous to Bott-Chern cohomology and we relate them to harmonic forms on $M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H^n(\mathbb R)$ denote the real hyperbolic space realized as the symmetric space $Spin_0(1,n)/Spin(n)$. In this paper, we provide a characterization for the image of the Poisson transform for $L^2$-sections of the spinor bundle over the boundary ${\partial H}^n(\mathbb R)$. As a consequence, we obtain an $L^2$ uniform estimate for the generalized spectral projections associated to the spinor bundle over $H^n(\mathbb R)$, thereby extending Strichartz's conjecture from the scalar case to the spinor setting.</description>

Specifically, we focus on cases where the principal eigenfunction $u$ is assumed to be log-concave and our primary goal is to obtain quantitative estimates for the Hessian of $\log u$.</description>

      <title>On Classifying HyperK\"ahler Kummer 8-Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HyperK\"ahler spaces, including manifolds, orbifolds and conical singularities play an important role in superstring/$M$-theory and gauge theories as well as in differential and algebraic geometry. In this paper we provide hundreds of new examples of compact hyperK\"ahler orbifolds of Kummer type $T^8/G$, where $T^8$ is the maximal torus of the compact Lie group $E_8$ and $G$ a finite group of isometries whose holonomies form a subgroup of the Weyl group of $E_8$. We show that, out of all of these examples, the only orbifolds whose singularities have a known holomorphic symplectic resolution lead to manifolds diffeomorphic to the two currently known examples of compact hyperK\"ahler 8-manifolds. We also demonstrate that these methods can, when combined with theorems of Joyce, be extended to construct potentially new manifolds of $\operatorname{SU}(4)$- and $\operatorname{Spin}(7)$- holonomy. All of these examples give rise to new vacua of string/$M$-theory in two/three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Shape Taylor expansion for wave scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Taylor expansion of wave fields with respect to shape parameters has a wide range of applications in wave scattering problems, including inverse scattering, optimal design, and uncertainty quantification. However, deriving the high order shape derivatives required for this expansion poses significant challenges with conventional methods. This paper addresses these difficulties by introducing elegant recurrence formulas for computing high order shape derivatives. The derivation employs tools from exterior differential forms, Lie derivatives, and material derivatives. The work establishes a unified framework for computing the high order shape perturbations in scattering problems. In particular, the recurrence formulas are applicable to both acoustic and electromagnetic scattering models under a variety of boundary conditions, including Dirichlet, Neumann, impedance, and transmission types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the unit tangent bundle of noncompact finite volume negatively curved Riemannian manifolds, we prove the equidistribution towards the measure of maximal entropy for the geodesic flow of the Lebesgue measure along the divergent geodesic flow orbits, as their complexity tends to infinity. We prove the analogous result for geometrically finite tree quotients, where the equidistribution takes place in the quotient space of geodesic lines towards the Bowen-Margulis measure.</description>

      <title>Transverse expansion of the metric at null hypersurfaces II. Existence results and application to Killing horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper finishes the series of two papers that we started with [arXiv:2405.05377], where we analyzed the transverse expansion of the metric at a general null hypersurface. While [arXiv:2405.05377] focused on uniqueness results, here we show existence of ambient manifolds given the full asymptotic expansion at the null hypersurface. When such expansion fulfills a set of "constraint equations" we prove that the ambient manifold solves the Einstein equations to infinite order at the hypersurface. Our approach does not make any assumptions regarding the dimension or topology of the null hypersurface and is entirely covariant. Furthermore, when the hypersurface exhibits a product topology we find the minimum amount of data on a cross-section that ensures the existence of an ambient space solving the Einstein equations to infinite order on the hypersurface. As an application we recall the notion of abstract Killing horizon data (AKH) introduced in [arXiv:2405.05377], namely the minimal data needed to define a non-degenerate Killing horizon from a detached viewpoint, and we prove that every AKH of arbitrary dimension and topology gives rise to an ambient space solving the {\Lambda}-vacuum equations to infinite order and with the given data as Killing horizon. Our result also includes the possibility of the Killing vector having zeroes at the horizon.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Arnold's $J^+$-invariant for pairs of immersions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.04349v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the $J^{2+}$-invariant for oriented pairs of generic immersions. This invariant behaves like Arnold's $J^+$-invariant for generic immersions as it is invariant when going through inverse tangencies and triple points, but changes when traversing direct tangencies. It has several useful properties, for example its independence of the $J^+$-invariants of the single immersions forming the pair. Also it is invariant under simultaneous orientation change. Therefore, one can define two $J^{2+}$-invariants for each pair depending on its orientation, those two invariants are not independent from each other. Furthermore the invariant is extended to the $J^{n+}$-invariant for links of n oriented immersions.</description>

Abstract: Half Lie groups exist only in infinite dimensions: They are smooth manifolds and topological groups such that right translations are smooth, but left translations are merely required to be continuous. The main examples are groups of $H^s$ or $C^k$ diffeomorphisms and semidirect products of a Lie group with kernel an infinite dimensional representation space. Here, we investigate mainly Banach half-Lie groups, the groups of their $C^k$-elements, extensions, and right invariant strong Riemannian metrics on them: surprisingly the full Hopf--Rinow theorem holds, which is not the case in general even for Hilbert manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We define and construct a conformally invariant energy for closed smoothly immersed submanifolds of even dimension, but of arbitrary codimension, in conformally flat Riemannian manifolds. This is a higher dimensional analogue of the Willmore energy for immersed surfaces and is given directly via a coupling of the tractor connection to the (submanifold critical) GJMS operators. In the case where the submanifold is of dimension 4 we compare this to other energies, including one found using a second simple construction that uses $Q$-operators.</description>

Abstract: This article provides the first extension of Lagrangian Intersection Floer cohomology to Poisson structures which are almost everywhere symplectic, but degenerate on a lowerdimensional submanifold. The main result of the article is the definition of Lagrangian intersection Floer cohomology, referred to as log Floer cohomology, for orientable surfaces equipped with log symplectic structures. We show that this cohomology is invariant under suitable isotopies and that it is isomorphic to the log de Rham cohomology when computed for a single Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Intersection of transverse foliations in 3-manifolds: Hausdorff leafspace implies leafwise quasi-geodesic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ be transverse two dimensional foliations with Gromov hyperbolic leaves in a closed 3-manifold $M$ whose fundamental group is not solvable, and let $\mathcal{G}$ be the one dimensional foliation obtained by intersection. We show that $\mathcal{G}$ is \emph{leafwise quasigeodesic} in $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ if and only if the foliation $\mathcal{G}_L$ induced by $\mathcal{G}$ in the universal cover $L$ of any leaf of $\mathcal{F}_1$ or $\mathcal{F}_2$ has Hausdorff leaf space. We end up with a discussion on the hypothesis of Gromov hyperbolicity of the leaves.</description>

Abstract: We study the degeneration of hyperbolic surfaces along a ray given by the harmonic map parametrization of Teichm\"uller space. The direction of the ray is determined by a holomorphic quadratic differential on a punctured Riemann surface, which has poles of order $\geq 2$ at each puncture. We show that the rescaled distance functions of the universal covers of hyperbolic surfaces uniformly converge, on a certain non-compact region containing a fundamental domain, to the intersection number with the vertical measured foliation given by the holomorphic quadratic differential determining the direction of the ray. This implies that hyperbolic surfaces along the ray converge to the dual $\mathbb{R}$-tree of the vertical measured foliation in the sense of Gromov-Hausdorff. As an application, we determine the limit of the hyperbolic surfaces in the Thurston boundary.</description>
