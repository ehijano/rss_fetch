      <title>Proportional infinite-width infinite-depth limit for deep linear neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distributional properties of linear neural networks with random parameters in the context of large networks, where the number of layers diverges in proportion to the number of neurons per layer. Prior works have shown that in the infinite-width regime, where the number of neurons per layer grows to infinity while the depth remains fixed, neural networks converge to a Gaussian process, known as the Neural Network Gaussian Process. However, this Gaussian limit sacrifices descriptive power, as it lacks the ability to learn dependent features and produce output correlations that reflect observed labels. Motivated by these limitations, we explore the joint proportional limit in which both depth and width diverge but maintain a constant ratio, yielding a non-Gaussian distribution that retains correlations between outputs. Our contribution extends previous works by rigorously characterizing, for linear activation functions, the limiting distribution as a nontrivial mixture of Gaussians.</description>

      <title>Trans-Glasso: A Transfer Learning Approach to Precision Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision matrix estimation is essential in various fields, yet it is challenging when samples for the target study are limited. Transfer learning can enhance estimation accuracy by leveraging data from related source studies. We propose Trans-Glasso, a two-step transfer learning method for precision matrix estimation. First, we obtain initial estimators using a multi-task learning objective that captures shared and unique features across studies. Then, we refine these estimators through differential network estimation to adjust for structural differences between the target and source precision matrices. Under the assumption that most entries of the target precision matrix are shared with source matrices, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds and show that Trans-Glasso achieves minimax optimality under certain conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate Trans Glasso's superior performance compared to baseline methods, particularly in small-sample settings. We further validate Trans-Glasso in applications to gene networks across brain tissues and protein networks for various cancer subtypes, showcasing its effectiveness in biological contexts. Additionally, we derive the minimax optimal rate for differential network estimation, representing the first such guarantee in this area.</description>

      <title>DP-CDA: An Algorithm for Enhanced Privacy Preservation in Dataset Synthesis Through Randomized Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the growth of data across various sectors, including healthcare, security, finance, and education, has created significant opportunities for analysis and informed decision-making. However, these datasets often contain sensitive and personal information, which raises serious privacy concerns. Protecting individual privacy is crucial, yet many existing machine learning and data publishing algorithms struggle with high-dimensional data, facing challenges related to computational efficiency and privacy preservation. To address these challenges, we introduce an effective data publishing algorithm \emph{DP-CDA}. Our proposed algorithm generates synthetic datasets by randomly mixing data in a class-specific manner, and inducing carefully-tuned randomness to ensure formal privacy guarantees. Our comprehensive privacy accounting shows that DP-CDA provides a stronger privacy guarantee compared to existing methods, allowing for better utility while maintaining strict level of privacy. To evaluate the effectiveness of DP-CDA, we examine the accuracy of predictive models trained on the synthetic data, which serves as a measure of dataset utility. Importantly, we identify an optimal order of mixing that balances privacy guarantee with predictive accuracy. Our results indicate that synthetic datasets produced using the DP-CDA can achieve superior utility compared to those generated by traditional data publishing algorithms, even when subject to the same privacy requirements.</description>

      <title>Effective Non-Random Extreme Learning Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a growing statistical technique widely applied to regression problems. In essence, ELMs are single-layer neural networks where the hidden layer weights are randomly sampled from a specific distribution, while the output layer weights are learned from the data. Two of the key challenges with this approach are the architecture design, specifically determining the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer, and the method's sensitivity to the random initialization of hidden layer weights.
  This paper introduces a new and enhanced learning algorithm for regression tasks, the Effective Non-Random ELM (ENR-ELM), which simplifies the architecture design and eliminates the need for random hidden layer weight selection. The proposed method incorporates concepts from signal processing, such as basis functions and projections, into the ELM framework. We introduce two versions of the ENR-ELM: the approximated ENR-ELM and the incremental ENR-ELM. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method overcomes the problems of traditional ELM while maintaining comparable predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient pooling of predictions via kernel embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic predictions are probability distributions over the set of possible outcomes. Such predictions quantify the uncertainty in the outcome, making them essential for effective decision making. By combining multiple predictions, the information sources used to generate the predictions are pooled, often resulting in a more informative forecast. Probabilistic predictions are typically combined by linearly pooling the individual predictive distributions; this encompasses several ensemble learning techniques, for example. The weights assigned to each prediction can be estimated based on their past performance, allowing more accurate predictions to receive a higher weight. This can be achieved by finding the weights that optimise a proper scoring rule over some training data. By embedding predictions into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), we illustrate that estimating the linear pool weights that optimise kernel-based scoring rules is a convex quadratic optimisation problem. This permits an efficient implementation of the linear pool when optimally combining predictions on arbitrary outcome domains. This result also holds for other combination strategies, and we additionally study a flexible generalisation of the linear pool that overcomes some of its theoretical limitations, whilst allowing an efficient implementation within the RKHS framework. These approaches are compared in an application to operational wind speed forecasts, where this generalisation is found to offer substantial improvements upon the traditional linear pool.</description>

      <title>Alpha Entropy Search for New Information-based Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) methods based on information theory have obtained state-of-the-art results in several tasks. These techniques heavily rely on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to compute the acquisition function. In this work, we introduce a novel information-based class of acquisition functions for BO called Alpha Entropy Search (AES). AES is based on the {\alpha}-divergence, that generalizes the KL divergence. Iteratively, AES selects the next evaluation point as the one whose associated target value has the highest level of the dependency with respect to the location and associated value of the global maximum of the optimization problem. Dependency is measured in terms of the {\alpha}-divergence, as an alternative to the KL divergence. Intuitively, this favors the evaluation of the objective function at the most informative points about the global maximum. The {\alpha}-divergence has a free parameter {\alpha}, which determines the behavior of the divergence, trading-off evaluating differences between distributions at a single mode, and evaluating differences globally. Therefore, different values of {\alpha} result in different acquisition functions. AES acquisition lacks a closed-form expression. However, we propose an efficient and accurate approximation using a truncated Gaussian distribution. In practice, the value of {\alpha} can be chosen by the practitioner, but here we suggest to use a combination of acquisition functions obtained by simultaneously considering a range of values of {\alpha}. We provide an implementation of AES in BOTorch and we evaluate its performance in both synthetic, benchmark and real-world experiments involving the tuning of the hyper-parameters of a deep neural network. These experiments show that the performance of AES is competitive with respect to other information-based acquisition functions such as JES, MES or PES.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical kernel machines have historically faced significant challenges in scaling to large datasets and model sizes--a key ingredient that has driven the success of neural networks. In this paper, we present a new methodology for building kernel machines that can scale efficiently with both data size and model size. Our algorithm introduces delayed projections to Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD) allowing the training of much larger models than was previously feasible, pushing the practical limits of kernel-based learning. We validate our algorithm, EigenPro4, across multiple datasets, demonstrating drastic training speed up over the existing methods while maintaining comparable or better classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Priors for Boundary Value Problems of Linear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental task in computational science, traditionally addressed by numerical solvers. Recent advancements have introduced neural operators and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to tackle PDEs, achieving reduced computational costs at the expense of solution quality and accuracy. Gaussian processes (GPs) have also been applied to linear PDEs, with the advantage of always yielding precise solutions. In this work, we propose Boundary Ehrenpreis-Palamodov Gaussian Processes (B-EPGPs), a novel framework for constructing GP priors that satisfy both general systems of linear PDEs with constant coefficients and linear boundary conditions. We explicitly construct GP priors for representative PDE systems with practical boundary conditions. Formal proofs of correctness are provided and empirical results demonstrating significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art neural operator approaches.</description>

      <title>CatNet: Effective FDR Control in LSTM with Gaussian Mirrors and SHAP Feature Importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CatNet, an algorithm that effectively controls False Discovery Rate (FDR) and selects significant features in LSTM with the Gaussian Mirror (GM) method. To evaluate the feature importance of LSTM in time series, we introduce a vector of the derivative of the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to measure feature importance. We also propose a new kernel-based dependence measure to avoid multicollinearity in the GM algorithm, to make a robust feature selection with controlled FDR. We use simulated data to evaluate CatNet's performance in both linear models and LSTM models with different link functions. The algorithm effectively controls the FDR while maintaining a high statistical power in all cases. We also evaluate the algorithm's performance in different low-dimensional and high-dimensional cases, demonstrating its robustness in various input dimensions. To evaluate CatNet's performance in real world applications, we construct a multi-factor investment portfolio to forecast the prices of S\&amp;P 500 index components. The results demonstrate that our model achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional LSTM models without feature selection and FDR control. Additionally, CatNet effectively captures common market-driving features, which helps informed decision-making in financial markets by enhancing the interpretability of predictions. Our study integrates of the Gaussian Mirror algorithm with LSTM models for the first time, and introduces SHAP values as a new feature importance metric for FDR control methods, marking a significant advancement in feature selection and error control for neural networks.</description>

      <title>Random Forest-Supervised Manifold Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manifold alignment is a type of data fusion technique that creates a shared low-dimensional representation of data collected from multiple domains, enabling cross-domain learning and improved performance in downstream tasks. This paper presents an approach to manifold alignment using random forests as a foundation for semi-supervised alignment algorithms, leveraging the model's inherent strengths. We focus on enhancing two recently developed alignment graph-based by integrating class labels through geometry-preserving proximities derived from random forests. These proximities serve as a supervised initialization for constructing cross-domain relationships that maintain local neighborhood structures, thereby facilitating alignment. Our approach addresses a common limitation in manifold alignment, where existing methods often fail to generate embeddings that capture sufficient information for downstream classification. By contrast, we find that alignment models that use random forest proximities or class-label information achieve improved accuracy on downstream classification tasks, outperforming single-domain baselines. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our method typically enhances cross-domain feature integration and predictive performance, suggesting that random forest proximities offer a practical solution for tasks requiring multimodal data alignment.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Gaussian Process Regression with Temporal Feature Extraction for Partially Interpretable Remaining Useful Life Interval Prediction in Aeroengine Prognostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a pivotal role in intelligent manufacturing systems and Industry 4.0 technologies. While recent advancements have improved RUL prediction, many models still face interpretability and compelling uncertainty modeling challenges. This paper introduces a modified Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model for RUL interval prediction, tailored for the complexities of manufacturing process development. The modified GPR predicts confidence intervals by learning from historical data and addresses uncertainty modeling in a more structured way. The approach effectively captures intricate time-series patterns and dynamic behaviors inherent in modern manufacturing systems by coupling GPR with deep adaptive learning-enhanced AI process models. Moreover, the model evaluates feature significance to ensure more transparent decision-making, which is crucial for optimizing manufacturing processes. This comprehensive approach supports more accurate RUL predictions and provides transparent, interpretable insights into uncertainty, contributing to robust process development and management.</description>

      <title>Order Is All You Need for Categorical Data Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Categorical data composed of nominal valued attributes are ubiquitous in knowledge discovery and data mining tasks. Due to the lack of well-defined metric space, categorical data distributions are difficult to intuitively understand. Clustering is a popular technique suitable for data analysis. However, the success of clustering often relies on reasonable distance metrics, which happens to be what categorical data naturally lack. Therefore, the cluster analysis of categorical data is considered a critical but challenging problem. This paper introduces the new finding that the order relation among attribute values is the decisive factor in clustering accuracy, and is also the key to understanding the categorical data clusters. To automatically obtain the orders, we propose a new learning paradigm that allows joint learning of clusters and the orders. It turns out that clustering with order learning achieves superior clustering accuracy, and the learned orders provide intuition for understanding the cluster distribution of categorical data. Extensive experiments with statistical evidence and case studies have verified the effectiveness of the new ``order is all you need'' insight and the proposed method.</description>

      <title>K-means Derived Unsupervised Feature Selection using Improved ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature selection is important for high-dimensional data analysis and is non-trivial in unsupervised learning problems such as dimensionality reduction and clustering. The goal of unsupervised feature selection is finding a subset of features such that the data points from different clusters are well separated. This paper presents a novel method called K-means Derived Unsupervised Feature Selection (K-means UFS). Unlike most existing spectral analysis based unsupervised feature selection methods, we select features using the objective of K-means. We develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the NP-hard optimization problem of our K-means UFS model. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that our K-means UFS is more effective than the baselines in selecting features for clustering.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting Sea Surface Temperature in the Great Barrier Reef Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) region is crucial for the effective management of its fragile ecosystems. This study provides a rigorous comparative analysis of several machine learning techniques to identify the most effective method for SST prediction in this area. We evaluate the performance of ridge regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms. Our results reveal that while LASSO and ridge regression perform well, Random Forest and XGBoost significantly outperform them in terms of predictive accuracy, as evidenced by lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Prediction Error (RMSPE). Additionally, XGBoost demonstrated superior performance in minimizing Kullback- Leibler Divergence (KLD), indicating a closer alignment of predicted probability distributions with actual observations. These findings highlight the efficacy of using ensemble methods, particularly XGBoost, for predicting sea surface temperatures, making them valuable tools for climatological and environmental modeling.</description>

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in numerous science and engineering domains, e.g., signal processing, bioinformatics, and astronomy. Previous work has verified the efficacy of symbolic time series representation in a variety of engineering applications due to its storage efficiency and numerosity reduction. The most recent symbolic aggregate approximation technique, ABBA, has been shown to preserve essential shape information of time series and improve downstream applications, e.g., neural network inference regarding prediction and anomaly detection in time series.
  Motivated by the emergence of high-performance hardware which enables efficient computation for low bit-width representations, we present a new quantization-based ABBA symbolic approximation technique, QABBA, which exhibits improved storage efficiency while retaining the original speed and accuracy of symbolic reconstruction. We prove an upper bound for the error arising from quantization and discuss how the number of bits should be chosen to balance this with other errors.
  An application of QABBA with large language models (LLMs) for time series regression is also presented, and its utility is investigated. By representing the symbolic chain of patterns on time series, QABBA not only avoids the training of embedding from scratch, but also achieves a new state-of-the-art on Monash regression dataset. The symbolic approximation to the time series offers a more efficient way to fine-tune LLMs on the time series regression task which contains various application domains. We further present a set of extensive experiments performed across various well-established datasets to demonstrate the advantages of the QABBA method for symbolic approximation.</description>

      <title>Sampling with Adaptive Variance for Multimodal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a class of adaptive sampling algorithms for multimodal distributions on a bounded domain, which share a structural resemblance to the classic overdamped Langevin dynamics. We first demonstrate that this class of linear dynamics with adaptive diffusion coefficients and vector fields can be interpreted and analyzed as weighted Wasserstein gradient flows of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence between the current distribution and the target Gibbs distribution, which directly leads to the exponential convergence of both the KL and $\chi^2$ divergences, with rates depending on the weighted Wasserstein metric and the Gibbs potential. We then show that a derivative-free version of the dynamics can be used for sampling without gradient information of the Gibbs potential and that for Gibbs distributions with nonconvex potentials, this approach could achieve significantly faster convergence than the classical overdamped Langevin dynamics. A comparison of the mean transition times between local minima of a nonconvex potential further highlights the better efficiency of the derivative-free dynamics in sampling.</description>

      <title>Influence functions and regularity tangents for efficient active learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we describe an efficient method for providing a regression model with a sense of curiosity about its data. In the field of machine learning, our framework for representing curiosity is called Active Learning, which means automatically choosing data points for which to query labels in the semisupervised setting. The methods we propose are based on computing a "regularity tangent" vector that can be calculated (with only a constant slow-down) together with the model's parameter vector during training. We then take the inner product of this tangent vector with the gradient vector of the model's loss at a given data point to obtain a measure of the influence of that point on the complexity of the model. There is only a single regularity tangent vector, of the same dimension as the parameter vector. Thus, in the proposed technique, once training is complete, evaluating our "curiosity" about a potential query data point can be done as quickly as calculating the model's loss gradient at that point. The new vector only doubles the amount of storage required by the model. We show that the quantity computed by our technique is an example of an "influence function", and that it measures the expected squared change in model complexity incurred by up-weighting a given data point. We propose a number of ways for using this quantity to choose new training data for a model in the framework of active learning.</description>

      <title>Heavy-tailed Contamination is Easier than Adversarial Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large body of work in the statistics and computer science communities dating back to Huber (Huber, 1960) has led to statistically and computationally efficient outlier-robust estimators. Two particular outlier models have received significant attention: the adversarial and heavy-tailed models. While the former models outliers as the result of a malicious adversary manipulating the data, the latter relaxes distributional assumptions on the data allowing outliers to naturally occur as part of the data generating process. In the first setting, the goal is to develop estimators robust to the largest fraction of outliers while in the second, one seeks estimators to combat the loss of statistical efficiency, where the dependence on the failure probability is paramount.
  Despite these distinct motivations, the algorithmic approaches to both these settings have converged, prompting questions on the relationship between the models. In this paper, we investigate and provide a principled explanation for this phenomenon. First, we prove that any adversarially robust estimator is also resilient to heavy-tailed outliers for any statistical estimation problem with i.i.d data. As a corollary, optimal adversarially robust estimators for mean estimation, linear regression, and covariance estimation are also optimal heavy-tailed estimators. Conversely, for arguably the simplest high-dimensional estimation task of mean estimation, we construct heavy-tailed estimators whose application to the adversarial setting requires any black-box reduction to remove almost all the outliers in the data. Taken together, our results imply that heavy-tailed estimation is likely easier than adversarially robust estimation opening the door to novel algorithmic approaches for the heavy-tailed setting. Additionally, confidence intervals obtained for adversarially robust estimation also hold with high-probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning feature representations from a pair of random variables, where we focus on the representations that are induced by their dependence. We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for such dependence induced representations, and illustrate their connections to Hirschfeld--Gebelein--R\'{e}nyi (HGR) maximal correlation functions and minimal sufficient statistics. We characterize a large family of loss functions that can learn dependence induced representations, including cross entropy, hinge loss, and their regularized variants. In particular, we show that the features learned from this family can be expressed as the composition of a loss-dependent function and the maximal correlation function, which reveals a key connection between representations learned from different losses. Our development also gives a statistical interpretation of the neural collapse phenomenon observed in deep classifiers. Finally, we present the learning design based on the feature separation, which allows hyperparameter tuning during inference.</description>

      <title>AdamZ: An Enhanced Optimisation Method for Neural Network Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AdamZ is an advanced variant of the Adam optimiser, developed to enhance convergence efficiency in neural network training. This optimiser dynamically adjusts the learning rate by incorporating mechanisms to address overshooting and stagnation, that are common challenges in optimisation. Specifically, AdamZ reduces the learning rate when overshooting is detected and increases it during periods of stagnation, utilising hyperparameters such as overshoot and stagnation factors, thresholds, and patience levels to guide these adjustments. While AdamZ may lead to slightly longer training times compared to some other optimisers, it consistently excels in minimising the loss function, making it particularly advantageous for applications where precision is critical. Benchmarking results demonstrate the effectiveness of AdamZ in maintaining optimal learning rates, leading to improved model performance across diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>Gradient dynamics for low-rank fine-tuning beyond kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LoRA has emerged as one of the de facto methods for fine-tuning foundation models with low computational cost and memory footprint. The idea is to only train a low-rank perturbation to the weights of a pre-trained model, given supervised data for a downstream task. Despite its empirical sucess, from a mathematical perspective it remains poorly understood what learning mechanisms ensure that gradient descent converges to useful low-rank perturbations.
  In this work we study low-rank fine-tuning in a student-teacher setting. We are given the weights of a two-layer base model $f$, as well as i.i.d. samples $(x,f^*(x))$ where $x$ is Gaussian and $f^*$ is the teacher model given by perturbing the weights of $f$ by a rank-1 matrix. This generalizes the setting of generalized linear model (GLM) regression where the weights of $f$ are zero.
  When the rank-1 perturbation is comparable in norm to the weight matrix of $f$, the training dynamics are nonlinear. Nevertheless, in this regime we prove under mild assumptions that a student model which is initialized at the base model and trained with online gradient descent will converge to the teacher in $dk^{O(1)}$ iterations, where $k$ is the number of neurons in $f$. Importantly, unlike in the GLM setting, the complexity does not depend on fine-grained properties of the activation's Hermite expansion. We also prove that in our setting, learning the teacher model "from scratch'' can require significantly more iterations.</description>

      <title>Risk Management with Feature-Enriched Generative Adversarial Networks (FE-GAN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Feature-Enriched Generative Adversarial Networks (FE-GAN) in financial risk management, with a focus on improving the estimation of Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). FE-GAN enhances existing GANs architectures by incorporating an additional input sequence derived from preceding data to improve model performance. Two specialized GANs models, the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and the Tail Generative Adversarial Network (Tail-GAN), were evaluated under the FE-GAN framework. The results demonstrate that FE-GAN significantly outperforms traditional architectures in both VaR and ES estimation. Tail-GAN, leveraging its task-specific loss function, consistently outperforms WGAN in ES estimation, while both models exhibit similar performance in VaR estimation. Despite these promising results, the study acknowledges limitations, including reliance on highly correlated temporal data and restricted applicability to other domains. Future research directions include exploring alternative input generation methods, dynamic forecasting models, and advanced neural network architectures to further enhance GANs-based financial risk estimation.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Laplacian matrix aiming to enable the construction of spectral convolutional networks and to extend the signal processing applications for directed graphs. Our proposal is inspired by a Haar-like transformation and produces a Hermitian matrix which is not only in one-to-one relation with the adjacency matrix, preserving both direction and weight information, but also enjoys desirable additional properties like scaling robustness, sensitivity, continuity, and directionality. We take a theoretical standpoint and support the conformity of our approach with the spectral graph theory. Then, we address two use-cases: graph learning (by introducing HaarNet, a spectral graph convolutional network built with our Haar-Laplacian) and graph signal processing. We show that our approach gives better results in applications like weight prediction and denoising on directed graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-space models are a popular statistical framework for analysing sequential data. Within this framework, particle filters are often used to perform inference on non-linear state-space models. We introduce a new method, StateMixNN, that uses a pair of neural networks to learn the proposal distribution and transition distribution of a particle filter. Both distributions are approximated using multivariate Gaussian mixtures. The component means and covariances of these mixtures are learnt as outputs of learned functions. Our method is trained targeting the log-likelihood, thereby requiring only the observation series, and combines the interpretability of state-space models with the flexibility and approximation power of artificial neural networks. The proposed method significantly improves recovery of the hidden state in comparison with the state-of-the-art, showing greater improvement in highly non-linear scenarios.</description>

      <title>Federated PCA and Estimation for Spiked Covariance Matrices: Optimal Rates and Efficient Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant recent attention in machine learning for its enhanced privacy and data security, making it indispensable in fields such as healthcare, finance, and personalized services. This paper investigates federated PCA and estimation for spiked covariance matrices under distributed differential privacy constraints. We establish minimax rates of convergence, with a key finding that the central server's optimal rate is the harmonic mean of the local clients' minimax rates. This guarantees consistent estimation at the central server as long as at least one local client provides consistent results. Notably, consistency is maintained even if some local estimators are inconsistent, provided there are enough clients. These findings highlight the robustness and scalability of FL for reliable statistical inference under privacy constraints. To establish minimax lower bounds, we derive a matrix version of van Trees' inequality, which is of independent interest. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm that preserves differential privacy while achieving near-optimal rates at the central server, up to a logarithmic factor. We address significant technical challenges in analyzing this algorithm, which involves a three-layer spectral decomposition. Numerical performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated using both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Implicit High-Order Moment Tensor Estimation and Learning Latent Variable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning latent-variable models. An obstacle towards designing efficient algorithms for such models is the necessity of approximating moment tensors of super-constant degree. Motivated by such applications, we develop a general efficient algorithm for implicit moment tensor computation. Our algorithm computes in $\mathrm{poly}(d, k)$ time a succinct approximate description of tensors of the form $M_m=\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_iv_i^{\otimes m}$, for $w_i\in\mathbb{R}_+$--even for $m=\omega(1)$--assuming there exists a polynomial-size arithmetic circuit whose expected output on an appropriate samplable distribution is equal to $M_m$, and whose covariance on this input is bounded. Our framework broadly generalizes the work of~\cite{LL21-opt} which developed an efficient algorithm for the specific moment tensors that arise in clustering mixtures of spherical Gaussians.
  By leveraging our general algorithm, we obtain the first polynomial-time learners for the following models.
  * Mixtures of Linear Regressions. We give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time algorithm for this task. The previously best algorithm has super-polynomial complexity in $k$.
  * Learning Mixtures of Spherical Gaussians. We give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time density estimation algorithm, under the condition that the means lie in a ball of radius $O(\sqrt{\log k})$. Prior algorithms incur super-polynomial complexity in $k$. We also give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time parameter estimation algorithm, under the {\em optimal} mean separation of $\Omega(\log^{1/2}(k/\epsilon))$.
  * PAC Learning Sums of ReLUs. We give a learner with complexity $\mathrm{poly}(d, k) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)}$. This is the first algorithm for this task that runs in $\mathrm{poly}(d, k)$ time for subconstant values of $\epsilon = o_{k, d}(1)$.</description>

      <title>Gradient Norm Regularization Second-Order Algorithms for Solving Nonconvex-Strongly Concave Minimax Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study second-order algorithms for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, which have attracted much attention in recent years in many fields, especially in machine learning. We propose a gradient norm regularized trust region (GRTR) algorithm to solve nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, where the objective function of the trust region subproblem in each iteration uses a regularized version of the Hessian matrix, and the regularization coefficient and the radius of the ball constraint are proportional to the square root of the gradient norm. The iteration complexity of the proposed GRTR algorithm to obtain an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary point is proved to be upper bounded by $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\rho^{0.5}\kappa^{1.5}\epsilon^{-3/2})$, where $\rho$ and $\kappa$ are the Lipschitz constant of the Jacobian matrix and the condition number of the objective function respectively, which matches the best known iteration complexity of second-order methods for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems. We further propose a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with a gradient norm regularization coefficient and use the negative curvature direction to correct the iteration direction (LMNegCur), which does not need to solve the trust region subproblem at each iteration. We also prove that the LMNegCur algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary point within $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\rho^{0.5}\kappa^{1.5}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ number of iterations. Numerical results show the efficiency of both proposed algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an expert-elicitation method for learning non-parametric joint prior distributions using normalizing flows. Normalizing flows are a class of generative models that enable exact, single-step density evaluation and can capture complex density functions through specialized deep neural networks. Building on our previously introduced simulation-based framework, we adapt and extend the methodology to accommodate non-parametric joint priors. Our framework thus supports the development of elicitation methods for learning both parametric and non-parametric priors, as well as independent or joint priors for model parameters. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we perform four simulation studies and present an evaluation pipeline that incorporates diagnostics and additional evaluation tools to support decision-making at each stage of the elicitation process.</description>

      <title>Selective Inference for Time-Varying Effect Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal effect moderation investigates how the effect of interventions (or treatments) on outcome variables changes based on observed characteristics of individuals, known as potential effect moderators. With advances in data collection, datasets containing many observed features as potential moderators have become increasingly common. High-dimensional analyses often lack interpretability, with important moderators masked by noise, while low-dimensional, marginal analyses yield many false positives due to strong correlations with true moderators. In this paper, we propose a two-step method for selective inference on time-varying causal effect moderation that addresses the limitations of both high-dimensional and marginal analyses. Our method first selects a relatively smaller, more interpretable model to estimate a linear causal effect moderation using a Gaussian randomization approach. We then condition on the selection event to construct a pivot, enabling uniformly asymptotic semi-parametric inference in the selected model. Through simulations and real data analyses, we show that our method consistently achieves valid coverage rates, even when existing conditional methods and common sample splitting techniques fail. Moreover, our method yields shorter, bounded intervals, unlike existing methods that may produce infinitely long intervals.</description>

      <title>Improving Pre-Trained Self-Supervised Embeddings Through Effective Entropy Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of different architectures and loss functions have been applied to the problem of self-supervised learning (SSL), with the goal of developing embeddings that provide the best possible pre-training for as-yet-unknown, lightly supervised downstream tasks. One of these SSL criteria is to maximize the entropy of a set of embeddings in some compact space. But the goal of maximizing the embedding entropy often depends--whether explicitly or implicitly--upon high dimensional entropy estimates, which typically perform poorly in more than a few dimensions. In this paper, we motivate an effective entropy maximization criterion (E2MC), defined in terms of easy-to-estimate, low-dimensional constraints. We demonstrate that using it to continue training an already-trained SSL model for only a handful of epochs leads to a consistent and, in some cases, significant improvement in downstream performance. We perform careful ablation studies to show that the improved performance is due to the proposed add-on criterion. We also show that continued pre-training with alternative criteria does not lead to notable improvements, and in some cases, even degrades performance.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Generalization Capabilities of AID-based Bi-level Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bi-level optimization has achieved considerable success in contemporary machine learning applications, especially for given proper hyperparameters. However, due to the two-level optimization structure, commonly, researchers focus on two types of bi-level optimization methods: approximate implicit differentiation (AID)-based and iterative differentiation (ITD)-based approaches. ITD-based methods can be readily transformed into single-level optimization problems, facilitating the study of their generalization capabilities. In contrast, AID-based methods cannot be easily transformed similarly but must stay in the two-level structure, leaving their generalization properties enigmatic. In this paper, although the outer-level function is nonconvex, we ascertain the uniform stability of AID-based methods, which achieves similar results to a single-level nonconvex problem. We conduct a convergence analysis for a carefully chosen step size to maintain stability. Combining the convergence and stability results, we give the generalization ability of AID-based bi-level optimization methods. Furthermore, we carry out an ablation study of the parameters and assess the performance of these methods on real-world tasks. Our experimental results corroborate the theoretical findings, demonstrating the effectiveness and potential applications of these methods.</description>

      <title>Very Basics of Tensors with Graphical Notations: Unfolding, Calculations, and Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network diagram (graphical notation) is a useful tool that graphically represents multiplications between multiple tensors using nodes and edges. Using the graphical notation, complex multiplications between tensors can be described simply and intuitively, and it also helps to understand the essence of tensor products. In fact, most of matrix/tensor products including inner product, outer product, Hadamard product, Kronecker product, and Khatri-Rao product can be written in graphical notation. These matrix/tensor operations are essential building blocks for the use of matrix/tensor decompositions in signal processing and machine learning. The purpose of this lecture note is to learn the very basics of tensors and how to represent them in mathematical symbols and graphical notation. Many papers using tensors omit these detailed definitions and explanations, which can be difficult for the reader. I hope this note will be of help to such readers.</description>

      <title>Causal Adjacency Learning for Spatiotemporal Prediction Over Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction over graphs (STPG) is crucial for transportation systems. In existing STPG models, an adjacency matrix is an important component that captures the relations among nodes over graphs. However, most studies calculate the adjacency matrix by directly memorizing the data, such as distance- and correlation-based matrices. These adjacency matrices do not consider potential pattern shift for the test data, and may result in suboptimal performance if the test data has a different distribution from the training one. This issue is known as the Out-of-Distribution generalization problem. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a Causal Adjacency Learning (CAL) method to discover causal relations over graphs. The learned causal adjacency matrix is evaluated on a downstream spatiotemporal prediction task using real-world graph data. Results demonstrate that our proposed adjacency matrix can capture the causal relations, and using our learned adjacency matrix can enhance prediction performance on the OOD test data, even though causal learning is not conducted in the downstream task.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of the Successive Projection Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The successive projection algorithm (SPA) is a workhorse algorithm to learn the $r$ vertices of the convex hull of a set of $(r-1)$-dimensional data points, a.k.a. a latent simplex, which has numerous applications in data science. In this paper, we revisit the robustness to noise of SPA and several of its variants. In particular, when $r \geq 3$, we prove the tightness of the existing error bounds for SPA and for two more robust preconditioned variants of SPA. We also provide significantly improved error bounds for SPA, by a factor proportional to the conditioning of the $r$ vertices, in two special cases: for the first extracted vertex, and when $r \leq 2$. We then provide further improvements for the error bounds of a translated version of SPA proposed by Arora et al. (''A practical algorithm for topic modeling with provable guarantees'', ICML, 2013) in two special cases: for the first two extracted vertices, and when $r \leq 3$. Finally, we propose a new more robust variant of SPA that first shifts and lifts the data points in order to minimize the conditioning of the problem. We illustrate our results on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Even Sparser Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Transformers excel in long-range dependency modeling, but generally require quadratic memory complexity in the number of nodes in an input graph, and hence have trouble scaling to large graphs. Sparse attention variants such as Exphormer can help, but may require high-degree augmentations to the input graph for good performance, and do not attempt to sparsify an already-dense input graph. As the learned attention mechanisms tend to use few of these edges, such high-degree connections may be unnecessary. We show (empirically and with theoretical backing) that attention scores on graphs are usually quite consistent across network widths, and use this observation to propose a two-stage procedure, which we call Spexphormer: first, train a narrow network on the full augmented graph. Next, use only the active connections to train a wider network on a much sparser graph. We establish theoretical conditions when a narrow network's attention scores can match those of a wide network, and show that Spexphormer achieves good performance with drastically reduced memory requirements on various graph datasets.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Rank-N-Contrast: Continuous and Robust Representations for Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document is a replication of the original "Rank-N-Contrast" (arXiv:2210.01189v2) paper published in 2023. This evaluation is done for academic purposes. Deep regression models often fail to capture the continuous nature of sample orders, creating fragmented representations and suboptimal performance. To address this, we reproduced the Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) framework, which learns continuous representations by contrasting samples by their rankings in the target space. Our study validates RNC's theoretical and empirical benefits, including improved performance and robustness. We extended the evaluation to an additional regression dataset and conducted robustness tests using a holdout method, where a specific range of continuous data was excluded from the training set. This approach assessed the model's ability to generalise to unseen data and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This replication study validates the original findings and broadens the understanding of RNC's applicability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Understanding Generalization of Federated Learning: the Trade-off between Model Stability and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning approach that trains neural networks across multiple devices while keeping their local data private. However, FL often faces challenges due to data heterogeneity, leading to inconsistent local optima among clients. These inconsistencies can cause unfavorable convergence behavior and generalization performance degradation. Existing studies mainly describe this issue through \textit{convergence analysis}, focusing on how well a model fits training data, or through \textit{algorithmic stability}, which examines the generalization gap. However, neither approach precisely captures the generalization performance of FL algorithms, especially for neural networks. In this paper, we introduce the first generalization dynamics analysis framework in federated optimization, highlighting the trade-offs between model stability and optimization. Through this framework, we show how the generalization of FL algorithms is affected by the interplay of algorithmic stability and optimization. This framework applies to standard federated optimization and its advanced versions, like server momentum. We find that fast convergence from large local steps or accelerated momentum enlarges stability but obtains better generalization performance. Our insights into these trade-offs can guide the practice of future algorithms for better generalization.</description>

      <title>Local Learning for Covariate Selection in Nonparametric Causal Effect Estimation with Latent Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects from nonexperimental data is a fundamental problem in many fields of science. A key component of this task is selecting an appropriate set of covariates for confounding adjustment to avoid bias. Most existing methods for covariate selection often assume the absence of latent variables and rely on learning the global network structure among variables. However, identifying the global structure can be unnecessary and inefficient, especially when our primary interest lies in estimating the effect of a treatment variable on an outcome variable. To address this limitation, we propose a novel local learning approach for covariate selection in nonparametric causal effect estimation, which accounts for the presence of latent variables. Our approach leverages testable independence and dependence relationships among observed variables to identify a valid adjustment set for a target causal relationship, ensuring both soundness and completeness under standard assumptions. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Towards Foundation Models for Critical Care Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Notable progress has been made in generalist medical large language models across various healthcare areas. However, large-scale modeling of in-hospital time series data - such as vital signs, lab results, and treatments in critical care - remains underexplored. Existing datasets are relatively small, but combining them can enhance patient diversity and improve model robustness. To effectively utilize these combined datasets for large-scale modeling, it is essential to address the distribution shifts caused by varying treatment policies, necessitating the harmonization of treatment variables across the different datasets. This work aims to establish a foundation for training large-scale multi-variate time series models on critical care data and to provide a benchmark for machine learning models in transfer learning across hospitals to study and address distribution shift challenges. We introduce a harmonized dataset for sequence modeling and transfer learning research, representing the first large-scale collection to include core treatment variables. Future plans involve expanding this dataset to support further advancements in transfer learning and the development of scalable, generalizable models for critical healthcare applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been posited that there is a connection between the dynamical equations describing evolutionary processes in biology and sequential Bayesian learning methods. This manuscript describes new research in which this precise connection is rigorously established in the continuous time setting. Here we focus on a partial differential equation known as the Kushner-Stratonovich equation describing the evolution of the posterior density in time. Of particular importance is a piecewise smooth approximation of the observation path from which the discrete time filtering equations, which are shown to converge to a Stratonovich interpretation of the Kushner-Stratonovich equation. This smooth formulation will then be used to draw precise connections between nonlinear stochastic filtering and replicator-mutator dynamics. Additionally, gradient flow formulations will be investigated as well as a form of replicator-mutator dynamics which is shown to be beneficial for the misspecified model filtering problem. It is hoped this work will spur further research into exchanges between sequential learning and evolutionary biology and to inspire new algorithms in filtering and sampling.</description>

      <title>A Review of Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Probabilistic Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the greater scope of Deep Learning-based computer vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has given rise to challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation by discussing fundamental concepts in uncertainty that govern advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. We identify that quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty approximates Bayesian inference w.r.t. to either latent variables or model parameters, respectively. Moreover, literature on both uncertainties trace back to four key applications; (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) active learning. Then, a discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and comparison of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty-based active learning, standardization and benchmarking, and recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.</description>

      <title>Statistical inference for quantum singular models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has seen substantial achievements, with numerical and theoretical evidence suggesting that singularities of statistical models are considered a contributing factor to its performance. From this remarkable success of classical statistical models, it is naturally expected that quantum singular models will play a vital role in many quantum statistical tasks. However, while the theory of quantum statistical models in regular cases has been established, theoretical understanding of quantum singular models is still limited. To investigate the statistical properties of quantum singular models, we focus on two prominent tasks in quantum statistical inference: quantum state estimation and model selection. In particular, we base our study on classical singular learning theory and seek to extend it within the framework of Bayesian quantum state estimation. To this end, we define quantum generalization and training loss functions and give their asymptotic expansions through algebraic geometrical methods. The key idea of the proof is the introduction of a quantum analog of the likelihood function using classical shadows. Consequently, we construct an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the quantum generalization loss, the quantum widely applicable information criterion (QWAIC), as a computable model selection metric from given measurement outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many large-scale classification problems, classes are organized in a known hierarchy, typically represented as a tree expressing the inclusion of classes in superclasses. We introduce a loss for this type of supervised hierarchical classification. It utilizes the knowledge of the hierarchy to assign each example not only to a class but also to all encompassing superclasses. Applicable to any feedforward architecture with a softmax output layer, this loss is a proper scoring rule, in that its expectation is minimized by the true posterior class probabilities. This property allows us to simultaneously pursue consistent classification objectives between superclasses and fine-grained classes, and eliminates the need for a performance trade-off between different granularities. We conduct an experimental study on three reference benchmarks, in which we vary the size of the training sets to cover a diverse set of learning scenarios. Our approach does not entail any significant additional computational cost compared with the loss of cross-entropy. It improves accuracy and reduces the number of coarse errors, with predicted labels that are distant from ground-truth labels in the tree.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Prompt Tuning Transformers: Universality, Capacity and Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical and computational limits of prompt tuning for transformer-based foundation models. Our key contributions are prompt tuning on \textit{single-head} transformers with only a \textit{single} self-attention layer: (i) is universal, and (ii) supports efficient (even almost-linear time) algorithms under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Statistically, we prove that prompt tuning on such simplest possible transformers are universal approximators for sequence-to-sequence Lipschitz functions. In addition, we provide an exponential-in-$dL$ and -in-$(1/\epsilon)$ lower bound on the required soft-prompt tokens for prompt tuning to memorize any dataset with 1-layer, 1-head transformers. Computationally, we identify a phase transition in the efficiency of prompt tuning, determined by the norm of the \textit{soft-prompt-induced} keys and queries, and provide an upper bound criterion. Beyond this criterion, no sub-quadratic (efficient) algorithm for prompt tuning exists under SETH. Within this criterion, we showcase our theory by proving the existence of almost-linear time prompt tuning inference algorithms. These fundamental limits provide important necessary conditions for designing expressive and efficient prompt tuning methods for practitioners.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks for Drift Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept drift refers to the change of data distributions over time. While drift poses a challenge for learning models, requiring their continual adaption, it is also relevant in system monitoring to detect malfunctions, system failures, and unexpected behavior. In the latter case, the robust and reliable detection of drifts is imperative. This work studies the shortcomings of commonly used drift detection schemes. We show how to construct data streams that are drifting without being detected. We refer to those as drift adversarials. In particular, we compute all possible adversairals for common detection schemes and underpin our theoretical findings with empirical evaluations.</description>

      <title>Early stopping and polynomial smoothing in regression with reproducing kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.06827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of early stopping for iterative learning algorithms in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in the nonparametric regression framework. In particular, we work with the gradient descent and (iterative) kernel ridge regression algorithms. We present a data-driven rule to perform early stopping without a validation set that is based on the so-called minimum discrepancy principle. This method enjoys only one assumption on the regression function: it belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The proposed rule is proved to be minimax-optimal over different types of kernel spaces, including finite-rank and Sobolev smoothness classes. The proof is derived from the fixed-point analysis of the localized Rademacher complexities, which is a standard technique for obtaining optimal rates in the nonparametric regression literature. In addition to that, we present simulation results on artificial datasets that show the comparable performance of the designed rule with respect to other stopping rules such as the one determined by V-fold cross-validation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a probabilistic perspective on adversarial examples, allowing us to embed subjective understanding of semantics as a distribution into the process of generating adversarial examples, in a principled manner. Despite significant pixel-level modifications compared to traditional adversarial attacks, our method preserves the overall semantics of the image, making the changes difficult for humans to detect. This extensive pixel-level modification enhances our method's ability to deceive classifiers designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our empirical findings indicate that the proposed methods achieve higher success rates in circumventing adversarial defense mechanisms, while remaining difficult for human observers to detect.</description>

      <title>Auditing for Human Expertise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-stakes prediction tasks (e.g., patient diagnosis) are often handled by trained human experts. A common source of concern about automation in these settings is that experts may exercise intuition that is difficult to model and/or have access to information (e.g., conversations with a patient) that is simply unavailable to a would-be algorithm. This raises a natural question whether human experts add value which could not be captured by an algorithmic predictor. We develop a statistical framework under which we can pose this question as a natural hypothesis test. Indeed, as our framework highlights, detecting human expertise is more subtle than simply comparing the accuracy of expert predictions to those made by a particular learning algorithm. Instead, we propose a simple procedure which tests whether expert predictions are statistically independent from the outcomes of interest after conditioning on the available inputs (`features'). A rejection of our test thus suggests that human experts may add value to any algorithm trained on the available data, and has direct implications for whether human-AI `complementarity' is achievable in a given prediction task. We highlight the utility of our procedure using admissions data collected from the emergency department of a large academic hospital system, where we show that physicians' admit/discharge decisions for patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (AGIB) appear to be incorporating information that is not available to a standard algorithmic screening tool. This is despite the fact that the screening tool is arguably more accurate than physicians' discretionary decisions, highlighting that -- even absent normative concerns about accountability or interpretability -- accuracy is insufficient to justify algorithmic automation.</description>

      <title>Practical and Asymptotically Exact Conditional Sampling in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful on a range of conditional generation tasks including molecular design and text-to-image generation. However, these achievements have primarily depended on task-specific conditional training or error-prone heuristic approximations. Ideally, a conditional generation method should provide exact samples for a broad range of conditional distributions without requiring task-specific training. To this end, we introduce the Twisted Diffusion Sampler, or TDS. TDS is a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that targets the conditional distributions of diffusion models through simulating a set of weighted particles. The main idea is to use twisting, an SMC technique that enjoys good computational efficiency, to incorporate heuristic approximations without compromising asymptotic exactness. We first find in simulation and in conditional image generation tasks that TDS provides a computational statistical trade-off, yielding more accurate approximations with many particles but with empirical improvements over heuristics with as few as two particles. We then turn to motif-scaffolding, a core task in protein design, using a TDS extension to Riemannian diffusion models. On benchmark test cases, TDS allows flexible conditioning criteria and often outperforms the state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops a Bayesian non-parametric approach to signal separation where the signals may vary according to latent variables. Our key contribution is to augment Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) for the case where each data point comprises the weighted sum of a known number of pure component signals, observed across several input locations. Our framework allows arbitrary non-linear variations in the signals while being able to incorporate useful priors for the linear weights, such as summing-to-one. Our contributions are particularly relevant to spectroscopy, where changing conditions may cause the underlying pure component signals to vary from sample to sample. To demonstrate the applicability to both spectroscopy and other domains, we consider several applications: a near-infrared spectroscopy dataset with varying temperatures, a simulated dataset for identifying flow configuration through a pipe, and a dataset for determining the type of rock from its reflectance.</description>

      <title>AdaTrans: Feature-wise and Sample-wise Adaptive Transfer Learning for High-dimensional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the transfer learning problem in the high dimensional linear regression setting, where the feature dimension is larger than the sample size. To learn transferable information, which may vary across features or the source samples, we propose an adaptive transfer learning method that can detect and aggregate the feature-wise (F-AdaTrans) or sample-wise (S-AdaTrans) transferable structures. We achieve this by employing a fused-penalty, coupled with weights that can adapt according to the transferable structure. To choose the weight, we propose a theoretically informed, data-driven procedure, enabling F-AdaTrans to selectively fuse the transferable signals with the target while filtering out non-transferable signals, and S-AdaTrans to obtain the optimal combination of information transferred from each source sample. We show that, with appropriately chosen weights, F-AdaTrans achieves a convergence rate close to that of an oracle estimator with a known transferable structure, and S-AdaTrans recovers existing near-minimax optimal rates as a special case. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using both simulation and real data, demonstrating favorable performance compared to the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Robust Generative Learning with Lipschitz-Regularized $\alpha$-Divergences Allows Minimal Assumptions on Target Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the robustness of Lipschitz-regularized $\alpha$-divergences as objective functionals in generative modeling, showing they enable stable learning across a wide range of target distributions with minimal assumptions. We establish that these divergences remain finite under a mild condition-that the source distribution has a finite first moment-regardless of the properties of the target distribution, making them adaptable to the structure of target distributions. Furthermore, we prove the existence and finiteness of their variational derivatives, which are essential for stable training of generative models such as GANs and gradient flows. For heavy-tailed targets, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions that connect data dimension, $\alpha$, and tail behavior to divergence finiteness, that also provide insights into the selection of suitable $\alpha$'s. We also provide the first sample complexity bounds for empirical estimations of these divergences on unbounded domains. As a byproduct, we obtain the first sample complexity bounds for empirical estimations of these divergences and the Wasserstein-1 metric with group symmetry on unbounded domains. Numerical experiments confirm that generative models leveraging Lipschitz-regularized $\alpha$-divergences can stably learn distributions in various challenging scenarios, including those with heavy tails or complex, low-dimensional, or fractal support, all without any prior knowledge of the structure of target distributions.</description>

      <title>OAL: Enhancing OOD Detection Using Latent Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection algorithms have been developed to identify unknown samples or objects in real-world model deployments. Outlier Exposure (OE) algorithms, a subset of these methods, typically employ auxiliary datasets to train OOD detectors, enhancing the reliability of their predictions. While previous methods have leveraged Stable Diffusion (SD) to generate pixel-space outliers, these can complicate network optimization. We propose an Outlier Aware Learning (OAL) framework, which synthesizes OOD training data directly in the latent space. To regularize the model's decision boundary, we introduce a mutual information-based contrastive learning approach that amplifies the distinction between In-Distribution (ID) and collected OOD features. The efficacy of this contrastive learning technique is supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Furthermore, we integrate knowledge distillation into our framework to preserve in-distribution classification accuracy. The combined application of contrastive learning and knowledge distillation substantially improves OOD detection performance, enabling OAL to outperform other OE methods by a considerable margin. Source code is available at: \url{https://github.com/HengGao12/OAL}.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimisation with Unknown Hyperparameters: Regret Bounds Logarithmically Closer to Optimal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is widely used for optimising black-box functions but requires us to specify the length scale hyperparameter, which defines the smoothness of the functions the optimizer will consider. Most current BO algorithms choose this hyperparameter by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the observed data, albeit risking misspecification if the objective function is less smooth in regions we have not yet explored. The only prior solution addressing this problem with theoretical guarantees was A-GP-UCB, proposed by Berkenkamp et al. (2019). This algorithm progressively decreases the length scale, expanding the class of functions considered by the optimizer. However, A-GP-UCB lacks a stopping mechanism, leading to over-exploration and slow convergence. To overcome this, we introduce Length scale Balancing (LB) - a novel approach, aggregating multiple base surrogate models with varying length scales. LB intermittently adds smaller length scale candidate values while retaining longer scales, balancing exploration and exploitation. We formally derive a cumulative regret bound of LB and compare it with the regret of an oracle BO algorithm using the optimal length scale. Denoting the factor by which the regret bound of A-GP-UCB was away from oracle as $g(T)$, we show that LB is only $\log g(T)$ away from oracle regret. We also empirically evaluate our algorithm on synthetic and real-world benchmarks and show it outperforms A-GP-UCB, maximum likelihood estimation and MCMC.</description>

      <title>Deep sr-DDL: Deep Structurally Regularized Dynamic Dictionary Learning to Integrate Multimodal and Dynamic Functional Connectomics data for Multidimensional Clinical Characterizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.12410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel integrated framework that jointly models complementary information from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to extract biomarkers of brain connectivity predictive of behavior. Our framework couples a generative model of the connectomics data with a deep network that predicts behavioral scores. The generative component is a structurally-regularized Dynamic Dictionary Learning (sr-DDL) model that decomposes the dynamic rs-fMRI correlation matrices into a collection of shared basis networks and time varying subject-specific loadings. We use the DTI tractography to regularize this matrix factorization and learn anatomically informed functional connectivity profiles. The deep component of our framework is an LSTM-ANN block, which uses the temporal evolution of the subject-specific sr-DDL loadings to predict multidimensional clinical characterizations. Our joint optimization strategy collectively estimates the basis networks, the subject-specific time-varying loadings, and the neural network weights. We validate our framework on a dataset of neurotypical individuals from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database to map to cognition and on a separate multi-score prediction task on individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in a five-fold cross validation setting. Our hybrid model outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches at clinical outcome prediction and learns interpretable multimodal neural signatures of brain organization.</description>

      <title>Modeling Inter-Dependence Between Time and Mark in Multivariate Temporal Point Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal Point Processes (TPP) are probabilistic generative frameworks. They model discrete event sequences localized in continuous time. Generally, real-life events reveal descriptive information, known as marks. Marked TPPs model time and marks of the event together for practical relevance. Conditioned on past events, marked TPPs aim to learn the joint distribution of the time and the mark of the next event. For simplicity, conditionally independent TPP models assume time and marks are independent given event history. They factorize the conditional joint distribution of time and mark into the product of individual conditional distributions. This structural limitation in the design of TPP models hurt the predictive performance on entangled time and mark interactions. In this work, we model the conditional inter-dependence of time and mark to overcome the limitations of conditionally independent models. We construct a multivariate TPP conditioning the time distribution on the current event mark in addition to past events. Besides the conventional intensity-based models for conditional joint distribution, we also draw on flexible intensity-free TPP models from the literature. The proposed TPP models outperform conditionally independent and dependent models in standard prediction tasks. Our experimentation on various datasets with multiple evaluation metrics highlights the merit of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously quantify the improvement in the sample complexity of variational divergence estimations for group-invariant distributions. In the cases of the Wasserstein-1 metric and the Lipschitz-regularized $\alpha$-divergences, the reduction of sample complexity is proportional to the group size if the group is finite. In addition to the published version at ICML 2023, our proof indeed has included the case when the group is infinite such as compact Lie groups, the convergence rate can be further improved and depends on the intrinsic dimension of the fundamental domain characterized by the scaling of its covering number. Our approach is different from that in [Tahmasebi &amp; Jegelka, ICML 2024] and our work also applies to asymmetric divergences, such as the Lipschitz-regularized $\alpha$-divergences. For the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), the improvement of sample complexity is more nuanced, as it depends on not only the group size but also the choice of kernel.

      <title>Intelligent Anomaly Detection for Lane Rendering Using Transformer with Self-Supervised Pre-Training and Customized Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Modyn: Data-Centric Machine Learning Pipeline Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world machine learning (ML) pipelines, datasets are continuously growing. Models must incorporate this new training data to improve generalization and adapt to potential distribution shifts. The cost of model retraining is proportional to how frequently the model is retrained and how much data it is trained on, which makes the naive approach of retraining from scratch each time impractical.
  We present Modyn, a data-centric end-to-end machine learning platform. Modyn's ML pipeline abstraction enables users to declaratively describe policies for continuously training a model on a growing dataset. Modyn pipelines allow users to apply data selection policies (to reduce the number of data points) and triggering policies (to reduce the number of trainings). Modyn executes and orchestrates these continuous ML training pipelines. The system is open-source and comes with an ecosystem of benchmark datasets, models, and tooling. We formally discuss how to measure the performance of ML pipelines by introducing the concept of composite models, enabling fair comparison of pipelines with different data selection and triggering policies. We empirically analyze how various data selection and triggering policies impact model accuracy, and also show that Modyn enables high throughput training with sample-level data selection.</description>

      <title>Learning Distributions on Manifolds with Free-Form Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Manifold Free-Form Flows (M-FFF), a simple new generative model for data on manifolds. The existing approaches to learning a distribution on arbitrary manifolds are expensive at inference time, since sampling requires solving a differential equation. Our method overcomes this limitation by sampling in a single function evaluation. The key innovation is to optimize a neural network via maximum likelihood on the manifold, possible by adapting the free-form flow framework to Riemannian manifolds. M-FFF is straightforwardly adapted to any manifold with a known projection. It consistently matches or outperforms previous single-step methods specialized to specific manifolds. It is typically two orders of magnitude faster than multi-step methods based on diffusion or flow matching, achieving better likelihoods in several experiments. We provide our code at https://github.com/vislearn/FFF.</description>

      <title>Robust Point Matching with Distance Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the outlier robustness and noise stability of practical matching procedures based on distance profiles. Although the idea of matching points based on invariants like distance profiles has a long history in the literature, there has been little understanding of the theoretical properties of such procedures, especially in the presence of outliers and noise. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that under certain probabilistic settings, the proposed matching procedure is successful with high probability even in the presence of outliers and noise. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method using a real data example and provide simulation studies to complement the theoretical findings. Lastly, we extend the concept of distance profiles to the abstract setting and connect the proposed matching procedure to the Gromov-Wasserstein distance and its lower bound, with a new sample complexity result derived based on the properties of distance profiles. As a result, we contribute to the literature by providing theoretical underpinnings of the matching procedures based on invariants like distance profiles, which have been widely used in practice but have rarely been analyzed theoretically.</description>

      <title>Understanding Model Selection For Learning In Strategic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07588v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of ever-larger machine learning models reflects a growing consensus that the more expressive the model class one optimizes over$\unicode{x2013}$and the more data one has access to$\unicode{x2013}$the more one can improve performance. As models get deployed in a variety of real-world scenarios, they inevitably face strategic environments. In this work, we consider the natural question of how the interplay of models and strategic interactions affects the relationship between performance at equilibrium and the expressivity of model classes. We find that strategic interactions can break the conventional view$\unicode{x2013}$meaning that performance does not necessarily monotonically improve as model classes get larger or more expressive (even with infinite data). We show the implications of this result in several contexts including strategic regression, strategic classification, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. In particular, we show that each of these settings admits a Braess' paradox-like phenomenon in which optimizing over less expressive model classes allows one to achieve strictly better equilibrium outcomes. Motivated by these examples, we then propose a new paradigm for model selection in games wherein an agent seeks to choose amongst different model classes to use as their action set in a game.</description>

      <title>Motion Code: Robust Time Series Classification and Forecasting via Sparse Variational Multi-Stochastic Processes Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research, time series classification and forecasting on noisy data remain highly challenging. The main difficulties lie in finding suitable mathematical concepts to describe time series and effectively separate noise from the true signals. Unlike traditional methods treating time series as static vectors or fixed sequences, we propose a novel framework that views each time series, regardless of length, as a realization of a continuous-time stochastic process. This mathematical approach captures dependencies across timestamps and detects hidden, time-varying signals within the noise. However, real-world data often involves multiple distinct dynamics, making it insufficient to model the entire process with a single stochastic model. To address this, we assign each dynamic a unique signature vector and introduce the concept of "most informative timestamps" to infer a sparse approximation of the individual dynamics from these vectors. The resulting model, called Motion Code, includes parameters that fully capture diverse underlying dynamics in an integrated manner, enabling simultaneous classification and forecasting of time series. Extensive experiments on noisy datasets, including real-world Parkinson's disease sensor tracking, demonstrate Motion Code's strong performance against established benchmarks for time series classification and forecasting.</description>

      <title>Selecting informative conformal prediction sets with false coverage rate control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In supervised learning, including regression and classification, conformal methods provide prediction sets for the outcome/label with finite sample coverage for any machine learning predictor. We consider here the case where such prediction sets come after a selection process. The selection process requires that the selected prediction sets be `informative' in a well defined sense. We consider both the classification and regression settings where the analyst may consider as informative only the sample with prediction sets small enough, excluding null values, or obeying other appropriate `monotone' constraints. We develop a unified framework for building such informative conformal prediction sets while controlling the false coverage rate (FCR) on the selected sample. While conformal prediction sets after selection have been the focus of much recent literature in the field, the new introduced procedures, called InfoSP and InfoSCOP, are to our knowledge the first ones providing FCR control for informative prediction sets. We show the usefulness of our resulting procedures on real and simulated data.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian Process Model for Ordinal Data with Applications to Chemoinformatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of screening tools for chemical testing, it is now possible to create vast databases of chemicals easily. However, rigorous statistical methodologies employed to analyse these databases are in their infancy, and further development to facilitate chemical discovery is imperative. In this paper, we present conditional Gaussian process models to predict ordinal outcomes from chemical experiments, where the inputs are chemical compounds. We implement the Tanimoto distance, a metric on the chemical space, within the covariance of the Gaussian processes to capture correlated effects in the chemical space. A novel aspect of our model is that the kernel contains a scaling parameter, a feature not previously examined in the literature, that controls the strength of the correlation between elements of the chemical space. Using molecular fingerprints, a numerical representation of a compound's location within the chemical space, we find that accounting for correlation amongst chemical compounds improves predictive performance over the uncorrelated model, where effects are assumed to be independent. Moreover, we present a genetic algorithm for the facilitation of chemical discovery and identification of important features to the compound's efficacy, based on two criteria derived from the proposed model. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed methods. Our model is demonstrated on a hazard classification problem of organic solvents.</description>

      <title>MANO: Exploiting Matrix Norm for Unsupervised Accuracy Estimation Under Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the models' outputs, specifically the logits, is a common approach to estimating the test accuracy of a pre-trained neural network on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples without requiring access to the corresponding ground truth labels. Despite their ease of implementation and computational efficiency, current logit-based methods are vulnerable to overconfidence issues, leading to prediction bias, especially under the natural shift. In this work, we first study the relationship between logits and generalization performance from the view of low-density separation assumption. Our findings motivate our proposed method MaNo which (1) applies a data-dependent normalization on the logits to reduce prediction bias, and (2) takes the $L_p$ norm of the matrix of normalized logits as the estimation score. Our theoretical analysis highlights the connection between the provided score and the model's uncertainty. We conduct an extensive empirical study on common unsupervised accuracy estimation benchmarks and demonstrate that MaNo achieves state-of-the-art performance across various architectures in the presence of synthetic, natural, or subpopulation shifts.

      <title>Towards Faster Decentralized Stochastic Optimization with Communication Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication efficiency has garnered significant attention as it is considered the main bottleneck for large-scale decentralized Machine Learning applications in distributed and federated settings. In this regime, clients are restricted to transmitting small amounts of quantized information to their neighbors over a communication graph. Numerous endeavors have been made to address this challenging problem by developing algorithms with compressed communication for decentralized non-convex optimization problems. Despite considerable efforts, the current results suffer from various issues such as non-scalability with the number of clients, requirements for large batches, or bounded gradient assumption. In this paper, we introduce MoTEF, a novel approach that integrates communication compression with Momentum Tracking and Error Feedback. Our analysis demonstrates that MoTEF achieves most of the desired properties, and significantly outperforms existing methods under arbitrary data heterogeneity. We provide numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings and confirm the practical superiority of MoTEF.</description>

      <title>Modeling Latent Neural Dynamics with Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the collective activity of neural populations relates to computation and ultimately behavior is a key goal in neuroscience. To this end, statistical methods which describe high-dimensional neural time series in terms of low-dimensional latent dynamics have played a fundamental role in characterizing neural systems. Yet, what constitutes a successful method involves two opposing criteria: (1) methods should be expressive enough to capture complex nonlinear dynamics, and (2) they should maintain a notion of interpretability often only warranted by simpler linear models. In this paper, we develop an approach that balances these two objectives: the Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (gpSLDS). Our method builds on previous work modeling the latent state evolution via a stochastic differential equation whose nonlinear dynamics are described by a Gaussian process (GP-SDEs). We propose a novel kernel function which enforces smoothly interpolated locally linear dynamics, and therefore expresses flexible -- yet interpretable -- dynamics akin to those of recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS). Our approach resolves key limitations of the rSLDS such as artifactual oscillations in dynamics near discrete state boundaries, while also providing posterior uncertainty estimates of the dynamics. To fit our models, we leverage a modified learning objective which improves the estimation accuracy of kernel hyperparameters compared to previous GP-SDE fitting approaches. We apply our method to synthetic data and data recorded in two neuroscience experiments and demonstrate favorable performance in comparison to the rSLDS.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI needs formal notions of explanation correctness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) in critical domains such as medicine poses risks and requires regulation. One requirement is that decisions of ML systems in high-risk applications should be human-understandable. The field of "explainable artificial intelligence" (XAI) seemingly addresses this need. However, in its current form, XAI is unfit to provide quality control for ML; it itself needs scrutiny. Popular XAI methods cannot reliably answer important questions about ML models, their training data, or a given test input. We recapitulate results demonstrating that popular XAI methods systematically attribute importance to input features that are independent of the prediction target. This limits their utility for purposes such as model and data (in)validation, model improvement, and scientific discovery. We argue that the fundamental reason for this limitation is that current XAI methods do not address well-defined problems and are not evaluated against objective criteria of explanation correctness. Researchers should formally define the problems they intend to solve first and then design methods accordingly. This will lead to notions of explanation correctness that can be theoretically verified and objective metrics of explanation performance that can be assessed using ground-truth data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For several decades now, Bayesian inference techniques have been applied to theories of particle physics, cosmology and astrophysics to obtain the probability density functions of their free parameters. In this study, we review and compare a wide range of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling techniques to determine their relative efficacy on functions that resemble those encountered most frequently in the particle astrophysics literature. Our first series of tests explores a series of high-dimensional analytic test functions that exemplify particular challenges, for example highly multimodal posteriors or posteriors with curving degeneracies. We then investigate two real physics examples, the first being a global fit of the $\Lambda$CDM model using cosmic microwave background data from the Planck experiment, and the second being a global fit of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model using a wide variety of collider and astrophysics data. We show that several examples widely thought to be most easily solved using nested sampling approaches can in fact be more efficiently solved using modern MCMC algorithms, but the details of the implementation matter. Furthermore, we also provide a series of useful insights for practitioners of particle astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Assumption-Lean Post-Integrated Inference with Negative Control Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data integration methods aim to extract low-dimensional embeddings from high-dimensional outcomes to remove unwanted variations, such as batch effects and unmeasured covariates, across heterogeneous datasets. However, multiple hypothesis testing after integration can be biased due to data-dependent processes. We introduce a robust post-integrated inference (PII) method that adjusts for latent heterogeneity using negative control outcomes. Leveraging causal interpretations, we derive nonparametric identifiability of the direct effects, which motivates our semiparametric inference method. Our method extends to projected direct effect estimands, accounting for hidden mediators, confounders, and moderators. These estimands remain statistically meaningful under model misspecifications and with error-prone embeddings. We provide bias quantifications and finite-sample linear expansions with uniform concentration bounds. The proposed doubly robust estimators are consistent and efficient under minimal assumptions and potential misspecification, facilitating data-adaptive estimation with machine learning algorithms. Our proposal is evaluated with random forests through simulations and analysis of single-cell CRISPR perturbed datasets with potential unmeasured confounders.</description>

      <title>Transformers Provably Solve Parity Efficiently with Chain of Thought</title>

Abstract: This work provides the first theoretical analysis of training transformers to solve complex problems by recursively generating intermediate states, analogous to fine-tuning for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We consider training a one-layer transformer to solve the fundamental $k$-parity problem, extending the work on RNNs by Wies et al. (2023). We establish three key results: (1) any finite-precision gradient-based algorithm, without intermediate supervision, requires substantial iterations to solve parity with finite samples. (2) In contrast, when intermediate parities are incorporated into the loss function, our model can learn parity in one gradient update when aided by \emph{teacher forcing}, where ground-truth labels of the reasoning chain are provided at each generation step. (3) Even without teacher forcing, where the model must generate CoT chains end-to-end, parity can be learned efficiently if augmented data is employed to internally verify the soundness of intermediate steps. Our findings, supported by numerical experiments, show that task decomposition and stepwise reasoning naturally arise from optimizing transformers with CoT; moreover, self-consistency checking can improve multi-step reasoning ability, aligning with empirical studies of CoT.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Survey on Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the inner mechanisms of black-box foundation models (FMs) is essential yet challenging in artificial intelligence and its applications. Over the last decade, the long-running focus has been on their explainability, leading to the development of post-hoc explainable methods to rationalize the specific decisions already made by black-box FMs. However, these explainable methods have certain limitations in terms of faithfulness and resource requirement. Consequently, a new class of interpretable methods should be considered to unveil the underlying mechanisms of FMs in an accurate, comprehensive, heuristic, and resource-light way. This survey aims to review those interpretable methods that comply with the aforementioned principles and have been successfully applied to FMs. These methods are deeply rooted in machine learning theory, covering the analysis of generalization performance, expressive capability, and dynamic behavior. They provide a thorough interpretation of the entire workflow of FMs, ranging from the inference capability and training dynamics to their ethical implications. Ultimately, drawing upon these interpretations, this review identifies the next frontier research directions for FMs.</description>

      <title>Enriching GNNs with Text Contextual Representations for Detecting Disinformation Campaigns on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disinformation on social media poses both societal and technical challenges, requiring robust detection systems. While previous studies have integrated textual information into propagation networks, they have yet to fully leverage the advancements in Transformer-based language models for high-quality contextual text representations. This work addresses this gap by incorporating Transformer-based textual features into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for fake news detection. We demonstrate that contextual text representations enhance GNN performance, achieving 33.8% relative improvement in Macro F1 over models without textual features and 9.3% over static text representations. We further investigate the impact of different feature sources and the effects of noisy data augmentation. We expect our methodology to open avenues for further research, and we made code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Differentially Private Hyperdimensional Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is essential for efficient data exchange in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, as it trains Machine Learning (ML) models locally and shares only model updates. However, FL is vulnerable to privacy threats like model inversion and membership inference attacks, which can expose sensitive training data. To address these privacy concerns, Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms are often applied. Yet, adding DP noise to black-box ML models degrades performance, especially in dynamic IoT systems where continuous, lifelong FL learning accumulates excessive noise over time. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Federated HyperDimensional computing with Privacy-preserving (FedHDPrivacy), an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework that combines the neuro-symbolic paradigm with DP. FedHDPrivacy carefully manages the balance between privacy and performance by theoretically tracking cumulative noise from previous rounds and adding only the necessary incremental noise to meet privacy requirements. In a real-world case study involving in-process monitoring of manufacturing machining operations, FedHDPrivacy demonstrates robust performance, outperforming standard FL frameworks-including Federated Averaging (FedAvg), Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD), Federated Proximal (FedProx), Federated Normalized Averaging (FedNova), and Federated Adam (FedAdam)-by up to 38%. FedHDPrivacy also shows potential for future enhancements, such as multimodal data fusion.</description>

      <title>Summarizing Bayesian Nonparametric Mixture Posterior -- Sliced Optimal Transport Metrics for Gaussian Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods to summarize posterior inference for mixture models focus on identifying a point estimate of the implied random partition for clustering, with density estimation as a secondary goal (Wade and Ghahramani, 2018; Dahl et al., 2022). We propose a novel approach for summarizing posterior inference in nonparametric Bayesian mixture models, prioritizing density estimation of the mixing measure (or mixture) as an inference target. One of the key features is the model-agnostic nature of the approach, which remains valid under arbitrarily complex dependence structures in the underlying sampling model. Using a decision-theoretic framework, our method identifies a point estimate by minimizing posterior expected loss. A loss function is defined as a discrepancy between mixing measures. Estimating the mixing measure implies inference on the mixture density and the random partition. Exploiting the discrete nature of the mixing measure, we use a version of sliced Wasserstein distance. We introduce two specific variants for Gaussian mixtures. The first, mixed sliced Wasserstein, applies generalized geodesic projections on the product of the Euclidean space and the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. The second, sliced mixture Wasserstein, leverages the linearity of Gaussian mixture measures for efficient projection.</description>
