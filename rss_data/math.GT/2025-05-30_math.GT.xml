      <title>A parallel algorithm for the computation of the Jones polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knots, links and entangled filaments appear in many physical systems of interest in biology and engineering. Classifying knots and measuring entanglement is of interest both for advancing knot theory, as well as for analyzing large data that become available through experiments or Artificial Intelligence. In this context, the efficient computation of topological invariants and other metrics of entanglement becomes an urgent issue. The computation of common measures of topological complexity, such as the Jones polynomial, is #P-hard and of exponential time on the number of crossings in a knot(oid) (link(oid)) diagram. In this paper, we introduce the first parallel algorithm for the exact computation of the Jones polynomial for (collections of) both open and closed simple curves in 3-space. This algorithm enables the reduction of the computational time by an exponential factor depending on the number of processors. We demonstrate the advantage of this algorithm by applying it to knots, as well as to systems of linear polymers in a melt obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. The method is general and could be applied to other invariants and measures of complexity.</description>

      <title>A cut-and-paste mechanism to introduce fundamental group and construct new four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple cut-and-paste mechanism to construct both orientable and nonorientable four-manifolds from a given initial one. This mechanism alters the fundamental group while preserving other essential topological invariants. It avoids codimension two cut-and-paste fundamental group computations and fast tracks the search for fixed-point free involutions. The mechanism proves useful to unveil novel exotic irreducible smooth structures on closed four-manifolds with finite cyclic fundamental group, which include $\Q$-homology real projective four-spaces.</description>

      <title>Associated groups of symmetric quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the structure of associated groups of symmetric quandles. We explore the relationship between the associated group of a symmetric quandle and that of its underlying quandle. A group-theoretic characterization of the associated groups of symmetric quandles is presented. Moreover, we prove that a symmetric quandle is embeddable if and only if its underlying quandle is embeddable. Finally, we determine the abelianizations of these associated groups.</description>

      <title>A lookup table for large-genus asymptotics of saddle connection Siegel-Veech constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Siegel-Veech constants are powerful tools for counting saddle connections on a translation surface. Their computation can be involved, most famously with recursive formulas that use intricate combinatorics or intersection theory. From recursive formulas, asymptotics of Siegel--Veech constants for growing genus can be extracted. In this survey, we collect some known asymptotics and explicitly calculate some special cases of asymptotics that show up in applications.</description>

      <title>Simplifying generic smooth maps to the 2-sphere and to the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how to construct explicit deformations of generic smooth maps from closed $n$--dimensional manifolds $M$ with $n \geq 2$ to the $2$--sphere $S^2$ and show that every smooth map $M \to S^2$ is homotopic to a $C^\infty$ stable map with at most one cusp point and with only folds of the middle absolute index. Furthermore, if $n$ is even, such a $C^\infty$ stable map can be so constructed that the restriction to the singular point set is a topological embedding. As a corollary, we show that for $n \geq 2$ even, there always exists a $C^\infty$ stable map $M \to \mathbf{R}^2$ with at most one cusp point such that the restriction to the singular point set is a topological embedding. As another corollary, we give a new proof to the existence of an open book structure on odd dimensional manifolds which extends a given one on the boundary, originally due to Quinn. Finally, using the open book structure thus constructed, we show that $k$--connected $n$--dimensional manifolds always admit a fold map into $\mathbf{R}^2$ without folds of absolute indices $i$ with $1 \leq i \leq k$, for $n \geq 7$ odd and $1 \leq k \leq (n-5)/2$.</description>

      <title>Corks, exotic 4-manifolds and genus functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every 4-dimensional oriented handlebody without 3- and 4-handles can be modified to admit infinitely many exotic smooth structures, and further that their genus functions are pairwise equivalent. We furthermore show that, for any 4-manifold admitting an embedding into a symplectic 4-manifold with weakly convex boundary, its genus function is algebraically realized as those of infinitely many pairwise exotic 4-manifolds. We also prove that, for any two 4-manifolds with non-degenerate intersection forms, algebraic inequivalences of genus functions are stable under connected sums and boundary sums with a certain type of 4-manifolds having arbitrarily large second Betti numbers. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of genus function type for diffeomorphism invariants and show that similar results hold for any such invariant. As an application of our exotic 4-manifolds, we also prove that for any (possibly non-orientable) 4-manifold, every submanifold of codimension less than two satisfying a mild condition can be modified to admit infinitely many exotically knotted copies.</description>

      <title>Surface Subgroups for Cocompact Lattices of Isometries of $H^{2n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of surface subgroups within any cocompact lattice $\Gamma$ in $\mathrm{SO}(2n,1)$ for $n\geq2$. This result addresses the cases missing from the work of Hamenst\"adt in 2015, who constructed surface subgroups in cocompact lattices for all other rank-one semisimple Lie groups of non-compact type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the isometries of the complex hyperbolic bidisk, that is, the product space $\mathbb{H}^2_{\mathbb{C}} \times \mathbb{H}^2_{\mathbb{C}} $, where each factor $ \mathbb{H}^2_{\mathbb{C}} $ denotes the complex hyperbolic plane. We investigate the Dirichlet domain formed by the action of a cyclic subgroup $(g_1, g_2)$, where each $g_i$ is loxodromic. We prove that such a Dirichlet domain has two sides.</description>

      <title>A categorification of Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT with application to TQFTs and once-extended TQFTs derived from strict omega-groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first revisit the construction of Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT, which depends on the choice of a homotopy finite space, $\boldsymbol{B}$. This constitutes a vast generalisation of the Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT, with a trivial cocycle, and of Yetter's homotopy 2-type TQFT. We build our construction directly from homotopy theoretical techniques, and hence, as in Quinn's original notes from 1995, the construction works in all dimensions.
  Our aim in this is to provide background for giving in detail the construction of a once-extended TQFT categorifying Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT, in the form of a symmetric monoidal bifunctor from the bicategory of manifolds, cobordisms and extended cobordisms, first to the symmetric monoidal bicategory of profunctors (enriched over vector spaces), and then to the Morita bicategory of algebras, bimodules and bimodule maps. These once-extended versions of Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT likewise are defined for all dimensions, and, as with the original version, depend on the choice of a homotopy finite space, $\boldsymbol{B}$.
  To show the utility of this approach, we explicitly compute both Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT, and its extended version, for the case when $\boldsymbol{B}$ is the classifying space of a homotopy finite omega-groupoid, in this paper taking the form of a crossed complex, following Brown and Higgins.
  The constructions in this paper include, in particular, the description of once-extended TQFTs derived from the classifying space of a finite strict 2-group, of relevance for modelling discrete higher gauge theory, although the techniques involved are considerably more general.</description>

      <title>Random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms (complex generalized H\'{e}non maps and their conjugate maps) of $\Bbb{C}^{2}.$ We show that a generic random dynamical system of polynomial automorphisms has ``mean stablity'' on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$. Further, we show that if a system has mean stability, then (1) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma =(\gamma _{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$ of maps, the maximal Lyapunov exponents of $\gamma $ at $z$ is negative, (2) there are only finitely many minimal sets of the system, (3) each minimal set is attracting, (4) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma $ of maps, the orbit $\{ \gamma _{n}\cdots \gamma _{1}(z) \} _{n=1}^{\infty }$ tends to one of the minimal sets of the system, and (5) the transition operator of the system has the spectrum gap property on the space of Hoelder continuous functions with some exponent. Note that none of (1)--(5) can hold for any deterministic iteration dynamical system of a single complex generalized H\'{e}non map. We observe many new phenomena in random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms of $\Bbb{C}^{2}$ and observe the mechanisms. We provide new strategies and methods to study higher-dimensional random holomorphic dynamical systems.</description>
