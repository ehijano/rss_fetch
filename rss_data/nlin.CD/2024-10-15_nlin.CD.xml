      <title>Oscillatory solutions at the continuum limit of Lorenz 96 systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the generation and propagation of oscillatory solutions observed in the widely used Lorenz 96 (L96) systems. First, period-two oscillations between adjacent grid points are found in the leading-order expansions of the discrete L96 system. The evolution of the envelope of period-two oscillations is described by a set of modulation equations with strictly hyperbolic structure. The modulation equations are found to be also subject to an additional reaction term dependent on the grid size, and the period-two oscillations will break down into fully chaotic dynamics when the oscillation amplitude grows large. Then, similar oscillation solutions are analyzed in the two-layer L96 model including multiscale coupling. Modulation equations for period-three oscillations are derived based on a weakly nonlinear analysis in the transition between oscillatory and nonoscillatory regions. Detailed numerical experiments are shown to confirm the analytical results.</description>

      <title>Variational data assimilation in wall turbulence: From outer observations to wall stress and pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation of near-wall turbulence in channel flow from outer observations is investigated using adjoint-variational data assimilation. We first consider fully resolved velocity data, starting at a distance from the wall. By enforcing the estimated flow to exactly satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, we seek a statistically stationary turbulent state that reproduces the instantaneous outer measurements. Such an estimated state provides full access to the unknown near-wall turbulence, including the wall shear stresses and pressure. When the first observation is within fifty viscous units from the wall, the correlation coefficient between the true and estimated state exceeds 95%. As the observations are further separated from the wall, at ninety viscous units, the accuracy of the assimilated wall stresses decreases to 40% at the wall. This trend is nearly independent of the Reynolds number. The Fourier spectrum of the estimation error is qualitatively consistent with the coherence spectrum between the outer and the inner state variables: observed long wavelength structures in the outer flow have deeper coherence into the unobserved near-wall region, and therefore the error is lowest at large scales. Nevertheless, the adjoint-variational approach provides a more rigorous quantification of the capacity to accurately predict the instantaneous near-wall turbulence from outer measurements. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of the estimation accuracy using filtered and sub-sampled outer observations.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics and integrability of a Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with linear functional response and generalist predator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deal with a Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with a generalist or alternating food for predator and linear functional response. Using a topological equivalent polynomial system we prove that the system is not Liouvillian (hence also not Darboux) integrable. In order to study the global dynamics of this model, we use the Poincar\'e compactification of $\mathbb{R}^2$ to characterize all phase portraits in the Poincar\'e disc, obtaining two different topological phase portraits.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of McMillan mappings III. Symmetric map with mixed nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article extends the study of dynamical properties of the symmetric McMillan map, emphasizing its utility in understanding and modeling complex nonlinear systems. Although the map features six parameters, we demonstrate that only two are irreducible: the linearized rotation number at the fixed point and a nonlinear parameter representing the ratio of terms in the biquadratic invariant. Through a detailed analysis, we classify regimes of stable motion, provide exact solutions to the mapping equations, and derive a canonical set of action-angle variables, offering analytical expressions for the rotation number and nonlinear tune shift. We further establish connections between general standard-form mappings and the symmetric McMillan map, using the area-preserving H\'eon map and accelerator lattices with thin sextupole magnet as representative case studies. Our results show that, despite being a second-order approximation, the symmetric McMillan map provides a highly accurate depiction of dynamics across a wide range of system parameters, demonstrating its practical relevance in both theoretical and applied contexts.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the nonlinear diffusion of the proton beam halo at the CERN LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In circular particle accelerators, storage rings, or colliders, mitigating beam losses is critical to ensuring optimal performance, particularly for rings that include superconducting magnets. A thorough understanding of beam-halo dynamics is essential for this purpose. This paper presents recent results for the measurement of the nonlinear diffusion process of the beam halo at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The novel approach used in this paper is based on the analytical framework of the Nekhoroshev theorem, which provides a functional form for the diffusion coefficient. By monitoring the beam loss signal during controlled movements of the collimator jaws, we determine the beam losses at equilibrium for various amplitudes and analyze the beam-halo distribution. Post-processing of these measurements provides the nonlinear diffusion coefficient, which is found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical assumptions. Measurements from an experiment investigating the effectiveness of beam-beam compensation using beam-beam compensation wires also provide a direct assessment of the compensation's effectiveness on beam-tail diffusion.</description>

      <title>Deformation of invariant tori under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study extends the functional perturbation theory~(FPT) of dynamical systems, initially developed for investigating the shifts of invariant (un)stable manifolds within chaotic regions when subjected to global perturbations. In contrast, invariant tori reside in the ordered regions of the phase space, where periodic orbits are parabolic in conservative systems. For example, in magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) devices, invariant tori appear as closed flux surfaces, whose nested structure dominates radial transport and, consequently, the overall confinement performance. This Letter provides formulae characterizing the deformation of invariant tori under perturbation.</description>
