      <title>New tissue engineered scaffolds for rotator cuff tendon-bone interface regeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healing of Tendon-bone interface(TBI) injuries is slow and is often repaired with scar tissue formation that compromises normal function. Despite the increasing maturity of surgical techniques, re-tearing of the rotator cuff after surgery remains common. The main reason for this issue is that the original structure of the rotator cuff at the TBI area is difficult to fully restore after surgery, and anatomical healing of the rotator cuff TBI is challenging to achieve solely through surgery. With the advancement of tissue engineering technology, more and more basic researchers and clinical surgeons are recognizing the enormous potential of tissue engineering in promoting TBI healing. Growing research evidence indicates that tissue engineering technology not only effectively promotes repairing and remodeling of the TBI but also reduces the formation of fibrous vascular scar tissue, leading to more orderly tissue reconstruction. The core of tissue engineering technology approaches lies in combining the use of various scaffolds, cells and bioactive molecules to simulate the natural environment of TBI healing, achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes. In this review, we will systematically summarize and highlight recent progress in the application of tissue engineering on TBI regeneration, particularly focusing on advancements in novel scaffolds and their role and potential in promoting healing of the TBI of rotator cuff, providing valuable references for clinical application and research.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised risk factor identification across cancer types and data modalities via explainable artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Risk stratification is a key tool in clinical decision-making, yet current approaches often fail to translate sophisticated survival analysis into actionable clinical criteria. We present a novel method for unsupervised machine learning that directly optimizes for survival heterogeneity across patient clusters through a differentiable adaptation of the multivariate logrank statistic. Unlike most existing methods that rely on proxy metrics, our approach represents novel methodology for training any neural network architecture on any data modality to identify prognostically distinct patient groups. We thoroughly evaluate the method in simulation experiments and demonstrate its utility in practice by applying it to two distinct cancer types: analyzing laboratory parameters from multiple myeloma patients and computed tomography images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, identifying prognostically distinct patient subgroups with significantly different survival outcomes in both cases. Post-hoc explainability analyses uncover clinically meaningful features determining the group assignments which align well with established risk factors and thus lend strong weight to the methods utility. This pan-cancer, model-agnostic approach represents a valuable advancement in clinical risk stratification, enabling the discovery of novel prognostic signatures across diverse data types while providing interpretable results that promise to complement treatment personalization and clinical decision-making in oncology and beyond.</description>

      <title>Graph-Convolutional-Beta-VAE for Synthetic Abdominal Aorta Aneurysm Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13628v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation plays a crucial role in medical research by mitigating privacy concerns and enabling large-scale patient data analysis. This study presents a beta-Variational Autoencoder Graph Convolutional Neural Network framework for generating synthetic Abdominal Aorta Aneurysms (AAA). Using a small real-world dataset, our approach extracts key anatomical features and captures complex statistical relationships within a compact disentangled latent space. To address data limitations, low-impact data augmentation based on Procrustes analysis was employed, preserving anatomical integrity. The generation strategies, both deterministic and stochastic, manage to enhance data diversity while ensuring realism. Compared to PCA-based approaches, our model performs more robustly on unseen data by capturing complex, nonlinear anatomical variations. This enables more comprehensive clinical and statistical analyses than the original dataset alone. The resulting synthetic AAA dataset preserves patient privacy while providing a scalable foundation for medical research, device testing, and computational modeling.</description>
