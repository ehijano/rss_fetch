      <title>Results on Logarithmic Coefficients for the Class of Bounded Turning Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is crucial to explore the sharp bounds of logarithmic coefficients and the Hankel determinant involving logarithmic coefficients as part of coefficient problems in various function classes. Our primary objective in this study is to determine the sharp bounds for logarithmic coefficients as well as logarithmic inverse coefficients of bounded analytic functions associated with a bean-shaped domain in the class $\mathcal{BT_\mathfrak{B}}$. For this class, we also establish the sharp bounds for the second Hankel determinant involving logarithmic coefficients as well as logarithmic inverse coefficients. In addition, we establish sharp bounds for the generalized Zalcman conjecture inequality and the moduli differences of logarithmic coefficients for the class $\mathcal{BT_\mathfrak{B}}$.</description>

      <title>The dimension-free Gehring-Hayman inequality for quasigeodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known theorem of J. Heinonen and S. Rohde in 1993 states that if $D\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is quasiconformally equivalently to an uniform domain, then the Gehring-Hayman inequality holds in $D$: quasihyperbolic geodesics in $D$ minimizes the Euclidean length among all curves in $D$ with the same end points, up to a universal dimension-dependent multiplicative constant.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach to thstrengthen the above result in the following three aspects: 1) obtain a dimension-free multiplicative constant in the Gehring-Hayman inequality; 2) relax the class of quasihyperbolic geodesics to more general quasigeodesics; 3) relax the quasiconformal equivalence to more general coarsely quasihyperbolic equivalence.
  As a byproduct of our general approach, we are able to prove that the above improved Gehring-Hayman inequality indeed holds in Banach spaces. This answers affirmatively an open problem raised by J. Heinonen and S. Rohde in 1993 and reformulated by J. V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} in 2005.</description>

      <title>On meromorphic solutions of certain Fermat-type difference and analogues equations concerning open problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have found that some certain Fermat-type shift and difference equations have the meromorphic solutions generated by Riccati type functions. Also we have solved the open problems posed by Liu and Yang (A note on meromorphic solutions of Fermat types equations, An. Stiint. Univ. Al. I. Cuza Lasi Mat. (N. S.), 62(2)(1), 317-325 (2016)). We have fortified the claims by some examples.</description>

      <title>Three topological phases of the elliptic Ginibre ensembles with a point charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the complex and symplectic elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $(c+1)N \times (c+1)N$, conditioned to have a deterministic eigenvalue at $ p \in \mathbb{R} $ with multiplicity $ c N $. We show that their limiting spectrum is either simply connected, doubly connected, or composed of two disjoint simply connected components. Moreover, denoting by $\tau \in [0,1]$ the non-Hermiticity parameter, we explicitly characterise the regions in the parameter space $ (p, c, \tau) $ where each topological type emerges. For cases where the droplet is either simply or doubly connected, we provide an explicit description of the limiting spectrum and the corresponding electrostatic energies. As an application, we derive the asymptotic behaviour of the moments of the characteristic polynomial for elliptic Ginibre matrices in the exponentially varying regime.</description>

      <title>Hypercyclicity of Toeplitz operators with smooth symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the dynamics of Toeplitz operators $T_F$ with smooth symbols $F$ on the Hardy spaces of the unit disk $H^p$, $p&gt;1$. Building on a model theory for Toeplitz operators on $H^2$ developed by Yakubovich in the 90's, we carry out an in-depth study of hypercyclicity properties of such operators. Under some rather general smoothness assumptions on the symbol, we provide some necessary/sufficient/necessary and sufficient conditions for $T_F$ to be hypercyclic on $H^p$. In particular, we extend previous results on the subject by Baranov-Lishanskii and Abakumov-Baranov-Charpentier-Lishanskii. We also study some other dynamical properties for this class of operators.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Holomorphic Hamiltonian Systems and K\"ahler Duality of Complex Coadjoint Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is split up into two parts: The first one concerns (pseudo)-holomorphic Hamiltonian systems, while the second part is about K\"ahler structures of complex coadjoint orbits. We begin the first part by investigating basic properties of holomorphic Hamiltonian systems (HHSs) like maximal holomorphic trajectories and holomorphic Hamiltonian foliations. Afterwards, we use these notions to combine HHSs with two structures frequently studied in geometry, namely Lefschetz and almost toric fibrations, leading us to the notion of a holomorphic symplectic Lefschetz fibration. Following this examination, we formulate action functionals for HHSs. These action functionals are well-suited to find periodic orbits. However, it turns out that HHSs rarely exhibit periodic orbits. One possible obstruction for a HHS to possess periodic orbits is the integrability of the underlying complex structure. To circumvent this obstruction, we introduce the notion of pseudo-holomorphic Hamiltonian systems (PHHSs) which allow us to describe classical mechanics on almost complex manifolds. We show that PHHSs satisfy almost the same properties as HHSs. In the second part, we study coadjoint orbits of complex Lie groups and show that they also exhibit, next to their Hyperk\"ahler structure which was introduced by Kronheimer and Kovalev in the 90s, a holomorphic K\"ahler structure. A holomorphic K\"ahler structure can be thought of as a complexification of a usual K\"ahler structure. We call the fact that a space admits both Hyperk\"ahler and holomorphic K\"ahler structures ''K\"ahler duality''. In this thesis, we suspect that the K\"ahler duality of complex coadjoint orbits can be traced back to double cotangent bundles. Precisely speaking, we conjecture that double cotangent bundles naturally exhibit K\"ahler duality and that this K\"ahler duality transfers via reduction to complex coadjoint orbits.</description>

      <title>Rationally Convex Surfaces with hyperbolic complex tangencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the first examples of rationally convex surfaces in the complex plane with hyperbolic complex tangencies. In fact, we give two very different types of rationally convex surfaces: those that admit analytic fillings by handle-bodies, and those that do not have any compact Riemann surfaces attached at all. The fillable examples all live in the round sphere and are unknotted, while the non-fillable examples can moreover be produced in several different smooth isotopy classes.</description>

      <title>Regular immersions directed by algebraically elliptic cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an open Riemann surface and $A$ be the punctured cone in $\mathbb{C}^n\setminus\{0\}$ on a smooth projective variety $Y$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. Recently, Runge approximation theorems with interpolation for holomorphic immersions $M\to\mathbb{C}^n$, directed by $A$, have been proved under the assumption that $A$ is an Oka manifold. We prove analogous results in the algebraic setting, for regular immersions directed by $A$ from a smooth affine curve $M$ into $\mathbb{C}^n$. The Oka property is naturally replaced by the stronger assumption that $A$ is algebraically elliptic, which it is if $Y$ is uniformly rational. Under this assumption, a homotopy-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition for approximation and interpolation emerges. We show that this condition is satisfied in many cases of interest.</description>

Abstract: We show that the complex projective space is the only projective manifold compactifying $\mathbb{C}^n$ by a smooth connected hypersurface, provided $n$ is even. In the odd dimensional case we give some partial results. The case when $n \equiv 1 $ mod $4$ has now been settled by Ping Li.</description>
