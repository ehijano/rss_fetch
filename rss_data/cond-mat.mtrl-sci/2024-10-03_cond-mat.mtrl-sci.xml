      <title>Near room temperature ferrimagnetism and half-metallicity in disordered Ca1.5La0.5MnRuO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron spin polarization on half-metallic double-perovskites is usually conditioned to the ordered rock-salt arrangement of the transition-metal ions along the lattice. In this work, we investigate a polycrystalline sample of the Ca1.5La0.5MnRuO6 compound by employing x-ray powder diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, x-ray absorption and magnetic circular dichroism at the Mn-L2,3 and Ru-M2,3 edges, magnetometry, electrical transport and first principles calculations in order to show that this is a fully disordered material exhibiting near room temperature ferrimagnetism and half-metallic conductivity, with significant intergrain tunneling magnetoresistance. These unprecedented results are compared to those of archetypical ordered double-perovskites, and discussed in terms of the Mn and Ru valences and their orbital hybridization.</description>

      <title>Exploring diffusion bonding of niobium and its alloys with tungsten and a molybdenum alloy for high-energy particle target applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-producing targets in high-energy research facilities are often made from refractory metals, and they typically require dedicated cooling systems due to the challenging thermomechanical conditions they experience. However, direct contact of water with target blocks can induce erosion, corrosion, and embrittlement, especially of tungsten (W). One approach to overcoming this problem is cladding the blocks with tantalum (Ta). Unfortunately, Ta generates high decay heat when irradiated, raising safety concerns in the event of a loss-of-cooling accident. This study explored the capacity of niobium (Nb) and its alloys to form diffusion bonds with W and TZM (a molybdenum alloy with titanium and zirconium). This is because the Beam Dump Facility (BDF), a planned new fixed-target installation in CERN's North Area, uses these target materials. The bonding quality of pure Nb, Nb1Zr, and C103 (a Nb alloy with 10% hafnium and 1% titanium) with TZM and W obtained using hot isostatic pressing (HIP) was evaluated. The effects of different HIP temperatures and the introduction of a Ta interlayer were examined. Optical microscopy indicated promising bonding interfaces, which were further characterized using tensile tests and thermal-diffusivity measurements. Their performance under high-energy beam impact was validated using thermomechanical simulations. C103 exhibited higher interface strengths and safety factors than Ta2.5W, positioning it as a potential alternative cladding material for the BDF production target. The findings highlight the viability of Nb-based materials, particularly C103, for improving operational safety and efficiency in fixed-target physics experiments; however, considerations regarding the long half-life of 94Nb require further attention.</description>

      <title>Thermal properties of SnSe nanoflakes by AFM-based Scanning Thermal Microscopy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the thermal resistance of SnSe nanoflakes using scanning thermal microscopy, an extension of atomic force microscopy that allows for nanoscale thermal mapping. The nanoflakes studied ranged in thickness from 5 nm to 40 nm, enabling us to observe the thermal properties across a wide range of dimensions. Our results show a clear trend: as the thickness of the nanoflakes increases, the thermal resistance also increases. This suggests that diffusive mechanisms govern heat transport in SnSe nanoflakes and follow Fourier's law of heat conduction. The observed behavior can be attributed to the inherently short phonon mean free path in SnSe which is on the order of 5 nm at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Strongly Enhanced Electronic Bandstructure Renormalization by Light in Nanoscale Strained Regions of Monolayer MoS$_2$/Au(111) Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the photoexcited quasiparticle (QP) dynamics in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides lays the foundation for exploring the strongly interacting, non-equilibrium 2D quasiparticle and polaritonic states in these quantum materials and for harnessing the properties emerging from these states for optoelectronic applications. In this study, scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy with light illumination at the tunneling junction is performed to investigate the QP dynamics in monolayer MoS$_2$ on an Au(111) substrate with nanoscale corrugations. The corrugations on the surface of the substrate induce nanoscale local strain in the overlaying monolayer MoS$_2$ single crystal, which result in energetically favorable spatial regions where photoexcited QPs, including excitons, trions, and electron-hole plasmas, accumulate. These strained regions exhibit pronounced electronic bandstructure renormalization as a function of the photoexcitation wavelength and intensity as well as the strain gradient, implying strong interplay among nanoscale structures, strain, and photoexcited QPs. In conjunction with the experimental work, we construct a theoretical framework that integrates non-uniform nanoscale strain into the electronic bandstructure of a monolayer MoS$_2$ lattice using a tight-binding approach combined with first-principle calculations. This methodology enables better understanding of the experimental observation of photoexcited QP localization in the nanoscale strain-modulated electronic bandstructure landscape. Our findings illustrate the feasibility of utilizing nanoscale architectures and optical excitations to manipulate the local electronic bandstructure of monolayer TMDs and to enhance the many-body interactions of excitons, which is promising for the development of nanoscale energy-adjustable optoelectronic and photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Electrochemical Limits Preceding Dendrite Penetration in Ceramic Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes have the potential to stabilize lithium metal anodes, which hold the promise to increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries. However, lithium metal dendrites that occur locally at the solid-solid interface plague the solid-state lithium metal cells during charging, limiting the cycle life, and rendering high safety risks in practical applications. While multiple explanations have been proposed, understandings of the dynamics preceding and causing the metal penetration in solid electrolytes are still not conclusive. Here, by testing many highly consistent Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) samples and utilizing an improved operando technique on symmetrical cells, we observed a consistent and statistically significant trend of current-dependent dendrite initiation time, which coincides with the Sand's time scaling in liquid electrolytes. This new understanding offers an electrochemical origin of dendritic initiation but also provides future insight into optimal all-solid-state battery design.</description>

      <title>Comparison between upconversion response of $Er^{3+}$ sensitised with $Yb^{3+}$ in various oxidic ceramic hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upconversion process for the $Er^{3+}$ ion, when irradiated with IR photons at 980 nm, strongly depends upon the presence of the sensitizer $Yb^{3+}$ ions. There are many studies analyzing the properties of the upconversion process for various crystalline ceramic matrices, but these, in their overwhelming majority, focus on only one compound. Comparative studies are very scarce, and the treatment of each case is limited. The purpose of this study is the comparison of the upconversion response of $Er^{3+}$ in some $Er^{3+}$:$Yb^{3+}$-doped oxidic ceramics. This comparison helps to observe aspects of the phenomena that are common across the cases, like the variation of red-green intensity ratios when the sensitizer's $Yb^{3+}$ concentration is increased, offering hints about the mechanism by which $Er^{3+}$ is sensitized by $Yb^{3+}$. Sol-gel methods were used to obtain doped oxidic ceramics, which were characterized by XRD and SEM and their upconversion spectra were measured. There is a good correlation between the relative and absolute concentrations of the activator and sensitizer species and the intensities of the emission lines in the visible spectra. We observed that the ratios between emission intensities in the green band (510 - 580 nm) and red band (640 - 700 nm) (i.e., the spectral content) show similarities between different host crystals for $Er^{3+}$ and $Yb^{3+}$, which are indications that, regardless of the crystalline medium of hosting, the dopant ions interact in some specific and similar ways, and a hypothesis explaining this is suggested.</description>

      <title>Orbital torque switching of perpendicular magnetization in light metal/ferrimagnet bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital torque, associated with orbital current, enables light metals to efficiently manipulate magnetization with rich tunability. A clear demonstration of perpendicular magnetization switching using light metals alone is essential for understanding orbital physics and developing high-density orbitronic devices. Here, we report orbital torque switching of perpendicular magnetization in light metal (Ti, V, Cr)/ferrimagnet (Fe1-xGdx) bilayers. Taking the Ti/ Fe1-xGdx sample as a model system, the torque efficiency increases four-fold by enhancing the spin-orbit coupling in Fe1-xGdx through modulating Gd composition, which is a characteristic feature of orbital torque. Our findings demonstrate that light metals in combination with rare earth-transition metal ferrimagnets can be employed for efficient orbitronic devices and serve as a model system for studying orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional materials as ideal substrates for molecular quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and manipulation of non-classical light states is central to emerging quantum technologies. Color centers in insulating crystals have been extensively studied for single-photon generation, but organic molecules immobilized on substrates have gained attention due to their superior scalability, large oscillator strengths, and tunable emission frequency. Here, we use first principles calculations to investigate the photoemission spectrum of organic molecules adsorbed on various 2D materials. Machine learning interatomic potentials are combined with density functional theory to accelerate the search for stable adsorption configurations. The calculated zero phonon line (ZPL) energies and emission lineshapes show excellent agreement with experiments. Our results indicate that the 2D substrate couples weakly to the molecular transitions and that emission characteristics are almost universal across different substrates. The unique effect of the 2D substrate is to introduce a sharp sideband(s) near the ZPL as a fingerprint of hindered rotational and translational modes of the molecule.</description>

      <title>Megahertz cycling of ultrafast structural dynamics enabled by nanosecond thermal dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions are of fundamental scientific and technological interest. Ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction with combined femtosecond-nanometer resolution elucidate the laser-induced dynamics in structurally heterogeneous systems. These measurements, however, remain challenging due to the brightness limitation of pulsed electron sources, leading to an experimental trade-off between resolution and contrast. Higher signals without compromising the electron beam coherence can be achieved by enhanced duty cycles, thus far limited to few-kHz repetition rates by the cooling times in thin-film specimens. Here, we combine nanometric electron-beam probing with sample support structures tailored to accommodate rapid thermal relaxation. A charge-density wave (CDW) phase transformation allows us to quantify the mean temperature increase induced by pulsed laser illumination. Varying the excitation fluence and repetition rate, we gauge the impact of excitation confinement and efficient dissipation on the thermal relaxation of different sample designs. In particular, a thermally optimized support can dissipate average laser intensities of up to \SI{200}{\micro\watt\per\um^2} within a few nanoseconds, allowing for reversible driving and probing of the CDW transition at a repetition rate of \SI{2}{\MHz}. Sample designs tailored to ultrafast measurement schemes will thus extend the capabilities of electron diffraction and microscopy, enabling high-resolution investigations of structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Assessing the electronic excitation spectra of chromium, palladium and samarium from their stopping quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic excitation spectrum of a material characterises the response to external electromagnetic perturbations through its energy loss function (ELF), which is obtained from several experimental sources that usually do not completely agree among them. In this work we assess the available ELF of three metals, namely chromium, palladium and samarium, by using the dielectric formalism to calculate relevant stopping quantities, such as the stopping cross sections for protons and alpha particles, as well as the corresponding electron inelastic mean free paths. Comparing these quantities (as calculated from different sets of ELF) with the available experimental data for each of the analysed metals, we conclude that currently their most reliable ELF are those obtained by means of the recently proposed reverse Monte Carlo method. This work also analyses the contribution of different electronic shells to the electronic excitation spectra of these materials, and reveals the important role that the excitation of ``semi-core'' bands play on the energy loss mechanism for these metals.</description>

      <title>On the material genome of wurtzite ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the dielectric film thickness shrinks to ~10 nm, some traditional wurtzite piezoelectric materials demonstrate ferroelectricity through element doping. Among them, Sc doped AlN and Mg doped ZnO are the most famous examples. While it is widely acknowledged that the dopant atoms effectively reduce the coercive field, enabling ferroelectric polarization switching, the material genome of these wurtzite (WZ) ferroelectrics is still less understood. In this work, we analyze the features of WZ ferroelectrics, ascribing them to five-coordination (5C) ferroelectrics, which may be compared with 6C ferroelectrics (perovskite-type) and 7C ferroelectrics (hafnia-like). In particular, the exact reason for their adopting the hexagonal WZ structure instead of the zinc blende structure is studied. Emphasis is paid to the degree of ionicity in promoting the hexagonal arrangement, and the phenomenon of layer distance compression is discovered and explained in WZ ferroelectrics. The role of element doping in coercive field reduction is understood within this context.</description>

      <title>Laser induced transition in Cerium Oxide thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex interaction between the intrinsic and extrinsic state variables of strongly correlated insulator thin films is drawing interest as it shows memristive behavior that may be used in neuromorphic computing. In this study, we have observed that laser irradiation in cerium oxide thin film helps to make transition from metastable state. We study the transport properties of cerium oxide thin film which shows the metal-insulator transition. As for ceria the reduction of oxidation states depends upon oxygen vacancy defects which can be controlled by external ways due to which the transport property can vary. In this study, a decrease in the value of transition temperature under dark conditions was observed as laser-induced and we have explained this result by the generation of energy states observed from temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) study, oxygen vacancy defects, and polaron hopping within ceria.</description>

      <title>Spin waves with source-free time-dependent spin density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent spin density functional theory (TD-SDFT) allows the theoretical description of spin and magnetization dynamics in electronic systems from first quantum mechanical principles. TD-SDFT accounts for electronic interaction effects via exchange-correlation scalar potentials and magnetic fields, which have to be suitably approximated in practice. We consider here an approach that was recently proposed for the ground state by Sharma et al. [J. Chem. Theor. Comput. 14, 1247 (2018)], which enforces the so-called "source-free" condition by eliminating monopole contributions contained within a given approximate exchange-correlation magnetic field. This procedure was shown to give good results for the structure of magnetic materials. We analyze the source-free construction in the linear-response regime, considering spin waves in paramagnetic and ferromagnetic electron gases. We observe a violation of Larmor's theorem in the paramagnetic case and a wrong long-wavelength behavior of ferromagnetic magnons. The practical implications of these violations are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Enhanced Conductivity and Structure Change in Defective Li4Ti5O12 or Blue-LTO : a study combined theoretical and experimental perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spinel Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) has emerged as a promising anode material for the next generation of all-solid-state Li-ion batteries (ASSB), primarily due to its characteristic "zero strain" charge/discharge behavior and exceptional cycling stability, which significantly prolongs battery lifespan. Pristine LTO, however, is hindered by poor ionic and electronic conductivity. By employing tailored sintering protocols that create oxygen vacancies, a high-performing, blue LTO material is achieved. It has been proposed that the increased electronic conductivity could stem from vacancy-induced polarons. Yet, detailed insights into polaron stability, distribution, and dynamics within both the LTO bulk and surface have remained elusive due to limited information on structural changes. Utilizing Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) and Coincidence Doppler Broadening Spectroscopy (CDBS), in conjunction with Two Component Density Functional Theory (TCDFT) with the on-site Hubbard U correction, enables us to probe the depth profile of defect species introduced by sintering in a reductive environment. Our research provides direct evidence of oxygen vacancy formation within the subsurface region, an inference drawn from the observation of \ch{Ti^{3+}}. Our investigation into Li16d vacancy formation within the bulk region uncovers the interactions between mobile species, namely Li-ions and polarons. Furthermore, we delve into the polaron stability on the LTO surface, offering an explanation for the superior performance of the (100) facet exposed LTO nanoparticle, as compared to its (111) exposed counterpart.</description>

      <title>Measurements with Noise: Bayesian Optimization for Co-optimizing Noise and Property Discovery in Automated Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a Bayesian optimization (BO) workflow that integrates intra-step noise optimization into automated experimental cycles. Traditional BO approaches in automated experiments focus on optimizing experimental trajectories but often overlook the impact of measurement noise on data quality and cost. Our proposed framework simultaneously optimizes both the target property and the associated measurement noise by introducing time as an additional input parameter, thereby balancing the signal-to-noise ratio and experimental duration. Two approaches are explored: a reward-driven noise optimization and a double-optimization acquisition function, both enhancing the efficiency of automated workflows by considering noise and cost within the optimization process. We validate our method through simulations and real-world experiments using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM), demonstrating the successful optimization of measurement duration and property exploration. Our approach offers a scalable solution for optimizing multiple variables in automated experimental workflows, improving data quality, and reducing resource expenditure in materials science and beyond.</description>

      <title>Finite-element methods for noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling in real-space pseudopotential density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient finite-element approach for large-scale real-space pseudopotential density functional theory (DFT) calculations incorporating noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling. The approach builds on the open-source DFT-FE computational framework and addresses a crucial gap in real-space DFT calculations using finite elements, which previous studies have shown to offer several advantages over traditional DFT basis sets. In particular, we derive the finite-element (FE) discretized governing equations involving 2-component spinors utilizing the locally reformulated electrostatics in the DFT problem and further develop a generalized force methodology to compute atomic forces and unit-cell stresses in a unified setting within this FE framework of DFT accounting for noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit effects. Additionally, we design an efficient self-consistent field iteration approach based on Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration procedure exploiting the sparsity of local and non-local parts of FE discretized Hamiltonian to solve the underlying nonlinear eigenvalue problem based on a two-grid strategy. Validation against plane-wave implementations shows excellent agreement in ground-state energetics, vertical ionization potentials, magnetic anisotropy energies, band structures, and spin textures. The proposed method achieves up to 8x-11x speed-ups for semi-periodic and non-periodic systems with ~5000-7000 electrons in terms of minimum wall times compared to widely used plane-wave implementations on CPUs in addition to exhibiting significant computational advantage on GPUs. This methodology provides a robust, systematically convergent framework for large-scale DFT calculations involving noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling, enabling more complex material simulations and extending the length scales of ab-initio studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we synthesized S functionalized graphene sponge electrode and applied it for electrochemical oxidation of five commonly used antibiotics, namely sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ofloxacin, roxithromycin and erythromycin, and inactivation of a multidrug resistant Escherichia coli, E. coli. The experiments were performed using real drinking water in a flow through, one pass mode. Highly polar antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole did not adsorb onto the graphene sponge but were completely removed, i.e., more than 95% removal, at low applied current densities, 14.5 A m2. Antibiotics with high affinity for pi pi interactions were completely removed already in the open circuit, and current application led to their further degradation. S doped graphene sponge anode resulted in 4.5 log removal of a multi-drug resistant E. coli at 29 A m2. There was no regrowth of bacteria observed during storage of the electrochemically treated samples, suggesting that the treatment severely impacted the cell viability. Further E. coli removal of 0.7 log was observed after the storage of electrochemically treated samples. The energy consumption of a continuously operated electrochemical system that achieved 4.5 log inactivation of a multidrug resistant E. coli and 87 to 99% removal of antibiotics was 1.1 kWh m3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of quantum spin liquid (QSL) states in condensed matter physics has drawn attention to kagome antiferromagnets (AFM) where a two-dimensional corner-sharing network of triangles frustrates conventional magnetic orders. While quantum kagome AFMs based on Cu$^{2+}$ (3d$^9$, $s=\frac{1}{2}$) ions have been extensively studied, there is so far little work beyond copper-based systems. Here we present our bulk magnetization, specific heat and neutron scattering studies on single crystals of a new titanium fluoride Cs$_8$RbK$_3$Ti$_{12}$F$_{48}$ where Ti$^{3+}$ (3d$^1$, $s = \frac{1}{2}$) ions form a breathing quantum kagome antiferromagnet that does not order magnetically down to 1.5 K. Our comprehensive map of the dynamic response function $S(Q,\hbar\omega)$ acquired at 1.5 K where the heat capacity is T-linear reveals a dispersive continuum emanating from soft lines that extend along (100). The data indicate fractionalized spinon-like excitations with quasi-one-dimensional dispersion within a quasi-two-dimensional spin system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic behavior of mixed systems containing the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and the nonionic surfactant polyethylene glycol dodecyl ether (Brij L4) in aqueous solutions was investigated. Electrical conductivity and interfacial tension measurements were employed to investigate the concentration-dependent properties of these surfactant mixtures. Two main experiments were conducted: i) constant ratio experiment: the overall surfactant concentration was varied while maintaining a fixed ratio between SDS and Brij L4. It was shown that the critical micelle concentration (CMC) determined from electrical conductivity measurements does not indicate the formation of the first mixed micelles as observed using tensiometry, but the point from which the adsorption of counterions by the existing micelles became important. By using the Regular Solution Theory (RST), it was found that the interaction between SDS and Brij L4 is synergistic, driven by dipole-ion interactions of the hydrophilic regions of the two surfactants. ii) Fixed SDS concentration while increase the Brij L4 concentration: the resulting electrical conductivity exhibited non-trivial behavior which complexity arose from simultaneous phenomena of incorporation of free SDS molecules into the micelles as Brij L4 concentration increased, leading to a decrease in electrical conductivity; liberation of some adsorbed counterions from the mixed micelles to the solution, which increases the conductivity and increase of viscosity due to Brij L4 further addition that leads to a sequential decrease in electrical conductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report evidence for superconductivity with onset temperatures up to 11 K in thin films of the infinite-layer nickelate parent compound NdNiO$_2$. A combination of oxide molecular-beam epitaxy and atomic hydrogen reduction yields samples with high crystallinity and low residual resistivities, a substantial fraction of which exhibit superconducting transitions. We survey a large series of samples with a variety of techniques, including electrical transport, scanning transmission electron microscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, to investigate the possible origins of superconductivity. We propose that superconductivity could be intrinsic to the undoped infinite-layer nickelates but suppressed by disorder due to its nodal order parameter, a finding which would necessitate a reconsideration of the nickelate phase diagram. Another possible hypothesis is that the parent materials can be hole doped from randomly dispersed apical oxygen atoms, which would suggest an alternative pathway for achieving superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Minimizing finite viscosity enhances relative kinetic energy absorption in bistable mechanical metamaterials but only with sufficiently fine discretization: a nonlinear dynamical size effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bistable mechanical metamaterials have shown promise for mitigating the harmful consequences of impact by converting kinetic energy into stored strain energy, offering an alternative and potentially synergistic approach to conventional methods of attenuating energy transmission. In this work, we numerically study the dynamic response of a one-dimensional bistable metamaterial struck by a high speed impactor (where the impactor velocity is commensurate with the sound speed), using the peak kinetic energy experienced at midpoint of the metamaterial compared to that in an otherwise identical linear system as our performance metric. We make five key findings: 1) The bistable material can counter-intuitively perform better (to nearly 1000x better than the linear system) as the viscosity decreases (but remains finite), but only when sufficiently fine discretization has been reached (i.e. the system approaches sufficiently close to the continuum limit); 2) This discretization threshold is sharp, and depends on the viscosity present; 3) The bistable materials can also perform significantly worse than linear systems (for low discretization and viscosity or zero viscosity); 4) The dependence on discretization stems from the partition of energy into trains of solitary waves that have pulse lengths proportional to the unit cell size, where, with intersite viscosity, the solitary wave trains induce high velocity gradients and thus enhanced damping compared to linear, and low-unit-cell-number bistable, materials; and 5) When sufficiently fine discretization has been reached at low viscosities, the bistable system outperforms the linear one for a wide range of impactor conditions. The first point is particularly important, as it shows the existence of a nonlinear dynamical size effect, where, given a protective layer of some thickness...</description>

      <title>Contrasting dynamical properties of single-Q and triple-Q magnetic orderings in a triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Q magnetic structures on triangular lattices, with their two-dimensional topological spin texture, have attracted significant interest. However, unambiguously confirming their formation by excluding the presence of three equally-populated single-Q domains remains challenging. In the metallic triangular lattice antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2, two magnetic ground states have been suggested at different temperature ranges, with the low-temperature phase being a triple-Q structure corresponding to the highest-density Skyrmion lattice. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and advanced spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate a clear distinction in the excitation spectra between the single-Q and triple-Q phases of Co1/3TaS2 and, more generally, a triangular lattice. First, we refined the spin Hamiltonian by fitting the excitation spectra measured in its paramagnetic phase, allowing us to develop an unbiased model independent of magnetic ordering. Second, we observed that the two magnetically ordered phases in Co1/3TaS2 exhibit markedly different behaviors in their long-wavelength Goldstone modes. Our spin model, derived from the paramagnetic phase, confirms that these behaviors originate from the single-Q and triple-Q nature of the respective ordered phases, providing unequivocal evidence of the single-Q to triple-Q phase transition in Co1/3TaS2. Importantly, we propose that the observed contrast in the long-wavelength spin dynamics between the single-Q and triple-Q orderings is universal, offering a potentially unique way to distinguish a generic triple-Q ordering on a triangular lattice from its multi-domain single-Q counterparts. We describe its applicability with examples of similar hexagonal systems forming potential triple-Q orderings. (For the full abstract, please refer to the manuscript)</description>

      <title>Dissipationless transport signature of topological nodal lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological materials, such as topological insulators or semimetals, usually not only reveal the nontrivial properties of their electronic wavefunctions through the appearance of stable boundary modes, but also through very specific electromagnetic responses. The anisotropic longitudinal magnetoresistance of Weyl semimetals, for instance, carries the signature of the chiral anomaly of Weyl fermions. However for topological nodal line semimetals -- materials where the valence and conduction bands cross each other on one-dimensional curves in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone -- such a characteristic has been lacking. Here we report the discovery of a peculiar charge transport effect generated by topological nodal lines: a dissipationless transverse signal in the presence of coplanar electric and magnetic fields, which originates from a Zeeman-induced conversion of topological nodal lines into Weyl nodes under infinitesimally small magnetic fields. We evidence this dissipationless topological response in trigonal \ce{PtBi2} persisting up to room temperature, and unveil the extensive topological nodal lines in the band structure of this non-magnetic material. These findings provide a new pathway to engineer Weyl nodes by arbitrary small magnetic fields and reveal that bulk topological nodal lines can exhibit non-dissipative transport properties.</description>

Abstract: The electronic and magnetic properties of recently synthesized new perovskite phase of HgMnO$_3$ are studied. By means of $ab$ $initio$ DFT calculations this material was shown to be altermagnetic. We discuss features of its electronic structure and unveil the physical mechanism of anomalous suppression of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in this material. While it is tempting to ascribe unexpectedly weak exchange interaction between nearest neighbors to crystal structure distortions, this is the indirect ferromagnetic exchange via Hg $6s$ states, which strongly affects the magnetic properties. This effect can be important not only for HgMnO$_3$, but also for many other transition metal compounds having empty $s$ states, placed not far above the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin BIC metasurfaces based on ultralow-loss Sb2Se3 phase-change material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) are increasingly recognised as promising platforms for tunable photonic devices due to their ability to modulate optical properties through solid-state phase transitions. Ultrathin and low-loss PCMs are highly valued for their fast and more effective phase transitions and applications in reconfigurable photonic chips, metasurfaces, optical modulators, sensors, photonic memories, and neuromorphic computing. However, conventional PCMs such as GST, GSST, VO2, and In3SbTe2, despite optimisation for tunable meta-optics, suffer from high intrinsic losses in the near-infrared (NIR) region, limiting their potential for high quality factor (Q-factor) resonant metasurfaces. Here we present the design and fabrication of tunable bound states in the continuum (BIC) metasurfaces using the ultralow-loss PCM Sb2Se3. Our BIC metasurfaces, only 25 nm thick, achieve high modulation depth and broad resonance tuning in the NIR with high Q-factors up to 130, without the need for additional materials. Experimentally, we employ these BIC metasurfaces to modulate photoluminescence in rare earth-doped upconversion nanoparticles, reducing the excitation power for multiphoton photoluminescence and enabling emission polarisation manipulation. This work offers a promising platform for developing active resonant metasurfaces in the NIR region, with broad applications including super resolution imaging, optical modulation, ultrafast switches, harmonic generation, colour filtering, and optical sensing.</description>

      <title>Amplifying the antiferromagnetic spin Seebeck effect through topological magnons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological magnons emerge as topologically protected spin wave states at the edges of magnets. Here, we theoretically explore how these surface states can be harnessed to amplify the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in antiferromagnets (AFMs) interfaced with normal metals (NMs). Based on a microscopic model of a kagome AFM, we demonstrate that broken mirror symmetry, combined with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), drives the system into a topological phase hosting spin-polarized magnons at the boundaries. Notably, linear response calculations reveal that in AFM/NM heterostructures, the topological magnons exhibit strong coupling to the metal's charge carriers, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the SSE. The relative contribution of the topological magnons is found to be 4-5 times greater than that of the trivial magnon bands. Moreover, our results show that this enhancement is highly sensitive to the strength of the DMI.</description>

Abstract: It is highly desirable to modify and improve the Dirac electron system of graphene for novel electronic properties and promising applications. For this purpose, we study 2D heterostructures consisting of graphene and monolayer TMDs by means of first-principles calculation and effective low-energy hamiltonian model. We determine the model parameters by fitting with the first-prinples bands. MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ are chosen in order to align the Dirac cones of graphene with the intrinsic Fermi levels of the TMDs. It is found that the Dirac energy bands of graphene are modified, but the linear band dispersion near the cones is kept. It is shown that the effective low-energy model hosts Dirac-Rashba feimions in the WSe$_2$/graphene and MoSe$_2$/graphene/WSe$_2$, and there is quantum valley Hall effect in these graphene-based 2D heterostructures. Our further analyses indicate that there are strong interactions between the orbitals and spins especially near the K and K' points. These can be useful in further exploration for novel properties and more functionalities in 2D heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Increased formation of trions and charged biexcitons by above-gap excitation in single-layer $WSe_2$</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors exhibit pronounced many-body effects and intense optical responses due to strong coulombic interactions. Consequently, subtle differences in photoexcitation conditions can strongly influence how the material dissipates energy during thermalization. Here, using multiple excitation spectroscopies, we show that a distinct thermalization pathway emerges at elevated excitation energies, enhancing the formation of trions and charged biexcitons in single-layer WSe2 by up to 2x and 5x, respectively. Power- and temperature-dependent measurements lend insight into the origin of the enhancement. These observations underscore the complexity of excited state relaxation in monolayer semiconductors, provide insight for the continued development of carrier thermalization models, and highlight the potential to precisely control excitonic yields and probe non-equilibrium dynamics in 2D semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Controlled synthesis and characterization of porous silicon nanoparticles for dynamic nuclear polarization</title>

Abstract: Si nanoparticles (NPs) have been actively developed as a hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent with an imaging window close to one hour. However, the progress in the development of NPs has been hampered by the incomplete understanding of their structural properties that correspond to efficient hyperpolarization buildup and long polarization decays. In this work we study dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of single crystal porous Si (PSi) NPs with defined doping densities ranging from nominally undoped to highly doped with boron or phosphorus. To develop such PSi NPs we perform low-load metal-assisted catalytic etching for electronic grade Si powder followed by thermal oxidation to form the dangling bonds in the Si/SiO$_2$ interface, the $P_b$ centers. $P_b$ centers are the endogenous source of the unpaired electron spins necessary for DNP. The controlled fabrication and oxidation procedures allow us to thoroughly investigate the impact of the magnetic field, temperature and doping on the DNP process. We argue that the buildup and decay rate constants are independent of size of Si crystals between approximately 10 and 60 nm. Instead, the rates are limited by the polarization transfer across the nuclear spin diffusion barrier determined by the large hyperfine shift of the central $^{29}$Si nuclei of the $P_b$ centers. The size-independent rates are then weakly affected by the doping degree for low and moderately doped Si although slight doping is required to achieve the highest polarization. Thus, we find the room temperature relaxation of low boron doped PSi NPs reaching $75 \pm 3$ minutes and nuclear polarization levels exceeding $\sim 6$ % when polarized at 6.7 T and 1.4 K. Our study thus establishes solid grounds for further development of Si NPs as hyperpolarized contrast agents.</description>

      <title>Optically Resolved Exchange Splittings in the Doped Van der Waals Ferromagnet CrBr3:Yb3+</title>

Abstract: The chromium-trihalides (CrX3; X = Cl, Br, I) have long served as model systems for understanding magnetism and magneto-optics in ionic crystals, and they have recently also emerged as archetypes of magnetic two-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals materials. Although the physical properties of CrX3 compounds have now been explored in great depth, the use of impurity doping to generate new properties remains surprisingly underexplored. Here we report on the magnetic and magneto-optical properties of lanthanide-doped CrBr3, in which Yb3+ is introduced as a spin-bearing optical point defect. Narrow-line near-infrared dopant photoluminescence is efficiently sensitized by CrBr3-to-Yb3+ energy transfer. Magneto-optical measurements show facile spin manipulation of the paramagnetic Yb3+ impurities by the surrounding CrBr3 lattice. Photoluminescence data reveal that the Kramers spin degeneracies of the ground- and excited-state Yb3+ doublets are spontaneously lifted by strong magnetic exchange with neighboring Cr3+ ions, such that individual Yb3+ spin transitions are easily resolved even at zero external magnetic field. The temperature and field dependence of these splittings can be used to probe both local and long-range spin correlations. These results highlight the use of extrinsic optical impurities to add new spin-photonic functionality to this classic 2D Van der Waals magnet.</description>

      <title>Enhanced room temperature ferromagnetism in nanostructured MoS2 flakes by hydrogen post-treatment: Combined experimental and first-principles-based studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We meticulously study the individual effects of hydrogen irradiation and annealing on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of nanostructured MoS2 thin films grown through Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). The role of edge-terminated structure and point defects to induce room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) is thoroughly investigated. The nanostructured pristine MoS2 thin films show the formation of a pure 2-H MoS2 phase, confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Pristine MoS2 thin films are independently annealed in a reducing hydrogen environment and irradiated with low-energy hydrogen ions to study the significance of point defects like sulfur vacancies. RTFM with saturation magnetization value (Ms: 1.66 emu/g) has been observed in the pristine film. Magnetization increases after irradiation and annealing processes. However, hydrogen annealing at a temperature of 200oC exhibits a maximum Ms value of 2.7 emu/g at room temperature. The increase in ferromagnetism is attributed to an increment in sulfur vacancies, hydrogen adsorption with sulfur, and modification in edges, which is confirmed by the analysis of Electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) measurements. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have demonstrated that the edge-oriented structure of MoS2 exhibits a magnetization value of 3.2 {\mu}B. Additionally, introducing an S-vacancy and H-adsorption in a parallel position to the sulfur further enhances the magnetization value to 3.85 {\mu}B and 3.43 {\mu}B respectively. These findings align broadly with our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Sub-cycle Nanotip Field Emission of Electrons Driven by Air Plasma Generated THz Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.</description>

      <title>Exciton lasing in carbon nanotubes below the population inversion threshold via phonon-mediated stimulated emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitonic optical transitions in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been extensively studied for at least two decades. However, exploiting these transitions to produce a lasing effect has been proved unpractical due to the difficulties of achieving an excitonic population inversion in carbon nanotubes. In this work we show that lasing is theoretically possible at a much lower exciton population threshold by taking advantage of phonon stimulated emission. Specifically, the so-called Anti-Stokes transitions, where light is generated by the creation of a phonon and the annihilation of an exciton, can be used to sustain the coherent emission of photons. These transitions have been overlooked for long due to their low intensity as a consequence of the low occupancy of the associated phonon branches. We show that the best conditions to achieve the lasing effect are met in CNTs with i) excitons of non-zero momentum, ii) a strong exciton-phonon coupling and iii) narrow exciton transitions.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the highest phonon frequency and superconducting temperature from fundamental physical constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental physical constants govern key effects in high-energy particle physics and astrophysics, including the stability of particles, nuclear reactions, formation and evolution of stars, synthesis of heavy nuclei and emergence of stable molecular structures. Here, we show that fundamental constants also set an upper bound for the frequency of phonons in condensed matter phases, or how rapidly an atom can vibrate. This bound is in agreement with \textit{ab initio} simulations of atomic hydrogen and high-temperature hydride superconductors, and implies an upper limit to the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in condensed matter. Fundamental constants set this limit to the order of 10$^2-10^3$ K. This range is consistent with our calculations of $T_c$ from optimal Eliashberg functions. As a corollary, we observe that the very existence of the current research of finding $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ at and above $300$ K is due to the observed values of fundamental constants. We finally discuss how fundamental constants affect the observability and operation of other effects and phenomena including phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Phonon-assisted Auger decay of excitons in doped transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes determines the optical quantum yield and plays a crucial role in the potential optoelectronic applications of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC). Here, we show that, in the presence of free carriers, an additional nonradiative decay channel opens for excitons in TMDC monolayers. Although the usual Auger decay channel is suppressed at low doping levels by the simultaneous momentum and energy conservation laws, exciton-phonon coupling relaxes this suppression. By solving a Bethe-Salpeter Equation, we calculate the phonon-assisted Auger decay rates in four typical TMDCs as a function of doping, temperature, and dielectric environment. We find that even for a relatively low doping of 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, the nonradiative lifetime ranges from 16 ps to 165 ps in different TMDCs, offering competition to the radiative decay channel.</description>
