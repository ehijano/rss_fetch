      <title>Robust dividend policy: Equivalence of Epstein-Zin and Maenhout preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a continuous-time economy, this study formulates the Epstein-Zin (EZ) preference for the discounted dividend (or cash payouts) of stockholders as an EZ singular control utility. We show that such a problem is well-defined and equivalent to the robust dividend policy set by the firm's executive in the sense of Maenhout's ambiguity-averse preference. While the firm's executive announces the expected future earnings in financial reports, they also signal the firm's confidence in the expected earnings through dividend or cash payouts. The robust dividend policy can then be characterized by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) variational inequality (VI). By constructing a novel shooting method for the HJB-VI, we theoretically prove that the robust dividend policy is a threshold strategy on the firm's surplus process. Therefore, dividend-caring investors can choose firms that match their preferences by examining stock's dividend policies and financial statements, whereas executives can make use of dividend to signal their confidence, in the form of ambiguity aversion, on realizing the earnings implied by their financial statements.</description>

      <title>The Unfairness of $\varepsilon$-Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness in decision-making processes is often quantified using probabilistic metrics. However, these metrics may not fully capture the real-world consequences of unfairness. In this article, we adopt a utility-based approach to more accurately measure the real-world impacts of decision-making process. In particular, we show that if the concept of $\varepsilon$-fairness is employed, it can possibly lead to outcomes that are maximally unfair in the real-world context. Additionally, we address the common issue of unavailable data on false negatives by proposing a reduced setting that still captures essential fairness considerations. We illustrate our findings with two real-world examples: college admissions and credit risk assessment. Our analysis reveals that while traditional probability-based evaluations might suggest fairness, a utility-based approach uncovers the necessary actions to truly achieve equality. For instance, in the college admission case, we find that enhancing completion rates is crucial for ensuring fairness. Summarizing, this paper highlights the importance of considering the real-world context when evaluating fairness.</description>
