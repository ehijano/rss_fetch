      <title>Quantum spectrum and Gamma structure for standard flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum spectrum and Gamma structure for projective bundles, blow-ups, and standard flips. After restricting the quantum multiplication to the exceptional curve direction, we obtain a decomposition of the quantum cohomology of standard flips into asymptotic Gamma classes. We then show that this decomposition is compatible with the semi-orthogonal decompositions for these spaces constructed in work of Orlov and Belmans-Fu-Raedschelders. The proof involves a sequence of reductions to a local model and the asymptotic behavior of Meijer G-functions.</description>

      <title>An equisingular heritage of Bernard Teissier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a brief and partial overview of Bernard Teissier's work in complex equisingularity theory, and a perspective on its legacy; in particular, we focus on the development of the theory in the real and the non-Archimedean contexts. Our aim is not to go into technical details, but, hopefully, rather to give a flavour of the forms taken by these developments, while providing enough definitions and references to give the reader access to old and new reference articles in the field.</description>

      <title>On the Zariski density of rational curves on IHS manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analogy with recent works on $K3$ surfaces, we study the existence of infinitely many ruled divisors on projective irreducible holomorphic symplectic (IHS) manifolds. We prove such an existence result for any projective IHS manifold of $K3^{[n]}$ or generalized Kummer type which is not a variety defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ with Picard number one. The result is obtained as a combination of the regeneration principle and of a generalization to higher dimension of a controlled degeneration technique, invented by Chen, Gounelas and Liedtke in dimension 2.</description>

      <title>New examples of geometrically special varieties: K3 surfaces, Enriques surfaces, and algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We verify that elliptic K3 surfaces and algebraic groups have many rational points over function fields, i.e., they are geometrically special in the sense of Javanpeykar-Rousseau. We also show that under additional assumptions, this geometric specialness persists under removal of closed subsets of codimension at least two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that given a simple abelian variety $A$ and a normal variety $V$ defined over a finitely generated field $K$ of characteristic zero, the set of non-constant morphisms $V \to A$ satisfying certain tangency conditions imposed by a Campana orbifold divisor $\Delta$ on $A$ is finite. To do so, we study the geometry of the scheme $\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}^{\mathrm{nc}}(C, (A, \Delta))$ parametrizing such morphisms from a smooth curve $C$ and show that it admits a quasi-finite non-dominant morphism to $A$.</description>

      <title>Thomason's completion for K-theory and cyclic homology of quotient stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several completion theorems for equivariant K-theory
  and cyclic homology of schemes with group action over a field. One of these
  shows that for an algebraic space over a field acted upon by a linear algebraic
  group, the derived completion of equivariant K'-theory at the
  augmentation ideal of the representation ring of the group coincides with the
  ordinary K'-theory of the bar construction associated to the group action.
  This provides a solution to Thomason's completion problem. For action with finite
  stabilizers, we show that the equivariant K-theory and cyclic homology have
  non-equivariant descriptions even without passing to their completions. As an
  application, we describe all equivariant Hochschild and
  other homology groups for such actions.</description>

      <title>Birational Transformations and 2d (0,2) Quiver Gauge Theories beyond Toric Fano 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a family of birational transformations that relate toric Fano 3-folds defined by reflexive lattice polytopes can be identified with mass deformations of corresponding 2d (0,2) supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. These theories are realized by a Type IIA brane configuration known as brane brick models. We further show that the same family of birational transformations extends to more general toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds, including those defined by non-reflexive toric diagrams. Under these birational transformations, the mesonic moduli spaces of the associated abelian 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories and brane brick models share the same number of generators and the same Hilbert series when refined only under the U(1)R symmetry. Since these transformations categorize toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds and their corresponding 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories into non-trivial equivalence classes, we anticipate that our findings will pave the way for a `Minimal Model Program' for quiver gauge theories corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau manifolds.</description>

      <title>Linear Logic and the Hilbert Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric model of shallow multiplicative exponential linear logic (MELL) using the Hilbert scheme. Building on previous work interpreting multiplicative linear logic proofs as systems of linear equations, we show that shallow MELL proofs can be modeled by locally projective schemes. The key insight is that while multiplicative linear logic proofs correspond to equations between formulas, the exponential fragment of shallow proofs corresponds to equations between these equations. We prove that the model is invariant under cut-elimination by constructing explicit isomorphisms between the schemes associated to proofs related by cut-reduction steps. A key technical tool is the interpretation of the exponential modality using the Hilbert scheme, which parameterizes closed subschemes of projective space. We demonstrate the model through detailed examples, including an analysis of Church numerals that reveals how the Hilbert scheme captures the geometric content of promoted formulas. This work establishes new connections between proof theory and algebraic geometry, suggesting broader relationships between computation and scheme theory.</description>

      <title>The bilinear fermionic form for KP and BKP hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a tau-function of the KP or BKP hierarchy, we introduce the notion of lifting operator and derive an equation connecting the corresponding fermionic two-point function and fermionic one-point function through the lifting operator. This provides an effective approach to determine the fermionic two-point function of the tau-function from the lifting operator and the fermionic one-point function. As practical applications, we derive concise formulas for the fermionic two-point functions of several models, like the $r$-spin model and the Br{\' e}zin--Gross--Witten model, which respectively serve as examples for KP and BKP tau-functions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of different Mathematical Models for Different Case Studies Using Statistical Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curve fitting is a fundamental technique in engineering and scientific research, serving as a critical tool for extracting insights from data. This study explores the application of various statistical equations to estimate outcomes in three distinct case studies: population dynamics, temperature variations within buildings, and market equilibrium prices. The efficacy of each fitting is evaluated through rigorous error criteria, including Sum of Squares Error (SSE), R-squared (R), Degrees of Freedom Error (DFE), Adjusted R-squared (Adj. R), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Our findings reveal that the selection of mathematical functions and the order of equations are contingent upon the specific nature of the model being analyzed. In the first case study concerning population dynamics, a fractional exponential function emerges as the optimal equation. Conversely, the second and third case studies, which focus on temperature fluctuations in buildings and market price equilibrium, respectively, find the best fit with a sinusoidal function employing three terms. Additionally, we compare the fitted curves and empirical equations with experimental data from the literature to comprehensively assess their predictive accuracy. By establishing the most suitable mathematical models for diverse case studies, researchers and practitioners can enhance their ability to make accurate predictions and informed decisions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any triple of complete flags in $\mathbb R^d$ admits a common generating set of size $\lfloor 5d/3\rfloor$ and that this bound is sharp. This result extends the classical linear-algebraic fact -- a consequence of the Bruhat decomposition of $\text{GL}_d(\mathbb R)$ -- that any pair of complete flags in $\mathbb R^d$ admits a common generating set of size $d$. We also deduce an analogue for $m$-tuples of flags with $m&gt;3$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the $p$-rank stratification of the moduli space of curves of genus $g$ that admit a double cover to a fixed elliptic curve $E$ in characteristic $p&gt;2$. We show that the closed $p$-rank strata of this moduli space are equidimensional of the expected dimension. We also show the existence of a smooth double cover of $E$ of all the possible values of the $p$-rank on this moduli space.</description>

      <title>Modular reduction of complex representations of finite reductive groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a complex representation of a finite group, Brauer and Nesbitt defined in 1941 its reduction mod p, obtaining a representation over the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{F}_p$. In 2021, Lusztig studied the characters obtained by reducing mod p an irreducible unipotent representation of a finite reductive group over $\mathbb{F}_p$. He gave a conjectural formula for this character as a linear combination of terms which had no explicit definition and were only known in some small-rank examples. In this paper we provide an explicit formula for these terms and prove Lusztig's conjecture, giving a formula for the reduction mod p of any unipotent representation of $G(\mathbb{F}_q)$ for q a power of p. We also propose a conjecture linking this construction to the full exceptional collection in the derived category of coherent sheaves on a partial flag variety constructed recently by Samokhin and van der Kallen.</description>

      <title>GKZ discriminant and Multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T=(\C^*)^k$ act on $V=\C^N$ faithfully and preserving the volume form, i.e. $(\C^*)^k \into \text{SL}(V)$. On the B-side, we have toric stacks $Z_W$ (see Eq. \ref{eq:ZW})labelled by walls $W$ in the GKZ fan, and $Z_{/F}$ labelled by faces of a polytope corresponding to minimal semi-orthogonal decomposition (SOD) components. The B-side multiplicity $n^B_{W,F}$, well-defined by a result of Kite-Segal \cite{kite-segal}, is the number of times $\Coh(Z_{/F})$ appears in a complete SOD of $\Coh(Z_W)$. On the A-side, we have the GKZ discriminant loci components $\nabla_F \In (\C^*)^k$, and its tropicalization $\nabla^{trop}_{F} \In \R^k$. The A-side multiplicity $n^A_{W, F}$ is defined as the multiplicity of the tropical complex $\nabla^{trop}_{F}$ on wall $W$. We prove that $n^A_{W,F} = n^B_{W,F}$, confirming a conjecture in Kite-Segal \cite{kite-segal} inspired by \cite{aspinwall2017mirror}. Our proof is based on the result of Horja-Katzarkov \cite{horja2022discriminants} and a lemma about B-side SOD multiplicity, which allows us to reduce to lower dimension just as in A-side \cite{GKZ-book}[Ch 11].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the K-moduli space of Fano threefolds obtained by blowing up $\mathbb{P}^3$ along $(2,3)$-complete intersection curves. This K-moduli space is a two-step birational modification of the GIT moduli space of $(3,3)$-curves on $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$. As an application, we show that our K-moduli space appears as one model of the Hassett--Keel program for $\overline{M}_4$. In particular, we classify all K-(semi/poly)stable members in this deformation family of Fano varieties. We follow the moduli continuity method with moduli of lattice-polarized K3 surfaces, general elephants and Sarkisov links as new ingredients.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper Stability of Holomorphic Foliations with Split Tangent Sheaf one finds a study of the locus $\mathrm{Dec}$ where the tangent sheaf of a {\it family} of foliations in $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb C}^n$ is {\it decomposable}, i.e. a sum of line bundles. A prime conclusion is an ``openness'' result: once the singular locus has sufficiently large codimension, $\mathrm{Dec}$ turns out to be open. In the present paper, we study the locus $\mathrm{LF}$ of points of a family of distributions where the tangent sheaf is {\it locally free}. Through general Commutative Algebra, we show that $\mathrm{LF}$ is open provided that singularities have codimension at least three. When dealing with foliations rather than distributions, the condition on the lower bound of the singular set can be weakened by the introduction of ``Kupka'' points. We apply the available ``openness'' results to families in $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb C}^n$ and in $\mathcal B$, the variety of Borel subgroups of a simple group. By establishing a theorem putting in bijection irreducible components of the space of two-dimensional subalgebras of a given semi-simple Lie algebra and its nilpotent orbits, we conclude that the space of foliations of {\it rank two} on $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb C}^n$ and $\mathcal B$, may have quite many irreducible components as $n$ and $\dim \mathcal B$ grow. We also set in place several algebro-geometric foundations for the theory of families of distributions in two appendices.</description>

      <title>Descent and generation for noncommutative coherent algebras over schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work shows forms of descent, in the fppf, h and \'{e}tale topologies, for strong generation of the bounded derived category of a noncommutative coherent algebra over a scheme. Even for (commutative) schemes this yields new perspectives. As a consequence we exhibit new examples where these bounded derived categories admit strong generators. We achieve our main results by leveraging the action of the scheme on the coherent algebra, allowing us to lift statements into the noncommutative setting. In particular, this leads to interesting applications regarding generation for Azumaya algebras.</description>

      <title>Algebraically Skew Embedding of Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth complex variety $X$, an algebraically skew embedding of $X$ is an embedding of $X$ into a complex projective space $\mathbb{P}^N$ such that for any two points $x,y\in X$, their embedded tangent spaces in $\mathbb{P}^N$ do not intersect. In this work, we establish an upper bound and a lower bound of the minimal dimension $N$ such that there exists an algebraically skew embedding into $\mathbb{P}^N$ in terms of the dimension of the given smooth variety $X$. Then we further classify the algebraic curves in terms of their minimal skew embedding dimensions.</description>

      <title>Computation method for perfectoid purity and perfectoid BCM-regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a criterion for a sufficient condition of perfectoid purity and a computation method for perfectoid pure threshold of $\mathrm{div}(p)$. Furthermore, we give examples of Noetherian local $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$-algebras $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ such that $p$ is contained in $\mathfrak{m}$, $R$ is perfectoid BCM-regular, and $R/pR$ is normal Gorenstein, but $R/pR$ is not strongly $F$-regular for every prime number $p$.</description>

      <title>Quantum cohomology and Fukaya summands from monotone Lagrangian tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a monotone Lagrangian torus inside a compact symplectic manifold $X$, with superpotential $W_L$. We show that a geometrically-defined closed-open map induces a decomposition of the quantum cohomology $\operatorname{QH}^*(X)$ into a product, where one factor is the localisation of the Jacobian ring $\operatorname{Jac} W_L$ at the set of isolated critical points of $W_L$. The proof involves describing the summands of the Fukaya category corresponding to this factor -- verifying the expectations of mirror symmetry -- and establishing an automatic generation criterion in the style of Ganatra and Sanda, which may be of independent interest. We apply our results to understanding the structure of quantum cohomology and to constraining the possible superpotentials of monotone tori</description>

      <title>Markov fractions and the slopes of the exceptional bundles on $\mathbb P^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Markov fractions introduced recently by Boris Springborn are precisely the slopes of the exceptional vector bundles on $\mathbb P^2$ studied in 1980s by Dr\`ezet and Le Potier and by Rudakov. In particular, we provide a simpler proof of Rudakov's result claiming that the ranks of the exceptional bundles on $\mathbb P^2$ are Markov numbers.</description>
