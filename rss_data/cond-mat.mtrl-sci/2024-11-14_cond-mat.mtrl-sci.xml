      <title>Ultrafast electron dynamics in altermagnetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a new class of magnetic materials that combine properties previously thought to be exclusive to either antiferromagnets or ferromagnets, and have unique properties of their own. In particular, a combination of symmetries connecting magnetic sublattices gives rise to a band spin splitting exhibiting unconventional d, g, or i-wave character. Their unique electronic properties have already led to new spin-dependent transport effects. Here, we consider their spin and charge dynamics on ultrafast timescales. We use a minimal tight binding model that captures the main features of the altermagnetic candidate material KRu$_4$O$_8$. In the framework of this model, we compute the spin-dependent electronic scattering dynamics after ultrashort-pulse excitation and show through these microscopic calculations how electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering processes redistribute optically excited carriers in a 2D slice of the Brillouin zone. We find that the optically excited spin polarization is long lived (~1ps) compared to the electron-electron momentum scattering lifetime of roughly 10fs. This contrasts remarkably with the much shorter spin lifetimes observed in typical ultrafast electronic spin dynamics in conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, making these pulse-driven spin excitation experiments a key probe of altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Machine-Learned Model for GST Phase Change Materials via Direct and Indirect Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase change materials such as Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Te$_{5}$ (GST) are ideal candidates for next-generation, non-volatile, solid-state memory due to the ability to retain binary data in the amorphous and crystal phases, and rapidly transition between these phases to write/erase information. Thus, there is wide interest in using molecular modeling to study GST. Recently, a Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) was trained for GST to reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies and forces at a fraction of the computational cost [Zhou et al. Nature Electronics $\mathbf{6}$, 746-754 (2023)]; however, simulations of large length and time scales are still challenging using this GAP model. Here we present a machine-learned (ML) potential for GST implemented using the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework. This ACE potential shows comparable accuracy to the GAP potential but performs orders of magnitude faster. We train the ACE potentials both directly from DFT, as well as using a recently introduced indirect learning approach where the potential is trained instead from an intermediate ML potential, in this case, GAP. Indirect learning allows us to consider a significantly larger training set than could be generated using DFT alone. We compare the directly and indirectly learned potentials and find that both reproduce the structure and thermodynamics predicted by the GAP, and also match experimental measures of GST structure. The speed of the ACE model, particularly when using GPU acceleration, allows us to examine repeated transitions between crystal and amorphous phases in device-scale systems with only modest computational resources.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of continuum elasticity due to electronic effects in gold nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experiment reports a creation of goldene, which is two-dimensional gold with hexagonal structure. By rolling up the goldene, gold nanotubes (GNT) should exist, but their structural and electronic properties are not understood well. Based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate a breakdown of inverse square law, wherein the curvature energy stored in a GNT decreases with the inverse square of the GNT radius. This is due to the enhanced curvature energy in specific GNTs having nearly flat bands around the Fermi level. We show that the electron states on the flat band of GNT reflect those on the Fermi surface of goldene by using the Bloch and geometric boundary conditions, and that in-plane character of the latter states enhances the curvature energy.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect from inter-superlattice scattering in a noncollinear antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superlattice formation dictates the physical properties of many materials, including the nature of the ground state in magnetic materials. Chemical composition is commonly considered to be the primary determinant of superlattice identity, especially in intercalation compounds. Here, we find that, contrary to this conventional wisdom, kinetic control of superlattice growth leads to the coexistence of disparate domains within a compositionally "perfect" single crystal. We demonstrate that Cr$_{1/4}$TaS$_2$ is a bulk noncollinear antiferromagnet in which scattering between bulk and minority superlattice domains engenders complex magnetotransport below the N\'{e}el temperature, including an anomalous Hall effect. We characterize the magnetic phases in different domains, image their nanoscale morphology, and propose a mechanism for nucleation and growth. These results provide a blueprint for the deliberate engineering of macroscopic transport responses via microscopic patterning of magnetic exchange interactions in superlattice domains.</description>

      <title>A damage mechanics model for quasi brittle materials based on the structured deformation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structured deformation theory is used within the thermodynamics of irreversible processes framework in order to build a damage model relevant for quasi-brittle materials. The cracks are supposed smeared in the body and their shape is assumed to be sinusoidal. The convex of elasticity supposes a limitation of the thermodynamic force associated to the relative sliding of the crack lips. This limitation consists of both some equivalent to the Coulomb's friction and a cohesive force issued from the Barenblatt approach. This leads to an initial yield surface that can be expressed as the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, known to be relevant for such materials in term of initial yield surface and prediction of the crack orientation. The evolution law introduces an hardening and softening function that, combined to the rest of the framework, allows the description of the stress to strain evolution. The results are identified and compared to the Kupfer's database on concrete.</description>

      <title>Concurrent operando neutron imaging and diffraction analysis revealing spatial lithiation phase evolution in an ultra-thick graphite electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy efficient, safe and reliable Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are required for a wide range of applications. Charging capabilities of thick electrodes still holding their stored high-energy is a most desirable characteristic in future advanced LIBs. The introduction of ultra-thick graphite anode meets limitations in internal electrode transport properties, leading to Li-ion gradients with detrimental consequences for battery cell performance and lifetime. Yet, there is a lack of experimental tools capable of providing a complete view of local processes and evolving gradients within such thick electrodes. Here, we introduce a multi-modal operando measurement approach, enabling quantitative spatio-temporal observations of Li concentrations and intercalation phases in ultra-thick, graphite electrodes. Neutron imaging and diffraction concurrently provide correlated information from the macroscopic scale of the cell and electrode down to the crystallographic scale portraying the intercalation and deintercalation processes. In particular, the evolving formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), observation of gradients in total lithium content, as well as in the formation of ordered LixC6 phases and trapped lithium have been mapped throughout the first charge-discharge cycle of the cell. Different lithiation stages co-exist during charging and discharging of an ultra-thick composite graphite-based electrode; delayed lithiation and delithiation processes are observed at the central region of the electrode, while the SEI formation, potential plating and dead lithium are predominantly found closer to the interface with the separator. The study furthermore emphasizes the potential of the method to study Li ion diffusion and the kinetics of lithiation phase formation in advanced ultra-thick electrodes.</description>

      <title>Effect of pH on photocatalytic degradation of Methylene Blue in water by facile hydrothermally grown TiO2 Nanoparticles under Natural Sunlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each year, the production of synthetic dye wastewater reaches a trillion tons, posing a significant challenge to addressing water scarcity on a global level. Hence, the treatment of wastewater to prevent water scarcity is of prime importance, and failing to do so will increase ecotoxicological risks and human health. Textile wastewater contains harmful dye. Photocatalytic degradation of such dye-contaminated wastewater is crucial to purifying the dye-contaminated water. However, this process takes time, uses high-power lamps, and is expensive. Here, we report the effect of the concentration of precursor on the size and surface morphology of TiO2 nanostructures prepared by facile hydrothermal synthesis and its ability to perform as a photocatalyst to degrade the most common industrial textile dye, methylene blue (MB), under natural sunlight. The impact of particle size on the photocatalytic activity and photocarrier migration rate was thoroughly examined. Also, the effect of pH on adsorption and photocatalytic degradation has been evaluated in detail. With several optimized conditions, almost complete dye degradation was achieved within 40 minutes under the direct illumination of natural sunlight. The enhanced photocatalytic performance can be correlated to the synergetic effect of a higher charge transfer mechanism, good catalytic active surface area availability (386 m2/g), and several optimized parameters that affect the reaction efficacy. Additionally, repeated use of NPs without sacrificing performance five times confirmed its stability and Sustainability as a promising candidate for large-scale industrial textile wastewater remedies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Optoelectronic Potential of Vacancy-Ordered Double Perovskites: A Computational Deep Dive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free perovskite materials have emerged as key players in optoelectronics, showcasing exceptional optical and electronic properties, alongside being environmentally friendly and non-toxic elements. Recently, among studied perovskite materials, vacancy-ordered double perovskites (VODPs) stand out as a promising alternative. In this study, we captured the electronic, optical, excitonic, and polaronic properties of a series of VODPs with the chemical formula Rb$_{2}$BX$_{6}$ (B = Si, Ge, Sn, Pt; X = Cl, Br, I) using first-principles calculations. Our results indicate these materials exhibit high stability and notable electronic and optical properties. The calculated G$_{0}$W$_{0}$ bandgap values of these perovskites fall within the range of 0.56 to 6.12 eV. Optical properties indicate strong infra-red to ultraviolet light absorption across most of the systems. Additionally, an analysis of excitonic properties reveals low to moderate exciton-binding energies and variable exciton lifetimes, implying higher quantum yield and conversion efficiency. Furthermore, utilizing the Feynman polaron model, polaronic parameters are evaluated, and for the majority of systems, charge-separated polaronic states are less stable than bound excitons. Finally, an investigation of Polaronic mobility reveals high polaron mobility for electrons (3.33-85.11 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) compared to previously reported Cs-based VODP materials. Overall, these findings highlight Rb-based VODPs as promising candidates for future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of Top Al$_2$O$_3$ Interlayer Thickness on Memory Window and Reliability of FeFETs With TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$/Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$/SiO$_x$/Si (MIFIS) Gate Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of top Al2O3 interlayer thickness on the memory window (MW) of Si channel ferroelectric field-effect transistors (Si-FeFETs) with TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$/Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$/SiO$_x$/Si (MIFIS) gate structure. We find that the MW first increases and then remains almost constant with the increasing thickness of the top Al2O3. The phenomenon is attributed to the lower electric field of the ferroelectric Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ in the MIFIS structure with a thicker top Al2O3 after a program operation. The lower electric field makes the charges trapped at the top Al2O3/Hf0.5Zr0.5O$_2$ interface, which are injected from the metal gate, cannot be retained. Furthermore, we study the effect of the top Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer thickness on the reliability (endurance characteristics and retention characteristics). We find that the MIFIS structure with a thicker top Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer has poorer retention and endurance characteristics. Our work is helpful in deeply understanding the effect of top interlayer thickness on the MW and reliability of Si-FeFETs with MIFIS gate stacks.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ multilayers with reduced wake-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ thin films, significant research has focused on Zr-doped HfO$_2$ and solid solution (Hf,Zr)O$_2$ thin films. Functional properties can be further tuned via multilayering, however, this approach has not yet been fully explored in HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ films. This work demonstrates ferroelectricity in a 50 nm thick, solution-processed HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ multilayer film, marking it as the thickest such film to date exhibiting ferroelectric properties. The multilayer structure was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, with high-resolution TEM revealing grain continuity across multiple layers. This finding indicates that a polar phase in the originally paraelectric ZrO$_2$ layer, can be stabilized by the HfO$_2$ layer. The film attains a remanent polarization of 8 uC/cm$^2$ and exhibits accelerated wake-up behavior, attributed to its higher breakdown strength resulting from the incorporation of multiple interfaces. These results offer a faster wake-up mechanism for thick ferroelectric hafnia films.</description>

      <title>K-edge XANES of octahedral aluminum compounds: similarities and differences via the analysis of excitonic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an \textit{ab initio} investigation of the XANES spectra at the aluminum K edge for three compounds: Al$_2$O$_3$, AlF$_3$ and AlCl$_3$, where the Al atoms share the same oxidation state~(III) and are coordinated in an octahedral symmetry. The XANES spectra calculated within the independent-particle approximation reveal significant differences, including shifts in the spectrum onset, variations in the spectral shapes, and the presence of a pre-peak in the case of AlCl$_3$, all in correspondence with the behavior of the PDOS of the absorbing atom in the different materials. The origin of the features stems from the specific band structure of each compound. When electron--hole interactions are taken into account through the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, a series of dark and bright excitons with large binding energies and Frenkel character is obtained. The strong excitonic effects lead to the suppression of the pre-peak in AlCl$_3$ and further accentuate the differences among the three Al K-edge spectra.</description>

      <title>A combined diffusion/rate equation model to describe charge generation in phase-separated donor-acceptor blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been largely improved by the introduction of novel non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Further improvements in PCE require a more comprehensive understanding of the free charge generation process. Recently, the small PCE of donor-acceptor blends with low offsets between the relevant frontier orbitals was attributed to inefficient exciton dissociation. However, another source of photocurrent loss is the competition between exciton diffusion and decay, which is particularly relevant for bilayers or bulk heterojunction blends with phase separated morphology. Here, we present an analytical model that combines exciton diffusion with a set of rate equations based on Marcus theory of charge transfer. An expression for the charge generation efficiency is derived from the steady-state solution of the model. Thereby, the intrinsic exciton lifetime is identified as a pivotal parameter to facilitate efficient charge generation in spite of a vanishing driving force for exciton dissociation. The dynamic formulation of the model is used to elucidate the characteristic time scales of charge generation. It is found that for low-offset systems, the pure diffusive times are considerably shorter than those associated with charge generation. It can therefore be concluded that when estimating domain sizes via exciton diffusion measurements, the assumption that excitons are instantaneously quenched at the donor-acceptor interface is only valid when a high driving force for exciton dissociation is present. The model is applied to the transient absorption dynamics of a PM6:Y6 blend. It is demonstrated that the charge generation dynamics are determined by the interplay between exciton diffusion and hole transfer kinetics, with an estimated Y6 domain size of 25nm, while interfacial charge transfer (CT) states separate rapidly into free charges.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, presents unprecedented opportunities for materials science research. We proposed and developed an AI materials scientist named MatPilot, which has shown encouraging abilities in the discovery of new materials. The core strength of MatPilot is its natural language interactive human-machine collaboration, which augments the research capabilities of human scientist teams through a multi-agent system. MatPilot integrates unique cognitive abilities, extensive accumulated experience, and ongoing curiosity of human-beings with the AI agents' capabilities of advanced abstraction, complex knowledge storage and high-dimensional information processing. It could generate scientific hypotheses and experimental schemes, and employ predictive models and optimization algorithms to drive an automated experimental platform for experiments. It turns out that our system demonstrates capabilities for efficient validation, continuous learning, and iterative optimization.</description>

      <title>h-CMD: An efficient hybrid fast centroid and quasi-centroid molecular dynamics method for the simulation of vibrational spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing efficient path integral (PI) methods for atomistic simulations of vibrational spectra in heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces has long been a challenging task. Here, we present the h-CMD method, short for hybrid centroid molecular dynamics, that combines the recently introduced fast quasi-CMD (f-QCMD) method with fast CMD (f-CMD). In this scheme, molecules that are believed to suffer more seriously from the curvature problem of CMD, e.g., water, are treated with f-QCMD, while the rest, e.g., solid surfaces, are treated with f-CMD. To test the accuracy of the newly introduced scheme, the infrared spectra of the interfacial D2O confined in the archetypal ZIF-90 framework are simulated using h-CMD compared to a variety of other PI methods, including thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (T-RPMD) and partially adiabatic CMD as well as f-CMD and experiment as reference. Comparisons are also made to classical MD, where nuclear quantum effects are neglected entirely. Our detailed comparisons at different temperatures of 250-600 K show that h-CMD produces O-D stretches that are in close agreement with the experiment, correcting the known curvature problem and red-shifting of the stretch peaks of CMD. h-CMD also corrects the known issues associated with too artificially dampened and broadened spectra of T-RPMD, which leads to missing the characteristic doublet feature of the interfacial confined water, rendering it unsuitable for these systems. The new h-CMD method broadens the applicability of f-QCMD to heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces, where defining curvilinear coordinates for the entire system is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Universal Moir\'e-Model-Building Method without Fitting: Application to Twisted MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive method to construct analytical continuum models for moir\'e systems directly from first-principle calculations without any parameter fitting. The core idea of this method is to interpret the terms in the continuum model as a basis, allowing us to determine model parameters as coefficients of this basis through Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We apply our method to twisted MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ with twist angles ranging from 2.13$^\circ$ to 3.89$^\circ$, producing continuum models that exhibit excellent agreement with both energy bands and wavefunctions obtained from first-principles calculations. We further propose a strategy to integrate out the higher-energy degrees of freedom to reduce the number of the parameters in the model without sacrificing the accuracy for low-energy bands. Our findings reveal that decreasing twist angles typically need an increasing number of harmonics in the moir\'e potentials to accurately replicate first-principles results. We provide parameter values for all derived continuum models, facilitating further robust many-body calculations. Our approach is general and applicable to any commensurate moir\'e materials accessible by first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Phononic Crystal Waveguides for Acoustically Induced Spin Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the use of strain and induced piezoelectric fields, surface acoustic waves have been shown to control quantum information processes, such as single photon emission and the coherent transport of electron spins. Regarding the latter, systems using plane surface waves have provided suitable demonstration systems, but to build complexity, more control over the acoustic wave may be required. One method for acoustic control is the use of phononic crystals consisting of periodic arrays of nanofabricated holes on the surface of a device. These inclusions form a metamaterial-like layer with properties different from the normal material to dictate the physics of wave motion. Exploiting these surface properties can lead to acoustic waveguides, which can be designed to control the path of the surface acoustic waves. The design parameters of a new type of phononic crystal waveguide is explored that uses 2-fold elliptical cylinder inclusions to create a slow region that also limits coupling and radiative loss to bulk acoustic modes. Such a waveguide would be the foundational piece in an acoustic circuit that could then mediate complex spin transport geometries.</description>

      <title>Accurate Electron-phonon Interactions from Advanced Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is key for understanding many properties of materials such as superconductivity and electric resistivity. Although first principles density-functional-theory (DFT) based EPC calculations are used widely, their efficacy is limited by the accuracy and efficiency of the underlying exchange-correlation functionals. These limitations become exacerbated in complex $d$- and $f$-electron materials, where beyond-DFT approaches and empirical corrections, such as the Hubbard $U$, are commonly invoked. Here, using the examples of CoO and NiO, we show how the efficient r2scan density functional correctly captures strong EPC effects in transition-metal oxides without requiring the introduction of empirical parameters. We also demonstrate the ability of r2scan to accurately model phonon-mediated superconducting properties of the main group compounds (e.g., MgB$_2$), with improved electronic bands and phonon dispersions over those of traditional density functionals. Our study provides a pathway for extending the scope of accurate first principles modeling of electron-phonon interactions to encompass complex $d$-electron materials.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale mapping of superconductivity in the incoherent CDW mosaic phase of a transition metal dichalcogenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of superconductivity in the octahedrally coordinated (1T) phase of TaS2 is preceded by the intriguing loss of long-range order in the charge density wave (CDW). Such decoherence, attainable by different methods, results in the formation of nm-sized coherent CDW domains bound by a two-dimensional network of domain walls (DW) - mosaic phase -, which has been proposed as the spatial origin of the superconductivity. Here, we report the atomic-scale characterization of the superconducting state of 1T-TaSSe, a model 1T compound exhibiting the CDW mosaic phase. We use high-resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy and Andreev spectroscopy to probe the microscopic nature of the superconducting state in unambiguous connection with the electronic structure of the mosaic phase. Spatially resolved conductance maps at the Fermi level at the onset of superconductivity reveal that the density of states is mostly localized on the CDW domains compared to the domain walls, which suggests their dominant role in the formation of superconductivity. This scenario is confirmed within the superconducting dome at 340 mK, where superconductivity is fully developed, and the subtle spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting gap remains unlinked to the domain wall network. Our results provide key new insights into the fundamental interplay between superconductivity and CDW in these relevant strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field control over the axialness of Higgs modes in charge-density wave compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how symmetry-breaking processes generate order out of disorder is among the most fundamental problems of nature. The scalar Higgs mode - a massive (quasi-) particle - is a key ingredient in these processes and emerges with the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. Its related exotic and elusive axial counterpart, a Boson with vector character, can be stabilized through the simultaneous breaking of multiple continuous symmetries. Here, we employ a magnetic field to tune the recently discovered axial Higgs-type charge-density wave amplitude modes in rare-earth tritellurides. We demonstrate a proportionality between the axial Higgs component and the applied field, and a 90$^{\circ}$ phase shift upon changing the direction of the B-field. This indicates that the axial character is directly related to magnetic degrees of freedom. Our approach opens up an in-situ control over the axialness of emergent Higgs modes.</description>

      <title>Material Property Prediction with Element Attribute Knowledge Graphs and Multimodal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has become a crucial tool for predicting the properties of crystalline materials. However, existing methods primarily represent material information by constructing multi-edge graphs of crystal structures, often overlooking the chemical and physical properties of elements (such as atomic radius, electronegativity, melting point, and ionization energy), which have a significant impact on material performance. To address this limitation, we first constructed an element property knowledge graph and utilized an embedding model to encode the element attributes within the knowledge graph. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal fusion framework, ESNet, which integrates element property features with crystal structure features to generate joint multimodal representations. This provides a more comprehensive perspective for predicting the performance of crystalline materials, enabling the model to consider both microstructural composition and chemical characteristics of the materials. We conducted experiments on the Materials Project benchmark dataset, which showed leading performance in the bandgap prediction task and achieved results on a par with existing benchmarks in the formation energy prediction task.</description>

Abstract: Despite its excellent performance in microelectronic industry, silicon was not able to perform well in photonic devices arena. This is because the silicon has never been a good optical source mainly due to its indirect band gap structure. Many of the device functionalities in silicon have been reported, with an exception of, until recently, a reliable optical source. Silicon is a nonlinear material which makes use of its nonlinearities to realize various functionalities. This paper presents a theoretical treatment of generating and enhancing third-harmonic field which may be used as optical source, crystal state monitoring and all-optical signal processing applications.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of new materials is very important to the field of materials science. When researchers explore new materials, they often have expected performance requirements for their crystal structure. In recent years, data-driven methods have made great progress in the direction plane of crystal structure generation, but there is still a lack of methods that can effectively map material properties to crystal structure. In this paper, we propose a Crystal DiT model to generate the crystal structure from the expected material properties by embedding the material properties and combining the symmetry information predicted by the large language model. Experimental verification shows that our proposed method has good performance.</description>

      <title>Bulk Crystal Growth and Single-Crystal-to-Single-Crystal Phase Transitions in the Averievite CsClCu5V2O10</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-two-dimensional averievites with triangle-kagome-triangle trilayers are of interest due to their rich structural and magnetic transitions and strong spin frustration that are expected to host quantum spin liquid ground state with suitable substitution or doping. Herein, we report growth of bulk single crystals of averievite CsClCu5V2O10 with dimensions of several millimeters on edge in order to (1) address the open question whether the room temperature crystal structure is P-3m1, P-3, P21/c or else, (2) to elucidate the nature of phase transitions, and (3) to study direction-dependent physical properties. Single-crystal-to-single-crystal structural transitions at ~305 K and ~127 K were observed in the averievite CsClCu5V2O10 single crystals. The nature of the transition at ~305 K, which was reported as P-3m1-P21/c transition, was found to be a structural transition from high temperature P-3m1 to low temperature P-3 by combining variable temperature synchrotron X-ray single crystal and high-resolution powder diffraction. In-plane and out-of-plane magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements confirm a first-order transition at 305 K, a structural transition at 127 K and an antiferromagnetic transition at 24 K. These averievites are thus ideal model systems for a deeper understanding of structural transitions and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Electron-Magnon Coupling Mediated Magnetotransport in Antiferromagnetic van der Waals Heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-magnon coupling reveals key insights into the interfacial properties between non-magnetic metals and magnetic insulators, influencing charge transport and spin dynamics. Here, we present temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy and magneto-transport measurements of few-layer graphene (FLG)/antiferromagnetic FePS\(_3\) heterostructures. The magnon mode in FePS\(_3\) softens below 40 K, and effective magnon stiffness decreases with cooling. Magnetotransport measurements show that FLG exhibits negative magnetoresistance (MR) in the heterostructure at low fields (\(\pm 0.2 \, \text{T}\)), persisting up to 100 K; beyond this, MR transitions to positive. Notably, as layer thickness decreases, the coupling strength at the interface reduces, leading to a suppression of negative MR. Additionally, magnetodielectric measurements in the FLG/FePS\(_3\)/FLG heterostructure show an upturn at temperatures significantly below ($T_\text{N}$), suggesting a role for the magnon mode in capacitance, as indicated by hybridization between magnon and phonon bands in pristine FePS\(_3\) \textit{via} magnetoelastic coupling.</description>

      <title>Space-local memory in generalized master equations: Reaching the thermodynamic limit for the cost of a small lattice simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exact quantum dynamics of lattice models can be computationally intensive, especially when aiming for large system sizes and extended simulation times necessary to converge transport coefficients. By leveraging finite memory times to access long-time dynamics using only short-time data, generalized master equations (GMEs) can offer a route to simulating the dynamics of lattice problems efficiently. However, such simulations are limited to small lattices whose dynamics exhibit finite-size artifacts that contaminate transport coefficient predictions. To address this problem, we introduce a novel approach that exploits finite memory in time \textit{and} space to efficiently predict the many-body dynamics of dissipative lattice problems involving short-range interactions. This advance enables one to leverage the short-time dynamics of small lattices to simulate arbitrarily large systems over long times. We demonstrate the strengths of this method by focusing on nonequilibrium polaron relaxation and transport in the dispersive Holstein model, successfully simulating lattice dynamics in one and two dimensions free from finite-size effects, reducing the computational expense of such simulations by multiple orders of magnitude. Our method is broadly applicable and provides an accurate and efficient means to investigate nonequilibrium relaxation with microscopic resolution over mesoscopic length and time scales that are relevant to experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials science datasets are inherently heterogeneous and are available in different modalities such as characterization spectra, atomic structures, microscopic images, and text-based synthesis conditions. The advancements in multi-modal learning, particularly in vision and language models, have opened new avenues for integrating data in different forms. In this work, we evaluate common techniques in multi-modal learning (alignment and fusion) in unifying some of the most important modalities in materials science: atomic structure, X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), and composition. We show that structure graph modality can be enhanced by aligning with XRD patterns. Additionally, we show that aligning and fusing more experimentally accessible data formats, such as XRD patterns and compositions, can create more robust joint embeddings than individual modalities across various tasks. This lays the groundwork for future studies aiming to exploit the full potential of multi-modal data in materials science, facilitating more informed decision-making in materials design and discovery.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Superconductivity in Pr4Ni3O10 Single Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) of nickelates has potential similarities with cuprate superconductors, which may provide unique perspectives on the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. Up to now, most of high-pressure experiments concentrated on the lanthanum-related RP phase. Therefore, the discovery of new superconducting nickelate compounds is highly desired to explore the generality of pressure-induced superconductivity in RP nickelates. Here, we grow high-quality Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal with an optical floating zone furnace under high oxygen pressure and conduct high-pressure transport measurements with various pressure transmitting mediums. The density wave in Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal was suppressed by pressure, accompanying the arising of superconducting state beyond 10 GPa. The maximum and unsaturated Tc of 39 K is obtained within our research pressure. Although zero resistivity was not achieved in our experiments, the pressure and temperature-dependent diamagnetism along with the systematic evolution of resistivity with applied magnetic field, corroborate the superconductivity in Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals. Our findings provide a new platform for the investigation of the relationship among structural evolution, magnetism, correlation, and superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Accelerated Quantum Transport Simulations in Nanoelectronics: From Break Junctions to Field-Effect Transistors</title>

Abstract: Quantum transport calculations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices, yet the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency has long limited their practical applications. We present a general framework that combines the deep learning tight-binding Hamiltonian (DeePTB) approach with the non-equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method, enabling efficient quantum transport calculations while maintaining first-principles accuracy. We demonstrate the capabilities of the DeePTB-NEGF framework through two representative applications: comprehensive simulation of break junction systems, where conductance histograms show good agreement with experimental measurements in both metallic contact and single-molecule junction cases; and simulation of carbon nanotube field effect transistors through self-consistent NEGF-Poisson calculations, capturing essential physics including the electrostatic potential and transfer characteristic curves under finite bias conditions. This framework bridges the gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a powerful tool for high-throughput quantum transport simulations across different scales in nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Dielectric losses in metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) in the self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) basis is often used for describing complex many-body effects in material science applications. Its exact solution on the real-frequency axis at finite temperature for polarization using the diagrammatic Monte Carlo method [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 045152, (2024)] captures effects of multiple Coulomb scattering of a single particle-hole excitation, but does not account for multiple pair excitations important for studying dielectric loses in metals at frequencies comparable to the plasmon mode. In this paper we report technical developments which allow one to efficiently compute the dielectric response in a wide frequency range from zero to a few Fermi energies without systematic bias at finite $T$. By applying it to the homogeneous electron gas we demonstrate how at small momenta the gap in the spectral density between the electron-hole and plasmon excitations, existing within the HF-BSE approach, is filled with two particle-hole excitations and is completely washed out already at temperature $T \sim \varepsilon_F/10$.</description>

      <title>Deep learning tight-binding approach for large-scale electronic simulations at finite temperatures with $ab$ $initio$ accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating electronic behavior in materials and devices with realistic large system sizes remains a formidable task within the $ab$ $initio$ framework due to its computational intensity. Here we show DeePTB, an efficient deep learning-based tight-binding approach with $ab$ $initio$ accuracy to address this issue. By training on structural data and corresponding $ab$ $initio$ eigenvalues, the DeePTB model can efficiently predict tight-binding Hamiltonians for unseen structures, enabling efficient simulations of large-size systems under external perturbations such as finite temperatures and strain. This capability is vital for semiconductor band gap engineering and materials design. When combined with molecular dynamics, DeePTB facilitates efficient and accurate finite-temperature simulations of both atomic and electronic behavior simultaneously. This is demonstrated by computing the temperature-dependent electronic properties of a gallium phosphide system with $10^6$ atoms. The availability of DeePTB bridges the gap between accuracy and scalability in electronic simulations, potentially advancing materials science and related fields by enabling large-scale electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We found signatures of current-induced sliding motion in helimagnetic $\mathrm{Mn}\mathrm{Au}_2$ thin films. An abrupt change in differential resistivity occurred at a threshold bias current in the helimagnetic state, whereas it was absent in the induced ferromagnetic state. Broadband voltage noise also emerged above the threshold current in the helimagnetic state. Based on the similarity to canonical charge/spin density wave systems, we ascribed the origin of these phenomena to the sliding motion of the helimagnetic structure.</description>

      <title>Quantized Born Effective charges as probes for the topological phase transition in the Haldane and Kane-Mele models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to study the transition between different topological states, based on the assessment of the vibrational resonances in infrared spectra. We consider the Haldane and Kane-Mele models finding that Born effective charges are nearly quantized, with a discontinuous jump concomitant with the topological phase transition. In particular, Born effective charges display a finite value in the trivial phase and a null one in the nontrivial one. This is rooted in the connection between Born effective charges and electronic Berry curvature at the band edges. Finally, at the topological phase transition of the Haldane model, we also observe a nearly quantized jump of the chiral splitting of the zone-center phonon frequencies, induced by time-reversal symmetry breaking.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach toward characterizing local structural features of two-dimensional particle systems. The approach can accurately identify and characterize defects in high-temperature crystals, distinguish a wide range of nominally disordered systems, and robustly describe complex structures such as grain boundaries. This paper also introduces two-dimensional functionality into the open-source software program VoroTop which automates this analysis. This software package is built on a recently-introduced multithreaded version of VORO++, enabling the analysis of systems with billions of particles on high-performance computer architectures.</description>

      <title>Twin branching in shape memory alloys: a 1D model with energy dissipation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a 1D model of twin branching in shape memory alloys. The free energy of the branched microstructure comprises the interfacial and elastic strain energy contributions, both expressed in terms of the average twin spacing treated as a continuous function of the position. The total free energy is then minimized, and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation is solved numerically using the finite element method. The model can be considered as a continuous counterpart of the recent discrete model of Seiner et al. (2020), and our results show a very good agreement with that model in the entire range of physically relevant parameters. Furthermore, our continuous setting facilitates incorporation of energy dissipation into the model. The effect of rate-independent dissipation on the evolution of the branched microstructure is thus studied. The results show that significant effects on the microstructure and energy of the system are expected only for relatively small domain sizes.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Wide-temperature-range Glassy-like and Effective Across-layer Thermal Transport in Crystalline CsCu$_4$Se$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport in crystalline compounds with intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is crucial in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the lattice thermal conductivity of crystalline CsCu$_4$Se$_3$ by coupling first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics with a unified theory of thermal transport. We consider the effects of both cubic and quartic anharmonicity on phonon scattering rates and energy shifts, as well as the diagonal and off-diagonal terms of heat flux operators. Our results reveal that the vibrational properties of CsCu$_4$Se$_3$ are characterized by strong anharmonicity and wave-like phonon tunneling. In particular, the strong anharmonic scattering induced by Cu- and Cs-dominated phonon modes plays a non-negligible role in suppressing particle-like propagation. Moreover, the coherence-driven conductivity dominates the total thermal conductivity along the $z$-axis, leading to an anomalous, wide-temperature-range (100-700 K) glassy-like thermal transport. Importantly, the significant coherence contribution, resulting from the coupling of distinct vibrational eigenstates, facilitates effective thermal transport across layers, sharply contrasting with traditional layered materials. As a result, the non-monotonic temperature dependence of coherences' thermal conductivity results from the combined effects of anharmonic scattering rates and anharmonic phonon renormalization. Our work not only reveals the significant contributions from the off-diagonal terms of heat flux operators in crystalline CsCu$_4$Se$_3$, but also explains the non-monotonic relationship between wave-like thermal conductivity and anharmonic scattering, providing insights into the microscopic mechanisms driving anomalous heat transport.</description>

      <title>A Universal Deep Learning Framework for Materials X-ray Absorption Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful characterization technique for probing the local chemical environment of absorbing atoms. However, analyzing XAS data presents significant challenges, often requiring extensive, computationally intensive simulations, as well as significant domain expertise. These limitations hinder the development of fast, robust XAS analysis pipelines that are essential in high-throughput studies and for autonomous experimentation. We address these challenges with OmniXAS, a framework that contains a suite of transfer learning approaches for XAS prediction, each contributing to improved accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated on K-edge spectra database covering eight 3d transition metals (Ti-Cu). The OmniXAS framework is built upon three distinct strategies. First, we use M3GNet to derive latent representations of the local chemical environment of absorption sites as input for XAS prediction, achieving up to order-of-magnitude improvements over conventional featurization techniques. Second, we employ a hierarchical transfer learning strategy, training a universal multi-task model across elements before fine-tuning for element-specific predictions. Models based on this cascaded approach after element-wise fine-tuning outperform element-specific models by up to 69%. Third, we implement cross-fidelity transfer learning, adapting a universal model to predict spectra generated by simulation of a different fidelity with a higher computational cost. This approach improves prediction accuracy by up to 11% over models trained on the target fidelity alone. Our approach boosts the throughput of XAS modeling by orders of magnitude versus first-principles simulations and is extendable to XAS prediction for a broader range of elements. This transfer learning framework is generalizable to enhance deep-learning models that target other properties in materials research.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric behavior of breathing kagom\'{e} monolayers of $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{(Cl, Br, I)}_8$ from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply density functional theory to explore the magnetoelectric (ME) properties of two-dimensional $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{(Cl,Br,I)}_8$. These compounds have recently been proposed to exhibit coupled ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order leading to a switchable anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). Using both spin-spiral and self-consistent spin-orbit coupled calculations, we predict an in-plane $120^\circ$ cycloid of trimerized spins as the ground state for $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Cl}_8$. For $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Br}_8$ and $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{I}_8$ we find long period incommensurate helical order. We calculate a number of magnetic properties such as the exchange constants, orbital magnetization, and Weiss temperatures. It is then shown that, despite having both broken inversion and time-reversal symmetry, the proposed AVHE and linear ME response are forbidden by the presence of helical order in the ground state. In addition, the computed switching trajectory demonstrates that it is unlikely that the polar state of the monolayers can be switched with a homogeneous electric field due to an unusual equation of state of the out-of-plane dipole moment. Nevertheless, we highlight that in the presence of a strong electric field, the trimerized spins in $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Cl}_8$ will exhibit a magnetic phase transition from the $120^\circ$ cycloid to out-of-plane ferromagnetic order, which restores the symmetry required for both AVHE and linear ME effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07064v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Response theories in condensed matter typically describe the response of an electron fluid to external electromagnetic fields, while perturbations on neutral particles are often designed to mimic such fields. Here, we study the response of fermions to a space-time-dependent velocity field, thereby sidestepping the issue of gauge charge. First, we use a semiclassical chiral kinematic theory to obtain the local density of current and extract the orbital magnetization. The theory immediately predicts a "converse vortical effect," defined as an orbital magnetization driven by linear velocity. It receives contributions from magnetic moments on the Fermi surface and the Berry curvature of the occupied bands. Then, transcending semiclassics via a complementary Kubo formalism reveals that the uniform limit of a clean system receives only the Berry curvature contribution while other limits sense the Fermi surface magnetic moments too. We propose CoSi as a candidate material and suggest magnetometry of a sample under a thermal gradient to detect the effect. Overall, our study sheds light on the effects of a space-time-dependent velocity field on electron fluids and paves the way for exploring quantum materials using new probes and perturbations.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in a paramagnetic effective spin-1/2 magnetic insulator CsYbSe$_2$, by introducing a minimal model requiring only Zeeman splitting and magnetoelastic coupling. We use it to argue that hybridized excitations -- formed from acoustic phonons and localized spin-flip-excitations across the Zeeman gap of the crystal electric field ground doublet -- are responsible for a non-monotonic field dependence of longitudinal thermal conductivity. Beyond highlighting a starring role for phonons, our results raise the prospect of universal magneto-thermal transport phenomena in paramagnetic insulators that originate from simple features shared across many systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the Kondo lattice model of multipolar magnetic moments interacting with conduction electrons on a triangular lattice. Bond-dependent electron hoppings induce a compass-like anisotropy in the effective Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between multipolar moments. This unique anisotropy stabilizes multipolar skyrmion crystals at zero magnetic field. In a unit cell, the skyrmion fractionalizes into meron composites subject to the conservation of total topological charge. Diverse multipolar phases in the phase diagram give rise to novel spontaneous Hall response of conduction electrons.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose-Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multi-layer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the non-Abelian Moore-Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore-Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multi-layer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</description>
