      <title>Deterministic factorization of constant-depth algebraic circuits in subexponential time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While efficient randomized algorithms for factorization of polynomials given by algebraic circuits have been known for decades, obtaining an even slightly non-trivial deterministic algorithm for this problem has remained an open question of great interest. This is true even when the input algebraic circuit has additional structure, for instance, when it is a constant-depth circuit. Indeed, no efficient deterministic algorithms are known even for the seemingly easier problem of factoring sparse polynomials or even the problem of testing the irreducibility of sparse polynomials.
  In this work, we make progress on these questions: we design a deterministic algorithm that runs in subexponential time, and when given as input a constant-depth algebraic circuit $C$ over the field of rational numbers, it outputs algebraic circuits (of potentially unbounded depth) for all the irreducible factors of $C$, together with their multiplicities. In particular, we give the first subexponential time deterministic algorithm for factoring sparse polynomials.
  For our proofs, we rely on a finer understanding of the structure of power series roots of constant-depth circuits and the analysis of the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator. In particular, we show that the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator constructed using low-degree hard polynomials (explicitly constructed in the work of Limaye, Srinivasan &amp; Tavenas) preserves not only the non-zeroness of small constant-depth circuits (as shown by Chou, Kumar &amp; Solomon), but also their irreducibility and the irreducibility of their factors.</description>

      <title>Collapsing Catalytic Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A catalytic machine is a space-bounded Turing machine with additional access to a second, much larger work tape, with the caveat that this tape is full, and its contents must be preserved by the computation. Catalytic machines were defined by Buhrman et al. (STOC 2014), who, alongside many follow-up works, exhibited the power of catalytic space ($CSPACE$) and in particular catalytic logspace machines ($CL$) beyond that of traditional space-bounded machines.
  Several variants of $CL$ have been proposed, including non-deterministic and co-non-deterministic catalytic computation by Buhrman et al. (STACS 2016) and randomized catalytic computation by Datta et al. (CSR 2020). These and other works proposed several questions, such as catalytic analogues of the theorems of Savitch and Immerman and Szelepcs\'enyi. Catalytic computation was recently derandomized by Cook et al. (STOC 2025), but only in certain parameter regimes.
  We settle almost all questions regarding randomized and non-deterministic catalytic computation, by giving an optimal reduction from catalytic space with additional resources to the corresponding non-catalytic space classes. With regards to non-determinism, our main result is that \[CL=CNL\] and with regards to randomness we show \[CL=CPrL\] where $CPrL$ denotes randomized catalytic logspace where the accepting probability can be arbitrarily close to $1/2$. We also have a number of near-optimal partial results for non-deterministic and randomized catalytic computation with less catalytic space. We show catalytic versions of Savitch's theorem, Immerman-Szelepsc\'enyi, and the derandomization results of Nisan and Saks and Zhou, all of which are unconditional and hold for all parameter settings.
  Our results build on the compress-or-compute framework of Cook et al. (STOC 2025). Despite proving broader and stronger results, our framework is simpler and more modular.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Probabilistic Computers Rigorously Powerful than Traditional Computers, and Derandomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09549v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the techniques used in our previous work to show that there exists a probabilistic Turing machine running within time $O(n^k)$ for all $k\in\mathbb{N}_1$ accepting a language $L_d$ which is different from any language in $\mathcal{P}$, and then further to prove that $L_d\in\mathcal{BPP}$, thus separating the complexity class $\mathcal{BPP}$ from the class $\mathcal{P}$ (i.e., $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{BPP}$).
  Since the complexity class $\mathcal{BQP}$ of $bounded$ $error$ $quantum$ $polynomial$-$time$ contains the complexity class $\mathcal{BPP}$ (i.e., $\mathcal{BPP}\subseteq\mathcal{BQP}$), we thus confirm the widespread-belief conjecture that quantum computers are $rigorously$ $powerful$ than traditional computers (i.e., $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{BQP}$).
  We further show that (1). $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{RP}$; (2). $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\text{co-}\mathcal{RP}$; (3). $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{ZPP}$. Previously, whether the above relations hold or not are long-standing open questions in complexity theory.
  Meanwhile, the result of $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{BPP}$ shows that $randomness$ plays an essential role in probabilistic algorithm design. In particular, we go further to show that:
  (1). The number of random bits used by any probabilistic algorithm which accepts the language $L_d$ can not be reduced to $O(\log n)$;
  (2). There exits no efficient (complexity-theoretic) {\em pseudorandom generator} (PRG) $$ G:\{0,1\}^{O(\log n)}\rightarrow \{0,1\}^n; $$
  (3). There exists no quick HSG $H:k(n)\rightarrow n$ such that $k(n)=O(\log n)$.</description>

      <title>Border subrank via a generalised Hilbert-Mumford criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the border subrank of a sufficiently general tensor in $(\mathbb{C}^n)^{\otimes d}$ is $\mathcal{O}(n^{1/(d-1)})$ for $n \to \infty$. Since this matches the growth rate $\Theta(n^{1/(d-1)})$ for the generic (non-border) subrank recently established by Derksen-Makam-Zuiddam, we find that the generic border subrank has the same growth rate. In our proof, we use a generalisation of the Hilbert-Mumford criterion that we believe will be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On classical advice, sampling advise and complexity assumptions for learning separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relationship between advice in the form of a training set and classical advice. We do this by analyzing the class \textbf{BPP/samp} and certain variants of it. Specifically, our main result demonstrates that \textbf{BPP/samp} is a proper subset of the class \textbf{P/poly}. This result remains valid when considering quantum advice and a quantum generalization of the training set. Finally, leveraging the insights gained from these proofs, we identify sufficient and necessary complexity assumptions for the existence of concept classes that exhibit a quantum learning speed-up in the worst-case scenario, i.e., when accurate results are required for all inputs, and in the average-case scenario.</description>

      <title>Towards a universal gateset for $\mathsf{QMA}_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ is $\mathsf{QMA}$ with perfect completeness, i.e., the prover must accept with a probability of exactly $1$ in the YES-case. Whether $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ and $\mathsf{QMA}$ are equal is still a major open problem. It is not even known whether $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ has a universal gateset; Solovay-Kitaev does not apply due to perfect completeness. Hence, we do not generally know whether $\mathsf{QMA}_1^G=\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G'}$ (superscript denoting gateset), given two universal gatesets $G,G'$. In this paper, we make progress towards the gateset question by proving that for all $k\in\mathbb N$, the gateset $G_{2^k}$ (Amy et al., RC 2024) is universal for all gatesets in the cyclotomic field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k}),\zeta_{2^k}=e^{2\pi i/2^k}$, i.e. $\mathsf{QMA}_1^G\subseteq\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$ for all gatesets $G$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k})$. For $\mathsf{BQP}_1$, we can even show that $G_2$ suffices for all $2^k$-th cyclotomic fields. We exhibit complete problems for all $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$: Quantum $l$-SAT in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k})$ is complete for $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$ for all $l\ge4$, and $l=3$ if $k\ge3$, where quantum $l$-SAT is the problem of deciding whether a set of $l$-local Hamiltonians has a common ground state. Additionally, we give the first $\mathsf{QMA}_1$-complete $2$-local Hamiltonian problem: It is $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$-complete (for $k\ge3$) to decide whether a given $2$-local Hamiltonian $H$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k})$ has a nonempty nullspace. Our techniques also extend to sparse Hamiltonians, and so we can prove the first $\mathsf{QMA}_1(2)$-complete (i.e. $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ with two unentangled provers) Hamiltonian problem. Finally, we prove that the Gapped Clique Homology problem defined by King and Kohler (FOCS 2024) is $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_2}$-complete, and the Clique Homology problem without promise gap is PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Corners in Quasirandom Groups via Sparse Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve the best known upper bounds on the density of corner-free sets over quasirandom groups from inverse poly-logarithmic to quasi-polynomial. We make similarly substantial improvements to the best known lower bounds on the communication complexity of a large class of permutation functions in the 3-player Number-on-Forehead model. Underpinning both results is a general combinatorial theorem that extends the recent work of Kelley, Lovett, and Meka (STOC'24), itself a development of ideas from the breakthrough result of Kelley and Meka on three-term arithmetic progressions (FOCS'23).</description>

      <title>On Approximability of $\ell_2^2$ Min-Sum Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering problem is to partition an input set into clusters $C_1,\ldots,C_k$ to minimize $\sum_{i=1}^k\sum_{p,q\in C_i}\|p-q\|_2^2$. Although $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering is NP-hard, it is not known whether it is NP-hard to approximate $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering beyond a certain factor.
  In this paper, we give the first hardness-of-approximation result for the $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering problem. We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the objective to a factor better than $1.056$ and moreover, assuming a balanced variant of the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis, it is NP-hard to approximate the objective to a factor better than 1.327.
  We then complement our hardness result by giving a nearly linear time parameterized PTAS for $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering running in time $O\left(n^{1+o(1)}d\cdot \exp((k\cdot\varepsilon^{-1})^{O(1)})\right)$, where $d$ is the underlying dimension of the input dataset.
  Finally, we consider a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has access to an oracle that outputs a label $i\in[k]$ for input point, thereby implicitly partitioning the input dataset into $k$ clusters that induce an approximately optimal solution, up to some amount of adversarial error $\alpha\in\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$. We give a polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a $\frac{1+\gamma\alpha}{(1-\alpha)^2}$-approximation to $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering, for a fixed constant $\gamma&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Recognizing 2-Layer and Outer $k$-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The crossing number of a graph is the least number of crossings over all drawings of the graph in the plane. Computing the crossing number of a given graph is NP-hard, but fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the natural parameter. Two well-known variants of the problem are 2-layer crossing minimization and circular crossing minimization, where every vertex must lie on one of two layers, namely two parallel lines, or a circle, respectively. Both variants are NP-hard, but FPT with respect to the natural parameter.
  Recently, a local version of the crossing number has also received considerable attention. A graph is $k$-planar if it admits a drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge. In contrast to the crossing number, recognizing $k$-planar graphs is NP-hard even if $k=1$.
  In this paper, we consider the two above variants in the local setting. The $k$-planar graphs that admit a straight-line drawing with vertices on two layers or on a circle are called 2-layer $k$-planar and outer $k$-planar graphs, respectively. We study the parameterized complexity of the two recognition problems with respect to $k$. For $k=0$, both problems can easily be solved in linear time. Two groups independently showed that outer 1-planar graphs can also be recognized in linear time [Hong et al., Algorithmica 2015; Auer et al., Algorithmica 2016]. One group asked whether outer 2-planar graphs can be recognized in polynomial time.
  Our main contribution consists of XP-algorithms for recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs and outer $k$-planar graphs. We complement these results by showing that both recognition problems are XNLP-hard. This implies that both problems are W$[t]$-hard for every $t$ and that it is unlikely that they admit FPT-algorithms. On the other hand, we present an FPT-algorithm for recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs where the order of the vertices on one layer is specified.</description>

      <title>More-efficient Quantum Multivariate Mean Value Estimator from Generalized Grover Gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient algorithm for multivariate mean value estimation. Our algorithm outperforms previous work by polylog factors and nearly saturates the known lower bound. More formally, given a random vector $\vec{X}$ of dimension $d$, we find an algorithm that uses $O\left(n \log \frac{d}{\delta}\right)$ samples to find a mean estimate that $\vec{\tilde{\mu}}$ that differs from the true mean $\vec{\mu}$ by $\frac{\sqrt{\text{tr } \Sigma}}{n}$ in $\ell^\infty$ norm and hence $\frac{\sqrt{d \text{ tr } \Sigma}}{n}$ in $\ell^2$ norm, where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix of the components of the random vector. We also presented another algorithm that uses smaller memory but costs an extra $d^\frac{1}{4}$ in complexity. Consider the Grover gate, the unitary operator used in Grover's algorithm. It contains an oracle that uses a $\pm 1$ phase for each candidate for the search space. Previous work has demonstrated that when we substitute the oracle in Grover gate with generic phases, it ended up being a good mean value estimator in some mathematical notion. We used this idea to build our algorithm. Our result remains not exactly optimal due to a $\log \frac{d}{\delta}$ term in our complexity, as opposed to something nicer such as $\log \frac{1}{\delta}$; This comes from the phase estimation primitive in our algorithm. So far, this primitive is the only major known method to tackle the problem, and moving beyond this idea seems hard. Our results demonstrates that the methodology with generalized Grover gate can be used develop the optimal algorithm without polylog overhead for different tasks relating to mean value estimation.</description>
