      <title>Improved Forecasts of Global Extreme Marine Heatwaves Through a Physics-guided Data-driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unusually warm sea surface temperature events known as marine heatwaves (MHWs) have a profound impact on marine ecosystems. Accurate prediction of extreme MHWs has significant scientific and financial worth. However, existing methods still have certain limitations, especially in the most extreme MHWs. In this study, to address these issues, based on the physical nature of MHWs, we created a novel deep learning neural network that is capable of accurate 10-day MHW forecasting. Our framework significantly improves the forecast ability of extreme MHWs through two specially designed modules inspired by numerical models: a coupler and a probabilistic data argumentation. The coupler simulates the driving effect of atmosphere on MHWs while the probabilistic data argumentation approaches significantly boost the forecast ability of extreme MHWs based on the idea of ensemble forecast. Compared with traditional numerical prediction, our framework has significantly higher accuracy and requires fewer computational resources. What's more, explainable AI methods show that wind forcing is the primary driver of MHW evolution and reveal its relation with air-sea heat exchange. Overall, our model provides a framework for understanding MHWs' driving processes and operational forecasts in the future.</description>

      <title>GraphDOP: Towards skilful data-driven medium-range weather forecasts learnt and initialised directly from observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GraphDOP, a new data-driven, end-to-end forecast system developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) that is trained and initialised exclusively from Earth System observations, with no physics-based (re)analysis inputs or feedbacks. GraphDOP learns the correlations between observed quantities - such as brightness temperatures from polar orbiters and geostationary satellites - and geophysical quantities of interest (that are measured by conventional observations), to form a coherent latent representation of Earth System state dynamics and physical processes, and is capable of producing skilful predictions of relevant weather parameters up to five days into the future.</description>

      <title>AIFS-CRPS: Ensemble forecasting using a model trained with a loss function based on the Continuous Ranked Probability Score</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last three decades, ensemble forecasts have become an integral part of forecasting the weather. They provide users with more complete information than single forecasts as they permit to estimate the probability of weather events by representing the sources of uncertainties and accounting for the day-to-day variability of error growth in the atmosphere. This paper presents a novel approach to obtain a weather forecast model for ensemble forecasting with machine-learning. AIFS-CRPS is a variant of the Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS) developed at ECMWF. Its loss function is based on a proper score, the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). For the loss, the almost fair CRPS is introduced because it approximately removes the bias in the score due to finite ensemble size yet avoids a degeneracy of the fair CRPS. The trained model is stochastic and can generate as many exchangeable members as desired and computationally feasible in inference. For medium-range forecasts AIFS-CRPS outperforms the physics-based Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) ensemble for the majority of variables and lead times. For subseasonal forecasts, AIFS-CRPS outperforms the IFS ensemble before calibration and is competitive with the IFS ensemble when forecasts are evaluated as anomalies to remove the influence of model biases.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporally Coherent Probabilistic Generation of Weather from Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local climate information is crucial for impact assessment and decision-making, yet coarse global climate simulations cannot capture small-scale phenomena. Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative approach that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this inference task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output.</description>

      <title>Efficient Lagrangian averaging with exponential filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian averaging is a valuable tool for the analysis and modelling of multiscale processes in fluid dynamics. The numerical computation of Lagrangian (time) averages from simulation data is challenging, however. It can be carried out by tracking a large number of particles or, following a recent approach, by solving a dedicated set of partial differential equations (PDEs). Both approaches are computationally demanding because they require an entirely new computation for each time at which the Lagrangian mean fields are desired.
  We overcome this drawback by developing a PDE-based method that delivers Lagrangian mean fields for all times through the single solution of evolutionary PDEs. This allows for an on-the-fly implementation, in which Lagrangian averages are computed along with the dynamical variables. This is made possible by the use of a special class of temporal filters whose kernels are sums of exponential functions.
  We focus on two specific kernels involving one and two exponential functions. We implement these in the rotating shallow-water model and demonstrate their effectiveness at filtering out large-amplitude Poincar\'e waves while retaining the salient features of an underlying slowly evolving turbulent flow.</description>
