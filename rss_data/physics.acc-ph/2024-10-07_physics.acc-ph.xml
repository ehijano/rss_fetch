      <title>Transverse beam instabilities in low-emittance booster synchrotrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the ring-based light source community is moving towards fourth-generation light sources, many facilities plan to upgrade their boosters in parallel to meet the more demanding beam properties for the storage ring, especially in terms of a much lower emittance. Concerns over collective effects have, therefore, risen, particularly in the transverse planes, since the vacuum chamber dimensions tend to be reduced as a way to achieve a stronger focusing force on the beam. In this article, we present numerical studies on transverse beam instabilities, both in the single- and multibunch regimes, in the SOLEIL II booster as an example of a low-emittance booster. We show that Landau damping is an efficient mechanism for suppressing both transverse single-bunch and coupled-bunch instabilities. We also prove that the damping in the longitudinal plane can diffuse to the transverse plane and limit the transverse emittance growth. Moreover, we have discovered that the beam can exhibit sawtooth instability at high energy and that broad-band impedance is one of the key factors in suppressing transverse coupled-bunch instability.</description>

      <title>High Performance Operation of a Direct-Current and Superconducting Radio-Frequency Combined Photocathode Gun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) guns are promising candidates to deliver high brightness continuous-wave (CW) electron beams for new generations of coherent linac light sources, ultrafast electron diffractions, MeV pulsed beam applications, etc. To solve the compatibility problem of semiconductor photocathodes, a hybrid gun combining a direct-current gap and an SRF cavity has been developed. The gun, employing K2CsSb photocathodes driven by a green laser, has been brought into stable CW operation with a dark current below 100 pA, delivering electron beams at an energy gain of 2.4 MeV, an electron bunch charge of 100 pC, and a repetition rate of 1 MHz. A normalized beam emittance of 0.54 mm-mrad has been achieved at the bunch charge of 100 pC and peak current of about 6 A. CW operation at 81.25 MHz repetition rate has also been tested with the maximum average beam current reaching 3 mA.</description>
