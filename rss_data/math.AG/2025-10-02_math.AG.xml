      <title>Motivic homotopy theory for perfect schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a perfect version of Morel--Voevodsky's motivic homotopy category over a perfect base scheme in positive characteristic. By checking the axioms of a coefficient system, we establish a six-functor formalism. We show that multiplication by $p$ is already invertible in the perfect motivic homotopy catgory. By work of Elmanto--Khan the functor sending an $\mathbb{F}_p$-scheme $S$ to the category $\mathrm{S}\mathcal{H}(S)[1/p]$ is invariant under universal homeomorphisms, hence under perfections. Our result gives an explicit model for the localization of $\mathrm{S}\mathcal{H}$ at the universal homeomorphisms, which we conclude is the same as $\mathrm{S}\mathcal{H}[1/p]$.</description>

      <title>Finite isoresidual covers in strata of $k$-differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the strata of primitive $k$-differentials on the Riemann sphere whose singularities, except for two, are poles of order divisible by $k$. The map that assigns to each $k$-differential the $k$-residues at these poles is a ramified cover of its image. Generalizing results known in the case of abelian differentials, we describe the ramification locus of this cover and provide a formula, involving the $k$-factorial function, for the cardinality of each fiber. We prove this formula using intersection calculations on the multi-scale compactification of the strata of $k$-differentials. In special cases, we also give alternative proofs using flat geometry. Finally, we present an application to cone spherical metrics with dihedral monodromy.</description>

      <title>Determinantal ideals of secant varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Hilbert schemes of points, we establish a number of results for a smooth projective variety $X$ in a sufficiently ample embedding. If $X$ is a curve or a surface, we show that the ideals of higher secant varieties are determinantally presented, and we prove the same for the first secant variety if $X$ has arbitrary dimension. This completely settles a conjecture of Eisenbud-Koh-Stillman for curves and partially resolves a conjecture of Sidman-Smith in higher dimensions. If $X$ is a curve or a surface we also prove that the corresponding embedding of the Hilbert scheme of points $X^{[d]}$ into the Grassmannian is projectively normal. Finally, if $X$ is an arbitrary projective scheme in a sufficiently ample embedding, then we demonstrate that its homogeneous ideal is generated by quadrics of rank three, confirming a conjecture of Han-Lee-Moon-Park. Along the way, we check that the Hilbert scheme of three points on a smooth variety is the blow-up of the symmetric product along the big diagonal.</description>

      <title>Quadratic equations of tangent varieties via four-way tensors of linear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we construct quadratic equations and linear syzygies for tangent varieties using 4-way tensors of linear forms and generalize this method to higher secant varieties of higher osculating varieties. Such equations extend the classical determinantal ones of higher secant varieties and span all the equations of the same degree for smooth projective curves completely embedded by sufficiently positive line bundles, proving a variant of the Eisenbud-Koh-Stillman conjecture on determinantal equations. On the other hand, our syzygies are compatible with the Green-Lazarsfeld classes and generate the corresponding Koszul cohomology groups for Segre varieties with a prescribed number of factors. To obtain these results we describe the equations of minimal possible degrees and reinterpret the Green-Lazarsfeld classes from the perspective of representation theory.</description>

      <title>Projective models for Hilbert squares of $K3$ surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a very general polarized $K3$ surface $S\subset \mathbb{P}^g$ of genus $g\ge 5$, we study the linear system on the Hilbert square $S^{[2]}$ parametrizing quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^g$ that contain $S$. We prove its very ampleness for $g\geq 7$. In the cases of genus 7 or 8, we describe in detail the projective geometry of the corresponding embedding by making use of the Mukai model for $S$. In both cases, it can be realized as a degeneracy locus on an ambient homogeneous space, in a strikingly similar fashion. In consequence, we give explicit descriptions of its ideal and syzygies. Furthermore, we extract new information on the locally complete families, in a first step towards the understanding of their projective geometry.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Hosono-Lee-Lian-Yau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the mirror construction of singular Calabi-Yau double covers, introduced by Hosono, Lee, Lian, and Yau, to a broader class of singular Calabi-Yau $(\mathbb{Z}/2)^k$-Galois covers, and prove Hodge number duality for both the original and extended mirror pairs. A main tool in our approach is an analogue of the Cayley trick, which relates the de Rham complex of the branched covers to the twisted de Rham complex of certain Landau-Ginzburg models. In particular, it reveals direct relations between the Hodge numbers of the covers and the irregular Hodge numbers of the associated Landau-Ginzburg models. This construction is independent of mirror symmetry and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Novel Algorithm for Representing Positive Semi-Definite Polynomials as Sums of Squares with Rational Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm for constructing a sum-of-squares (SOS) decomposition for positive semi-definite polynomials with rational coefficients. Unlike previous methods that typically yield SOS decompositions with floating-point coefficients, our approach ensures that all coefficients in the decomposition remain rational. This is particularly useful in formal verification and symbolic computation, where exact arithmetic is required. We introduce a stepwise reduction technique that transforms a given polynomial into a sum of ladder-like squares while preserving rationality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to existing numerical approaches. This artical is an extension of the following Chinnese paper: HUANG Yong , ZENG Zhenbing , YANG Lu , RAO Yongsheng. An Algorithm to Represent Positive Semi-Definite Polynomials to Sum of Lader-Like Squares of Polynomials with Rational Coefficients (in Chinese).

      <description>arXiv:2510.01804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a class of nonsingular holomorphic foliations on compact complex tori which generalizes (in higher codimension) the turbulent foliations of codimension one constructed by Ghys. For those smooth turbulent foliations we prove that all transversely holomorphic Cartan geometries are flat. We also establish a uniqueness result for the transversely holomorphic Cartan geometries.</description>

Abstract: We show that the homology of modules for Hurwitz spaces stabilizes and compute its stable value. As one consequence, we compute the moments of Selmer groups in quadratic twist families of abelian varieties over suitably large function fields. As a second consequence, we deduce a version of Bhargava's conjecture, counting the number of $S_d$ degree $d$ extensions of $\mathbb F_q(t)$, for suitably large $q$. As a third consequence, we deduce that the homology of Hurwitz spaces associated to racks with a single component satisfy representation stability.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a three-dimensional smooth complete intersection of two quadrics over a field k is k-rational if and only if it contains a line defined over k. To do so, we develop a theory of intermediate Jacobians for geometrically rational threefolds over arbitrary, not necessarily perfect, fields. As a consequence, we obtain the first examples of smooth projective varieties over a field k which have a k-point, and are rational over a purely inseparable field extension of k, but not over k.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.04463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Call a Laurent polynomial $W$ `complete' if its Newton polytope is full-dimensional with zero in its interior. We show that if $W$ is any complete Laurent polynomial with coefficients in the positive part of the field $K$ of generalised Puiseux series, then $W$ has a unique positive critical point $p_{crit}$. Here a generalised Puiseux series is called `positive' if the coefficient of its leading term is in $\mathbb R_{&gt;0}$. Using the valuation on $K$ we obtain a canonically associated `tropical critical point' $d_{crit}$ in $\mathbb R^{r}$ for which we give a finite recursive construction. We show that this result is compatible with a general form of mutation, so that it can be applied in a cluster varieties setting. We also give applications to toric geometry including, via the theory of [FOOO], to the construction of canonical non-displaceable Lagrangian tori for toric symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the quotient of the Brauer group of a product of varieties over k by the sum of the images of the Brauer groups of factors has finite exponent. The bulk of the proof concerns p-primary torsion in characteristic p. Our approach gives a more direct proof of the boundedness of the p-primary torsion of the Brauer group of an abelian variety, as recently proved by D'Addezio. We show that the transcendental Brauer group of a Kummer surface over k has finite exponent, but can be infinite when k is an infinite field of positive characteristic. This answers a question of Zarhin and the author.</description>

      <title>Symplectic actions of groups of order 4 on K3^[2]-type manifolds, and standard involutions on Nikulin-type orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a K3^[2]-type manifold X with a symplectic involution i, the quotient X/i admits a Nikulin orbifold Y as terminalization. We study the symplectic action of a group G of order 4 on X, such that i belongs to G, and the natural involution induced on Y (the two groups give two different results). We give a lattice-theoretic classification of X and Y in the projective case, and give some explicit examples of models of X. We also give lattice-theoretic criteria that a Nikulin-type orbifold N has to satisfy to admit a symplectic involution that deforms to an induced one.</description>

      <title>Planar tropical caustics: trivalency and convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tropical caustic of a convex domain on the plane is a canonically associated tropical analytic curve inside the domain. In this note we give a graphical proof for the classification of its intermediate vertices, implying in particular that they are always trivalent. Apart from that we explain how various known examples of tropical caustics are constructed and discuss the possibility of relaxing the convexity condition for the domain.</description>

      <title>Vertex functions for bow varieties and their Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the vertex functions of finite type A bow varieties. Vertex functions are K-theoretic analogs of I-functions, and 3d mirror symmetry predicts that the q-difference equations satisfied by the vertex functions of a variety and its 3d mirror dual are the same after a change of variable swapping the roles of the various parameters. Thus the vertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is expected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove all of these statements. The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of complete flag varieties, for which the q-difference equations can be explicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in this reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer" flag variety. Our formula involves specializing certain K\"ahler parameters (also called Novikov parameters) to singularities of the vertex functions. In the $\hbar\to \infty$ limit, this statement is expected to degenerate to an analogous result about I-functions of flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Torus Actions on Matrix Schubert and Kazhdan-Lusztig Varieties, and their Links to Statistical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the toric geometry of two families of generalised determinantal varieties arising from permutations: Matrix Schubert varieties ($\overline{X_w}$) and Kazhdan-Lusztig varieties ($\mathcal{N}_{v,w}$). Matrix Schubert varieties can be written as $\overline{X_w} = Y_w \times \mathbb C^d$, where $d$ is maximal. We are especially interested in the structure and complexity of these varieties $Y_w$ and $\mathcal{N}_{v,w}$ under the so-called usual torus actions. In the case when $Y_w$ is toric, we provide a full characterisation of the simple reflections $s_i$ that render ${Y_{w \cdot s_i}}$ toric, as well as the corresponding changes to the weight cone. For Kazhdan-Lusztig varieties, we consider how moving one of the two permutations $v,w$ along a chain in the Bruhat poset affects their complexity. Additionally, we study the complexity of these varieties, for permutations $v$ and $w$ of a specific structure. Finally, we consider the links between these determinantal varieties and two classes of statistical models; namely conditional independence and quasi-independence models.</description>

      <title>Extensions Of Unirational Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We undertake a study of extensions of unirational algebraic groups. We prove that extensions of unirational groups are also unirational over fields of degree of imperfection $1$, but that this fails over every field of higher degree of imperfection, answering a question of Achet. We also initiate a study of those groups which admit filtrations with unirational graded pieces, and show that one may deduce unirationality of unipotent groups from unirationality of certain quotients.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic rank bounds for abelian varieties over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It follows from the Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich formula that the rank of an abelian variety (with trivial trace) defined over the function field of a curve is bounded by a quantity which depends on the genus of the base curve and on bad reduction data. Using a function field version of classical $\ell$-descent techniques, we derive an arithmetic refinement of this bound, extending previous work of the second and third authors from elliptic curves to abelian varieties, and improving on their result in the case of elliptic curves. When the abelian variety is the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve, we produce a more explicit $2$-descent map. Then we apply this machinery to studying points on the Jacobians of certain genus $2$ curves over $k(t)$, where $k$ is some perfect base field of characteristic not $2$.</description>

      <title>Ekedahl-Oort strata in the $\mathsf{GU}(q-2,2)$ Shimura variety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the characteristic-$p$ fibers of $\mathsf{GU}(q-2,2)$ Shimura varieties, which classify abelian varieties with additional structure. These Shimura varieties admit two stratifications of interest: the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, based on the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion subgroup scheme, and the Newton stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group. In this paper, we present several novel techniques that give a better understanding of the Ekedahl-Oort stratification and of the interaction between the two stratifications for a general signature $(q-2,2)$.</description>

      <title>A note on weight filtrations at the characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that $\kgl$-linear cohomology theories over an affine Dedekind scheme $S$ admit a canonical weight filtration on resolvable motives without inverting residual characteristics. Combined with upcoming work of Annala--Hoyois--Iwasa, this endows essentially all known logarithmic cohomology theories with weight filtrations when evaluated on projective sncd pairs $(X,D)$ over $S$. Furthermore, the weight-filtered cohomology is an invariant of the open part $U = X-D$.
  On variants of de Rham cohomology, we show that our weight filtration recovers the d\'ecalaged pole-order filtration defined by Deligne. One interpretation of this is that the spectral sequence associated to the pole-order filtration is an invariant of $U$ from the $E_2$-page onwards, which generalizes a result of Deligne from characteristic 0 to positive and mixed characteristic, and suggests that ``mixed Hodge theory'' is a useful invariant of $S$-schemes.
  Finally, we compute explicit examples of weight filtered pieces of cohomology theories. One of the computations reproves a slight weakening of a result of Thuillier stating that the singular cohomology of the dual complex associated to the boundary divisor of a good projective compactification does not depend on the chosen compactification.
  In the appendix, we prove the folklore results that the Whitehead tower functor is fully faithful and that perfect bivariant pairings with respect to the twisted arrow category correspond to duality.</description>

      <title>Isotopy invariance and stratified $\mathbb{E}_2$-structure of the Ran Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a complex reductive group. A folklore result asserts the existence of an $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra structure on the Ran Grassmannian of $G$ over $\mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$, seen as a topological space with the complex-analytic topology. The aim of this paper is to prove this theorem, by establishing a homotopy invariance result: namely, an inclusion of open balls $D' \subset D$ in $\mathbb{C}$ induces a homotopy equivalence between the respective Beilinson--Drinfeld Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}_{G, {D'}^n} \hookrightarrow \mathrm{Gr}_{G, D^n}$, for any positive integer $n$. We use a purely algebraic approach, showing that automorphisms of a complex smooth algebraic curve $X$ can be lifted to automorphisms of the associated Beilinson--Drinfeld Grassmannian. As a consequence, we obtain a stronger version of the usual homotopy invariance result: namely, the homotopies can be promoted to equivariant stratified isotopies, where "equivariant" refers to the action of the arc group $\mathrm{L}^+G$ and "stratified" refers to the stratification induced by the Schubert stratification of $\mathrm{Gr}_G$ and the incidence stratification of $\mathbb{C}^n$.</description>
