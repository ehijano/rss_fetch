      <title>Coinductive Streams in Monoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce monoidal streams. Monoidal streams are a generalization of causal stream functions, which can be defined in cartesian monoidal categories, to arbitrary symmetric monoidal categories. In the same way that streams provide semantics to dataflow programming with pure functions, monoidal streams provide semantics to dataflow programming with theories of processes represented by a symmetric monoidal category. Monoidal streams also form a feedback monoidal category. In the same way that we can use a coinductive stream calculus to reason about signal flow graphs, we can use coinductive string diagrams to reason about feedback monoidal categories. As an example, we study syntax for a stochastic dataflow language, with semantics in stochastic monoidal streams.</description>

      <title>Evidential Decision Theory via Partial Markov Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12989v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce partial Markov categories. In the same way that Markov categories encode stochastic processes, partial Markov categories encode stochastic processes with constraints, observations and updates. In particular, we prove a synthetic Bayes theorem and we apply it to define a syntactic partial theory of observations on any Markov category, whose normalisations can be computed in the original Markov category. Finally, we formalise Evidential Decision Theory in terms of partial Markov categories, and provide implemented examples.</description>

      <title>A Concrete Model for Disjunction in Parallel and Algebraic Lambda Calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an interpretation for disjunctions in the presence of parallel and sum operators in both the parallel lambda calculus and the algebraic lambda calculus. Unlike conventional approaches that treat disjunction as a coproduct, we introduce a set-theoretic interpretation based on the union of the disjoint union and the Cartesian product, which does not form a coproduct in our proposed models. This leads to concrete models in the category ${\mathbf{Mag}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are magmas and whose arrows are those of Set, and in the category ${\mathbf{AMag}^{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are action magmas and whose arrows are also those of Set. This framework enables a refined treatment of parallelism and algebraic structure. We define two lambda calculi: (i) a parallel lambda calculus where the parallel operator is a constructor of collections, and (ii) an algebraic lambda calculus incorporating scalars. Each calculus is given a formal interpretation in a corresponding category, ensuring soundness and adequacy. Our results provide a novel approach to integrating parallelism and algebraic structure within propositional logic while preserving key proof-theoretic properties.</description>

      <title>Probability and Angelic Nondeterminism with Multiset Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a version of probabilistic Kleene algebra with angelic nondeterminism and a corresponding class of automata. Our approach implements semantics via distributions over multisets in order to overcome theoretical barriers arising from the lack of a distributive law between the powerset and Giry monads. We produce a full Kleene theorem and a coalgebraic theory, as well as both operational and denotational semantics and equational reasoning principles.</description>

      <title>On Piecewise Affine Reachability with Bellman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A piecewise affine map is one of the simplest mathematical objects exhibiting complex dynamics. The reachability problem of piecewise affine maps is as follows: Given two vectors $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{Q}^d$ and a piecewise affine map $f$, is there $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{n}(\mathbf{s}) = \mathbf{t}$? Koiran, Cosnard, and Garzon show that the reachability problem of piecewise affine maps is undecidable even in dimension 2.
  Most of the recent progress has been focused on decision procedures for one-dimensional piecewise affine maps, where the reachability problem has been shown to be decidable for some subclasses. However, the general undecidability discouraged research into positive results in arbitrary dimension.
  In this work, we investigate a rich subclass of piecewise affine maps arising as Bellman operators of Markov decision processes (MDPs). We consider the reachability problem restricted to this subclass and examine its decidability in arbitrary dimensions. We establish that the reachability problem for Bellman operators is decidable in any dimension under either of the following conditions (i) the target vector $\mathbf{t}$ is not the fixed point of the operator $f$; or (ii) the initial and target vectors $\mathbf{s}$ and $\mathbf{t}$ are comparable with respect to the componentwise order. Furthermore, we show that the reachability problem for two-dimensional Bellman operators is decidable for arbitrary $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t}\in \mathbb{Q}^d$, in contrast to the known undecidability of reachability for general piecewise affine maps.</description>
