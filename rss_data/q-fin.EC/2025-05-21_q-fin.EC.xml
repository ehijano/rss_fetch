      <title>The emerging AI 'revolution tranquille' in America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using data from the U.S. Census Bureaus Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS), I examine the adoption of AI among US firms at national, state, industry, and firm size levels. I find that adoption remains overall low (only around 7% of firms currently use AI), but is on a steady upward trajectory with a rising share of firms planning to implement AI. Adoption rates vary significantly across regions and sectors: some states are emerging as early adopters, while others lag, and knowledge-intensive industries (such as information technology and professional services) along with larger firms show higher openness to AI adoption compared to sectors like construction or small businesses. In general, these trends indicate that a quiet revolution in AI adoption is underway; a gradual but expanding diffusion of AI across the economy with important implications for future productivity and policy.</description>

      <title>Birthweight Declined During the Pandemic and It Is Falling Further Post-pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent literature reports mixed evidence on whether birthweight has decreased during the pandemic. In this paper, we use New York's hospital inpatient discharge data and contribute to this ongoing debate in multiple ways. First, we corroborate that birthweight has declined during the pandemic by 7g (grams). Second, we provide the first empirical evidence that, after the pandemic, not only birthweight has not reverted to the pre-pandemic levels, but it has fallen lower, 17g below the pre-pandemic levels. Third, in the post-pandemic years, mothers who are hospitalized to give birth are 27% more likely to be at a higher mortality risk and 8% more likely to have a higher severity of illness. Disruptions to birthweight could have far-reaching consequences for the health, longevity, and well-being of the population. Therefore, understanding the full scope of COVID-19's influence on birthweight is a vital and timely practice. Future research is needed to test whether our results are driven by true underlying changes in birthweight and complications or by healthcare providers being induced (financially or otherwise) to report birthweight differently.</description>

      <title>Falling Birthrate and Rising C-section: Post-Pandemic Evidence from New York</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The literature documents the effects of the pandemic on birthrate, birthweight, and pregnancy complications. This study contributes to this growing body of research by examining multiple facets of the phenomenon. Using the 2012-2022 hospital inpatient discharge data of New York, we implemented fixed-effects regression models and reported three key findings. First, birthrate was declining pre-pandemic by 1.11% annually. Second, we documented an additional 7.61% decline in birthrate with the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Notably, birthrate did not return to the pre-pandemic trajectory in subsequent years, indicating a persistent decline. Third, this post-pandemic decline was greater in vaginal delivery, with weak evidence of a drop in C-section. In our sample, C-section generates 61% more revenue than vaginal delivery. This raises the possibility that, in response to declining birthrate, healthcare providers have increased C-section rates to make up for lost revenues. While this hinted at upselling in the delivery room, further research is needed to draw definitive conclusions.</description>

      <title>Development of Railway Silk Road as a Platform for Promoting Georgias Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The given paper emphasizes the importance of the Railway Silk Road for promoting Georgia's economic growth and development. The article notes that economic integration in the region increases cargo turnover in Central Asia and the Caucasus, thus boosting the volume of goods transported through Georgia and contributing to the sustainability of Georgia's macroeconomic and economic growth. The financial economic models aim to identify causal links between the sensitivity of railway cargo and the country's economic growth. The main task of the research was to use the Railway EVA and the Georgian economy to create a cargo sensitivity relationship between CAGR models. The paper analyzes key scientific problems regarding railway freight transportation studies. Calculations are provided for the share of the Railway System in the country's GDP for 2006-2017, as well as the average annual geometric (CAGR) growth of cargo volumes over a 16-year cycle, allowing Georgian Railway JSC to generate additional value in the country's overall GDP. The research shows that the added value to GDP comes in direct and indirect forms through the development and growth of various sectors of Georgia's economy, as some of the cargo shipped by railway remains in Georgia and is used in production, thereby adding value to the country's economic growth. The use of this model by foreign research centers also provides further opportunities for the economic growth of their countries.</description>

      <title>Following the herd: The influence of the bandwagon heuristic on e-commerce shoppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research study examined how the number of reviews, review scores product involvement, and product review valence affect consumers' shopping decisions. Specifically, two online experiments were conducted to examine how product review scores interact with the number of reviews, product involvement, and review valence in affecting bandwagon perceptions and purchase intention. A mock website that displays products and product review metrics was constructed for the purpose of the research. The findings suggest that product review scores, and their interaction with product involvement and review valence, influenced consumers' shopping decisions.</description>

      <title>International Tourism and Global Biodiversity Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of international tourism on biodiversity risks has received considerable attention, yet quantitative research in this field remains relatively limited. This study constructs a biodiversity risk index for 155 countries and regions spanning the years 2001 to 2019, analysing how international tourism influences biodiversity risks in destination countries. The results indicate that the growth of international tourism significantly elevates biodiversity risks, with these effects displaying both lagging and cumulative characteristics. Furthermore, spatial analysis shows that international tourism also intensifies biodiversity risks in neighbouring countries. The extent of its impact varies according to the tourism model and destination. In addition, government regulations and international financial assistance play a crucial role in mitigating the biodiversity risks associated with international tourism.</description>

      <title>Product Design Using Generative Adversarial Network: Incorporating Consumer Preference and External Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has facilitated automated product design but often neglects valuable consumer preference data within companies' internal datasets. Additionally, external sources such as social media and user-generated content (UGC) platforms contain substantial untapped information on product design and consumer preferences, yet remain underutilized. We propose a novel framework that transforms the product design paradigm to be data-driven, automated, and consumer-centric. Our method employs a semi-supervised deep generative architecture that systematically integrates multidimensional consumer preferences and heterogeneous external data. The framework is both generative and preference-aware, enabling companies to produce consumer-aligned designs with enhanced cost efficiency. Our framework trains a specialized predictor model to comprehend consumer preferences and utilizes predicted popularity metrics to guide a continuous conditional generative adversarial network (CcGAN). The trained CcGAN can directionally generate consumer-preferred designs, circumventing the expenditure associated with testing suboptimal candidates. Using external data, our framework offers particular advantages for start-ups or other resource-constrained companies confronting the ``cold-start" problem. We demonstrate the framework's efficacy through an empirical application with a self-operated photography chain, where our model successfully generated superior photo template designs. We also conduct web-based experiments to verify our method and confirm its effectiveness across varying design contexts.</description>

      <title>BlockingPy: approximate nearest neighbours for blocking of records for entity resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entity resolution (probabilistic record linkage, deduplication) is a key step in scientific analysis and data science pipelines involving multiple data sources. The objective of entity resolution is to link records without common unique identifiers that refer to the same entity (e.g., person, company). However, without identifiers, researchers need to specify which records to compare in order to calculate matching probability and reduce computational complexity. One solution is to deterministically block records based on some common variables, such as names, dates of birth or sex or use phonetic algorithms. However, this approach assumes that these variables are free of errors and completely observed, which is often not the case. To address this challenge, we have developed a Python package, BlockingPy, which uses blocking via modern approximate nearest neighbour search and graph algorithms to reduce the number of comparisons. In this paper, we present the design of the package, its functionalities and two case studies related to official statistics. The presented software will be useful for researchers interested in linking data from various sources.</description>
