      <title>Quantale-valued maps and partial maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathsf{Q}$ be a commutative and unital quantale. By a $\mathsf{Q}$-map we mean a left adjoint in the quantaloid of sets and $\mathsf{Q}$-relations, and by a partial $\mathsf{Q}$-map we refer to a Kleisli morphism with respect to the maybe monad on the category $\mathsf{Q}\text{-}\mathbf{Map}$ of sets and $\mathsf{Q}$-maps. It is shown that every $\mathsf{Q}$-map is symmetric if and only if $\mathsf{Q}$ is weakly lean, and that every $\mathsf{Q}$-map is exactly a map in $\mathbf{Set}$ if and only $\mathsf{Q}$ is lean. Moreover, assuming the axiom of choice, it is shown that the category of sets and partial $\mathsf{Q}$-maps is monadic over $\mathsf{Q}\text{-}\mathbf{Map}$.</description>

      <title>The least subtopos containing the discrete skeleton of $\Omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p: \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{S}$ be a pre-cohesive geometric morphism. We show that the least subtopos of $\mathcal{E}$ containing both the subcategories $p^*: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{E}$ and $p^!: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{E}$ exists, and that it coincides with the least subtopos containing $p^*2$, where 2 denotes the subobject classifier of $\mathcal{S}$.</description>

      <title>Gray (skew) multicategories: double and Gray-categorical cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct in a unifying way skew-multicategories and multicategories of double and Gray-categories that we call Gray (skew) multicategories. We study their different versions depending on the types of functors and higher transforms. We construct Gray type products by generators and relations and prove that Gray skew-multicategories are closed and representable on one side, and that the Gray multicaticategories taken with the strict type of functors are representable. We conclude that the categories of double and Gray-categories with strict functors underlying Gray (skew) multicategories are skew monoidal, respectively monoidal, depending on the type of the inner-hom and product considered. The described Gray (skew) multicategories we see as prototypes of general Gray (skew) multicategories, which correspond to (higher) categories of higher dimensional internal and enriched categories.</description>

      <title>Interpolation of the oscillator representation and Azumaya algebras in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{C}$ be a symmetric tensor category and let $A$ be an Azumaya algebra in $\mathfrak{C}$. Assuming a certain invariant $\eta(A) \in \mathrm{Pic}(\mathfrak{C})[2]$ vanishes, and fixing a certain choice of signs, we show that there is a universal tensor functor $\Phi \colon \mathfrak{C} \to \mathfrak{D}$ for which $\Phi(A)$ splits. We apply this when $\mathfrak{C}=\underline{\mathrm{Rep}}(\mathbf{Sp}_t(\mathbf{F}_q))$ is the interpolation category of finite symplectic groups and $A$ is a certain twisted group algbera in $\mathfrak{C}$, and we show that the splitting category $\mathfrak{D}$ is S. Kriz's interpolation category of the oscillator representation. This construction has a number advantages over previous ones; e.g., it works in non-semisimple cases. It also brings some conceptual clarity to the situation: the existence of Kriz's category is tied to the non-triviality of the Brauer group of $\mathfrak{C}$.</description>

      <title>Premonoidal and Kleisli double categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a double categorical version of the recently introduced notion of premonoidal bicategories of Paquet and Saville. We investigate the relation of a premonoidal double category to pseudodouble quasi-functors of two variables and show that a double category possesses a pseudodouble quasi-functor if and only if it is binoidal and purely central. We introduce the notion of cubical double functors of three and more variables and their vertical transformations. We use them to show that a double category $\Dd$ has a premonoidal structure induced by a quasi-functor if and only if $\Dd$ is monoidal. This is further equivalent to $\Dd$ being premonoidal and purely central, in which case the pure center double category $\Zz_p(\Dd)$ is monoidal.
  Exploiting the lifting properties of vertical structures in a double category into their horizontal counterparts, if certain companions exist, we prove a series of further results. We use the notions of double monads and the Kleisli double category of Gambino, Garner and Vasilakopoulou. We firstly introduce a vertical strength on a vertical double monad on a monoidal double category, and also a horizontal strength on a horizontal double monad on a (horizontally) monoidal double category. We prove that vertical strengths on vertical double monads induce horizontal strengths on the induced horizontal double monads. We show that vertical strengths induce actions of a monoidal double category on the corresponding horizontal Kleisli double category of the induced horizontal double monad. Morever, we prove that for a bistrong vertical double monad the mentioned Kleisli double category is premonoidal. The latter two results are double categorical analogues of the corresponding bicategorical results of Paquet and Saville. Thanks to the double categorical approach they count with much simpler proofs.</description>

      <title>You Wouldn't Permutahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop formulas that define permutahedral commutation coherence relations of all orders. To illustrate the result geometrically, we begin by defining a rigid transformation of the $(n+1)$-permutahedron into a $n$-cube of dimensions $1 \times 2 \times \cdots \times n$. With a fictitious assumption, we 'define' the corresponding coherence relations 'up to associativity' as an instance of a semi-simplicial type in the language of Displayed Type Theory. This is not a formal result in type theory, but we expect this to translate into one as soon as the problem of defining associahedral coherences is solved in a type theory with semi-simplicial types. On the other hand, this not-strictly-well-typed definition may be used to produce well-typed formulas in a restricted setting.</description>

      <title>The Surface Signature and Rough Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel transport, or path development, provides a rich characterization of paths which preserves the underlying algebraic structure of concatenation. The path signature is universal among such maps: any (translation-invariant) parallel transport factors uniquely through the path signature. Furthermore, the path signature is a central object in the theory of rough paths, which provides an integration theory for highly irregular paths. A fundamental result is Lyons' extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough paths, and in turn provides a way to compute parallel transport of arbitrarily irregular paths. In this article, we consider the notion of surface holonomy, a generalization of parallel transport to the higher dimensional setting of surfaces parametrized by rectangular domains, which preserves the higher algebraic structures of horizontal and vertical concatenation. Building on work of Kapranov, we introduce the surface signature, which is universal among surface holonomy maps with respect to continuous 2-connections. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a rough surface and prove a surface extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough surfaces. By exploiting the universal property of the surface signature, this provides a method to compute the surface holonomy of arbitrarily irregular surfaces.</description>
