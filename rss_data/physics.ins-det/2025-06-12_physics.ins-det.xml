      <title>Light Dark Matter Detection with Sub-eV Transition-Edge Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of high-resolution transition-edge sensors (TESs) as a quantum sensing platform for detecting dark matter (DM). Operating near the thermodynamic noise limit with sub-eV energy resolution, TESs offer a powerful approach for probing light DM in the sub-GeV mass range. Optical TESs, realized on superconducting films with critical temperatures below 150 mK, achieve energy thresholds below 100 meV and enable precise calorimetric detection of individual energy depositions. We model TES response by incorporating fundamental noise sources and applying optimal filtering techniques, and evaluate their sensitivity across a range of DM interaction channels, accounting for in-medium effects in the target material. We show that even ng-month-scale exposures can reach previously unexplored DM-electron scattering cross sections below $10^{-27}$ cm$^2$ for sub-MeV masses, and can probe the MeV-scale mass range for DM-nucleon couplings. Combining high energy resolution, photon-number sensitivity, and scalability, optical TESs provide a compelling quantum sensing platform for rare-event searches at the intersection of particle physics and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Search for Primordial Black Holes from the International Space Station with the SQM-ISS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the observational capabilities and sensitivity of the SQM-ISS detector to primordial black holes. The SQM-ISS experiment aims to detect slow, non relativistic massive particles within cosmic rays, using a detector on board the International Space Station. The device is designed to recognize the passage of highly penetrating and dense particles in a wide range of mass and charge states such as Strange Quark Matter (SQM). These particles, traveling at speeds typical of gravitationally bound objects in the galaxy - around 250 km/s - are also possible candidates of dark matter. The ability of SQM-ISS to identify penetrating, massive and slow-moving objects allows it also to be sensitive to the detection of primordial black holes. We discuss how black holes, traveling through the detector at velocities compatible with galactic orbital speeds, can be identified based on their interaction signatures.</description>

      <title>Study of Stability and Consistency of EAS Thermal Neutron Detection at ENDA-64</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction:Electron-Neutron Detector Array (ENDA) is designed to measure thermal neutrons produced by hadronic interactions between cosmic ray extensive air showers (EAS) and the surrounding environment as well as electrons around the cores of EAS. ENDA is located within Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). ENDA was expanded from an initial 16 detectors to 64 detectors in April 2023, so called ENDA-64, and has been running alongside LHAASO. The stability and consistency of neutron detection are crucial for laying a solid foundation for subsequent data analysis and physical results. Methods:We obtain the stability by studying variations of event rate and thermal neutron rate in each cluster and the consistency by comparing distribution of number of thermal neutrons between clusters. Additionally, we investigate the specific influences of the rainy and dry seasons, as well as the presence or absence of sand cubes under the detectors, to examine the environmental factors affecting neutron measurement performance. Results:The calibration results indicate good consistency in thermal neutron detection across the clusters, with the maximum inconsistency of 6.85%. The maximum instability of event rate and thermal neutron rate over time are 4.68% and 11.0% respectively. The maximum inconsistency between the clusters without the sand cubes is 18%. The use of sand cubes is effective in protecting the target material from rainwater, and the sand cubes help the cluster to increase collection of neutrons generated by EAS events.</description>

      <title>Impact of angle-dependent recombination on neutrino energy reconstruction in LArTPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The technology of Liquid Argon Time-Projection Chambers (LArTPC) plays a very important role in modern neutrino physics. It allows precise tracking and calorimetry in detectors with very large volume and mass. One important component of LArTPC calorimetric energy reconstruction is the electron-ion recombination effect.
  Existing experiments have provided constraints to its empirical description, including an explicit dependence on the particle's angle with respect to the TPC's electric field.
  In this paper we analyze the impact of angle-dependent recombination models on the reconstruction of neutrino energy in LArTPCs. We examine in detail the predictions of the existing models, showing that there is still considerable uncertainty for the angular dependence prediction at the low values of $dE/dx$ typical of minimum ionizing particles. We apply a simple correction to overcome unphysical predictions in the non-constrained energy loss regions and evaluate the consequences of that in the bias and linearity of electron neutrino energy responses, using generator-level and electron shower simulations for neutrino energies in the range of 0.5-5 GeV. Comparing prediction with and without angular-dependence, we observe an average energy bias between -0.9\% at 0.5 GeV and -0.6\% at 5 GeV. While small, these values are close to the typical requirement of 2\% for the energy scale uncertainty of future experiments, and indicate the need to obtain actual experimental constraints at low $dE/dx$ and take the effect into account in order to achieve the best precision in future LAr TPC electron neutrino calorimetry.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Acoustic Event Monitoring in Single-Mode Fibers Using Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization optical fiber sensors are based on modifications of fiber birefringence by an external measurand (e.g. strain, pressure, acoustic waves). Yet, this means that different input states of polarization will result in very distinct behaviors, which may or may not be optimal in terms of sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. To tackle this challenge, this manuscript presents an optimization technique for the input polarization state using the Fisher information formalism, which allows for achieving maximal precision for a statistically unbiased metric. By first measuring the variation of the Mueller matrix of the optical fiber in response to controlled acoustic perturbations induced by piezo speakers, we compute the corresponding Fisher information operator. Using maximal information states of the Fisher information, it was possible to observe a significant improvement in the performance of the sensor, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio from 4.3 to 37.6 dB, attaining an almost flat response from 1.5 kHz up to 15 kHz. As a proof-of-concept for dynamic audio signal detection, a broadband acoustic signal was also reconstructed with significant gain, demonstrating the usefulness of the introduced formalism for high-precision sensing with polarimetric fiber sensors.</description>

      <title>Simulation of irradiated hybrid planar pixels modules at fluences expected at HL-LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal loss is the main limitation on tracking/vertexing performance due to radiation damage effect to hybrid pixel detectors when irradiated at fluences expected at High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). It is important to have reliable predictions on the charge collection performance after irradiation in order to predict operational voltage values and test tracking algorithms robustness. In this paper the validation of combined TCAD and Monte Carlo simulations of hybrid silicon planar pixels sensors will be presented. In particular different trapping models will be compared to identify the one giving the best predictions. Eventually predictions on the collected charge performance of planar pixels modules at HL-LHC will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Low-Power Optical Actuation of n-GaAs Cantilevers via Surface Piezoelectric Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical behavior of any semiconductor microstructure is inevitably coupled to light. In the case of micro mechanical resonators (MEMs), carrier generation can affect the quality factor of the resonance through electron-phonon scattering and ohmic losses, but it may also inject energy into the structure and induce movement. Thus, semiconductor MEMs may be regarded as intrinsically optomechanical systems. Here, we report on the optical actuation of a simple-clamped n-GaAs cantilever. This is achieved through modulated nanowatt LED illumination at the resonance frequency. We propose that the mechanism responsible for the coupling between light and movement is piezoelectrically induced stress in the surface depletion layer. Motion may be detected using two methods: by measuring the piezoelectric voltage generated due to deformation or the current arising due to the capacitance changes. In the latter case, a bias voltage must be applied to the device, which leads to nonlinear dynamics. Our results indicate that photothermal and electrostatic effects can be ruled out because i) we measure a very small drift of the resonance frequency with the light modulation offset which, together with finite-element simulations, indicates photothermal effects are not responsible for actuation, ii) we observe a phase shift under different bias voltage polarities, which rules out electrostatic actuation and iii), static measurements performed using an optical profilometer confirm the piezoelectric nature of the interaction with light. In summary, we find homogeneous low power LED illumination to be an effective, simple and convenient method of actuation for piezoelectric semiconductor based MEMs.</description>

      <title>Development of a high-rate capable DLC-RPC based on a current evacuation pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05128v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Resistive Plate Chamber using Diamond-Like Carbon electrodes (DLC-RPC) has been developed as a background tagging detector in the MEG$~$II experiment. The DLC-RPC is planned to be installed in a high-intensity and low-momentum muon beam. This detector is required to have a detection efficiency above 90 % with four active gaps in the muon beam due to the limitation of the material budget. In such an environment, the high current flowing through the resistive electrodes causes a voltage drop, which reduces the performance of the DLC-RPC. This voltage drop can be suppressed by implementing a current evacuation pattern, though discharges are more likely to occur near the pattern. Therefore the pattern must be covered by a protection cover made of an insulator. In this study, electrode samples with a current evacuation pattern and different widths of protection cover (0.2 mm and 0.8 mm) have been produced, and their performance and stability were measured. The detection efficiency of a single-gap chamber for $\beta$-rays from a $^{90}$Sr source was measured to be up to approximately 60 % in both electrode samples. The target efficiency can be achieved even with a drop of 100 $-$ 150 V. On the other hand, after more than a dozen hours of operation, discharges suddenly occurred and the detector was prevented from further operation. These discharges created current paths on the spacing pillars. This serious problem must be investigated and solved in the future.</description>

      <title>Performance of Prototypes with Different Reflector Materials for the SHiP Liquid Scintillator Surrounding Background Tagger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The baseline technology for the Surrounding Background Tagger of the recently approved SHiP experiment relies on liquid scintillator composed of linear alkylbenzene and 2,5-diphenyloxazole as active detector material. The primary scintillation photons are collected by Wavelength-shifting Optical Modules, and the secondary photons are guided by total reflection to an array of 40 silicon photomultipliers. Here we present a direct comparison of the performance of three detector prototype cells constructed from different alternative materials known to provide good chemical compatibility with the liquid scintillator: Aluminium and stainless steel. To increase the internal reflectivity, one of the two aluminium prototypes was polished on the inside, while the inner walls of the stainless steel cell were clad with sheets of polytetrafluoroethylene. Using 5 GeV muons from the CERN PS T10 beamline, we studied detected light yield and time resolution attained by the three prototypes. For both the polished AlMg4.5 cell and the PTFE-clad stainless steel prototype, the achieved detected light yield and time resolution meet the requirements of the SHiP Surrounding Background Tagger. Concerning another crucial parameter, the uniformity of the detector response across the detector cell, the polished AlMg4.5 cell shows the best performance among the tested prototypes. These results will significantly affect the final design of the SHiP Surrounding Background Tagger.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing neutrinoless double beta decay event kinematics in a xenon gas detector with vertex tagging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If neutrinoless double beta decay is discovered, the next natural step would be understanding the lepton number violating physics responsible for it. Several alternatives exist beyond the exchange of light neutrinos. Some of these mechanisms can be distinguished by measuring phase-space observables, namely the opening angle $\cos\theta$ among the two decay electrons, and the electron energy spectra, $T_1$ and $T_2$. In this work, we study the statistical accuracy and precision in measuring these kinematic observables in a future xenon gas detector with the added capability to precisely locate the decay vertex. For realistic detector conditions (a gas pressure of 10 bar and spatial resolution of 4 mm), we find that the average $\overline{\cos\theta}$ and $\overline{T_1}$ values can be reconstructed with a precision of 0.19 and 110 keV, respectively, assuming that only 10 neutrinoless double beta decay events are detected.</description>

      <title>Energy Reconstruction of Non-fiducial Electron-Positron Events in the DAMPE Experiment Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a space-based Cosmic-Ray (CR) observatory with the aim, among others, to study Cosmic-Ray Electrons (CREs) up to 10 TeV. Due to the low CRE rate at multi-TeV energies, we aim to increasing the acceptance by selecting events outside the fiducial volume. The complex topology of non-fiducial events requires the development of a novel energy reconstruction method. We propose the usage of Convolutional Neural Networks for a regression task to recover an accurate estimation of the initial energy.</description>
