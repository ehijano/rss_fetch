      <title>MoleculeCLA: Rethinking Molecular Benchmark via Computational Ligand-Target Binding Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular representation learning is pivotal for various molecular property prediction tasks related to drug discovery. Robust and accurate benchmarks are essential for refining and validating current methods. Existing molecular property benchmarks derived from wet experiments, however, face limitations such as data volume constraints, unbalanced label distribution, and noisy labels. To address these issues, we construct a large-scale and precise molecular representation dataset of approximately 140,000 small molecules, meticulously designed to capture an extensive array of chemical, physical, and biological properties, derived through a robust computational ligand-target binding analysis pipeline. We conduct extensive experiments on various deep learning models, demonstrating that our dataset offers significant physicochemical interpretability to guide model development and design. Notably, the dataset's properties are linked to binding affinity metrics, providing additional insights into model performance in drug-target interaction tasks. We believe this dataset will serve as a more accurate and reliable benchmark for molecular representation learning, thereby expediting progress in the field of artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Computing linear optical spectra of molecules in complex environments on Graphics Processing Units using molecular dynamics simulations and tensor-network approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline a computational workflow to model linear optical spectra of molecules in complex environments in the presence of nonadiabatic effects. The approach relies on computing excitation energy and transition dipole fluctuations along molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, treating molecular and environmental degrees of freedom on the same footing. Spectra are then generated following two distinct strategies: In the recently developed Gaussian Non-Condon Theory (GNCT), the linear response functions are computed in terms of independent adiabatic excited states, with non-Condon effects described through spectral densities of transition dipole fluctuations. For strongly coupled excited states, we instead parameterize a linear vibronic coupling (LVC) Hamiltonian directly from spectral densities of energy fluctuations and diabatic couplings computed along the MD trajectory. The optical spectrum is then calculated using powerful numerically exact tensor-network approaches. Both the electronic structure calculations to sample system fluctuations and the quantum dynamics simulations using tensor-network methods are carried out on graphics processing units (GPUs), enabling rapid calculations on complex condensed phase systems. We showcase the strengths of the workflow on a series of two-mode model systems in the presence of a conical intersection (CI), and the pyrazine molecule in different solvent environments.</description>

      <title>Excitation energies from state-specific ensemble density functionals with density-driven correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an effective ensemble density functional approximation, which we call GX24 as it is suitable for both ground (G) and excited state (X) energy prediction. This functional is derived from first principles based on a novel approximation for density-driven correlations. We show that GX24 exploits recent advances in ensemble density functional theory to resolve major paradigmatic failures (double excitations, charge transfer) of standard time-dependent density functional approximations. It thus represents a major step toward accurate modelling of neutral and charged excitations in a unified fashion.</description>

      <title>Observation of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization Echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18246v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is demonstrated that the time evolution of the electron-nuclear polarization transfer process during pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can be reversed on a microsecond timescale, leading to the observation of DNP echoes. The DNP echoes are induced by consecutive application of two pulse trains that produce effective Hamiltonians that differ only in the sign of the effective hyperfine coupling. The experiments have been performed on a frozen solution of trityl radicals in water/glycerol on a home-built X-band EPR/DNP spectrometer at 80 K. We envisage that DNP echoes will play an important role in future development of pulsed DNP for sensitivity-enhanced NMR, hyperfine spectroscopy, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>A Pre-trained Deep Potential Model for Sulfide Solid Electrolytes with Broad Coverage and High Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid electrolytes with fast ion transport are one of the key challenges for solid state lithium metal batteries. To improve ion conductivity, chemical doping has been the most effective strategy, and atomistic simulation with machine-learning potential helps find optimized doping by predicting ion conductivity for arbitrary composition. Yet most existing machine-learning models are trained on narrow chemistry, and new model has to be trained for each system, wasting transferable knowledge and incurring significant cost. Here, we propose a pre-trained deep potential model purpose-built for sulfide electrolytes with attention mechanism, known as DPA-SSE. The training set encompasses 15 elements and consists of both equilibrium and extensive out-of-equilibrium configurations. DPA-SSE achieves a high energy resolution of less than 2 meV/atom for dynamical trajectories up to 1150 K, and reproduces experimental ion conductivity of sulfide electrolytes with remarkable accuracy. DPA-SSE exhibits good transferability, covering a range of complex electrolytes with mixes of cation and anion atoms. Highly efficient dynamical simulation with DPA-SSE can be realized by model distillation which generates a faster model for given systems. DPA-SSE also serves as a platform for continuous learning, and the model fine-tune requires only a portion of downstream data. These results demonstrate the possibility of a new pathway for AI-driven development of solid electrolytes with exceptional performance.</description>

      <title>Refining Potential Energy Surface through Dynamical Properties via Differentiable Molecular Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18269v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, machine learning potentials (MLP) largely enhances the reliability of molecular dynamics, but its accuracy is limited by the underlying $\textit{ab initio}$ methods. A viable approach to overcome this limitation is to refine the potential by learning from experimental data, which now can be done efficiently using modern automatic differentiation technique. However, potential refinement is mostly performed using thermodynamic properties, leaving the most accessible and informative dynamical data (like spectroscopy) unexploited. In this work, through a comprehensive application of adjoint and gradient truncation methods, we show that both memory and gradient explosion issues can be circumvented in many situations, so the dynamical property differentiation is well-behaved. Consequently, both transport coefficients and spectroscopic data can be used to improve the density functional theory based MLP towards higher accuracy. Essentially, this work contributes to the solution of the inverse problem of spectroscopy by extracting microscopic interactions from vibrational spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Cavity-modified electronic interactions in molecular ensembles under vibrational strong coupling: Combined insights from cavity Born-Oppenheimer perturbation theory and ab initio wave function theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between molecular vibrations and quantized field modes of low-frequency optical cavities constitutes the conceptual cornerstone of vibro-polaritonic chemistry. In this work, we theoretically investigate complementary nonresonant interactions between electrons and low-frequency cavity modes with a focus on cavity-induced modifications of electronic interactions in molecular ensembles under VSC. Methodologically, we combine cavity Born-Oppenheimer perturbation theory (CBO-PT) [Fischer, Saalfrank, JCTC 19, 7215 (2023)] with ab initio wave function approaches, specifically, CBO Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theories. In a first step, we derive cavity-induced energy corrections to intra- and intermolecular electronic energies based on second-order CBO-PT. We find local modifications of molecular PES for selected isomerization reactions to be small and dominantly captured by the first-order dipole-fluctuation correction. Excellent agreement between CBO-PT and non-perturbative methods is obtained, which indicates potentially negligible state relaxation effects under VSC. Secondly, we examine cavity-modified intermolecular interactions revealing non-trivial corrections of dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole and van-der-Waals type character emerging at second-order of CBO-PT. Besides an explicit coupling of interacting dimers to cavity modes, we find a cavity-polarization dependent enhanced long-range component of dipole-induced dipole and van-der-Waals interactions. We present an illustrative numerical analysis of interaction potentials for selected molecular dimer models based on the CBO-CCSD approach, which provides a non-perturbative perspective on cavity-modified intermolecular interactions under VSC.</description>

      <title>Energies of atoms are approximately quadratic in nuclear charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantum mechanics based predictions of property trends are so important for materials design and discovery that even inexpensive approximate methods are valuable. We use the Alchemical Integral Transform (AIT) to study multi-electron atoms, and find energy differences between iso-electronic atoms to be approximately quadratic in their nuclear charges, $\Delta E \approx -(1 + 2\gamma \sqrt{N_e-1})\,\Delta Z\, \bar{Z}$. $\gamma \approx 0.3766 \pm 0.0020$ Ha corresponds to a universal constant, and $N_e$, $\Delta Z$, and $\bar{Z}$ respectively to electron number, and nuclear charge difference and average. We compare the formula's predictive accuracy using experimental numbers and numerical results obtained via DFT for the entire periodic table up to Radon. A detailed discussion of the atomic Helium-series is included. Finally, we show the applicability of AIT by predicting trends between electron affinities from ionization energies with linear corrections, resulting in a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.931.</description>

      <title>Particle-Particle Random Phase Approximation for Predicting Correlated Excited States of Point Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle-particle random phase approximation (ppRPA) within the hole-hole channel was recently proposed as an efficient tool for computing excitation energies of point defects in solids [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2024, 15, 2757-2764]. In this work, we investigate the application of ppRPA within the particle-particle channel for predicting correlated excited states of point defects, including the carbon-vacancy (VC) in diamond, the oxygen-vacancy (VO) in magnesium oxide (MgO), and the carbon dimer defect (C$_{\text{B}}$C$_{\text{N}}$) in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Starting from a density functional theory calculation of the ($N-2$)-electron ground state, vertical excitation energies of the $N$-electron system are obtained as the differences between the two-electron addition energies. We show that active-space ppRPA with the B3LYP functional yields accurate excitation energies, with errors mostly smaller than 0.1 eV for tested systems compared to available experimental values. We further develop a natural transition orbital scheme within ppRPA, which provides insights into the multireference character of defect states. This study, together with our previous work, establishes ppRPA as a low-cost and accurate method for investigating excited-state properties of point defect systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in Chemical Systems: Engineering Complexity through Self-Organization and Marangoni Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of a periodic array of hydrophilic cylindrical obstacles on the spatio-temporal dynamics of chemical waves in the bubble-free Belousov-Zhabotinsky-1,4-cyclohexanedione (BZ-CHD) oscillatory chemical reaction. We find that the thin fluid layer ascending the outer surfaces of these hydrophilic obstacles is crucial for influencing wave dynamics. We observe that circular waves begin almost simultaneously at these obstacles and spread outward. In a covered setup where evaporation is minimal, these wavefronts retain their circular shape. However, in an open setup where evaporative cooling is more pronounced, thermal Marangoni flows trigger wavefront instabilities, leading to the formation of distinctive flower-like patterns around the obstacles. Our experiments also shows that the number of petals formed increases linearly with the diameter of the pillars, though a minimum diameter is required for the instabilities to manifest. These results highlight the ability to engineer specific wave patterns, offering a strategy to control and steer the reaction dynamics. This capability is particularly crucial for the development of microfluidic devices that demand precise control over chemical wave propagation.</description>

      <title>MolFusion: Multimodal Fusion Learning for Molecular Representations via Multi-granularity Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence predicts drug properties by encoding drug molecules, aiding in the rapid screening of candidates. Different molecular representations, such as SMILES and molecule graphs, contain complementary information for molecular encoding. Thus exploiting complementary information from different molecular representations is one of the research priorities in molecular encoding. Most existing methods for combining molecular multi-modalities only use molecular-level information, making it hard to encode intra-molecular alignment information between different modalities. To address this issue, we propose a multi-granularity fusion method that is MolFusion. The proposed MolFusion consists of two key components: (1) MolSim, a molecular-level encoding component that achieves molecular-level alignment between different molecular representations. and (2) AtomAlign, an atomic-level encoding component that achieves atomic-level alignment between different molecular representations. Experimental results show that MolFusion effectively utilizes complementary multimodal information, leading to significant improvements in performance across various classification and regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle and fully self-consistent GW methods: an unbiased analysis using Gaussian orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparison of various approximations to self-consistency in the GW method, including the one-shot G0W0 method, different quasiparticle self-consistency schemes, and the fully self-consistent GW (scGW) approach. To ensure an unbiased and equitable comparison, we have implemented all the schemes with the same underlying Matsubara formalism, while employing Gaussian orbitals to describe the system. Aiming to assess and compare different GW schemes, we analyze band gaps in semiconductors and insulators, as well as ionization potentials in molecules. Our findings reveal that for solids, the different self-consistency schemes perform very similarly. However, for molecules, full self-consistency outperforms all other approximations, i.e., the one-shot and quasiparticle self-consistency GW schemes. Our work highlights the importance of implementation details when comparing different GW methods. By employing state-of-the-art fully self-consistent, finite temperature GW calculations, we have successfully addressed discrepancies in the existing literature regarding its performance. Our results also indicate that when stringent thresholds are imposed, the scGW method consistently yields accurate results.</description>

      <title>Charge and Spin Dynamics and Destabilization of Shallow Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers under UV and Blue Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond offer unique opportunities for studying photochemical reactions at the single-molecule level, such as the photogeneration of radical pairs in proximal molecules. A prerequesite for such experimental schemes is the detailed understanding of the charge and spin dynamics of NV centers exposed to the short-wavelength light required for photoexciting chemical species. Here, we measure and analyze the charge and spin dynamics of shallow NV centers under 445 nm (blue) and 375 nm (UV) illumination. With blue excitation, we observe a power-dependent charge-state preparation accompanied by modest preservation of spin initialization fidelity. Under UV excitation, we find a power-independent charge-state preparation and no spin polarization. We further observe an irreversible aging of NV centers under prolonged exposure to UV, and to a lesser extent, blue laser excitation, which we attribute to formation of new electronic trap states. This aging manifests itself in a reduced charge stability and spin contrast, and is detrimental to the NV sensing performance. We evaluate the prospects and limitations of NV centers for probing photogenerated radical pairs based on experimentally measured sensitivities following blue and UV excitation, and outline the design rules for possible sensing schemes.</description>

Abstract: We combined Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) and Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics (RPMD) for calculating the thermal rate constants of the OH + HBr system. We used the active learning (AL) algorithm for constructing a training set during RPMD. We compared the obtained RPMD-AL-MTP rate constants with the ones previously calculated using the quasi-classical trajectories (QCT) and the POTLIB potential energy surface, and with the experimental ones. We demonstrated that the RPMD rate constants were systematically closer to the experimental rate constants than the QCT ones at 200 K, 300 K, and 500 K.</description>

      <title>Benchmark Computations of Nearly Degenerate Singlet and Triplet states of N-heterocyclic Chromophores : I. Wavefunction-based Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the role of electron correlation in predicting the S$_1$-S$_0$ and T$_1$-S$_0$ excitation energies and hence, the singlet-triplet gap ($\Delta$E$_{ST}$) in a set of cyclazines which act as templates for potential candidates for 5th generation Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) materials. This issue has recently garnered much interest with the focus being on the inversion of the $\Delta$E$_{ST}$, although experiments have indicated near degenerate levels with both positive and negative being within the experimental error bar (\emph{J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980, 102: 6068 , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986, 108: 17} ). We have carried out a systematic and exhaustive study of various excited state electronic structure methodologies and identified the strengths and shortcomings of the various approaches and approximations in view of this challenging case. We have found that near degeneracy can be achieved either with a proper balance of static and dynamic correlation in multireference theories or with state-specific orbital corrections including its coupling with correlation. The role of spin contamination is also discussed. Eventually, this paper seeks to produce benchmark numbers for establishing cheaper theories which can then be used for screening derivatives of these templates with desirable optical and structural properties. Additionally we would like to point out that the use of DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD as the benchmark for $\Delta$E$_{ST}$ (as used in \emph{J. Phys. Chem. A 2022, 126: 8: 1378, Chem. Phys. Lett. 2021, 779: 138827}) is not a suitable benchmark for this class of molecules.</description>

Abstract: Electronic coherences are key to understanding and controlling photo-induced molecular transformations. We identify a crucial quantum-mechanical feature of electron-nuclear correlation, the projected nuclear quantum momenta, essential to capture the correct coherence behavior. In simulations, we show that, unlike traditional trajectory-based schemes, exact-factorization-based methods approximate these correlation terms, and correctly capture electronic coherences in a range of situations, including their spatial dependence, an important aspect that influences subsequent electron dynamics and that is becoming accessible in more experiments.</description>

      <title>Catalytic Coagulation</title>

Abstract: We introduce an autocatalytic aggregation model in which the rate at which two clusters merge to form a cluster is controlled by the presence of a third "catalytic" cluster whose mass must equal to the mass of one of the reaction partners. The catalyst is unaffected by the joining event and is available to either participate in or catalyze subsequent reactions. This model is meant to mimic the self-replicating reactions that occur in models for the origin of life. We solve the kinetics of this catalytic coagulation model for the case of mass-independent rates and show that the total cluster density decays as $t^{-1/3}$, while the density of clusters of any fixed mass decays as $t^{-2/3}$. These behaviors contrast with the corresponding $t^{-1}$ and $t^{-2}$ scalings for classic aggregation. We extend our model to mass-dependent reaction rates, to situations where only "magic" mass clusters can catalyze reactions, and to include steady monomer input.</description>
