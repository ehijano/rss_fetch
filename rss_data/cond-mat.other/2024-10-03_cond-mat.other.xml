      <title>Gapless dispersive continuum in a breathing kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of quantum spin liquid (QSL) states in condensed matter physics has drawn attention to kagome antiferromagnets (AFM) where a two-dimensional corner-sharing network of triangles frustrates conventional magnetic orders. While quantum kagome AFMs based on Cu$^{2+}$ (3d$^9$, $s=\frac{1}{2}$) ions have been extensively studied, there is so far little work beyond copper-based systems. Here we present our bulk magnetization, specific heat and neutron scattering studies on single crystals of a new titanium fluoride Cs$_8$RbK$_3$Ti$_{12}$F$_{48}$ where Ti$^{3+}$ (3d$^1$, $s = \frac{1}{2}$) ions form a breathing quantum kagome antiferromagnet that does not order magnetically down to 1.5 K. Our comprehensive map of the dynamic response function $S(Q,\hbar\omega)$ acquired at 1.5 K where the heat capacity is T-linear reveals a dispersive continuum emanating from soft lines that extend along (100). The data indicate fractionalized spinon-like excitations with quasi-one-dimensional dispersion within a quasi-two-dimensional spin system.</description>

      <title>Fast response and highly sensitive flexible humidity sensor based on nanocomposite film of MoS2 and graphene oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene oxide (GO)-based humidity sensors are attracting widespread attention due to their high responsivity and low cost. However, GO-based humidity sensors generally suffer from slow response and recovery as well as poor stability,etc. Here, we reported a flexible resistive humidity sensor based on a MoS2/GO composite film that was fabricated by mixing different volumes of MoS2 and GO dispersions with adjustable volume ratios. The MoS2/GO composite film has been used as a sensing layer on screen-printed interdigital electrodes. The results show that the best device performance was achieved at a dispersion volume of 0.05 mL with the MoS2/GO volume ratio of 5:1, featuring high responsivity (~98%), fast response/recovery time (1.3/12.1 s), excellent stability and low cost. Further, the humidity sensor exhibits good linearity over a wide humidity range (33% RH-98% RH) at room temperature and can be fabricated easily and feasibly. The application of the humidity sensors we prepared in human respiration detection and human fingertip proximity detection has been demonstrated. These findings indicate the great potential of the composite of MoS2/GO in developing the next generation of high-performance humidity sensors.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Graphene-Based Humidity Sensors with the Focus of Structural Design: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of the 5G era means that the concepts of robot, VR/AR, UAV, smart home, smart healthcare based on IoT (Internet of Things) have gradually entered human life. Since then, intelligent life has become the dominant direction of social development. Humidity sensors, as humidity detection tools, not only convey the comfort of human living environment, but also display great significance in the fields of meteorology, medicine, agriculture and industry. Graphene-based materials exhibit tremendous potential in humidity sensing owing to their ultra-high specific surface area and excellent electron mobility under room temperature for application in humidity sensing. This review begins with the introduction of examples of various synthesis strategies of graphene, followed by the device structure and working mechanism of graphene-based humidity sensor. In addition, several different structural design methods of graphene are summarized, demonstrating the structural design of graphene can not only optimize the performance of graphene, but also bring significant advantages in humidity sensing. Finally, key challenges hindering the further development and practical application of high-performance graphene-based humidity sensors are discussed, followed by presenting the future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Graphene-Based Pressure Sensors: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, pressure sensors have been widely used as crucial technology components in industrial, healthcare, consumer electronics, and automotive safety applications. With the development of intelligent technologies, there is a growing demand for pressure sensors with higher sensitivity, smaller size, and wider detection range. Graphene and its derivatives, as novel emerging materials in recent years, have received widespread attention from researchers due to their unique mechanical and electrical properties, and are considered as promising sensing materials for the high-performance pressure sensors. In general, graphene-based pressure sensors can be classified into flexible pressure sensors and gas pressure sensors. In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic properties of graphene and its derivatives and then review the research progress of both graphene-based flexible pressure sensors and graphene-based gas pressure sensors respectively, focusing on different sensing mechanisms. Finally, the application prospects of graphene-based pressure sensors as well as future challenges are discussed.</description>

      <title>Fighting Exponentially Small Gaps by Counterdiabatic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through a first-order quantum phase transition. Specifically, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging, necessitating high-order nonlocal terms in the expansion. Our results demonstrate that local CD strategies have limited effectiveness when crossing the extremely small gaps characteristic of NP-hard Ising problems. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which significantly increases the fidelity to the target state over the expansion method by directly addressing the gap-closing point and the associated edge states.</description>

      <title>Chaitin Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of Hamiltonians whose phase diagram is guaranteed to have a single phase transition, yet the location of this phase transition is uncomputable. The Hamiltonians $H(\phi)$ describe qudits on a two-dimensional square lattice with translationally invariant, nearest-neighbour interactions tuned by a continuous parameter $\phi\in(0,1]$. For all $\phi\in(0,1]$, $H(\phi)$ is in one of two phases, one a gapless phase, the other a gapped phase. The phase transition occurs when $\phi$ equals the Chaitin's constant $\Omega$, a well-defined real number that encodes the Halting problem, and hence is uncomputable for Turing machines and undecidable for any consistent recursive axiomatization of mathematics. Our result implies that no general algorithm exists to determine the phase diagrams even under the promise that the phase diagram is exceedingly simple, and illustrates how uncomputable numbers may manifest in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized transport in quadruple quantum dots attached to ferromagnetic leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental evidence of the Nagaoka ferromagnetism in quantum dot systems by Dehollain et al [1], we search for possible confirmation of such kind of ferromagnetism by analyzing the spin-resolved transport properties of a quadruple quantum dot system focusing on the linear response regime. In particular, we consider four quantum dots arranged in a two-by-two square lattice, coupled to external ferromagnetic source and drain electrodes. Turning on and off the specific conditions for the Nagaoka ferromagnetism to occur by changing the value of the intra-dot Coulomb interactions, we determine the transport coefficients, including the linear conductance, tunnel magnetoresistance and current spin polarization. We show that a sign change of the current spin polarization may be an indication of a ferromagnetic order of Nagaoka type which develops in the system.</description>
