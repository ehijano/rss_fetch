      <title>Tuning the structure and superconductivity of SrNi$_2$P$_2$ by Rh substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SrNi$_2$P$_2$ is unique among the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ class since it exhibits a temperature induced transition upon cooling from an uncollapsed tetragonal (ucT) state to a one-third-collapsed orthorhombic (tcO) state where one out of every three P-rows bond across the Sr layers. This compound is also known for exhibiting bulk superconductivity below 1.4 K at ambient pressure. In this work, we report on the effects of Rh substitution in Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$)$_2$P$_2$ on the structural and superconducting properties. We studied the variation of the nearest P-P distances as a function of the Rh fraction at room temperature, as well as its temperature dependence for selected compositions. We find that increasing the Rh fraction leads to a decrease in the transition temperature between the ucT and tcO states, until a full suppression of the tcO state for $x\geq 0.166$. The superconducting transition first remains nearly insensitive to the Rh fraction, and then it increases to 2.3 K after the tcO state is fully suppressed. These results are summarized in a phase diagram, built upon the characterization by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, resistance, magnetization and specific heat measurements done on crystalline samples with varying Rh content. The relationship between band structure, crystal structure and superconductivity is discussed based on previously reported band structure calculations on SrRh$_2$P$_2$. Moreover, the effect of Rh fraction on the stress-induced structural transitions is also addressed by means of strain-stress studies done by uniaxial compression of single-crystalline micropillars of Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$)$_2$P$_2$.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Model for Predicting and Designing High-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for ambient-pressure conventional superconductors with critical temperatures ($T_C$) higher than 40 K and implementable synthesis routes is a key challenge in the field of high-temperature superconductivity, mainly due to lack of efficient and effective models to estimate $T_C$ of potential systems. In this work, we propose a simplified model to estimate the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling (EPC) strength \lambbda and thus $T_C$ by separately treating the EPC matrix elements which evaluate the pairing strength and the phonon-assisted nesting function P(w) which evaluates the matching of electron bands and phonon spectra for forming potential electron pairs via phonons. By applying the model to screen over the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), we successfully identify several systems with TC exceeding 20 K as confirmed by accurate first-principles calculations. Especially, Ti$_3$N$_2$H$_2$ has a record high $T_C$ value among known MXenes, which is 52 K (78 K) according to isotropic (anisotropic) Migdal-Eliashberg equations under ambient pressure. More importantly, we propose a feasible synthesis route for Ti$_3$N$_2$H$_2$ starting from the experimentally synthesized MXene Ti$_4$N$_3$. Beyond demonstrating its feasibility and efficiency in identifying high-$T_C$ superconductors, our model illuminates the critical roles of the matching between electron band and phonon spectra as a necessary condition in determining $T_C$ and points out the directions for prediction and design of high-$T_C$ superconductors, which is exemplified by showing a novel designed system Ti$_3$N$_2$H$_2$ with a possible $T_C$ of 80 K under ambient pressure. Our model opens new avenues for exploring high-$T_C$ systems.</description>

      <title>Appearance of $c$-axis magnetic moment in odd-parity antiferromagnetic state in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ revealed by $^{75}$As-NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeRh$_2$As$_2$ shows the superconducting (SC) multiphase under the $c$-axis magnetic field, which is considered to originate from local inversion symmetry breaking at the Ce site. We reported that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is inside the SC phase and that the AFM state disappears at the transition field to the high-field SC phase. However, the magnetic structure in the AFM state has not been clarified yet. In this study, we performed $^{75}$As-NMR measurements in the SC phase in $H\parallel [110]$ to identify the magnetic structure. Comparing the NMR linewidth with $H \parallel c$, we found that the internal magnetic field is oriented to the $c$ axis. This suggests a $q = 0$ $A$-type AFM with the moments parallel to the $c$ axis. We also observed the reduction of the spin susceptibility, which indicates spin-singlet superconductivity in the low-field SC phase. This study provides an important clue to clarify the correlation between the SC multiphase, magnetism, and local inversion symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport theory for unconventional magnets; interplay of altermagnetism and p-wave magnetism with superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum transport theory for generic magnetic metals, in which magnetism occurs predominantly due to exchange interactions, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Our theory is valid both for the normal and the superconducting state. We derive the effective low-energy action for each of these materials, where the spin space groups are used to determine the form of the tensor coefficients appearing in the action. The transport equations, which are obtained as the saddle point equations of this action, describe a wider range of phenomena than the usual quasiclassical equations. In ferromagnets, in addition to the usual exchange field and spin relaxation effects, we identify a spin-dependent renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which provides a description of spinpolarized currents in both the normal and superconducting equal spin-triplet states. In the normal state, our equations provide a complete description of the spin-splitting effect in diffusive systems, recently predicted in ideal clean altermagnets. In the superconducting state, our equations predict a proximity induced magnetization, the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment in hybrid superconductor-altermagnet systems. The distribution and polarization direction of this magnetic moment depend on the symmetry of the structure, thus measurements of such polarization reveal the underlying microscopic symmetry of the altermagnet. Finally, for inversionsymmetry broken antiferromagnets, such as the p-wave magnet, we show that spin-galvanic effects which are distinguishable from the spin-galvanic effect induced by spin-orbit coupling only in the superconducting state. Besides these examples, our model applies to arbitrary magnetic systems, providing a complete theory for nonequilibrium transport in diffusive nonconventional magnets at arbitrary temperatures.</description>

      <title>Seeking the Casimir Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its first description in 1948, the Casimir effect has been studied extensively. Standard arguments for its existence hinge on the elimination of certain modes of the electromagnetic field because of the boundary conditions in the Casimir cavity. As such, it has been suggested that the ground state energy of the vacuum within the cavity may be reduced compared to the value outside. Could this have an effect on physical phenomena within the cavity? We study this Casimir energy and probe whether the critical temperature $T_c$ of a superconductor is altered when it is placed in the cavity. We do not detect any change in $T_c$ larger than 12 microKelvin, but theoretically expect a change on the order of 0.025 microKelvin, roughly 1000 times lower than our achieved sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Tunable Josephson voltage source for quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noisy voltage sources can be a limiting factor for fundamental physics experiments as well as for device applications in quantum information, mesoscopic circuits, magnetometry, and other fields. The best commercial DC voltage sources can be programmed to approximately six digits and have intrinsic noise in the microvolt range. On the other hand the noise level in metrological Josephson-junction based voltage standards is sub-femtovolt. Although such voltage standards can be considered "noiseless," they are generally not designed for continuous tuning of the output voltage nor for supplying current to a load at cryogenic temperatures. We propose a Josephson effect based voltage source, as opposed to a voltage standard, operating in the 30-160 uV range which can supply over 100 nA of current to loads at milli-Kelvin temperatures. We describe the operating principle, the sample design, and the calibration procedure to obtain continuous tunability. We show current-voltage characteristics of the device, demonstrate how the voltage can be adjusted without DC control connections to room-temperature electronics, and showcase an experiment coupling the source to a mesoscopic load, a small Josephson junction. Finally we characterize the performance of our source by measuring the voltage noise at the load, 50 pV RMS, which is attributed to parasitic resistances in the cabling. This work establishes the use of the Josephson effect for voltage biasing extremely sensitive quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Pair-breaking scattering interference as a mechanism for superconducting gap modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the ``pair-breaking scattering interference" as a general source of coherence peak modulations in superconductors. Assuming this mechanism, we present a simple physical picture for the coherence peak modulations in overdoped cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi-2223), ferromagnetic iron pnictide EuRbFe$_4$As$_4$ (Eu-1144), and kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, and Cs). Specifically, we explain the wavevectors, the particle-hole symmetry, and the dependence on the internal or external Zeeman-field of the coherence peak modulations. This work is intended as a cautious reminder to the scientific community when asserting the existence of a pair density wave phenomenon in the absence of tunneling conductance modulations in the normal state.</description>

      <title>Exact eigenstates of multicomponent Hubbard models: SU($N$) magnetic $\eta$ pairing, weak ergodicity breaking, and partial integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct exact eigenstates of multicomponent Hubbard models in arbitrary dimensions by generalizing the $\eta$-pairing mechanism. Our models include the SU($N$) Hubbard model as a special case. Unlike the conventional two-component case, the generalized $\eta$-pairing mechanism permits the construction of eigenstates that feature off-diagonal long-range order and magnetic long-range order. These states form fragmented fermionic condensates due to a simultaneous condensation of multicomponent $\eta$ pairs. While the $\eta$-pairing states in the SU(2) Hubbard model are based on the $\eta$-pairing symmetry, the exact eigenstates in the $N$-component system with $N\geq 3$ arise not from symmetry of the Hamiltonian but from a spectrum generating algebra defined in a Hilbert subspace. We exploit this fact to show that the generalized $\eta$-pairing eigenstates do not satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and serve as quantum many-body scar states. This result indicates a weak breakdown of ergodicity in the $N$-component Hubbard models for $N\geq 3$. Furthermore, we show that these exact eigenstates constitute integrable subsectors in which the Hubbard Hamiltonian effectively reduces to a non-interacting model. This partial integrability causes various multicomponent Hubbard models to weakly break ergodicity. We propose a method of harnessing dissipation to distill the integrable part of the dynamics and elucidate a mechanism of non-thermalization caused by dissipation. This work establishes the coexistence of off-diagonal long-range order and SU($N$) magnetism in excited eigenstates of the multicomponent Hubbard models, which presents a possibility of novel out-of-equilibrium pairing states of multicomponent fermions. These models unveil a unique feature of quantum thermalization of multicomponent fermions, which can experimentally be tested with cold-atom quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>The statistics and sensitivity of axion wind detection with the homogeneous precession domain of superfluid helium-3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The homogeneous precession domain (HPD) of superfluid $^{3}$He has recently been identified as a detection medium which might provide sensitivity to the axion-nucleon coupling $g_{aNN}$ competitive with, or surpassing, existing experimental proposals. In this work, we make a detailed study of the statistical and dynamical properties of the HPD system in order to make realistic projections for a full-fledged experimental program. We include the effects of clock error and measurement error in a concrete readout scheme using superconducting qubits and quantum metrology. This work also provides a more general framework to describe the statistics associated with the axion gradient coupling through the treatment of a transient resonance with a non-stationary background in a time-series analysis. Incorporating an optimal data-taking and analysis strategy, we project a sensitivity approaching $g_{aNN} \sim 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ across a decade in axion mass.</description>

      <title>Kinetic inductance traveling wave amplifier designs for practical microwave readout applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave amplifier (KIT) utilizes the nonlinear kinetic inductance of superconducting films, particularly Niobium Titanium Nitride (NbTiN), for parametric amplification. These amplifiers achieve remarkable performance in terms of gain, bandwidth, compression power, and frequently approach the quantum limit for noise. However, most KIT demonstrations have been isolated from practical device readout systems. Using a KIT as the first amplifier in the readout chain of an unoptimized microwave SQUID multiplexer coupled to a transition-edge sensor microcalorimeter we see an initial improvement in the flux noise. One challenge in KIT integration is the considerable microwave pump power required to drive the non-linearity. To address this, we have initiated efforts to reduce the pump power by using thinner NbTiN films and an inverted microstrip transmission line design. In this article, we present the new transmission line design, fabrication procedure, and initial device characterization -- including gain and added noise. These devices exhibit over 10 dB of gain with a 3 dB bandwidth of approximately 5.5-7.25 GHz, a maximum practical gain of 12 dB and typical gain ripple under 4 dB peak-to-peak. We observe an appreciable impedance mismatch in the NbTiN transmission line, which is likely the source of the majority of the gain ripple. Finally we perform an initial noise characterization and demonstrate system-added noise of three quanta or less over nearly the entire 3 dB bandwidth.</description>
