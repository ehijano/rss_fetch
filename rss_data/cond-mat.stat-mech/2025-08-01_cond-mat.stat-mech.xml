      <title>Quantum typicality approach to energy flow between two spin-chain domains at different temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a quantum typicality approach to examine systems composed of two subsystems at different temperatures. While dynamical quantum typicality is usually used to simulate high-temperature dynamics, we also investigate low-temperature dynamics using the method. To test our method, we investigate the energy current between subsystems at different temperatures in various paradigmatic spin-1/2 chains, specifically the XX chain, the critical transverse-field Ising chain, and the XXZ chain. We compare our numerics to existing analytical results and find a convincing agreement for the energy current in the steady state for all considered models and temperatures.</description>

      <title>Emergence of long-range non-equilibrium correlations in free liquid diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is experimentally well-established that non-equilibrium long-range correlations of concentration fluctuations appear in free diffusion of a solute in a solvent, but it remains unknown how such correlations are established dynamically. We address this problem in a model of Donev, Fai \&amp; Vanden-Eijnden (DFV), obtained from the high-Schmidt limit of the Landau-Lifschitz fluctuating hydrodynamic equations for a binary mixture. We consider an initial planar interface of the mean concentration field in an infinite space domain, idealizing prior experiments. Using methods borrowed from turbulence theory, we show both analytically and numerically that a quasi-steady regime with self-similar time decay of concentration correlations appears at long time. In addition to the expected ``giant concentration fluctuations'' with correlations $\propto r$ for $r\lesssim L(t)=(Dt)^{1/2},$ with diffusivity $D,$ a new regime with spatial decay $\propto 1/r$ appears for $r\gtrsim L(t).$ The quasi-steady regime arises from an initial stage of transient growth $\propto t,$ confirming the prediction of DFV for $r\gtrsim L(t)$ and discovering an analogous result for $r\lesssim L(t).$ Our results give new insight into the emergence of non-equilibrium long-range correlations and provide novel predictions that may be investigated experimentally.</description>

      <title>How to Incorporate Higher-order Interactions in Analog Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines (IMs) are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems. Among such problems, Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) is particularly relevant in industrial applications. To solve SAT problems using IMs, it is crucial to incorporate higher-order interactions. However, in analog IMs, interactions of different orders scale unevenly with the continuous spin amplitudes, introducing imbalances that can significantly degrade performance. We present a numerical comparison of methods to mitigate these imbalances, evaluating time-to-solution and success rate on Uniform Random 3-SAT instances from the SATLIB benchmark set. Our results show that the most effective approach employs spin interactions that are proportional to the signs of spins, rather than their continuous amplitudes. This generalizes our previous work, which showed that such interactions best mitigate imbalances induced by external fields in quadratic analog IMs. In this work, its advantage becomes substantially more pronounced, as it naturally mitigates imbalances across all interaction orders. We further demonstrate that smooth approximations of this method make it compatible with analog hardware. Our findings underscore the central role of spin-sign-based interactions in enabling robust and scalable analog IM dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polaron Mediated Superconductivity in Doped Chern Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of interacting topological bands with a tunable bandwidth offers a unique platform to study the interplay of intertwined orders and emergent non-electronic excitations. Here we design a time-reversal symmetric and sign-problem-free electronic model with tunable Chern bands carrying valley-contrasting Chern number, interacting via competing (anti-)ferromagnetic interactions. Using numerically exact quantum Monte-Carlo computations, we analyze the many-body phase-diagram as a function of temperature and band filling fractions over a wide range of electronic bandwidth, interaction anisotropy, and an Ising spin-orbit coupling. At a commensurate filling of the Chern bands, the ground state hosts intra-valley ferromagnetic coherence and inter-valley antiferomagnetism, thus realizing an insulating Chern antiferromagnet (CAF). Upon doping, the ground-state develops superconductivity, but where the low-energy charged quasiparticles are composite objects -- electrons dressed by multiple spin-flip excitations. These spin-polaron (or skyrmion) excitations persist in the presence of a weak spin-orbit coupling. In a companion article, we address the emergent symmetries and low-energy field-theoretic aspects of the problem and reveal the proximity to a deconfined quantum critical point. We end by providing a general outlook towards building microscopic connections with models of interacting moir\'e materials, including twisted bilayer graphene, where many of the ingredients considered here are naturally present.</description>

      <title>Dynamical freezing and enhanced magnetometry in an interacting spin ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems is a fundamental challenge in modern physics, with profound implications for advancing quantum technologies. Typically, periodically driven systems in the absence of conservation laws thermalize to a featureless "infinite-temperature" state, erasing all memory of their initial conditions. However, this paradigm can break down through mechanisms such as integrability, many-body localization, quantum many-body scars, and Hilbert space fragmentation. Here, we report the experimental observation of dynamical freezing, a distinct mechanism of thermalization breakdown in driven systems, and demonstrate its application in quantum sensing using an ensemble of approximately $10^4$ interacting nitrogen-vacancy spins in diamond. By precisely controlling the driving frequency and detuning, we observe emergent long-lived spin magnetization and coherent oscillatory micromotions, persisting over timescales exceeding the interaction-limited coherence time ($T_2$) by more than an order of magnitude. Leveraging these unconventional dynamics, we develop a dynamical-freezing-enhanced ac magnetometry that extends optimal sensing times far beyond $T_2$, outperforming conventional dynamical decoupling magnetometry with a 4.3 dB sensitivity enhancement. Our results not only provide clear experimental observation of dynamical freezing -- a peculiar mechanism defying thermalization through emergent conservation laws -- but also establish a robust control method generally applicable to diverse physical platforms, with broad implications in quantum metrology and beyond.</description>

      <title>Field digitization scaling in a $\mathbb{Z}_N \subset U(1)$ symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum field theories, both classical and quantum, requires regularization of infinitely many degrees of freedom. However, in the context of field digitization (FD) -- a truncation of the local fields to $N$ discrete values -- a comprehensive framework to obtain continuum results is currently missing. Here, we propose to analyze FD by interpreting the parameter $N$ as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense. As a first example, we investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field theory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the FD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different $N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\textit{field digitization scaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond dimension $\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover around a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating that FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\chi$ and $N$. Finally, we analytically prove that our calculations for the 2D classical-statistical $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model are directly related to the quantum physics in the ground state of a (2+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory which serves as a FD of compact quantum electrodynamics. Our study thus paves the way for applications of FDS to quantum simulations of more complex models in higher spatial dimensions, where it could serve as a tool to analyze the continuum limit of digitized quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>From confinement to chaos in AdS/CFT correspondence via non-equilibrium local states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study excited states in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space prepared by local operator insertions of a massive scalar field, corresponding to operator quenches for free fields in AdS. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the time evolution of boundary observables in the dual states. We then introduce a hard wall in AdS Poincare coordinates to impose an infrared cutoff, creating a confining deformation of the dual conformal field theory, and analyze the dynamics of excited states in this confining background. By comparing the evolution of boundary two-point correlation functions in the deformed theory to the statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles, we show that for sufficiently heavy operators the fluctuations approach quite close those of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). Finally, we extend our analysis to the compact BTZ black hole and its hard wall deformation, finding qualitatively similar behavior.</description>

      <title>Exploring Many-Body Quantum Geometry Beyond the Quantum Metric with Correlation Functions: A Time-Dependent Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor and quantum Fisher information have recently been shown to provide a unified geometric description of the linear response of many-body systems. However, a similar geometric description of higher-order perturbative phenomena including nonlinear response in generic quantum systems is lacking. In this work, we develop a general framework for the time-dependent quantum geometry of many-body systems by treating external perturbing fields as coordinates on the space of density matrices. We use the Bures distance between the initial and time-evolved density matrix to define geometric quantities through a perturbative expansion. To lowest order, we derive a time-dependent generalization of the Bures metric related to the spectral density of linear response functions, unifying previous results for the quantum metric in various limits and providing a geometric interpretation of Fermi's golden rule. At next order in the expansion, we define a time-dependent Bures-Levi-Civita connection for general many-body systems. We show that the connection is the sum of one contribution that is related to a second-order nonlinear response function, and a second contribution that captures the higher geometric structure of first-order perturbation theory. We show that in the quasistatic, zero-temperature limit for noninteracting fermions, this Bures connection reduces to the known expression for band-theoretic Christoffel symbols. Our work provides a systematic framework to explore many-body quantum geometry beyond the quantum metric and highlights how higher-order correlation functions can probe this geometry.</description>

      <title>A Perturbative Approach to Symmetric Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau paradigm has been a powerful framework for understanding phase transitions involving spontaneous symmetry breaking. In contrast, phase transitions between two symmetric phases, where neither phase breaks any symmetry, remain less explored. One intriguing class of such transitions involves "symmetric mass generation" (SMG), where interactions drive a transition from a gapless symmetric phase to a gapped symmetric phase. In this work, we develop a controlled perturbative approach to study a class of such transitions, based on an $\epsilon$-expansion around the critical dimension where the SMG-inducing-interaction becomes marginal. Applying this method to two distinct models, we identify a single-parameter-tuned transition in each case, which we conjecture captures the universal critical behavior of the SMG transition in these models. We compute universal quantities associated with these transitions.</description>

Abstract: Proximity measurements probe whether pairs of particles are close to one another. We consider the impact of post-selected random proximity measurements on a quantum fluid of many distinguishable particles. We show that such measurements induce random spatial localization of a fraction of the particles, and yet preserve homogeneity macroscopically. Eventually, all particles localize, with a distribution of localization lengths that saturates at a scale controlled by the typical measurement rate. The steady-state distribution of these lengths is governed by a familiar scaling form.</description>

      <title>Reformulating Chemical Equilibrium in Reacting Quantum Gas Mixtures: Particle Number Conservation, Correlations and Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical-ensemble description of reactive quantum gas mixtures is reformulated by incorporating a single global particle-number-conservation constraint over the combined spectra of inter-converting species. This constraint replaces the conventional equality of chemical potentials. Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein correlations naturally emerge across one-particle energy eigenstates of species sharing identical spin-statistics, which in ergodic single-systems manifest as intrinsic features of the equilibrium state. By embedding all microstates linked by conversion pathways, the framework incorporates concentration fluctuations in the statistical description. The formalism offers fresh insights into quantum chemical equilibrium in reactive mixtures with composition fluctuations and smoothly reduces to the classical ideal gas limit via an extended partition function that generalizes classical chemical-equilibrium treatments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional Mpemba effect refers to an anomalous cooling phenomenon when an initial hotter system cools down faster than an initial warm system. Such counterintuitive behavior has been confirmed and explored across phase transitions in condensed matter systems and also for colloidal particles exposed to a double-well potential. Here we predict a frictional Mpemba effect for a macroscopic body moving actively on a surface governed by Coulomb (dry) friction. For an initial high temperature, relaxation towards a cold state occurs much faster than that for an intermediate initial temperature, due to a large temperature overshooting in the latter case. This frictional Mpemba effect can be exploited to steer the motion of robots and granules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously analyze the non-equilibrium thermodynamic behavior of various formulations of quantum Brownian motion (QBM) using the framework of stochastic thermodynamics. While the widely used Caldeira-Leggett master equation exhibits desirable thermodynamic features, such as the fulfilment of a detailed balance, it fails to ensure complete positivity. In contrast, several completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) extensions turn out to be thermodynamically controversial. We show that such extensions introduce anomalous phase-space structures that violate detailed balance at the steady state, leading to non-vanishing entropy production and effective non-equilibrium current of unclear physical origins. Our results highlight a fundamental tension between quantum consistency and thermodynamic equilibration in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Fuss--Catalan algebras on generalized Dyck paths via non-crossing partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Fuss--Catalan algebras, which are generalizations of the Temperley--Lieb algebra and act on generalized Dyck paths, through non-crossing partitions. First, the Temperley--Lieb algebra is defined on non-crossing partitions, and a bijection between a Dyck path and a non-crossing partition is shown to be compatible with the Temperley--Lieb algebra on Dyck paths, or equivalently chord diagrams. We show that the Kreweras endomorphism on non-crossing partitions is equivalent to the rotation of chord diagrams under the bijection. Secondly, by considering an increasing $r$-chain in the graded lattice of non-crossing partitions, we define the Fuss--Catalan algebras on increasing $r$-chains. Through a bijection between an increasing $r$-chain and a generalized Dyck path, one naturally obtains the Fuss--Catalan algebra on generalized Dyck paths. As generalizations of the Fuss--Catalan algebra, we introduce the one- and two-boundary Fuss--Catalan algebras. Increasing $r$-chains of symmetric non-crossing partitions give symmetric generalized Dyck paths by the bijection, and the boundary Fuss--Catalan algebras naturally act on them. We show that these representations are compatible with the diagrammatic representations of the algebras by use of generalized chord diagrams. Thirdly, we discuss the integrability of the Fuss--Catalan algebras. For the Fuss--Catalan algebras with boundaries, we obtain a new solution of the reflection equation in the case of $r=2$.</description>

      <title>Run-and-Tumble Particles Learning Chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through evolution, bacteria have developed the ability to perform chemotactic motion in order to find nourishment. By adopting a machine learning approach, we aim to understand how this behavior arises. We consider run-and-tumble agents able to tune the instantaneous probability of switching between the run and the tumble phase. When such agents are navigating in an environment characterized by a concentration field pointing towards a circular target, we investigate how a chemotactic strategy may be learned starting from unbiased run-and-tumble dynamics. We compare the learning performances of agents that sense only the instantaneous concentration with those of agents having a short-term memory that allows them to perform temporal comparisons. While both types of learning agents develop successful target-search policies, we demonstrate that those achieved by agents endowed with temporal comparison abilities are significantly more efficient, particularly when the initial distance from the target is large. Finally, we also show that when an additional length scale is imposed, for example by fixing the initial distance to the target, the learning agents can leverage this information to further improve their efficiency in locating the target.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Physics perspective on fairness in shared expenses: The bar bill analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In social contexts where individuals consume varying amounts, such as shared meals or bar gatherings, splitting the total bill equally often yields surprisingly fair outcomes. In this work, we develop a statistical physics framework to explain this emergent fairness by modeling individual consumption as stochastic variables drawn from a realistic distribution, specifically the gamma distribution. Introducing a Boltzmann-like weighting factor, we derive exact analytical expressions for the partition function, average consumption, variance, and entropy under economic or social penalization constraints. Numerical simulations, performed using the Marsaglia-Tsang algorithm, confirm the analytical results with high precision. Drawing a direct parallel between individual consumption and ideal gas particle energy in the canonical ensemble, we show how the law of large numbers, mutual compensation, and the effective ordering induced by penalization combine to make equal cost-sharing statistically robust and predictable. These findings reveal that what appears to be an informal social convention is, in fact, grounded in the same fundamental principles that govern the collective behavior of particles in thermodynamic systems, highlighting the interdisciplinary power of statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Optimised Feature Subset Selection via Simulated Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio, which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability, and performance are crucial.</description>

      <title>Cohesion mediated layering in sheared grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider pattern formation in a sheared dense mixture of cohesive and non-cohesive grains. Our findings show that cohesive grains, which would typically form distributed agglomerates, instead segregate into percolating stripes or layers when the cohesive grain concentration ($c_o$) and cohesion strength ($C$) increase -- in a way that the average agglomerate size and the average normal stress collapse onto a single curve when plotted against $c_oC$. Our central proposal is that the development of interfaces between cohesive and non-cohesive grains is akin to phase separation in binary molecular mixtures driven by an effective free energy, although we are dealing with a non-equilibrium system; we setup the segregation flux such that the effect of this free energy is activated only upon application of the external driving. By constructing the segregation flux proportional to the gradient of the variational derivative of the free energy, we closely reproduce the layering in the steady-state limit. We find a robust correspondence between the parameter $c_o C$ in the discrete simulations and the parameters in the free energy.</description>

      <title>Universal tradeoff relations between resource cost and irreversibility of channels: General-resource Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorems and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies offer exceptional -- sometimes almost magical -- speed and performance, yet every quantum process costs physical resources. Designing next-generation quantum devices, therefore, depends on solving the following question: which resources, and in what amount, are required to implement a desired quantum process? Casting the problem in the language of quantum resource theories, we prove a universal cost-irreversibility tradeoff: the lower the irreversibility of a quantum process, the greater the required resource cost for its realization. The trade-off law holds for a broad range of resources -- energy, magic, asymmetry, coherence, athermality, and others -- yielding lower bounds on resource cost of any quantum channel. Its broad scope positions this result as a foundation for deriving the following key results: (1) we show a universal relation between the energetic cost and the irreversibility for arbitrary channels, encompassing the energy-error tradeoff for any measurement or unitary gate; (2) we extend the energy-error tradeoff to free energy and work costs; (3) we extend the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem, which is the universal limitation on measurements under conservation laws, to a wide class of resource theories: the probability of failure in distinguishing resourceful states via a measurement is inversely proportional to its resource cost; (4) we prove that infinitely many resource-non-increasing operations in fact require an infinite implementation cost. These findings reveal a universal relationship between quantumness and irreversibility, providing a first step toward a general theory that explains when -- and how -- quantumness can suppress irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Heralding and Optimal Decoders for Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological order (TO) provides a natural platform for storing and manipulating quantum information. However, its stability to noise has only been systematically understood for Abelian TOs. In this work, we exploit the non-deterministic fusion of non-Abelian anyons to inform active error correction and design decoders where the fusion products, instead of flag qubits, herald the noise. This intrinsic heralding enhances thresholds over those of Abelian counterparts when noise is dominated by a single non-Abelian anyon type. Furthermore, we present an approach for determining the optimal threshold for non-Abelian TOs with perfect anyon syndromes for any noise model, formulated as a statistical mechanics model using Bayesian inference. We numerically illustrate these results for $D_4 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \rtimes \mathbb Z_2$ TO. In particular, for non-Abelian charge noise and perfect syndrome measurement, we find an optimal threshold $p_c=0.218(1)$, whereas an intrinsically heralded minimal-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoder already gives $p_c=0.20842(2)$, outperforming standard MWPM with $p_c = 0.15860(1)$. Our work highlights how non-Abelian properties can enhance stability, rather than reduce it, and discusses potential generalizations for achieving fault tolerance.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Disordered Projected Branes: Stability and Quantum Criticality via Dimensional Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of disorder and dimensionality governs the emergence and stability of electronic phases in quantum materials and quantum phase transitions among them. While three-dimensional (3D) dirty Fermi liquids and Weyl semimetals support robust metallic states, undergoing disorder-driven Anderson localization transitions at strong disorder and the later ones exhibiting additional semimetal-to-metal transition at moderate disorder, conventional two-dimensional (2D) non-interacting systems localize for arbitrarily weak disorder. Here, we show that 2D disordered projected branes, constructed by systematically integrating out degrees of freedom from a 3D cubic lattice via the Schur decomposition, faithfully reproduce the full quantum phase diagram of their 3D parent systems. Using large-scale exact diagonalization and kernel polynomial method, we numerically demonstrate that 2D projected branes host stable metallic and semimetallic phases. Remarkably, the critical exponents governing the semimetal-to-metal and metal-insulator transitions on such 2D projected branes are sufficiently close to those of their 3D counterparts. Our findings thus establish 2D projected branes as genuine quantum holographic images of their higher-dimensional disordered parent crystals, supporting stable semimetallic and metallic phases that are otherwise inaccessible in conventional 2D lattices. Finally, we point to experimentally accessible metamaterial platforms, most notably the photonic lattices with tunable refractive-index disorder, as promising systems to realize and probe these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Fast Sampling of Protein Conformational Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein function does not solely depend on structure but often relies on dynamical transitions between distinct conformations. Despite this fact, our ability to characterize or predict protein dynamics is substantially less developed compared to state-of-the-art protein structure prediction. Molecular simulations provide unique opportunities to study protein dynamics, but the timescales associated with conformational changes generate substantial challenges. Enhanced sampling algorithms with collective variables can greatly reduce the computational cost of sampling slow processes. However, defining collective variables suitable to enhance sampling of protein conformational transitions is non-trivial. Low-frequency vibrations have long been considered as promising candidates for collective variable but their identification so far relied on assumptions inherently invalid at low frequencies. We recently introduced an analysis of molecular vibrations that does not rely on such approximations and remains accurate at low frequencies. Here, we modified this approach to efficiently isolate low-frequency vibrations in proteins and applied it to a set of five proteins of varying complexity. We demonstrate that our approach is not only highly reproducible but results in collective variables that consistently enhance sampling of protein conformational transitions and associated free energy surfaces on timescales compatible with high throughput applications. This enables the efficient generation of protein conformational ensembles, which will be key for future prediction algorithms aiming beyond static protein structures.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics after quantum quenches as hydrodynamic fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The statistics of fluctuations on large regions of space encodes universal properties of many-body systems. At equilibrium, it is described by thermodynamics. However, away from equilibrium such as after quantum quenches, the fundamental principles are more nebulous. In particular, although exact results have been conjectured in integrable models, a correct understanding of the physics is largely missing. In this letter, we explain these principles, taking the example of the number of particles lying on a large interval in one-dimensional interacting systems. These are based on simple hydrodynamic arguments from the theory of ballistically transported fluctuations, and in particular the Euler-scale transport of long-range correlations. Using these principles, we obtain the full counting statistics (FCS) in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities, whose validity depends on the structure of hydrodynamic modes and on the fluctuations in the initial state. In fermionic-statistics interacting integrable models with a continuum of hydrodynamic modes, such as the Lieb-Liniger model for cold atomic gases, the formula reproduces previous conjectures, but is in fact not exact: it gives the correct cumulants up to, including, order 5, while long-range correlations modify higher cumulants. In integrable and non-integrable models with two or less hydrodynamic modes, the formula is expected to give all cumulants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the replica method, we compute the statistics of the top eigenpair of diluted covariance matrices of the form $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a $N\times M$ sparse data matrix, in the limit of large $N,M$ with fixed ratio and a bounded number of nonzero entries. We allow for random non-zero weights, provided they lead to an isolated largest eigenvalue. By formulating the problem as the optimisation of a quadratic Hamiltonian constrained to the $N$-sphere at low temperatures, we derive a set of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions, which can be efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. The average largest eigenvalue is identified with a Lagrange parameter that governs the convergence of the algorithm, and the resulting stable populations are then used to evaluate the density of the top eigenvector's components. We find excellent agreement between our analytical results and numerical results obtained from direct diagonalisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the critical dynamics of the three-dimensional Heisenberg
  model with random cubic anisotropy in the out-of-equilibrium and
  equilibrium regimes. Analytical approaches based on field theory
  predict that the universality class of this model is that of the
  three-dimensional site-diluted Ising model. We have been able to
  estimate the dynamic critical exponent by working in the equilibrium
  regime and by computing the integrated autocorrelation times
  obtaining $z=2.50(5)$ (without taking into account scaling
  corrections) and $z=2.29(11)$ (by fixing the scaling corrections to
  that predicted by field theory). In the out-of-equilibrium regime
  we have focused in the study of the dynamic correlation length which
  has allowed us to compute the dynamic critical exponent obtaining
  $z=2.38(2)$, which is compatible with the equilibrium ones. Finally,
  both estimates are also compatible with the most accurate prediction
  $z=2.35(2)$, from numerical simulations of the 3D site-diluted Ising
  model, in agreement with the predictions based on field theory.</description>

      <title>Two Channel Kondo behavior in the quantum XX chain with a boundary defect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary defect in the single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum $XX$ chain exhibits two-channel Kondo physics. Due to the presence of the defect, the edge spin fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions, out of which one decouples, and one is overscreened by the free fermion in bulk, leading to non-trivial boundary behavior characteristic of the two-channel Kondo model. When the ratio of boundary to bulk coupling exceeds a critical value of $\sqrt{2}$, a massive boundary-bound mode is exponentially localized near the impurity site for strong impurity coupling. This leads to unusual behavior in physical quantities, such as the $g$-function not being monotonic. We compute the $g-$function of the impurity from both thermodynamic and entanglement entropy calculations and show that it takes a non-integer value of $\sqrt{2}$ just as in the two-channel Kondo problem.</description>

      <title>Non-Stabilizerness of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results suggest that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively distinct in chaotic and non-chaotic many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We develop, in the AdS/CFT correspondence, a method to compute correlation functions when the CFT is governed by the Lindblad equation for open quantum systems, via the AdS theory. Using a simple example in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we demonstrate that the predictions of the AdS theory based on our method match the direct computations in the dual CFT. We also briefly discuss the relaxation problem and the holographic entropy in this example.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Parallel Tempering for Constrained Optimization</title>

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.</description>

      <title>Effects of knotting on the collapse of active ring polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08391</link>

Abstract: We use numerical simulations to study tangentially active flexible ring polymers with different knot topologies. Simple, unknotted active rings display a transition from an extended phase to a collapsed one upon increasing the degree of polymerization. We find that topology has a significant effect on the polymer size at which the collapse takes place, with twist knots collapsing earlier than torus knots. Increasing knot complexity further accentuates this difference, as the collapse point of torus knots grows linearly with the minimum crossing number of the knot while that of twist knots shrinks, eventually canceling the actively stretched regime altogether. This behavior is a consequence of the ordered configuration of torus knots in their stretched active state, featuring an effective alignment for non-neighboring bonds which increases with the minimal crossing number. Twist knots do not feature ordered configurations or bond alignment, increasing the likelihood of collisions, leading to collapse. These results show that topology yields a degree of control on the properties of active ring polymers, and can be used to tune them. At the same time, they suggest that activity might introduce a bias for torus knots, as complex twist knots cannot be formed in extended active polymers.</description>
