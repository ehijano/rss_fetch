      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: High-velocity components in the Si II $\lambda$6355</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ZTF SN Ia Data Release 2 provides a perfect opportunity to perform a thorough search for, and subsequent analysis of, high-velocity components in the Si II $\lambda$6355 feature in the pre-peak regime. The source of such features remains unclear, with potential origins in circumstellar material or density/abundance enhancements intrinsic to the SN ejecta. Therefore, they may provide clues to the elusive progenitor and explosion scenarios of SNe Ia. We employ a MCMC fitting method followed by BIC testing to classify single and double Si II $\lambda$6355 components in the DR2. The detection efficiency of our classification method is investigated through the fitting of simulated features, allowing us to place cuts upon spectral quality required for reliable classification. These simulations were also used to perform an analysis of the recovered parameter uncertainties and potential biases in the measurements. Within the 329 spectra sample that we investigate, we identify 85 spectra exhibiting Si II $\lambda$6355 HVFs. We find that HVFs decrease in strength with phase relative to their photospheric counterparts - however, this decrease can occur at different phases for different objects. HVFs with larger velocity separations from the photosphere are seen to fade earlier leaving only the double components with smaller separations as we move towards maximum light. Our findings suggest that around three quarters of SN Ia spectra before -11 d show high-velocity components in the Si II $\lambda$6355 with this dropping to around one third in the six days before maximum light. We observe no difference between the populations of SNe Ia that do and do not form Si II $\lambda$6355 HVFs in terms of SALT2 light-curve parameter x1, peak magnitude, decline rate, host mass, or host colour, supporting the idea that these features are ubiquitous across the SN Ia population.</description>

      <title>Observations of Holographic Quantum-Foam Blurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "foamy" nature of spacetime at the Planck scale was an idea first introduced by John Wheeler in the 1950s. And for the last twenty years or so it has been debated whether those inherent uncertainties in time and path-length might also accumulate in transiting electromagnetic wavefronts, resulting in measurable blurring for images of distant galaxies and quasars. A confusing aspect is that "pointlike" objects will always be blurred out somewhat by the optics of a telescope, especially in the optical. But it turns out that Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are more useful to test this, and have been observed by a host of ground-based and space-based telescopes, including by the Fermi observatory for well over a decade. And a recent one was unprecedented: GRB221009A was extremely bright, allowing follow-up from the infrared through the ultraviolet to X-rays and gamma-rays, including a first association with photons at high TeV energies. I will discuss how that observation is in direct tension with the calculus of how spacetime "foaminess" can add up in an image of a pointsource at cosmological distances, which at high-enough energy could spread these out over the whole sky without resulting in photon loss. A simple multiwavelength average of foam-induced blurring consistent with holographic quantum gravity is described, analogous to atmospheric seeing from the ground. This fits with measured instrumental point-spread functions and with the highest-energy localization of GRB221009A, resolving the observational issues and pointing to a key physical implication: spacetime does not look smooth.</description>

      <title>Clash of the Titans: ultra-high energy KM3NeT event versus IceCube data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KM3NET has reported the detection of a remarkably high-energy through-going muon. Lighting up about a third of the detector, this muon could originate from a neutrino exceeding 10 PeV energy. The crucial question we need to answer is where this event comes from and what its source is. Intriguingly, IceCube has been running with a much larger effective area for a much longer time, and yet it has not reported neutrinos above 10 PeV. We quantify the tension between the KM3NeT event with the absence of similar high-energy events in IceCube. Through a detailed analysis, we determine the most likely neutrino energy to be in the range 23-2400 PeV. We find a $3.8\sigma$ tension between the two experiments assuming the neutrino to be from the diffuse isotropic neutrino background. Alternatively, assuming the event is of cosmogenic origin and considering three representative models, this tension still falls within 3.2-3.9$\sigma$. The least disfavored scenario is a steady or transient point source, though still leading to $2.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ tensions, respectively. The lack of observation of high-energy events in IceCube seriously challenges the explanation of this event coming from any known diffuse fluxes. Our results indicate the KM3NeT event is likely the first observation of a new astrophysical source.</description>

      <title>A search for the anomalous events detected by ANITA using the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dedicated search for upward-going air showers at zenith angles exceeding $110^\circ$ and energies $E&gt;0.1$ EeV has been performed using the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The search is motivated by two "anomalous" radio pulses observed by the ANITA flights I and III which appear inconsistent with the Standard Model of particle physics. Using simulations of both regular cosmic ray showers and upward-going events, a selection procedure has been defined to separate potential upward-going candidate events and the corresponding exposure has been calculated in the energy range [0.1-33] EeV. One event has been found in the search period between 1 Jan 2004 and 31 Dec 2018, consistent with an expected background of $0.27 \pm 0.12$ events from mis-reconstructed cosmic ray showers. This translates to an upper bound on the integral flux of $(7.2 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-21}$ cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ and $(3.6 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-20}$ cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ for an $E^{-1}$ and $E^{-2}$ spectrum, respectively. An upward-going flux of showers normalized to the ANITA observations is shown to predict over 34 events for an $E^{-3}$ spectrum and over 8.1 events for a conservative $E^{-5}$ spectrum, in strong disagreement with the interpretation of the anomalous events as upward-going showers.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Timing of 49 Pulsars from the Arecibo 327-MHz Drift Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 18 pulsar discoveries from the AO327 pulsar survey, along with their timing solutions and those for an additional 31 AO327-discovered pulsars. Timing solutions were constructed using observations from a follow-up timing campaign taken between the periods of 2013 -- 2019 using the Arecibo Observatory's 327-MHz receiver. Aside from PSR J0916+0658, an isolated pulsar that shows evidence for partial recycling, the remaining discoveries are non-recycled pulsars. We present a brief census of emission features for all pulsars with the following standouts. PSR~J1942+0142 is found to exhibit the very rare phenomenon of subpulse bi-drifting and PSR~J0225+1727 has an interpulse. We also report distance estimates using the NE2001 and YMW16 Galactic electron density models, and identify at least 10 sources where either one or both models underestimate the maximum Galactic line of sight dispersion measure.</description>

      <title>Broadband $\gamma$-ray spectrum of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The core-collapse supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is one of the brightest galactic radio sources with an angular radius of $\sim$ 2.5 $\arcmin$. Although no extension of this source has been detected in the $\gamma$-ray band, using more than 1000 days of LHAASO data above $\sim 0.8$ TeV, we find that its spectrum is significantly softer than those obtained with Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and its flux near $\sim 1$ TeV is about two times higher. In combination with analyses of more than 16 years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data covering $0.1 \, \mathrm{GeV} - 1 \, \mathrm{TeV}$, we find that the spectrum above 30 GeV deviates significantly from a single power-law, and is best described by a smoothly broken power-law with a spectral index of $1.90 \pm 0.15_\mathrm{stat}$ ($3.41 \pm 0.19_\mathrm{stat}$) below (above) a break energy of $0.63 \pm 0.21_\mathrm{stat} \, \mathrm{TeV}$. Given differences in the angular resolution of LHAASO-WCDA and IACTs, TeV $\gamma$-ray emission detected with LHAASO may have a significant contribution from regions surrounding the SNR illuminated by particles accelerated earlier, which, however, are treated as background by IACTs. Detailed modelling can be used to constrain acceleration processes of TeV particles in the early stage of SNR evolution.</description>

      <title>Insights Into Neutron Stars From Gravitational Redshifts and Universal Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universal relations in neutron stars form an essential entity to understand their properties. The moment of inertia, compactness, love number, mass quadrupole moment, and oscillation modes are some of the properties that have been studied previously in the context of universal relations. All of these quantities are measurable; thus, analyzing them is of utmost importance. This article analyzes the universal relations in the context of a neutron star's gravitational redshift. Using the redshift measurements of RBS 1223, RX J0720.4-3125, and RX J1856.5-3754, we provide theoretical estimates of compactness, the inverse of compactness, the moment of inertia, dimensionless tidal love number, mass quadrupole moment, the mass of the star times the ratio of angular frequency over the spin angular moment, and the average of the speed of sound squared. In the case of the redshift measurement of RX J0720.4-3125, we found that the theoretical estimate using universal relations aligns closely with the Bayesian estimate. Our findings indicate that such theoretical predictions are highly reliable for observations with low uncertainty and can be used as an alternative for statistical analysis. Additionally, we report a violation of the universality of the tidal love number and average of the speed of sound squared with respect to the gravitational redshift. Our calculations also show that the maximum redshift value for neutron stars following the current astrophysical constraints cannot exceed a value of $\le 0.763$.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting generic fast-time features in the neutrino lightcurve of nearby supernovae in neutrino telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino emission offers a direct probe into the hydrodynamics and energy transport processes within a supernova. Fast-time variations in the neutrino luminosity and mean energy can provide insights into phenomena like turbulence, convection, and shock revival. In this paper, we explore the detection capabilities of large-volume neutrino telescopes such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and the planned IceCube-Gen2 detector in identifying generic fast-time features in the neutrino light curve. We also investigate the potential enhancement in detection sensitivity using wavelength shifters, which can improve light collection efficiency. By employing a Short-Time Fourier Transform analysis, we quantify the excess power in the frequency spectrum arising from fast-time modulations and compute the detection horizon for a range of generic models. We find that with IceCube we can already see the strongest modulation models (&gt;50% amplitude) for progenitors located anywhere in the Milky Way. Sensitivity to weaker modulations (&gt;20% amplitude) is possible in future detectors like IceCube-Gen2, in particular with the use of wavelength shifters. For all detector configurations, the frequency and central time of the fast-time feature at the 5$\sigma$ detection horizon can be measured with a resolution of 7.0 Hz and 17 ms respectively.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Hypervelocity Supernova Survivors and the Outcomes of Interacting Double White Dwarf Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent prediction and discovery of hypervelocity supernova survivors has provided strong evidence that the "dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation" (D6) Type Ia supernova scenario occurs in Nature. In this model, the accretion stream from the secondary white dwarf in a double white dwarf binary strikes the primary white dwarf violently enough to trigger a helium shell detonation, which in turn triggers a carbon/oxygen core detonation. If the secondary white dwarf survives the primary's explosion, it will be flung away as a hypervelocity star. While previous work has shown that the hotter observed D6 stars can be broadly understood as secondaries whose outer layers have been heated by their primaries' explosions, the properties of the cooler D6 stars have proven difficult to reproduce. In this paper, we show that the cool D6 stars can be explained by the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of helium or carbon/oxygen white dwarfs that underwent significant mass loss and core heating prior to and during the explosion of their white dwarf companions. We find that the current population of known D6 candidates is consistent with ~2% of Type Ia supernovae leaving behind a hypervelocity surviving companion. We also calculate the evolution of hot, low-mass oxygen/neon stars and find reasonable agreement with the properties of the LP 40-365 class of hypervelocity survivors, suggesting that these stars are the kicked remnants of near-Chandrasekhar-mass oxygen/neon white dwarfs that were partially disrupted by oxygen deflagrations. We use these results as motivation for schematic diagrams showing speculative outcomes of interacting double white dwarf binaries, including long-lived merger remnants, Type Ia supernovae, and several kinds of peculiar transients.</description>

      <title>Momentum and Matter Matter for Axion Dark Matter Matters on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of matter effects to searches for axion Dark Matter on Earth. The finite momentum of axion Dark Matter is crucial to elucidating the effects of Earth on both the axion Dark Matter field value and its gradient. We find that experiments targeting axion couplings compatible with canonical solutions of the strong CP puzzle are likely not affected by Earth's matter effects. However, experiments sensitive to lighter axions with stronger couplings can be significantly affected, with a significant part of the parameter space suffering from a reduced axion field value, and therefore decreased experimental sensitivity. In contrast, the spatial gradient of the axion field can be enhanced along Earth's radial direction, with important implications for ongoing and planned experiments searching for axion Dark Matter.</description>

      <title>Choosing suitable noise models for nanohertz gravitational-wave astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the parameters of the nanohertz gravitational-wave background is essential for understanding its origin. The background is typically modeled with a power-law spectrum, parametrized with an amplitude $A$, which describes its intensity, and a spectral index $\gamma$, which describes how the background varies with frequency. Different collaborations have produced varied estimates of $\gamma$, some in tension with the value of $\gamma = 13/3$ expected for circular, gravitational-wave-driven binary black holes. However, estimates of $A$ and $\gamma$ can be affected by systematic errors and misspecified noise models. We investigate how systematic errors, which may plausibly be present in pulsar-timing analyses, can shift inferences about $A, \gamma$. We demonstrate that conservatively incorporating noise sources into the model that are not actually present in the data does not produce bias inferences in practice. This addresses concerns that an overly complex noise model might lead to bias from a needlessly conservative prior. Our results highlight the importance of using comprehensive noise models in pulsar timing analyses to ensure accurate and reliable parameter estimation of the gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>Decretion disc evolution and neutron star accretion in short-period eccentric Be/X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine Be star discs in highly eccentric Be/X-ray systems. We use a three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code to model the structure of the Be star disc and investigate its interactions with the secondary star over time. We use system parameters consistent with the eccentric, short-period (P $\approx$ 16 d) Be/X-ray binary A0538-66 as the basis for our models. We explore a range of system geometries by incrementally varying the misalignment angle of the neutron star's orbital plane with respect to the primary star's equatorial plane to cover a complete range from coplanar prograde to coplanar retrograde. For all simulations, we follow the evolution of the disc's total mass and angular momentum as well as the average eccentricity and inclination with respect to the equatorial planes of both the primary and secondary. We also determine the neutron star accretion rates. We find that the high eccentricity of the binary orbit causes all calculated disc parameters to vary with orbital phase in all models. The amplitude of these variations is negatively correlated with misalignment angle for models with misalignment angles less than 90{\deg}, and positively correlated for models with misalignment angles greater than 90{\deg}. Accretion rates are affected by the number of particles the neutron star interacts with as well as the length of the interaction time between the particles and the neutron star. We find that accretion rates are largest for models with misalignment angles less than 90{\deg}, and smaller for models with those greater than 90{\deg}.</description>

      <title>Solar flares as electron accelerators: toward a resolution of the acceleration efficiency issue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major open issue concerning the active Sun is the effectiveness with which magnetic reconnection accelerates electrons in flares. A paper published by {\em{Nature}} in 2022 used microwave observations to conclude that the Sun is an almost ideal accelerator, energizing nearly all electrons within a coronal volume to nonthermal energies. Shortly thereafter, a paper published in {\em{Astrophysical Journal Letters}} used hard X-ray measurements \emph{of the same event} to reach the contradictory conclusion that less than 1\% of the available electrons were accelerated. Here we address this controversy by using spatially resolved observations of hard X-ray emission and a spectral inversion method to determine the evolution of the electron spectrum throughout the flare. So we estimated the density of the medium where electrons accelerate and, from this, the ratio of accelerated to ambient electron densities. Results show that this ratio never exceeds a percent or so in the cases analyzed.</description>

Abstract: A five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein spacetime model is considered, with one extra compactified spatial dimension. The equation of state of an electrically neutral, zero-temperature Fermi gas with a repulsive linear potential is described. From the equation of state, the speed of sound squared is calculated and shown for different model parameters. Its properties are studied from lower energies up to the conformal limit.</description>

      <title>Successful $\nu p$-process in neutrino-driven outflows in core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the solar system abundances of several proton-rich isotopes, especially $^{92,94}$Mo and $^{96,98}$Ru, has been an enduring mystery in nuclear astrophysics. An attractive proposal to solve this problem is the $\nu p$-process, which can operate in neutrino-driven outflows in a core-collapse supernova after the shock is launched. Years of detailed studies, however, have cast doubt over the ability of this process to generate sufficiently high absolute and relative amounts of various $p$-nuclei. The $\nu p$-process is also thought to be excluded by arguments based on the long-lived radionuclide $^{92}$Nb.Here, we present explicit calculations, in which both the abundance ratios and the absolute yields of the $p$-nuclei up to $A\lesssim 105$ are successfully reproduced, even when using the modern (medium enhanced) triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates. The process is also shown to produce the necessary amounts of $^{92}$Nb. The models are characterized by subsonic outflows and by the protoneutron star masses in the $\gtrsim 1.7 M_\odot$ range. This suggests that the Mo and Ru $p$-nuclides observed in the Solar System were made in CCSN explosions characterized by an extended accretion stage.</description>

      <title>Confronting the dark matter capture rate with a continuous gravitational wave probe of local neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming gravitational wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Connecting dust and outflows in AGN: the intriguing case of NGC 6860</title>

Abstract: Cosmic dust plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies, significantly influencing star formation and the interstellar medium. However, in active galactic nuclei (AGN), the role and origin of dust remain poorly understood. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing the properties of dust in AGN. NGC 6860, an X-ray bright type-1 quasar, is an ideal target for investigating the connection between dust and winds in AGN. It exhibits reddening and X-ray absorption by both dust and winds. By modeling high-resolution X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, we determine the properties of dust and outflows in this AGN. Our analysis finds four photoionized components, outflowing with velocities of 50-300 km/s. The first two are relatively highly ionized with logxi = 3.4 and logxi = 2.9. The results of our photoionization modeling suggest that these two components are thermally unstable. The third component is ionized, with logxi = 2.3 and is located further away from the central black hole. The fourth component is less ionized, and is possibly located in the host galaxy. The application of dust models enables us to probe the abundance and location of the dust in NGC 6860. Our findings suggest that dust absorption and reddening originates from the extended narrow-line region and its host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Optical evolution of AT 2024wpp: the high-velocity outflows in Cow-like transients are consistent with high spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the analysis of optical data of a bright and extremely-rapidly evolving transient, AT2024wpp, whose properties are similar to the enigmatic AT2018cow (aka the Cow). AT2024wpp rose to a peak brightness of c=-21.9mag in 4.3d and remained above the half-maximum brightness for only 6.7d. The blackbody fits to the multi-band photometry show that the event remained persistently hot (T&gt;20000K) with a rapidly receding photosphere (v~11500km/s) until the end of the photometric dataset at +16.1d post-discovery. This behaviour mimics that of AT2018cow, albeit with a several times larger photosphere. The spectra are consistent with blackbody emission throughout our spectral sequence ending at +21.9d, showing a tentative, very broad emission feature at 5500{\AA} -- implying that the optical photosphere is likely within a near-relativistic outflow. Furthermore, reports of strong X-ray and radio emission cement the nature of AT2024wpp as a likely Cow-like transient. AT2024wpp is only the second event of the class with optical polarimetry. Our BVRI observations obtained from +6.1 to +14.4d show a low polarisation of P&lt;0.5% across all bands, similar to AT2018cow that was consistent with P~0% during the same outflow-driven phase. In the absence of evidence for a preferential viewing angle, it is unlikely that both events would have shown low polarisation in the case that their photospheres were aspherical. As such, we conclude that the near-relativistic outflows launched in these events are likely highly spherical, but polarimetric observations of further events are crucial to constrain their ejecta geometry and stratification in detail.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos and Relic Neutrino Matter Effect on the High-energy Neutrino Flavor Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac, they can potentially affect the flavor ratio predictions for the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube. In this context, we point out a novel matter effect induced by the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) on the flavor ratio composition. Specifically, the active-sterile neutrino oscillations over the astrophysical baseline lead to an energy-dependent flavor ratio at Earth due to the C$\nu$B matter effect, which is in principle distinguishable from the vacuum oscillation effect, provided there is an asymmetry between the neutrino and antineutrino number densities, as well as a local C$\nu$B overdensity. Considering the projected precision of the 3-neutrino oscillation parameter measurements and improved flavor triangle measurements, we show that the next-generation neutrino telescopes, such as KM3NeT and IceCube-Gen2, can in principle probe the pseudo-Dirac neutrino hypothesis and the C$\nu$B matter effect.</description>

      <title>Cooling rate and turbulence in the intracluster medium of the cool-core cluster Abell 2667</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the thermal X-ray emission from the intracluster medium (ICM) in the cool-core galaxy cluster Abell 2667 ($z=0.23$). Our goal is to detect low-temperature ($&lt;2$ keV) X-ray emitting gas, potentially associated to a cooling flow that connects the hot ICM reservoir to the cold gas phase responsible for star formation and supermassive black hole feeding. We use new deep XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS data, combined with archival Chandra data, to perform a spectral analysis for the core region. We find 1$\sigma$ upper limits to the cooling gas fraction of $\sim$40 $\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ and $\sim$50-60 $\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ in the temperature ranges 0.5-1 keV and 1-2 keV, respectively. The lack of OVII, FeXXI-FeXXII, and FeXVII emission lines in the RGS spectra suggest that the fraction of gas cooling below 1 keV is limited to a few tens of $\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ at most. However, we detect several lines (e.g. SiXIV, MgXII, FeXXIII/FeXXIV, NeX, OVIII$\alpha$) that allow us to estimate a 1$\sigma$ upper limit for turbulent broadening of $\sim$320 km $\rm s^{-1}$, higher that other cool-core clusters such as Abell 1835, implying mechanisms that boost turbulence in Abell 2667's atmosphere. Imaging analysis of Chandra data suggests the presence of a cold front, possibly lined to sloshing or ICM cavities. However, current data do not clearly identify the physical mechanism driving turbulence. These finding indicate that Abell 2667 is similar to other low-redshift cool-core clusters, though the large upper limit on turbulence hints at significant ICM heating, which may suppress cooling for extended periods and contribute to future condensation events.</description>

      <title>Where is the Super-virial Gas? II: Insight from the Survey of Galactic Sightlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed a super-virial temperature gas phase at log(T/K) $\sim7$ in the Milky Way, challenging existing galaxy-formation models. This hot gas phase was discovered toward extragalactic absorption sightlines and blank-sky emission fields, both at high galactic latitudes. The location of this hot component is unknown; is it in the extended circumgalactic medium (CGM) or in the interstellar medium (ISM) instead? We analyzed X-ray spectra from Chandra's High-Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) observations of 27 Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) to investigate whether the hot gas component is present in the ISM. We searched for absorption lines of SXVI K$\alpha$, SiXIV K$\alpha$, and NeX K$\alpha$, which are the tell-tale signatures of the hot gas and which have been detected toward extragalactic sightlines. Of the 27 targets, these lines were detected in the spectra of only 7, with two sources displaying broad line features likely intrinsic to the XRB systems. Additionally, most of the detected lines are time-variable, reinforcing their likely association with the XRBs. Our results suggest that the super-virial temperature gas is not a widespread component of the ISM but may instead be located in extraplanar regions or the extended CGM, in line with some recent simulation results.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov emission by a fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon &gt; 1$ produces Cherenkov emission. This is a new physical effect: classical (non-quantum) emission of electromagnetic waves by a completely charge-neutral ``particle''. The governing equations (involving General Relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous media) have no external electromagnetic source - it is the distortion of the initial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the role of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual Cherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c &gt; 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Unlike Cherenkov emission by a point charge, the effective source in this case is spatially distributed, with emission generated along the single Cherenkov emission cone. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $\propto dk_z /|k_z|$ for wave numbers $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_G$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers.</description>
