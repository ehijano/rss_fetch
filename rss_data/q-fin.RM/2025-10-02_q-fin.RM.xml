      <title>Improving Cryptocurrency Pump-and-Dump Detection through Ensemble-Based Models and Synthetic Oversampling Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&amp;D) manipulation in cryptocurrency markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&amp;D events by increasing recall and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular, XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%, respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities, contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency market.</description>

      <title>Automated Risk Management Mechanisms in DeFi Lending Protocols: A Crosschain Comparative Analysis of Aave and Compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain-based decentralised lending is a rapidly growing and evolving alternative to traditional lending, but it poses new risks. To mitigate these risks, lending protocols have integrated automated risk management tools into their smart contracts. However, the effectiveness of the latest risk management features introduced in the most recent versions of these lending protocols is understudied. To close this gap, we use a panel regression fixed effects model to empirically analyse the cross-version (v2 and v3) and cross-chain (L1 and L2) effectiveness of liquidation mechanisms, measured through TVL and total revenue as proxies for performance of the two most popular lending protocols, Aave and Compound, during the period Jan 2021 to Dec 2024. Our analysis reveals that liquidation events in v3 of both protocols lead to an increase in total value locked and total revenue, with stronger impact on the L2 blockchain compared to L1. In contrast, liquidations in v2 have an insignificant impact, which indicates that the most recent v3 protocols have better risk management than the earlier v2 protocols. We also show that L1 blockchains are the preferred choice among large investors for their robust liquidity and ecosystem depth, while L2 blockchains are more popular among retail investors for their lower fees and faster execution.</description>
