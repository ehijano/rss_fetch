      <title>Sumsets in the Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of the Boolean hypercube $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is a sumset if $S = A+A = \{a + b \ | \ a, b\in A\}$ for some $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$. We prove that the number of sumsets in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is asymptotically $(2^n-1)2^{2^{n-1}}$. Furthermore, we show that the family of sumsets in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is almost identical to the family of all subsets of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ that contain a complete linear subspace of co-dimension $1$.</description>

      <title>Free Sets in Planar Graphs: History and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a planar graph $G$ is a free set if, for every set $P$ of $|S|$ points in the plane, there exists a straight-line crossing-free drawing of $G$ in which vertices of $S$ are mapped to distinct points in $P$. In this survey, we review
  - several equivalent definitions of free sets, - results on the existence of large free sets in planar graphs and subclasses of planar graphs, - and applications of free sets in graph drawing.
  The survey concludes with a list of open problems in this still very active research area.</description>

      <title>Geometric planted matchings beyond the Gaussian model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering an unknown matching between a set of $n$ randomly placed points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and random perturbations of these points. This can be seen as a model for particle tracking and more generally, entity resolution. We use matchings in random geometric graphs to derive minimax lower bounds for this problem that hold under great generality. Using these results we show that for a broad class of distributions, the order of the number of mistakes made by an estimator that minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances is minimax optimal when $d$ is fixed and is optimal up to $n^{o(1)}$ factors when $d = o(\log n)$. In the high-dimensional regime we consider a setup where both initial positions and perturbations have independent sub-Gaussian coordinates. In this setup we give sufficient conditions under which the same estimator makes no mistakes with high probability. We prove an analogous result for an adapted version of this estimator that incorporates information on the covariance matrix of the perturbations.</description>

      <title>A Caro-Wei bound for induced linear forests in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known result due to Caro (1979) and Wei (1981) states that every graph $G$ has an independent set of size at least $\sum_{v\in V(G)} \frac{1}{d(v) + 1}$, where $d(v)$ denotes the degree of vertex $v$. Alon, Kahn, and Seymour (1987) showed the following generalization: For every $k\geq 0$, every graph $G$ has a $k$-degenerate induced subgraph with at least $\sum_{v \in V(G)}\min\{1, \frac {k+1}{d(v)+1}\}$ vertices. In particular, for $k=1$, every graph $G$ with no isolated vertices has an induced forest with at least $\sum_{v\in V(G)} \frac{2}{d(v) + 1}$ vertices. Akbari, Amanihamedani, Mousavi, Nikpey, and Sheybani (2019) conjectured that, if $G$ has minimum degree at least $2$, then one can even find an induced linear forest of that order in $G$, that is, a forest where each component is a path.
  In this paper, we prove this conjecture and show a number of related results. In particular, if there is no restriction on the minimum degree of $G$, we show that there are infinitely many ``best possible'' functions $f$ such that $\sum_{v\in V(G)} f(d(v))$ is a lower bound on the maximum order of a linear forest in $G$, and we give a full characterization of all such functions $f$.</description>

      <title>Generalising the maximum independent set algorithm via Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple greedy algorithm to find a maximal independent set (MIS) in a graph starts with the empty set and visits every vertex, adding it to the set if and only if none of its neighbours are already in the set. In this paper, we consider the generalisation of this MIS algorithm by letting it start with any set of vertices and we prove the hardness of many decision problems related to this generalisation. Our results are based on two main strategies. Firstly, we view the MIS algorithm as a sequential update of a Boolean network, which we refer to as the MIS network, according to a permutation of the vertex set. The set of fixed points of the MIS network corresponds to the set of MIS of the graph. Our generalisation then consists in starting from any configuration and following a sequential update given by a word of vertices. Secondly, we introduce the concept of a colony of a graph, that is a set of vertices that is dominated by an independent set. Deciding whether a set of vertices is a colony is NP-complete; decision problems related to the MIS algorithm will be reduced from the Colony problem. We first show that deciding whether a configuration can reach all maximal independent sets is coNP-complete. Second, we consider so-called fixing words, that allow to reach a MIS for any initial configuration, and fixing permutations, which we call permises; deciding whether a permutation is fixing is coNP-complete. Third, we show that deciding whether a graph has a permis is coNP-hard. Finally, we generalise the MIS algorithm to digraphs. The algorithm then uses the so-called kernel network, whose fixed points are the kernels of the digraph. Deciding whether the kernel network of a given digraph is fixable is coNP-hard, even for digraphs that have a kernel. Alternatively, we introduce two fixable Boolean networks whose sets of fixed points contain all kernels.</description>

      <title>Density of group languages in shift spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the density of group languages (i.e. rational languages recognized by morphisms onto finite groups) inside shift spaces. The density of a rational language can be understood as the frequency of some "pattern" in the shift space, for example a pattern like "words with an even number of a given letter." In this paper, we handle density of group languages via ergodicity of skew products between the shift space and the recognizing group. We consider both the cases of shifts of finite type (with a suitable notion of irreducibility), and of minimal shifts. In the latter case, our main result is a closed formula for the density which holds whenever the skew product has minimal closed invariant subsets which are ergodic under the product of the original measure and the uniform probability measure on the group. The formula is derived in part from a characterization of minimal closed invariant subsets for skew products relying on notions of cocycles and coboundaries. In the case where the whole skew product itself is ergodic under the product measure, then the density is completely determined by the cardinality of the image of the language inside the recognizing group. We provide sufficient conditions for the skew product to have minimal closed invariant subsets that are ergodic under the product measure. Finally, we investigate the link between minimal closed invariant subsets, return words and bifix codes.</description>

      <title>A Nonparametric Framework for Online Stochastic Matching with Correlated Arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02229v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of online algorithms for matching markets and revenue management settings is usually bound by the stochastic prior that the demand process is formed by a fixed-length sequence of queries with unknown types, each drawn independently. This assumption of {\em serial independence} implies that the demand of each type, i.e., the number of queries of a given type, has low variance and is approximately Poisson-distributed. This paper explores more general stochastic models for online edge-weighted matching that depart from the serial independence assumption. We propose two new models, \Indep and \Correl, that capture different forms of serial correlations by combining a nonparametric distribution for the demand with standard assumptions on the arrival patterns -- adversarial or random order. The \Indep model has arbitrary marginal distributions for the demands but assumes cross-sectional independence for the customer types, whereas the \Correl model captures common shocks across customer types. We demonstrate that fluid relaxations, which rely solely on expected demand information, have arbitrarily bad performance guarantees. In contrast, we develop new algorithms that essentially achieve optimal constant-factor performance guarantees in each model. Our mathematical analysis includes tighter linear programming relaxations that leverage distribution knowledge, and a new lossless randomized rounding scheme in the case of $\Indep$. In numerical simulations of the $\Indep$ model, we find that tighter relaxations are beneficial under high-variance demand and that our demand-aware rounding scheme can outperform stockout-aware rounding.</description>

      <title>Critical exponent of binary words with few distinct palindromes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite binary words that contain few distinct palindromes. In particular, we classify such words according to their critical exponents. This extends results by Fici and Zamboni [TCS 2013]. Interestingly, the words with 18 and 20 palindromes happen to be morphic images of the fixed point of the morphism $\texttt{0}\mapsto\texttt{01}$, $\texttt{1}\mapsto\texttt{21}$, $\texttt{2}\mapsto\texttt{0}$.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal embeddings of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their flexibility to represent almost any kind of relational data, graph-based models have enjoyed a tremendous success over the past decades. While graphs are inherently only combinatorial objects, however, many prominent analysis tools are based on the algebraic representation of graphs via matrices such as the graph Laplacian, or on associated graph embeddings. Such embeddings associate to each node a set of coordinates in a vector space, a representation which can then be employed for learning tasks such as the classification or alignment of the nodes of the graph. As the geometric picture provided by embedding methods enables the use of a multitude of methods developed for vector space data, embeddings have thus gained interest both from a theoretical as well as a practical perspective. Inspired by trace-optimization problems, often encountered in the analysis of graph-based data, here we present a method to derive ellipsoidal embeddings of the nodes of a graph, in which each node is assigned a set of coordinates on the surface of a hyperellipsoid. Our method may be seen as an alternative to popular spectral embedding techniques, to which it shares certain similarities we discuss. To illustrate the utility of the embedding we conduct a case study in which we analyse synthetic and real world networks with modular structure, and compare the results obtained with known methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Frequency Bin Interval in FFT via Dense Sampling Factor $\alpha$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a fundamental tool for signal analysis, widely used across various fields. However, traditional FFT methods encounter challenges in adjusting the frequency bin interval, which may impede accurate spectral analysis. In this study, we propose a method for adjusting the frequency bin interval in FFT by introducing a parameter $\alpha$. We elucidate the underlying principles of the proposed method and discuss its potential applications across various contexts. Our findings suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach to overcome the limitations of traditional FFT methods and enhance spectral analysis accuracy.</description>
