      <title>Vector-free DNA transfection by nuclear envelope mechanoporation</title>

Abstract: Genetic engineering of cells has a range of applications in treating incurable diseases. Plasmid DNA is a popular choice of nucleic acid for cell engineering due to its low cost and stability. However, plasmid DNA must survive the protective mechanisms present in the cell's cytoplasm to enter the nucleus for translation. Many of the existing methods for nucleic acid delivery, such as chemical-based and virus-based delivery, suffer from drawbacks induced by the nucleic acid carrier itself. Mechanical methods present an alternative to nucleic acid carriers by physically producing openings in the cell to deliver cargos. However, in most systems, the cell membrane openings are too small to deliver large cargos, or the poration process leads to low cell viability. In this study, we present a microfluidic device with integrated high aspect ratio nanostructures that repeatably rupture the cell membrane and nuclear envelope. These sharp-tipped nanolancets penetrate the cell deep enough to allow direct delivery of cargos into the nucleus, but still allow for cell recovery after treatment. We show the device's ability to deliver cargo to a variety of cell types while maintaining high viability. Then, we demonstrate the rapid onset of plasmid DNA expression that results from direct nuclear delivery of naked DNA, showing expression speeds comparable to microinjection, but with significantly greater throughput. We envision the use of this device as a tool to quickly produce high quantities of genetically engineered cells to treat a myriad of diseases.</description>

      <title>Mean-field analysis of a neural network with stochastic STDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysing biological spiking neural network models with synaptic plasticity has proven to be challenging both theoretically and numerically. In a network with N all-to-all connected neurons, the number of synaptic connections is on the order of $N^2$, making these models computationally demanding. Furthermore, the intricate coupling between neuron and synapse dynamics, along with the heterogeneity generated by plasticity, hinder the use of classic theoretical tools such as mean-field or slow-fast analyses. To address these challenges, we introduce a new variable which we term a typical neuron X. Viewed as a post-synaptic neuron, X is composed of the activity state V , the time since its last spike S, and the empirical distribution $\xi$ of the triplet V , S and W (incoming weight) associated to the pre-synaptic neurons. In particular, we study a stochastic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) model of connection in a probabilistic Wilson-Cowan spiking neural network model, which features binary neural activity. Taking the large N limit, we obtain from the empirical distribution of the typical neuron a simplified yet accurate representation of the original spiking network. This mean-field limit is a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) of McKean-Vlasov type, where the typical neuron dynamics depends on its own distribution. We term this analysis McKean-Vlasov mean-field (MKV-MF). Our approach not only reduces computational complexity but also provides insights into the dynamics of this spiking neural network with plasticity. The model obtained is mathematically exact and capable of tracking transient changes. This analysis marks the first exploration of MKV-MF dynamics in a network of spiking neurons interacting with STDP.</description>

      <title>Elastic Energy Storage Mechanism in Hovering Animal Flight: A Discriminative Method Based on Wing Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing research has yet to reach a consensus on whether and how small flying animals utilize elastic energy storage mechanisms to reduce flight energy expenditure, and there is a lack of systematic and universal methods for assessment. To address these gaps, this study proposes a method to evaluate elastic energy storage capacity based on wing kinematic parameters (flapping amplitude and flapping frequency), grounded in the hypothesis that animals tend to minimize flight energy expenditure. By establishing a simplified power model, the study calculates the optimal kinematic parameters corresponding to the minimum mechanical power requirements under two extreme conditions: no elastic energy storage and complete elastic energy storage. These optimal parameters are then compared with measured data from various small flying animals. The results show that the measured parameters of hummingbirds, ladybugs, and rhinoceros beetles are close to the no-storage optimum, indicating relatively weak elastic energy storage capacity; whereas hoverflies, bumblebees, and honeybees align closely with the complete-storage optimum, suggesting strong elastic energy storage ability. Furthermore, the wing kinematic adjustment strategies these animals employ in response to changes in load or air density are consistent with the predicted elastic storage capacities. This study provides a systematic new approach for assessing biological elastic energy storage capacity and offers a theoretical basis for the low-power design of flapping wing micro air vehicles.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Probing of New Biomarkers for Rapid Sickle Cell Disease Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sickle cell disease (SCD) remains a critical global health issue, with high child mortality in low-resource regions. Early screening and diagnosis is essential for improving health outcomes, but conventional screening methods are unsuitable for widespread use due to the high costs of laboratory equipment. There is an urgent need for portable, cost-effective, and user-friendly point-of-care tools that can quickly assess blood health. Here, we explore two new biomarkers enabled by acoustic probing for rapid SCD screening: cell membrane stability from measuring red blood cell (RBC) lysis temperature in whole blood, and plasma protein concentration from measuring relative protein precipitation in blood plasma. Both biomarkers effectively differentiate healthy HbAA samples from pre-/no transfusion HbSS samples with high accuracy. Additionally, the RBC lysis biomarker can distinguish post-transfusion exchange HbSS samples with a lower percentage of sickled cells, indicating the potential to initially screen for milder forms of SCD as well as sickle cell trait.</description>

      <title>Surface Acoustic Wave Hemolysis Assay for Evaluating Stored Red Blood Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blood transfusion remains a cornerstone of modern medicine, saving countless lives daily. Yet the quality of transfused blood varies dramatically among donors-a critical factor often overlooked in clinical practice. Rapid, benchtop, and cost-effective methods for evaluating stored red blood cells (RBCs) at the site of transfusion are lacking, with concerns persisting about the association between metabolic signatures of stored RBC quality and transfusion outcomes. Recent studies utilizing metabolomics approaches to evaluate stored erythrocytes find that donor biology (e.g., genetics, age, lifestyle factors) underlies the heterogeneity associated with blood storage and transfusion. The appreciation of donor-intrinsic factors provides opportunities for precision transfusion medicine approaches for the evaluation of storage quality and prediction of transfusion efficacy. Here we propose a new platform, the Surface Acoustic Wave Hemolysis Assay (SAW-HA), for on-site evaluation of stored RBCs utilizing SAW Hemolysis Temperature (SAWHT) as a marker for RBC quality. We report SAWHT as a mechanism-dependent reproducible methodology for evaluating stored human RBCs up to 42 days. Our results define unique signatures for SAW hemolysis and metabolic profiles in RBCs from two of the six donors in which high body mass index (BMI) and RBC triglycerides associated with increased susceptibility to hemolysis. Metabolic age of the stored RBCs - a recently appreciated predictor of post-transfusion efficacy-reveal that RBCs from the two low SAWHT units were characterized by disrupted redox control, deficient tryptophan metabolism, and high BMI. Together, these findings indicate the potential of the SAW-HA as a point-of-care analysis for transfusion medicine.</description>

      <title>Ohta-Kawasaki Model Reveals Patterns on Multicomponent Vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new mechanochemical modeling framework to explore the shape deformation and pattern formation in multicomponent vesicle membranes. In this framework, the shape of the membrane is described by an elastic bending model, while phase separation of membrane-bound activator proteins is determined by an Ohta-Kawasaki (OK) model. The coupled dynamics consist of an overdamped force-balanced equation for the membrane geometry and an OK-type advection-reaction-diffusion equation on the deformable membrane. We implement efficient spectral methods to simulate these dynamics in both two- and three-dimensions. Numerical experiments show that the model successfully reproduces a wide range of experimentally observed membrane morphologies \cite{baumgart2003imaging}. Taken together, the framework unifies curvature mechanics, microphase separation, and active forcing, providing new insight into membrane-bounded multicomponent vesicle dynamics and a practical platform for studying multicomponent biomembrane morphology.</description>

      <title>Theory of Reversed Ripening in Active Phase Separating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ripening dynamics in passive systems is governed by the theory of Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW). Here, we present an analog theory for reversed ripening in active systems. To derive the dynamic theory for the droplet size distribution, we consider a minimal ternary emulsion with one active reaction, leading to one conserved quantity. Even for cases where single droplets constantly grow, coupling many droplets via the conserved density in the far field leads to a self-organized reversal of ripening and, thus, a monodisperse emulsion. For late times, we find a scaling ansatz leading to the collapse of the rescaled size distributions, different from the LSW theory. This scaling behavior arises from a stable fixed point in the single droplet dynamics and may capture the late-time behavior of many active matter systems exhibiting reversed ripening.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber affects the lift of ray-inspired fins near a substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rays and skates tend to have different fin kinematics depending on their proximity to a ground plane such as the seafloor. Near the ground, rays tend to be more undulatory (high wavenumber), while far from the ground, rays tend to be more oscillatory (low wavenumber). It is unknown whether these differences are driven by hydrodynamics or other biological pressures. Here we show that near the ground, the time-averaged lift on a ray-like fin is highly dependent on wavenumber. We support our claims using a ray-inspired robotic rig that can produce oscillatory and undulatory motions on the same fin. Potential flow simulations reveal that lift is always negative because quasisteady forces overcome wake-induced forces. Three-dimensional flow measurements demonstrate that oscillatory wakes are more disrupted by the ground than undulatory wakes. All these effects lead to a suction force toward the ground that is stronger and more destabilizing for oscillatory fins than undulatory fins. Our results suggest that wavenumber plays a role in the near-ground dynamics of ray-like fins, particularly in terms of dorsoventral accelerations. The fact that lower wavenumber is linked with stronger suction forces offers a new way to interpret the depth-dependent kinematics of rays and ray-inspired robots.</description>
