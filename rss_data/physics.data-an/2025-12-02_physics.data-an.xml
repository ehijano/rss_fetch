      <title>Coincidence Algebra Bundle for Decay Quivers: An Algebraic Approach to Gamma-ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for a more comprehensive algebraic structure to calculate coincidence probabilities of a general decay scheme for gamma ray spectroscopy, we model the decay scheme, rather naturally, as a quiver through which we define a decay quiver. The path algebra of quivers is the underlying, more general, algebra for transition matrices that is typically used in modeling decay schemes. The path algebra allows for concatenation of transitions which affords the calculation of cascade probabilities. We extend the path algebra to allow for the multiplication of non-composable paths, i.e., transition that don't directly share a level connecting them. We define the coincidence algebra as the algebra that allows for such an extension and realize it as the fibres for a coincidence algebra bundle, the base space of which is the path algebra where decay schemes live. A given decay schemes coincidence probabilities are calculated on its fibre. \textit{Detection maps} are defined as linear maps on the base space that map transition probabilities to detected probabilities.</description>

      <title>Analysis framework for higher-order temporal correlations with applications to human heartbeats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a time series analysis framework focused on higher-order temporal correlations in the event sequence beyond the interevent time distribution by employing the burst-tree decomposition method. Bursts are clustered events that rapidly occur within shorter time periods, and they are separated by relatively longer inactive periods. The burst-tree decomposition method exactly maps the event sequence onto a tree, called a burst tree, in which each internal node represents a merge of consecutive bursts at the timescale separating those bursts. The burst tree fully reveals the hierarchical structure of bursts, hence the higher-order temporal correlations for the entire range of timescales. Those correlations are quantified using novel and existing measures derived from the burst tree, such as the burst complexity, memory coefficient for bursts, and principal and secondary cross sections of the burst-merging kernel. We apply our framework to the heartbeat time series of healthy people and of those with heart disease to reveal distinct multiscale temporal properties in physiological time series.</description>

      <title>Why Is Attention Sparse In Particle Transformer?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in jet tagging at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with the Particle Transformer (ParT) representing a leading example of such models. A striking feature of ParT is its sparse, nearly binary, attention structure, raising questions about the origin of this behavior and whether it encodes physically meaningful correlations. In this work, we investigate the source of ParT's sparse attention by comparing models trained on multiple benchmark datasets and examine the relative contributions of the attention term and the physics-inspired interaction matrix before softmax. We find that binary sparsity arises primarily from the attention mechanism itself, with the interaction matrix playing a secondary role. Moreove, we show that ParT is able to identify key jet substructure elements, such as leptons in semileptonic top decays, even without explicit particle identification inputs. These results provide new insight into the interpretability of transformer-based jet taggers and clarify the conditions under which sparse attention patterns emerge in ParT.</description>

      <title>Early-Warning Signals of Political Risk in Stablecoin Markets: Human and Algorithmic Behavior Around the 2024 U.S. Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the 2024 U.S. presidential election, viewed as a major political risk event, affected cryptocurrency markets by distinguishing human-driven peer-to-peer stablecoin transactions from automated algorithmic activity. Using structural break analysis, we find that human-driven Ethereum Request for Comment 20 (ERC-20) transactions shifted on November 3, two days before the election, while exchange trading volumes reacted only on Election Day. Automated smart-contract activity adjusted much later, with structural breaks appearing in January 2025. We validate these shifts using surrogate-based robustness tests. Complementary energy-spectrum analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum identifies pronounced post-election turbulence, and a structural vector autoregression confirms a regime shift in stablecoin dynamics. Overall, human-driven stablecoin flows act as early-warning indicators of political stress, preceding both exchange behavior and algorithmic responses.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Based Method for Goodness-of-Fit Test in Amplitude Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \textbf{Purpose:} Amplitude analysis is a pivotal tool in hadron spectroscopy, fundamentally involving a series of likelihood fits to multi-dimensional experimental distributions. While robust goodness-of-fit tests exist for low-dimensional scenarios, evaluating goodness-of-fit in amplitude analysis remains challenging.
  \textbf{Methods:} We propose a machine-learning approach using anomaly detection for goodness-of-fit assessment in amplitude analysis. Our method employs a classifier to identify discrepancies between data and fit results in multi-dimensional phase space.
  \textbf{Results and Conclusion:} Using Monte Carlo simulations of $J/\psi\to\gamma \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0\pi^0$ decays, we demonstrate that this method detects contributions from an additional resonance with a signal strength of 1\%. The detection power is sufficient for practical amplitude analyses, where contributions with fit fractions larger than 1\% are typically included in the nominal fit. This approach shows promise for amplitude analyses of multi-body processes.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Underlying Analytic Structure Within Standard Model Constants Using Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for uncovering hidden analytic relationships among the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model (SM), a foundational theory in physics that describes the fundamental particles and their interactions, using symbolic regression and genetic programming. Using this approach, we identify the simplest analytic relationships connecting pairs of these constants and report several notable expressions obtained with relative precision better than 1%. These results may serve as valuable inputs for model builders and artificial intelligence methods aimed at uncovering hidden patterns among the SM constants, or potentially used as building blocks for a deeper underlying law that connects all parameters of the SM through a small set of fundamental constants.</description>

      <title>Global-to-local image quality assessment in optical microscopy via fast and robust deep learning predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal domain. To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers, the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.</description>

      <title>A synchronization-free one-way ranging observable for detecting and characterizing coherent orbital-period systematics in GRACE-FO laser ranging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a synchronization-free differential observable for one-way inter-satellite laser ranging, designed to suppress first-order Doppler effects without requiring clock synchronization between spacecraft. The observable is constructed from successive pulse-interval differences, which isolate time-varying signatures while eliminating static and slowly varying biases. Applied to GRACE-FO Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) Level-1B data over four seasonal epochs in 2019, the method reveals a stable, spectrally narrow modulation at the orbital frequency. The amplitude and phase of the detected signature remain consistent across all datasets, demonstrating a deterministic, mission-internal origin. The detection is independently confirmed through synthetic-signal injection, shuffle-based significance testing, and cross-comparison with K-band ranging data. These results show that the proposed observable provides a sensitive diagnostic for identifying coherent orbital-period systematics that may remain hidden in conventional range-rate analysis. The method offers a pathway toward improved characterization of instrument and dynamical effects in current and future satellite gravity missions.</description>
