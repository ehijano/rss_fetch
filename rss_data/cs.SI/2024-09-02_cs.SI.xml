      <title>Longitudinal Modularity, a Modularity for Link Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal networks are commonly used to model real-life phenomena. When these phenomena represent interactions and are captured at a fine-grained temporal resolution, they are modeled as link streams. Community detection is an essential network analysis task. Although many methods exist for static networks, and some methods have been developed for temporal networks represented as sequences of snapshots, few works can handle link streams. This article introduces the first adaptation of the well-known Modularity quality function to link streams. Unlike existing methods, it is independent of the time scale of analysis. After introducing the quality function, and its relation to existing static and dynamic definitions of Modularity, we show experimentally its relevance for dynamic community evaluation.</description>

      <title>Network Inference in Public Administration: Questions, Challenges, and Models of Causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Descriptive and inferential social network analysis has become common in public administration studies of network governance and management. A large literature has developed in two broad categories: antecedents of network structure, and network effects and outcomes. A new topic is emerging on network interventions that applies knowledge of network formation and effects to actively intervene in the social context of interaction. Yet, the question remains how might scholars deploy and determine the impact of network interventions. Inferential network analysis has primarily focused on statistical simulations of network distributions to produce probability estimates on parameters of interest in observed networks, e.g. ERGMs. There is less attention to design elements for causal inference in the network context, such as experimental interventions, randomization, control and comparison networks, and spillovers. We advance a number of important questions for network research, examine important inferential challenges and other issues related to inference in networks, and focus on a set of possible network inference models. We categorize models of network inference into (i) observational studies of networks, using descriptive and stochastic methods that lack intervention, randomization, or comparison networks; (ii) simulation studies that leverage computational resources for generating inference; (iii) natural network experiments, with unintentional network-based interventions; (iv) network field experiments, with designed interventions accompanied by comparison networks; and (v) laboratory experiments that design and implement randomization to treatment and control networks. The article offers a guide to network researchers interested in questions, challenges, and models of inference for network analysis in public administration.</description>

      <title>Service-Oriented AoI Modeling and Analysis for Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve truly seamless global intelligent connectivity, non-terrestrial networks (NTN) mainly composed of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and drones are recognized as important components of the future 6G network architecture. Meanwhile, the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the proliferation of numerous applications with stringent requirements for timely information delivery. The Age of Information (AoI), a critical performance metric for assessing the freshness of data in information update systems, has gained significant importance in this context. However, existing modeling and analysis work on AoI mainly focuses on terrestrial networks, and the distribution characteristics of ground nodes and the high dynamics of satellites have not been fully considered, which poses challenges for more accurate evaluation. Against this background, we model the ground nodes as a hybrid distribution of Poisson point process (PPP) and Poisson cluster process (PCP) to capture the impact of ground node distribution on the AoI of status update packet transmission supported by UAVs and satellites in NTN, and the visibility and cross-traffic characteristics of satellites are additionally considered. We derived the average AoI for the system in these two different situations and examined the impact of various network parameters on AoI performance.</description>

      <title>How Many Lines to Paint the City: Exact Edge-Cover in Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logistics and transportation networks require a large amount of resources to realize necessary connections between locations and minimizing these resources is a vital aspect of planning research. Since such networks have dynamic connections that are only available at specific times, intricate models are needed to portray them accurately. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the number of resources needed to realize a dynamic network, using the temporal graphs model. In a temporal graph, edges appear at specific points in time. Given a temporal graph and a natural number k, we ask whether we can cover every temporal edge exactly once using at most k temporal journeys; in a temporal journey consecutive edges have to adhere to the order of time. We conduct a thorough investigation of the complexity of the problem with respect to four dimensions: (a) whether the type of the temporal journey is a walk, a trail, or a path; (b) whether the chronological order of edges in the journey is strict or non-strict; (c) whether the temporal graph is directed or undirected; (d) whether the start and end points of each journey are given or not. We almost completely resolve the complexity of all these problems and provide dichotomies for each one of them with respect to k.</description>

      <title>Academic Freedom and International Research Collaboration: A Longitudinal Analysis of Global Network Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topic of academic freedom has come to the fore as nations around the world experience a wave of democratic backsliding. Institutions of higher education are often targets of autocrats who seek to suppress intellectual sources of social and political resistance. At the same time, international collaboration in scientific research continues unabated, and the network of global science grows larger and denser every year. This research analyzes the effects of academic freedom on international research collaboration (IRC) in a sample of 166 countries. Global international collaboration data are drawn from articles in Web of Science across a 30-year time frame (1993-2022) and are used to construct three separate IRC networks in science and technology (S&amp;T), social sciences (SocSci), and arts and humanities (A&amp;H). The Academic Freedom Index, covering the same time frame, is drawn from the Varieties of Democracy Project, as are numerous country-level control variables. Stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOM) are used to analyze the networks. The results show positive significant estimates for both direct effects and homophily effects of academic freedom on network evolution. These effects appear to increase in strength moving from the S&amp;T network, to the SocSci network, and appear strongest in the A\&amp;H network. However, tests of temporal heterogeneity show a significant decline in the relevance of academic freedom in the most recent period.</description>

      <title>IC always bad? : Information Cocooning as a Group Emotional Stabilization Role in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research aims to investigate the effects of information cocooning on group mood changes caused by information spreading. The simulation of the realistic network evolution process is realized at the structural level by building a network evolution model based on individual viewpoints. Abstracting the accuracy of the real intelligent recommendation process by setting RA (Recommended Accuracy). By analyzing the information cocoon effect due to the recommendation in the comment section, we provide the structural basis of spreading for the dynamics model. A dynamics model of emotion spreading is developed to explore the trend of individual emotion spreading and to quantify the change of group emotion. Through experiments and analysis, this paper concludes that the information cocoon has a positive effect on the stability of group emotions, and that the H-CAC (Hidden Comment Area Cocoon) structure exists widely in real online social networks, and can produce a protective "harbor" effect in the competition of public opinion and cognitive games. The validity of the model is verified by comparison with real cases and generalization ability experiments. This work provides a multi-perspective analysis and visualization, providing more quantitative results. The research is expected to provide new perspectives and tools for understanding the reality of information cocooning and expanding the scenarios of its use.</description>

      <title>Towards Graph Prompt Learning: A Survey and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale "pre-train and prompt learning" paradigms have demonstrated remarkable adaptability, enabling broad applications across diverse domains such as question answering, image recognition, and multimodal retrieval. This approach fully leverages the potential of large-scale pre-trained models, reducing downstream data requirements and computational costs while enhancing model applicability across various tasks. Graphs, as versatile data structures that capture relationships between entities, play pivotal roles in fields such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and biological graphs. Despite the success of pre-train and prompt learning paradigms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), their application in graph domains remains nascent. In graph-structured data, not only do the node and edge features often have disparate distributions, but the topological structures also differ significantly. This diversity in graph data can lead to incompatible patterns or gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning on downstream graphs. We aim to bridge this gap by summarizing methods for alleviating these disparities. This includes exploring prompt design methodologies, comparing related techniques, assessing application scenarios and datasets, and identifying unresolved problems and challenges. This survey categorizes over 100 relevant works in this field, summarizing general design principles and the latest applications, including text-attributed graphs, molecules, proteins, and recommendation systems. Through this extensive review, we provide a foundational understanding of graph prompt learning, aiming to impact not only the graph mining community but also the broader Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) community.</description>
