      <title>Jammed disks of two sizes in a channel: segregation driven by steric forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disks of two sizes are confined to a long and narrow channel. The axis and the plane of the channel are horizontal. The channel is closed off by pistons that freeze jammed microstates out of loose disk configurations, agitated randomly at calibrated intensity and subject to moderate pressure. Disk sizes and channel width are such that under jamming no disks remain loose and all disks touch one wall. The protocol permits disks to move past each other prior to jamming, which facilitates randomness in the sequence of large and small disks. We present exact results for the characterization of jammed macrostates including volume and entropy for given fractions of small and large disks as functions of energy parameters which depend on the jamming protocol. Our analysis divides the disk sequence of jammed microstates into overlapping tiles out of which we construct 17 species of statistically interacting quasiparticles. Jammed macrostates then depend on the fractions of small and large disks and on a dimensionless control parameter inferred from measures for expansion work against the pistons and intensity of random agitations. Two models are introduced for comparison of key technical aspects: one model emphasizes symmetry and the other mechanical stability. We distinguish regimes for the energy parameters that either enhance or suppress mixing of disk sizes in jammed macrostates. The latter case, if realizable, is a manifestation of grain segregation driven by steric forces alone, without directional bias.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the compression behavior of polystyrene microbeads in a diamond anvil cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pressure dependence of the bulk modulus of glassy polystyrene (PS) was measured in the relatively high-pressure regime, up to 6 GPa, at ambient temperature. For the measurements, PS microbeads were immersed in a pressure medium consisting of a mixture of methanol and ethanol, and the sample was placed in a diamond anvil cell capable of generating high and hydrostatic pressure. The volume change of the PS beads was observed under an optical microscope. The results demonstrated that the volume change in this study is consistent with an equation of state determined from the earlier studies in the low-pressure range up to 0.2 GPa. The bulk modulus was obtained as the derivative of the microbead volume with respect to pressure, and compared with the earlier data obtained from Brillouin spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>On void formation during the simulated tensile testing of polymer-filler particle composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate a series of model polymer composites, composed of linear polymer strands and spherical, monodisperse filler particles (FP). These molecular dynamics simulations implement a coarse-grained, bead-spring force field and we vary several formulation parameters to study their respective influences on material properties. These parameters include FP radius, FP volume fraction, temperature, and the polymer-polymer, FP-FP, and polymer-FP interaction potentials. Uniaxial extension of the simulation cells allows direct comparison of mechanical reinforcement (or weakening) provided by the FP. We focus on the formation of microscopic voids during simulated tensile testing of glassy polymer composites and quantify how the characteristic spatial and morphological arrangement of these voids is a function of interaction potentials used in the simulation. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of polymer composite design and formulation.</description>

      <title>Dissipative response of driven bead-spring-dashpot chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work dissipated in pulling a polymer chain with internal friction is numerically calculated by considering a sequence of $N$ bead-spring-dashpots tethered at one end and being pulled at the other using a harmonic trap via linear and symmetric protocols. The variation of the dissipation with the chain length, pulling trap stiffness, and the internal friction parameter are examined in detail for both the protocols. In the limit of high trap stiffness: (i) the dissipation $decreases$ with $N$ for chains with internal friction, keeping all other parameters constant, and (ii) the relationship between the dissipation and internal friction parameter deviates from linearity as $N$ is increased. Consequently, a closed-form expression between the dissipated work in driving a chain of spring-dashpots and the damping coefficient of a single dashpot can be written only for the case of $N = 1$ [as shown in Phys. Rev. Res. $\mathbf{2}$, 013331 (2020)] and not for the general case of $N &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Design and optimization of in situ self-functionalizing stress sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical forces are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their in vivo measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel class of biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to measure mechanical stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the perfect balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied on the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, overcoming current technical barriers in biophysical measurements.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and structural properties of an absorbing phase transition: a case study from granular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical and structural properties of absorbing phase transitions (APTs) within granular systems. Specifically, we examine a model for vibrofluidized systems of spherical grains, which transition from a state of pure vertical motion to a horizontal diffusive state upon increased density. Depending on the details of the system, we observe both continuous and discontinuous transitions in numerical simulations. We explain this using a theoretical analysis based on kinetic theory applied to a coarse-grained model, which elucidates the role of a synchronization effect in determining the nature of the transition. A fluctuating hydrodynamic theory, which quantitatively describes the structural and dynamical properties of the active state such as hyperuniformity is derived from the microscopic dynamics, together with an equilibrium-like assumption concerning the noises on the hydrodynamic fields. This work expands on previous studies by providing a comprehensive examination of the APT characteristics and proposing new theoretical models to interpret the observed behaviors.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive MARTINI Coarse-Grained Framework for Phyllosilicate Clay/Polymer Nanocomposites: From Atomistic Validation to Mesoscale Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phyllosilicate clays have diverse applications in packaging industries and are found highly suitable for formulation, including thermoplastic starch (TPS), polyethylene (PE), or their combination. We developed CG MARTINI-3 parameters of the pyrophyllite using Lifshitz theory and experimental surface tension data. These initial bead assignments of pyrophyllite and periodic tetramethylammonium-montmorillonite (TMA-MMT) sheet were fine-tuned using optimal reproduction of structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties obtained via all-atom (AA) simulation of TPS with a periodic pyrophyllite sheet. These developed models predicted the correct AA radial distribution function and two-body excess entropy for polymer-sorbitol pairs, showcasing the robustness of the developed CG model in predicting the properties not used in parameterization. These composite simulations revealed acceleration (for pyrophyllite) or retardation (for TMA-MMT) of khun segment dynamics (compared to melt) with the depletion of polymer near the surface. The developed CG parameters were used to investigate the long-time behavior of TPS-polyethylene (PE) melt and their Cloisite-15A-based composite systems. The coordination number indicated compatibilization of the TPS-PE phase, achieved by binding TPS through its bare polar surface and PE via alkyl-mediated interactions, which consequently reduced the TPS-PE interfacial surface tension from 45 mN/m to 13.06 mN/m. Additionally, high TPS-clay coordination, sustained localization of clay at the TPS-PE interface, and clay aggregation observed in CG simulation closely agree with experimental observations. Further, the CG model effectively captured the clay-mediated variation in the overall morphology of the TPS-PE system and their direct impact on chain conformational properties, making this CG model highly suitable for a material design perspective.</description>

      <title>Bridging Machine Learning and Glassy Dynamics Theory for Predictive Polymer Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain fundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing relaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal mapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed thermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or newly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that integrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a simplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient to overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively accurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers. Rather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it by trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability in high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data. Moreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal mapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our results establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy polymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Evaluating non-equilibrium trajectories via mean back relaxation: Dependence on length and time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean back relaxation (MBR) relates the value of a stochastic process at three different time points. It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In this manuscript, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.</description>

      <title>Sliding of a liquid spherical drop in an external fluid: a generalization of the Hadamard-Rybczynski equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical solution is obtained for the problem of the slow movement of a small drop of liquid in another immiscible liquid in an infinitely large reservoir with the boundary condition of partial slip at the liquid-liquid interface. That generalizes the conventional Navier condition of partial slip that given at the liquid-solid interface, since the solid (rigid) state can be considered as a liquid with infinite viscosity. A generalized Hadamard-Rybczynski equation (HRE) is obtained. If slip length {\lambda}=0 that equation transforms into the conventional HRE. For infinite viscosity of the droplet, generalized HRE becomes a well-known relation generalizing the Stokes drag force for a solid sphere, taking into account the boundary condition of partial slip. At certain {\lambda}, we arrive at a model with continuity of the all components of the viscous stress tensor at the interface of two fluids, including diagonal tensor components. Generalized HRE is applied to the interpretation of the experiment in which the velocity of falling of a spherical droplet of silicate oil in the castor oil is investigated. Streamlines have been built corresponding to both the Hadamard-Rybczynski model and the partial slip approach. Presumably, the best applicability of the generalized HRE should be expected for the interface of hydrophobic liquid and hydrophilic one (water - hydrocarbons, water - higher alcohols, in general: aqueous emulsions, water - lipophilic organic liquids and oils, etc.). These are quite important emulsions in practical terms, for example, for the oil industry and medicine. Experimental methods for determining the slip length are discussed.</description>

      <title>Liquid-Gas Criticality of Hyperuniform Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In statistical physics, a well-accepted knowledge is that liquid-gas (LG) phase transition with diverging critical fluctuations lies in the universality class of Ising model. Yet, whether non-equilibrium effect alone can alter this conclusion remains an open question. Here, we study the LG criticality of a hyperuniform (HU) fluid composed of active spinners, where phase separation is induced by dissipative collisions. Strikingly, at the LG critical point, the HU fluid exhibits normal Gaussian density fluctuations instead of the diverging fluctuations. Through hydrodynamic field theory and renormalization-group analysis, we demonstrate that hyperuniformity reduces the upper critical dimension from d_c = 4 (classical fluids) to d_c = 2 due to an emerging long-range correlation induced by center-of-mass conservation. Large-scale stochastic field simulations confirm this dimensional reduction, and reveal diverging response function along with anomalous zero-range correlation function at the critical point, indicating the absence of an effective fluctuation-dissipation relationship in the system. The simulation also identifies anomalous finite-size scaling in density fluctuation, energy fluctuation, and Binder cumulant. Furthermore, HU fluid also exihibits non-classical spinodal decomposition dynamics with diverging decomposition time but non-diverging decomposition length scale. Our results provide an exception to the classical paradigms of LG critical phenomena and highlight how non-equilibrium effect can reshape universality classes of classical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>New universality classes govern the critical and multicritical behavior of an active Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ising model is one of the most well known models in statistical physics, with its critical behavior governed by the Wilson-Fisher universality class (UC). When active motility is incorporated into the Ising model by, e.g., dictating that the spins' directional movements follow their orientations, the spin number density necessarily constitutes a soft mode in the hydrodynamic description, and can therefore modify the scaling behavior of the system. Here, we show that this is indeed the case in a critical active Ising model in which density can impede the system's collective motion. Specifically, we use a perturbative dynamic renormalization group method to the one-loop level to uncover three new UCs, one of which supersedes the Wilson-Fisher UC to become the generic UC that governs the critical behavior of the active Ising model.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility in scalar active turbulence: The role of topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.</description>

      <title>A kinetic model to simulate charge flow through an electrochemical half cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A kinetic model of the electron transfer at the electrode / electrolyte solution interface is developed, implemented in a Monte Carlo framework, and applied to simulate this process in idealised systems consisting of the primitive model of electrolyte solutions limited by an impenetrable conducting surface. In the present implementation, a charged, spherical interface surrounding an equally spherical sample of electrolyte solution is introduced to model a single-electrode system, providing the computational analog to the conceptual half-cell picture that is widely used in electrochemistry. The electron transfer itself is described as a simple surface hopping process underlying a first order reaction corresponding to one of the coupled M/M$^+$ and X$^-$/X half reactions. Then, the electron transfer at the interface is combined with the self-diffusion of ions in the electrolyte solutions whose role is to supply reagents and disperse products, allowing the system to settle in a stationary non-equilibrium state. Simulations for the primitive model of electrolyte in contact with a charged impenetrable surface show that, after a brief transient, the samples sustain a steady current through the electrolyte solution. The results quantify the dependence of the current on: the overall charge of the electrode, the electrolyte concentration, the solvent viscosity and the kinetic parameter $k_e$ that represents the rate of the electron transfer for each ion in contact with the electrode. Since the simulated interface is very idealised, strategies to overcome the limitations of the present model are outlined and briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Morphology of Cellulose Nanocrystals via Controlled Aggregation</title>

Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated nanoparticles derived from natural cellulose, with potential applications ranging from rheological modifiers and emulsion stabilizers to photonic pigments and sensors. For most applications, precise control over CNC morphology and surface chemistry is essential, but the relationship between process parameters, CNC characteristics, and their resulting behavior is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of centrifugation and ionic strength on CNC morphology after dialysis using transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and scanning electron diffraction. We find that the centrifugation step commonly applied during CNC purification promotes the formation of compact composite nanoparticles made of aligned crystallites, referred to as 'bundles', that are associated preferentially along their hydrophobic faces. In stark contrast, transient exposure to high ionic strength leads to fractal-like, irregular composite nanoparticles. We then examine the consequence of these morphological differences on the cholesteric self-organization of the CNCs: aligned bundles reduce the cholesteric pitch in suspension, causing a blue-shift in the color of dish-cast photonic films, while misaligned particles promote gelation, producing colorless films. This study reveals the importance of sample history, in particular, the often-disregarded purification steps, on CNC characteristics and their ensemble behavior, thereby unlocking new routes for tailoring this promising nanomaterial.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium coexistence between a fluid and a hotter or colder crystal of granular hard disks</title>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium phase coexistence is commonly observed in both biological and artificial systems, yet understanding it remains a significant challenge. Unlike equilibrium systems, where free energy provides a unifying framework, the absence of such a quantity in non-equilibrium settings complicates their theoretical understanding. Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by energy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate these systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting dense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually attributed to greater dissipation in denser regions. In this article, we demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using a simple numerical granular model, we show that a hot solid and a cold liquid can coexist in granular systems. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision frequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent with equilibrium results for hard-disk systems. We further demonstrate that kinetic theory can be extended to accurately predict phase temperatures even at very high packing fractions, including within the solid phase.
  Our results highlight the importance of collisional dynamics and energy exchange in determining phase behavior in granular materials, offering new insights into non-equilibrium phase coexistence and the complex physics underlying granular systems.</description>

      <title>Forces and symmetry breaking of a living meso-swimmer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies and complex and periodically changing body shapes add extra challenges for accurate meso-swimming modelling. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia. We present a universal scaling law for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms with different body shapes, swimming strategies, and level of inertia at the mesoscale. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we discover that Artemia achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.</description>

      <title>Minimal mechanism for flocking in phoretically interacting active colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective motion as a flock is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. Finding possible mechanisms of attaining a global polar order via dynamical mechanisms - without any explicit alignment interaction - is an area of active current research. We report a novel flocking transition mechanism in a system of chemically interacting active colloidal particles sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities. The basic requirements to maintain the polar liquid flock are excluded volume repulsions and deterministic long-ranged net repulsive torques. The mechanism we report requires that the time scale individual colloids move a unit length to be dominant with respect to the time they deterministically sense chemicals. This can be equivalently interpreted as pair colloids sliding a minimal unit length before deterministically rotating due to chemical interactions. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. We complement these results with an analysis of a continuum hydrodynamic model, with the transition corresponding to destabilization of the flocking state. Finally, we present simulations for flocking in an agent-based model consisting of local update rules of colloidal pairs that slide and rotate upon collision.</description>

      <title>Only the Ambidextrous Can Flock: Two-dimensional Chiral Malthusian Flocks, Time Cholesterics, and the KPZ Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional chiral dry Malthusian flocks; that is, chiral polar-ordered active matter with neither number nor momentum conservation. In the absence of fluctuations, these form a ``time cholesteric", in which the velocity rotates uniformly in time at a fixed frequency. Fluctuations are described by the (2+1)-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which implies short-ranged orientational order. For weak chirality, the system is in the linear regime of the KPZ equation for a wide range of length scales, over which it exhibits quasi-long-ranged orientational order. Our predictions for velocity and density correlations are testable in both simulations and experiments.</description>

      <title>Particle-scale origin of quadrupolar non-affine displacement fields in granular solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we identify the local structural defects that control the non-affine displacement fields in jammed disk packings subjected to athermal, quasistatic (AQS) simple shear. While complex non-affine displacement fields typically occur during simple shear, isolated effective quadrupoles are also observed and their probability increases with increasing pressure. We show that the emergence of an isolated effective quadrupole requires the breaking of an interparticle contact that is aligned with low-frequency, spatially extended vibrational modes. Since the Eshelby inhomogeneity problem gives rise to quadrupolar displacement fields in continuum materials, we reformulate and implement Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method (EIM) for jammed disk packings. Using EIM, we show that we can reconstruct the non-affine displacement fields for jammed disk packings in response to applied shear as a sum of discrete Eshelby-like defects that are caused by mismatches in the local stiffnesses of triangles formed from Delaunay triangulation of the disk centers.</description>

      <title>Motion and hydrodynamic resistance of an elastic bead confined in a square microchannel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cells and other soft particles are often forced to flow in confined geometries in both laboratory and natural environments, where the elastic deformation induces an additional drag and pressure drop across the particle. In contrast with other multiphase flows, the physical parameters that determine this additional pressure are still not known. Here we start by measuring the pressure drop across a single spherical hydrogel particle as it flows in a microfluidic comparator. This pressure is found to depend on the amount of confinement, elastic modulus, fluid viscosity and velocity. A model for the force balance on the particle is then proposed, by incorporating the above ingredients and relying on simulations of bead geometry and lubrication flow considerations. The final model collapses the force measurements forces onto a single scaling law spanning several decades, while providing physical insights by recalling elements from classic multiphase flows and contact mechanics.</description>

      <title>Frustration, dynamics and catalysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The controlled dissipation of chemical potentials is the fundamental way cells make a living. Enzyme-mediated catalysis allows the various transformations to proceed at biologically relevant rates with remarkable precision and efficiency. Theory, experiments and computational studies coincide to show that local frustration is a useful concept to relate protein dynamics with catalytic power. Local frustration gives rise to the asperities of the energy landscapes that can harness the thermal fluctuations to guide the functional protein motions. We review here recent advances into these relationships from various fields of protein science. The biologically relevant dynamics is tuned by the evolution of protein sequences that modulate the local frustration patterns to near optimal values.</description>
