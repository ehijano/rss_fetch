      <title>Demonstration of an AI-driven workflow for dynamic x-ray spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for characterizing the chemical state and symmetry of individual elements within materials, but requires collecting data at many energy points which can be time-consuming. While adaptive sampling methods exist for efficiently collecting spectroscopic data, they often lack domain-specific knowledge about XANES spectra structure. Here we demonstrate a knowledge-injected Bayesian optimization approach for adaptive XANES data collection that incorporates understanding of spectral features like absorption edges and pre-edge peaks. We show this method accurately reconstructs the absorption edge of XANES spectra using only 15-20% of the measurement points typically needed for conventional sampling, while maintaining the ability to determine the x-ray energy of the sharp peak after absorption edge with errors less than 0.03 eV, the absorption edge with errors less than 0.1 eV; and overall root-mean-square errors less than 0.005 compared to compared to traditionally sampled spectra. Our experiments on battery materials and catalysts demonstrate the method's effectiveness for both static and dynamic XANES measurements, improving data collection efficiency and enabling better time resolution for tracking chemical changes. This approach advances the degree of automation in XANES experiments reducing the common errors of under- or over-sampling points in near the absorption edge and enabling dynamic experiments that require high temporal resolution or limited measurement time.</description>

      <title>Wide-angle Scanning Heterogeneous Element-Based Phased Array Using Novel Scanning Envelope Synthesis Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two novel methods, including the scanning envelope synthesis (SES) method and the active reflection self-cancellation (ARC) method, are proposed to design wide-angle scanning heterogeneous element phased arrays. Heterogeneous strategy is efficient to extend scanning range but quantitatively characterization of the effect is critically needed to guide design for achieving desired performance. The proposed SES method derives theoretically the relationship between scanning range and the 3dB-beamwidth of the pattern envelope of one phased array, which is linear superposition of active radiation pattern (AEP) magnitude of each element. Therefore, the contribution of each kind of heterogeneity can be quantitatively analyzed for further enhancing the scanning range. As we see, a high active reflection coefficient of the phased array can directly reduce the realized gain. In this way, one ARC method is proposed to reduce the active reflection coefficient by counteracting the reflection component of active reflection coefficient with its transmission component, thereby keeping the realized gain efficiently even when the array scans at large angels. For verification, one 24.5-29.5GHz 4x4 phased array scanning in E-plane is designed and fabricated. Benefiting from the proposed SES method, the scanning range of the prototype is extended up to $\pm74\deg$, around 10{\deg} improvement over one traditional heterogeneous array. Meanwhile, the active reflection coefficient is reduced from -4dB to lower than -7.5dB by applying the ARC method.</description>

      <title>Micro-Transfer Printed Continuous-Wave and Mode-Locked Laser Integration at 800 nm on a Silicon Nitride Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applications such as augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), optical atomic clocks, and quantum computing require photonic integration of (near-)visible laser sources to enable commercialization at scale. The heterogeneous integration of III-V optical gain materials with low-loss silicon nitride waveguides enables complex photonic circuits with low-noise lasers on a single chip. Previous such demonstrations are mostly geared towards telecommunication wavelengths. At shorter wavelengths, limited options exist for efficient light coupling between III-V and silicon nitride waveguides. Recent advances in wafer-bonded devices at these wavelengths require complex coupling structures and suffer from poor heat dissipation. Here, we overcome these challenges and demonstrate a wafer-scale micro-transfer printing method integrating functional III-V devices directly onto the silicon substrate of a commercial silicon nitride platform. We show butt-coupling of efficient GaAs-based amplifiers operating at 800 nm with integrated saturable absorbers to silicon nitride cavities. This resulted in extended-cavity continuous-wave and mode-locked lasers generating pulse trains with repetition rates ranging from 3.2 to 9.2 GHz and excellent passive stability with a fundamental radio-frequency linewidth of 519 Hz. These results show the potential to build complex, high-performance fully-integrated laser systems at 800 nm using scalable manufacturing, promising advances for AR/VR, nonlinear photonics, timekeeping, quantum computing, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Broadband Kinetic-Inductance Parametric Amplifiers with Impedance Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadband quantum-limited parametric amplifiers (PAs) are essential components in quantum information science and technology. Impedance-engineered resonator-based PAs and traveling-wave PAs are the primary approaches to overcome the gain-bandwidth constraint. While the former PAs are simpler to fabricate, the target characteristic impedance Z_\text{NR} of the nonlinear resonator has been restricted to be below 10 \Omega, requiring large capacitance. Moreover, these PAs have only been implemented with aluminum-based Josephson junctions (JJs), hindering their operation at high temperatures or strong magnetic fields. To address these issues, we propose a three-stage impedance-transformer scheme, showcased with a 20-nm-thick, 250-nm-wide high-kinetic-inductance niobium-titanium-nitride (NbTiN) film. Our scheme enables Z_\text{NR} up to several tens of ohms--a tenfold improvement over conventional designs, achieved through an additional quarter-wavelength transmission line with the characteristic impedance of 180 \Omega. Our kinetic-inductance impedance-engineered parametric amplifiers (KIMPA), featuring a 330-fF shunt capacitor, demonstrate a phase-preserving amplification with a 450-MHz bandwidth at 17-dB gain, and an added noise ranging from 0.5-1.3 quanta near the center frequency of 8.4 GHz. Due to the high critical current of the NbTiN nanowire, the KIMPA also achieves a saturation power of up to -68\pm3 dBm, approximately 30-dB higher than that of JJ-based PAs. This scheme also opens new possibilities for other three-wave-mixing building blocks.</description>

      <title>Quantum diamond microscopy of individual vaterite microspheres containing magnetite nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biocompatible vaterite microspheres, renowned for their porous structure, are promising carriers for magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery and diagnostic imaging. Precise control over the magnetic moment of individual microspheres is crucial for these applications. This study employs widefield quantum diamond microscopy to map the stray magnetic fields of individual vaterite microspheres (3-10 um) loaded with Fe3O4 MNPs of varying sizes (5 nm, 10 nm, and 20 nm). By analyzing over 35 microspheres under a 222 mT external magnetizing field, we measured peak-to-peak stray field amplitudes of 41 uT for 5 nm and 10 nm superparamagnetic MNPs, reflecting their comparable magnetic response, and 12 uT for 20 nm ferrimagnetic MNPs, due to distinct magnetization behavior. Finite-element simulations confirm variations in MNP distribution and magnetization uniformity within the vaterite matrix, with each microsphere encapsulating thousands of MNPs to generate its magnetization. This high-resolution magnetic imaging approach yields critical insights into MNP-loaded vaterite, enabling optimized synthesis and magnetically controlled systems for precision therapies and diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Surface morphology and thickness variation estimation of zeolites via electron ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zeolites, as representative porous materials, possess intricate three-dimensional frameworks that endow them with high surface areas and remarkable catalytic properties. There are a few factors that give a huge influence on the catalytic properties, including the size and connectivity of these three-dimensional channels and atomic level defects. In additional to that, the surface morphology and thickness variation of zeolites particles are essential to their catalytic performances as well. However, it is a significant challenge to characterize these macroscopic properties of zeolites using conventional techniques due to their sensitivity to electron beams. In this study, we introduce surface-adaptive electron ptychography, an advanced approach based on multi-slice electron ptychography, which enables high-precision reconstruction of both local atomic configurations and global structural features in zeolite nanoparticles. By adaptively optimizing probe defocus and slice thickness during the reconstruction process, SAEP successfully resolves surface morphology, thickness variations and atomic structure simultaneously. This integrated framework facilitates a direct and intuitive correlation between zeolite channel structures and particle thickness. Our findings open new pathways for large-scale, comprehensive structure property analysis of beam-sensitive porous materials, deepening the understanding of their catalytic behavior.</description>

      <title>A compact laser-plasma source for high-repetition-rate bi-modal X-ray and electron imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bright sources of high-energy X-rays and electrons are indispensable tools in advanced imaging. Yet, current laser-driven systems typically support only single-modality imaging, require complex infrastructure, or operate at low repetition rates. Here, we demonstrate a compact, table-top laser-plasma source capable of generating synchronized electron and X-ray pulses at 1 kHz using just 2 mJ per pulse. A structured methanol droplet target enables quasi-single-shot electron radiographs and broadband, energy-resolved X-ray images, facilitating bi-modal imaging of both metallic and biological specimens. We achieve resolutions of 13.6 um for electrons and 21 um for X-rays, and demonstrate tomographic reconstruction using 35 projections. This compact platform rivals large-scale petawatt systems in resolution and brightness, while remaining scalable and accessible for high-throughput imaging in materials science and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Modular Cosmic Ray Detector (MCORD) and its Potential Use in Various Physics Experiments, Astrophysics and Geophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of the collaboration building a set of detectors for the new collider, our group was tasked with designing and building a large-scale cosmic ray detector, which was to complement the capabilities of the MPD (Dubna) detec-tor set. The detector was planned as a trigger for cosmic ray particles and to be used to calibrate and test other systems. Additional functions were to be the detection of pairs of high-energy muons originating from some parti-cle decay processes generated during collisions and con-tinuous observation of the cosmic muon stream in order to detect multi muons events. From the very beginning, the detector was designed as a scalable and universal device for many applications. The following work will present the basic features and parameters of the Modular COsmic Ray Detector (MCORD) and examples of its possible use in high energy physics, astrophysics and geology. Thanks to its universal nature, MCORD can be potential used as a fast trigger, neutron veto detector, muon detector and as a tool in muon tomography.</description>

Abstract: We present in depth study of p-type doping concentration of mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) mercury cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe) thin films. Annealing time was changed under specific conditions to achieve a stable copper (Cu) doping concentration for HgCdTe thin films. Both MWIR and LWIR HgCdTe material were grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), where different trends were observed between LWIR and MWIR HgCdTe thin films by increasing anneal time. We also report the impact of different thickness (4 micron, 6 micron and 9 micron) along with annealing time on doping level of LWIR HgCdTe thin films.</description>

      <title>Optical to infrared mapping of vapor-to-liquid phase change dynamics using generative machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared thermography is a powerful tool for studying liquid-to-vapor phase change processes. However, its application has been limited in the study of vapor-to-liquid phase transitions due to the presence of complex liquid dynamics, multiple phases within the same field of view, and experimental difficulty. Here, we develop a calibration framework which is capable to studying one of the most complex two-phase heat transfer processes: dropwise condensation. The framework accounts for non-uniformities arising from dynamic two-phase interactions such as droplet nucleation, growth, coalescence, and departure, as well as substrate effects particularly observed on micro- and nanoengineered surfaces. This approach enables high-resolution temperature measurements with both spatial (12 $\mu$m) and temporal (5 ms) precision, leading to the discovery of local temperature phenomena unobservable using conventional approaches. These observed temperature variations are linked to droplet statistics, showing how different regions contribute to local condensation heat transfer. We extend the developed method to quantify local thermal parameters by fusing it with a generative machine learning model to map visual images into temperature fields. The model is informed of the physical parameter by incorporating vapor pressure embedding as the conditional parameter. This work represents a significant step toward simplifying local temperature measurements for vapor-to-liquid phase change phenomena by developing a methodology as well as a machine learning approach to map local thermal phenomena using only optical images as the input.</description>

      <title>Disaggregated Deep Learning via In-Physics Computing at Radio Frequency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern edge devices, such as cameras, drones, and Internet-of-Things nodes, rely on deep learning to enable a wide range of intelligent applications, including object recognition, environment perception, and autonomous navigation. However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations: disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.</description>

      <title>A three-axis Nanopositioner based on Near-Field Acoustic Levitation and Electromagnetic Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-field acoustic levitation (NFAL) enables nanometer-scale positioning resolution and bandwidth exceeding several hundred hertz specifically along the vertical (Z) direction, owing to its high acoustic stiffness and squeeze film damping. However, its application to horizontal (XY) positioning is limited by significantly lower acoustic stiffness and insufficient damping in horizontal directions, resulting in reduced resolution and bandwidth. Moreover, NFAL-based positioning systems typically lack multi-axis actuation capabilities due to challenges in generating multi-directional acoustic forces. This work presents a hybrid positioning approach that overcomes the mentioned limitations by integrating NFAL with electromagnetic actuation. A planar magnetic platform is acoustically levitated, while a coplanar current-carrying coil provides horizontal trapping stiffness more than three orders of magnitude higher than that achievable with acoustic forces alone. Additionally, the coil generates three-dimensional electromagnetic forces, enabling multi-axis positioning capability. Eddy currents induced in a thin copper sheet integrated with the coil enhance horizontal damping by 52 times. We experimentally demonstrate precise 3-axis linear motion with a root mean square (RMS) positioning resolution better than 20 nm along all axes. The system achieves an in-plane motion range of 1.42 mm with a bandwidth of 16 Hz and a Z-axis motion range of 40 micrometers with a positioning bandwidth of 171 Hz.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of state transfer in spin chains, with the aim of achieving perfect state transfer for quantum information processing applications. Previous research has mainly focused on manipulating inter-site couplings within spin chains; here, we investigate in detail the potential of modifying on-site energies to facilitate precise quantum information transfer. Our findings demonstrate that through targeted adjustments to the diagonal elements of the XY Hamiltonian and leveraging a genetic algorithm, quasi-perfect state transfer can be achieved with careful consideration of the system's spectral characteristics. This investigation into on-site energies offers an alternative approach for achieving high-fidelity state transfer, especially in cases where manipulation of inter-site couplings may be impractical. This study thus represents a significant advancement towards unlocking the diverse applications of spin chains within practical quantum information systems.</description>

Abstract: This study presents the design and simulation-based validation of a muon imaging system tailored for potential applications in industrial hydrotreatment units. The system is built around a two-panel plastic scintillator hodoscope, equipped with silicon photomultipliers and read-out via a CAEN FERS-A5202 acquisition system. The detector was calibrated using a stepwise ``staircase'' method and characterized under open-sky and controlled conditions. We conducted muon flux attenuation measurements to validate its response using variable lead shielding. We found agreement with simulations generated using the MEIGA framework and realistic cosmic ray spectra from the ARTI simulation chain. With the detector response validated, we modelled muon transmission through a realistic 3D representation of a hydrotreatment tower, incorporating internal variations in catalyst bed density. By reconstructing angular muon fluxes and computing relative attenuation maps, we demonstrated the system's capability to detect internal density contrasts. Simulation results indicate that 20~hours of exposure to vertical muon flux is sufficient to retrieve structural information. In comparison, inclined configurations (30$^\circ$ and 60$^\circ$ from vertical) require extended exposure times--up to 8~days--yet remain feasible within industrial monitoring schedules. These findings highlight the feasibility of muography as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for complex industrial infrastructure. The proposed system shows strong potential for real-time monitoring of catalyst bed integrity and long-term structural analysis in high-pressure chemical reactors.</description>
