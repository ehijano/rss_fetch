      <title>Acoustic angular sorting of resonant subwavelength particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest a dynamical mechanism for angular sorting of subwavelength particles in accord with their resonances and sizes, realised with the forces imposed by acoustic (ultrasound) waves with different wavelengths. We analyse how the acoustic force acting on a small particle depends on its size relative to the ultrasound wavelength, and how the detuning between the two different beams influences the size range and angular distribution for unambiguous sorting outcomes for a given size range. We predict a range of scenarios depending on the particular materials and provide several feasible examples and discuss their practical realisation.</description>

      <title>Torsional vibration of a coupled cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The torsion loading of a coupled cylinder, whose distinct upper and lower cylindrical sections may be composed of different materials, is considered. The bottom of the cylinder is fixed in place, and induces the cylinder vibration. The torsion is applied via an arbitrary loading on the upper face. Three forms of coupling condition between the upper and lower cylinders are outlined: ideal, soft (weak), and rigid (hard/ stiff) contact. The resulting displacements and tangential stresses are obtained using the finite Hankel transform, and a Green's function representation of the displacement. Numerical results are provided, and the impact of the differing coupling conditions investigated for a range of cylinder geometries, material properties and vibration rates. The resonance frequencies of the coupled cylinder are determined. A method for using the coupled cylinder model to approximate the displacement of a cylinder containing a damaged region via a weak interfacial layer is outlined. The properties of the weak interface layer needed for this approximation are determined, and the advantages of its use in non-destructive testing are discussed.</description>

      <title>Light propagation in magnetoelectric materials: The role of optical coefficients in refractive index modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigations into optical phenomena associated with nonlinear magnetoelectric effects are attracting growing attention within the scientific community. Technologies constantly demand new materials capable of exhibiting precise and controllable responses to external electromagnetic fields. In this context, the optics of such materials is of remarkable importance. Here, working in a lossless and non-dispersive regime, electromagnetic wave propagation in materials presenting linear and nonlinear optical coefficients is investigated. We expand the discussion of the roles of nonlinear coefficients by examining special cases in which the contribution of the magnetoelectric optical coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$, $\beta_{ijk}$, and $\gamma_{ijk}$ to birefringence and nonreciprocal phenomena is elucidated. Notably, expressions that directly connect the magnetoelectric coefficients to the refractive indices of the medium are fully derived. These expressions enable the direct measurement of all components of each nonlinear magnetoelectric coefficient, providing an advancement over previous works. This development bridges theoretical models with experimental applications, offering possibilities for the optical characterization of magnetoelectric effects.</description>

      <title>Numerical approach to second-order canonical perturbation theory in the planetary 3-body problem: Application to exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extrasolar planetary systems commonly exhibit planets on eccentric orbits, with many systems located near or within mean-motion resonances, showcasing a wide diversity of orbital architectures. Such complex systems challenge traditional secular theories, which are limited to first-order approximations in planetary masses or rely on expansions in orbital elements--eccentricities, inclinations, and semi-major axis ratios--that are subject to convergence issues, especially in highly eccentric, inclined, or tightly-packed systems. To overcome these limitations, we develop a numerical approach to second-order perturbation theory based on the Lie transform formalism. Our method avoids the need for expansions in orbital elements, ensuring broader applicability and more robust convergence. We first outline the Hamiltonian framework for the 3-body planetary problem, and apply a canonical transformation to eliminate fast angle dependencies, deriving the secular Hamiltonian up to second order in the mass ratio. We then use the fast Fourier transform algorithm to numerically simulate, in an accurate way, the long-term evolution of planetary systems near or away from mean-motion resonances. Finally, we validate our methods against well-known planetary configurations, such as the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system, as well as to exoplanetary systems like WASP-148, TIC 279401253 and GJ 876, demonstrating the applicability of our models across a wide range of planetary configurations.</description>
