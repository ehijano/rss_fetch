      <title>Hierarchical Three-Body Problem at High Eccentricities = Simple Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradual evolution of the restricted hierarchical three body problem is analyzed analytically, focusing on conditions of Kozai-Lidov Cycles that may lead to orbital flips from prograde to retrograde motion due to the octupole (third order) term which are associated with extremely high eccentricities. We revisit the approach described by Katz, Dong and Malhotra (\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.181101}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 181101 (2011)}) and show that for most initial conditions, to an excellent approximation, the analytic derivation can be greatly simplified and reduces to a simple pendulum model allowing an explicit flip criterion. The resulting flip criterion is much simpler than the previous one but the latter is still needed in a small fraction of phase space. We identify a logical error in the earlier derivation but clarify why it does not affect the final results.</description>

      <title>TOI 762 A b and TIC 46432937 b: Two Giant Planets Transiting M Dwarf Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of TOI 762 A b and TIC 46432937 b, two giant planets transiting M dwarf stars. Transits of both systems were first detected from observations by the NASA TESS mission, and the transiting objects are confirmed as planets through high-precision radial velocity (RV) observations carried out with VLT/ESPRESSO. TOI 762 A b is a warm sub-Saturn with a mass of 0.251 +- 0.042 M_J, a radius of 0.744 +- 0.017 R_J, and an orbital period of 3.4717 d. It transits a mid-M dwarf star with a mass of 0.442 +- 0.025 M_S and a radius of 0.4250 +- 0.0091 R_S. The star TOI 762 A has a resolved binary star companion TOI 762 B that is separated from TOI 762 A by 3.2" (~ 319 AU) and has an estimated mass of 0.227 +- 0.010 M_S. The planet TIC 46432937 b is a warm Super-Jupiter with a mass of 3.20 +- 0.11 M_J and radius of 1.188 +- 0.030 R_J. The planet's orbital period is P = 1.4404 d, and it undergoes grazing transits of its early M dwarf host star, which has a mass of 0.563 +- 0.029 M_S and a radius of 0.5299 +- 0.0091 R_S. TIC 46432937 b is one of the highest mass planets found to date transiting an M dwarf star. TIC 46432937 b is also a promising target for atmospheric observations, having the highest Transmission Spectroscopy Metric or Emission Spectroscopy Metric value of any known warm Super-Jupiter (mass greater than 3.0 M_J, equilibrium temperature below 1000 K).</description>

      <title>Chemistry in the GG Tau A Disk: Constraints from H2D+, N2H+, and DCO+ High Angular Resolution ALMA Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolved molecular line observations are essential for gaining insight into the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks, particularly in cold, dense regions where planets form and acquire compositions. However, tracing these regions is challenging because most molecules freeze onto grain surfaces and are not observable in the gas phase. We investigated cold molecular chemistry in the triple stellar T Tauri disk GG Tau A, which harbours a massive gas and dust ring and an outer disk, using ALMA Band 7 observations. We present high angular resolution maps of N2H+ and DCO+ emission, with upper limits reported for H2D+, 13CS, and SO2. The radial intensity profile of N2H+ shows most emission near the ring outer edge, while DCO+ exhibits double peaks, one near the ring inner edge and the other in the outer disk. With complementary observations of lower-lying transitions, we constrained the molecular surface densities and rotation temperatures. We compared the derived quantities with model predictions across different cosmic ray ionization (CRI) rates, carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios, and stellar UV fluxes. Cold molecular chemistry, affecting N2H+, DCO+, and H2D+ abundances, is most sensitive to CRI rates, while stellar UV flux and C/O ratios have minimal impact on these three ions. Our best model requires a low cosmic ray ionization rate of 1e-18 s-1. However, it fails to match the low temperatures derived from N2H+ and DCO+, 12 to 16 K, which are much lower than the CO freezing temperature.</description>

      <title>Viscous circumbinary protoplanetary discs -- I. Structure of the inner cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the most intriguing features, including spirals and cavities, in the current disc observations are found in binary systems like GG Tau, HD 142527 or HD 100453. Such features are evidence of the dynamic interaction between binary stars and the viscous disc. Understanding these dynamic interactions and how they result in the structure and growth of asymmetric circumbinary discs is a difficult problem, for which there is no complete analytical solution, that predicts the shape of the observed disc accurately. We use numeric simulation to evolve circumbinary discs with varying disc viscosities and investigate the size and shape of the inner cavities in such protoplanetary discs. We have simulated over 140 locally isothermal 2D grid-based disc models for &gt; 3e4 binary orbits each and mapped out the parameter space relevant for protoplanetary discs. With this, it becomes possible to create parametrised profiles for individual discs to compare to observation and find limits to their binary eccentricity or internal viscosity from the simulation data. In the long-term simulations larger cavity sizes than previously considered are possible within the parameter space (&lt; 6 binary separations). As an example, we find that the eccentricity of the disc around HD 142527 suggests the impact of the binary dynamics on the disc. However, even considering the larger cavity sizes, the large size of the cavity in HD 142527 remains unexplained by the simulations considering the most recent orbital constraints.</description>

      <title>Evidence for auroral influence on Jupiter's nitrogen and oxygen chemistry revealed by ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localized delivery of new long-lived species to Jupiter's stratosphere by comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1994 opened a window to constrain Jovian chemistry and dynamics by monitoring the evolution of their vertical and horizontal distributions. However, the spatial distributions of CO and HCN, two of these long-lived species, had never been jointly observed at high latitudinal resolution. Atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array observations of HCN and CO in March 2017 show that CO was meridionally uniform and restricted to pressures lower than 3 $\pm$ 1 mbar. HCN shared a similar vertical distribution in the low- to mid-latitudes, but was depleted at pressures between 2$^{+2}_ {-1}$ and 0.04$^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ mbar in the aurora and surrounding regions, resulting in a drop by two orders of magnitude in column density. We propose that heterogeneous chemistry bonds HCN on large aurora-produced aerosols at these pressures in the Jovian auroral regions causing the observed depletion.</description>

      <title>The deep oxygen abundance in Solar System Giant Planets, with a new derivation for Saturn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep elemental composition is a challenging measurement to achieve in the giant planets of the solar system. Yet, knowledge of the deep composition offers important insights in the internal structure of these planets, their evolutionary history and their formation scenarios. A key element whose deep abundance is difficult to obtain is oxygen, because of its propensity for being in condensed phases such as rocks and ices. In the atmospheres of the giant planets, oxygen is largely stored in water molecules that condense below the observable levels. At atmospheric levels that can be investigated with remote sensing, water abundance can modify the observed meteorology, and meteorological phenomena can distribute water through the atmosphere in complex ways that are not well understood and that encompass deeper portions of the atmosphere. The deep oxygen abundance provides constraints on the connection between atmosphere and interior and on the processes by which other elements were trapped, making its determination an important element to understand giant planets. In this paper, we review the current constraints on the deep oxygen abundance of the giant planets, as derived from observations and thermochemical models.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Criteria for Defining Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current IAU definition of "planet" is problematic because it is vague and excludes exoplanets. Here, we describe aspects of quantitative planetary taxonomy and examine the results of unsupervised clustering of Solar System bodies to guide the development of possible classification frameworks. Two unsurprising conclusions emerged from the clustering analysis: (1) satellites are distinct from planets and (2) dynamical dominance is a natural organizing principle for planetary taxonomy. To generalize an existing dynamical dominance criterion, we adopt a universal clearing timescale applicable to all central bodies (brown dwarfs, stars, and stellar remnants). Then, we propose two quantitative, unified frameworks to define both planets and exoplanets. The first framework is aligned with both the IAU definition of planet in the Solar System and the IAU working definition of an exoplanet. The second framework is a simpler mass-based framework that avoids some of the difficulties ingrained in current IAU recommendations.</description>

      <title>From traffic jams to roadblocks: The outer regions of TW Hya with ALMA Band 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of TW Hya at 0.65 mm with 0.5 arcsecond angular resolution, together with high angular resolution archival observations at 0.87 mm, 1.3 mm, 2.1 mm and 3.1 mm. We constrain the outer disk emission with both image-plane retrieval, and visibility-plane modeling with non-parametric and parametric fitting tools. Our results confirm emission in the outer disk regions of TW Hya (60 au &lt; R &lt; 110 au) at 0.65 mm, 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. With image-plane retrieval, we resolve the new continuum gap and ring, namely D79 and B86, at 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. With visibility-plane modeling, we also detect this substructure at 0.65 mm, and it is consistent in location with the outer ring proposed by Ilee et al. 2022 at the 1-sigma level. Furthermore, it has a high spectral index of 3.7, which may indicate dust grain sizes &lt;&lt; 1 mm. It may be a dust trap or a traffic jam, that has a flux density of 60 mJy and a mass (1.59 earth masses) that accounts for up to 2% of the dust disk at 0.65 mm. In conclusion, we confirm the existence of a faint ring in the outer regions of TW Hya at multiple millimeter wavelengths. With visibility-plane modeling, we are able to set constrains that are 3 times better than the resolution of our Band 8 observations.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey II: The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of three young brown dwarfs with CRIRES$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young brown dwarfs exhibit atmospheric characteristics similar to those of super-Jupiters, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary atmospheres. The ESO SupJup Survey, utilizing CRIRES$^+$ on the Very Large Telescope, aims to assess the role of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C as a formation tracer. We present observations of three young brown dwarfs: 2MASS J12003792-7845082, TWA 28, and 2MASS J08561384-1342242, with the goal of constraining their chemical compositions, thermal profiles, surface gravities, spin rotations, and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C. Atmospheric retrievals of CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra were conducted using the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS coupled with the Bayesian inference algorithm MultiNest, resulting in a detailed characterization of the atmospheres of these objects. We report the volume mixing ratios of main molecular and atomic species, including the novel detection of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in a brown dwarf's atmosphere, and determine $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values of $81^{+28}_{-19}$ and $79^{+20}_{-14}$ in the atmospheres of TWA 28 and J0856, respectively, with strong significance ($&gt;3\sigma$). Tentative evidence ($\sim 2\sigma$) of $^{13}$C in J1200 was found, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $114^{+69}_{-33}$, along with $^{18}$O detected at moderate significance in J0856 (3.3$\sigma$) and TWA 28 (2.1$\sigma$). The retrieved thermal profiles indicate hot atmospheres (2300-2600 K) with low surface gravities and slow spins, consistent with young objects. The consistent carbon isotope ratios among the three objects, showing no significant deviation from the local ISM, suggest a fragmentation-based formation mechanism similar to star formation. The tentative detection of $^{18}$O in two objects highlights the potential of high-resolution spectroscopy to probe additional isotope ratios, such as $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O, in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the ice and gas nature of active centaur (2060) Chiron using the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (2060) Chiron is a large centaur that has been reported active on multiple occasions including during aphelion passage. Studies of Chirons coma during active periods have resulted in the detection of C(triple)N and CO outgassing. Significant work remains to be undertaken to comprehend the activation mechanisms on Chiron and the parent molecules of the gas phases detected. This work reports the study of the ices on Chirons surface and coma and seeks spectral indicators of volatiles associated with the activity. Additionally, we discuss how these detections could be related to the activation mechanism for Chiron and, potentially, other centaurs. In July 2023, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observed Chiron when it was active near its aphelion. We present JWST/NIRSpec spectra from 0.97 to 5.27 microns with a resolving power of 1000, and compare them with laboratory data for identification of the spectral bands. We report the first detections on Chiron of absorption bands of several volatile ices, including CO2, CO, C2H6, C3H8, and C2H2. We also confirm the presence of water ice in its amorphous state. A key discovery arising from these data is the detection of fluorescence emissions of CH4, revealing the presence of a gas coma rich in this hyper-volatile molecule, which we also identify to be in non-local thermal equilibrium (nonLTE). CO2 gas emission is also detected in the fundamental stretching band at 4.27 microns. We argue that the presence of CH4 emission is the first proof of the desorption of CH4 due to a density phase transition of amorphous water ice at low temperature in agreement with the estimated temperature of Chiron during the JWST observations (61 K). Detection of photolytic and proton irradiation products of CH4 and CO2 on the surface, in the coma ice grains, or in the ring material is also detected via a forest of absorption features from 3.5 to 5.3 microns.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Elemental Abundance Measurements of Cool JWST Planet Hosts Using AutoSpecFit: An Application to the Sub-Neptune K2-18b's Host M dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an in-depth, high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of the M dwarf K2-18 that hosts a sub-Neptune exoplanet in its habitable zone. We show our technique to accurately normalize the observed spectrum, which is crucial for a proper spectral fitting. We also introduce a new automatic, line-by-line model-fitting code, AutoSpecFit, that performs an iterative ${\chi}^{2}$ minimization process to measure individual elemental abundances of cool dwarfs. We apply this code to the star K2-18, and measure the abundance of 10 elements - C, O, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, and Fe. We find these abundances moderately supersolar, except for Fe with a slightly subsolar abundance. The accuracy of the inferred abundances is limited by the systematic errors due to uncertain stellar parameters. We also derive the abundance ratios associated with several planet-building elements such as Al/Mg, Ca/Mg, Fe/Mg, and (a solar-like) C/O=0.568 $\pm$ 0.026, which can be used to constrain the chemical composition and the formation location of the exoplanet. On the other hand, the planet K2-18 b has attracted considerable interest, given the JWST measurements of its atmospheric composition. Early JWST studies reveal an unusual chemistry for the atmosphere of this planet, which is unlikely to be driven by formation in a disk of unusual composition. The comparison between the chemical abundances of K2-18 b from future JWST analyses and those of the host star can provide fundamental insights into the formation of this planetary system.</description>

      <title>Do SETI Optimists Have a Fine-Tuning Problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ecological systems, be it a garden or a galaxy, populations evolve from some initial value (say zero) up to a steady state equilibrium, when the mean number of births and deaths per unit time are equal. This equilibrium point is a function of the birth and death rates, as well as the carrying capacity of the ecological system itself. The growth curve is S-shaped, saturating at the carrying capacity for large birth-to-death rate ratios and tending to zero at the other end. We argue that our astronomical observations appear inconsistent with a cosmos saturated with ETIs, and thus SETI optimists are left presuming that the true population is somewhere along the transitional part of this S-curve. Since the birth and death rates are a-priori unbounded, we argue that this presents a fine-tuning problem. Further, we show that if the birth-to-death rate ratio is assumed to have a log-uniform prior distribution, then the probability distribution of the ecological filling fraction is bi-modal - peaking at zero and unity. Indeed, the resulting distribution is formally the classic Haldane prior, conceived to describe the prior expectation of a Bernoulli experiment, such as a technological intelligence developing (or not) on a given world. Our results formally connect the Drake Equation to the birth-death formalism, the treatment of ecological carrying capacity and their connection to the Haldane perspective.</description>

      <title>Infrared band strengths of dangling OH features in amorphous water at 20 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) spectra of vapor-deposited amorphous water at low temperatures show two weak peaks at around 3720 and 3696 cm-1 assigned to free-OH stretching modes of two- and three-coordinated water molecules (so-called dangling OH bonds), respectively, on the ice surface. A recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observation first succeeded in detection of a potential dangling OH feature at 3664 cm-1 for ices in molecular clouds, highlighting the importance of dangling OH bonds in interstellar ice chemistry. A lack of band strengths of these features at low temperatures restricts the quantification of dangling OH bonds from IR spectra, hindering development of a molecular-level understanding of the surface structure and chemistry of ice. Using IR multiple-angle incidence resolution spectrometry, we quantified the band strengths of two- and three-coordinated dangling OH features in amorphous water at 20 K as being 4.6 plus-minus 1.6 times 10-18 and 9.1 plus-minus 1.0 times 10-18 cm molecule-1, respectively. These values are more than an order of magnitude lower than band strengths of bulk water molecules in ice and liquid water and are similar to those of H2O monomers confined in solid matrices. Adsorption of carbon monoxide with dangling OH bonds results in the appearance of a new broad dangling OH feature at 3680-3620 cm-1, with a band strength of 1.8 plus-minus 0.1 times 10-17 cm molecule-1. The band strengths of dangling OH features determined in this study advance our understanding of the surface structure of interstellar ice analogs and recent IR observations of the JWST.</description>

      <title>Structure of crystalline water ice formed through neon matrix sublimation under cryogenic and vacuum conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ice I has three forms depending on the stacking arrangements of its layers: hexagonal ice Ih, cubic ice Ic, and stacking disordered ice Isd. Below ~60 K, amorphous water becomes metastable, and the formation of any form of ice I is often implicitly precluded. Using a newly developed low-temperature reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique, we show that crystalline ice with cubic stacking sequences (i.e., ice Ic) formed through Ne sublimation from a solid H2O/Ne (1:1000 ratio) matrix at 13 K. The extent of staking disorder (disordered cubic and hexagonal stacking sequences) in the ice formed by Ne matrix sublimation is smaller than that in vapor-deposited ice Isd prepared at 143 K and below the limit of detection of low-temperature RHEED. Dependence of the resulting ice structures on the thickness of the H2O/Ne matrix shows that amorphous water first forms in the early stages of Ne sublimation and the cubic stacking sequence subsequently takes place. As the cubic ice Ic formed here at a much lower temperature (13 K) than previously observed (typically above 78 K), Ne matrix sublimation represents a novel route to the formation of cubic ice Ic under low-temperature and low-pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Resurgence of Lunar Volcanism: Role of Localized Radioactive Enrichment in a Numerical Model of Magmatism and Mantle Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a 2-D numerical model of magmatism and mantle convection to understand the volcanism on the Procellarum KREEP terrane (PKT) of the Moon, which continued for billions of years with two peaks of activities at 3.5-4 Gyr ago and around 2 Gyr ago. In our model, the effects of the PKT on lunar evolution are considered by initially imposing a region of localized radioactive enrichment. The calculated volcanism has two peaks induced by different mechanisms. The first peak occurs at 3.5-4 Gyr ago when magma generated in the deep mantle by internal heating ascends to the surface as partially molten plumes. The basaltic blocks in the uppermost mantle formed by this magmatism, then, sink to the deep mantle, triggering further plumes that cause the resurgence of volcanism at $\sim$2 Gyr ago. Our model shows that localized radioactive enrichment is important for the long-lasting volcanism with a couple of peaks.</description>

      <title>The Solar and Geomagnetic Storms in May 2024: A Flash Data Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In May 2024, the scientific community observed intense solar eruptions that resulted in an extreme geomagnetic storm and auroral extension, highlighting the need to document and quantify these events. This study mainly focuses on their quantification. The source active region (AR 13664) evolved from 113 to 2761 millionths of the solar hemisphere between 4 May and 14 May 2024. AR 13664's magnetic free energy surpassed 1033 erg on 7 May 2024, triggering 12 X-class flares. Multiple interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) came out from this AR, accelerating solar energetic particles toward Earth. At least four ICMEs seemingly piled up to disturb the interplanetary space, according to the satellite data and interplanetary scintillation data. The shock arrival at 17:05 UT on 10 May 2024 significantly compressed the magnetosphere down to ~ 5.04 R_E, and triggered a deep Forbush decrease. GOES satellite data and ground-based neutron monitors confirmed a ground-level enhancement from 2 UT to 10 UT on 11 May 2024. The ICMEs induced extreme geomagnetic storms, peaking at a Dst index of -412 nT at 2 UT on 11 May 2024, marking the sixth-largest storm since 1957. The AE and AL indices showed extreme auroral extensions that located the AE/AL stations into the polar cap. We gathered auroral records at that time and reconstructed the equatorward boundary of the visual auroral oval to 29.8{\deg} invariant latitude. We compared naked-eye and camera auroral visibility, providing critical caveats on their difference. We also confirmed global enhancements of storm-enhanced density of the ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Discovery of MgS and NaS in the Interstellar Medium and tentative detection of CaO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first detection of the metal-bearing molecules sodium sulfide (NaS) and magnesium sulfide (MgS) and the tentative detection of calcium monoxide (CaO) in the interstellar medium (ISM) towards the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The derived column densities are (5.0+-1.1) x $10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, (6.0+-0.6) x $10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (2.0+-0.5) x $10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. This translates into fractional abundances with respect to H$_2$ of (3.7+-1.0) x $10^{-13}$, (4.4+-0.8) x $10^{-13}$, and (1.5+-0.4) x $10^{-13}$, respectively. We have also searched for other Na-, Mg- and Ca-bearing species towards this source but none of them have been detected and thus we provide upper limits for their abundances. We discuss the possible chemical routes involved in the formation of these molecules containing metals under interstellar conditions. Finally, we compare the ratio between sulfur-bearing and oxygen-bearing molecules with and without metals, finding that metal-bearing sulfur molecules are much more abundant than metal-bearing oxygen ones, in contrast with the general trend found in the ratios between other non metal- oxygen- and sulfur-bearing molecules. This further strengthen the idea that sulfur may be little depleted in G+0.693-0.027 as a result of the low velocity shocks present in this source sputtering large amounts of material from dust grains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When viewed from Earth, most of what we observe of a comet is dust. The influence of solar radiation pressure on the trajectories of dust particles depends on their cross-section to mass ratio. Hence solar radiation pressure acts like a mass spectrometer inside a cometary tail. The appearances of cometary dust tails have long been studied to obtain information on the dust properties, such as characteristic particle size and initial velocity when entering the tail. Over the past two decades, several spacecraft missions to comets have enabled us to study the dust activity of their targets at much greater resolution than is possible with a telescope on Earth or in near-Earth space, and added detail to the results obtained by the spacecraft visiting comet 1P/Halley in 1986. We now know that the dynamics of dust in the inner cometary coma is complex and includes a significant fraction of particles that will eventually fall back to the surface. The filamented structure of the near-surface coma is thought to result from a combination of topographic focussing of the gas flow, inhomogeneous distribution of activity across the surface, and projection effects. It is possible that some larger-than-centimetre debris contains ice when lifted from the surface, which can affect its motion. Open questions remain regarding the microphysics of the process that leads to the detachment and lifting of dust from the surface, the evolution of the dust while travelling away from the nucleus, and the extent to which information on the nucleus activity can be retrieved from remote observations of the outer coma and tail.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian for 1/1 Rotational Secondary Resonances, and Application to Small Satellites of Saturn and Jupiter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of rotation of the small satellites Methone and Aegaeon and revisit previous works on the rotation of Prometheus, Metis, and Amalthea. In all cases, the surfaces of section computed with the standard spin-orbit model reveal that the synchronous regime with small amplitude of libration shares another large domain in the phase space. We reproduce and apply the hamiltonian theory given in Wisdom (2004) to analytically characterize the detected structure as being a secondary resonance where the period of oscillation of the physical libration is similar to the orbital period of the satellite. We also show that the amplitude of libration around the secondary resonance is always larger than in the case of the other mode. Since the current rotational states of these sorts of satellites should be synchronous, our results can be considered in evolutionary studies of their rotation.</description>

      <title>Uranus and Neptune as methane planets: producing icy giants from refractory planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uranus and Neptune are commonly considered ice giants, and it is often assumed that, in addition to a solar mix of hydrogen and helium, they contain roughly twice as much water as rock. This classical picture has led to successful models of their internal structure and has been understood to be compatible with the composition of the solar nebula during their formation (Reynolds and Summers 1965; Podolak and Cameron 1974; Podolak and Reynolds 1984; Podolak et al. 1995; Nettelmann et al. 2013). However, the dominance of water has been recently questioned (Teanby et al. 2020; Helled and Fortney 2020; Podolak et al. 2022). Planetesimals in the outer solar system are composed mainly of refractory materials, leading to an inconsistency between the icy composition of Uranus and Neptune and the ice-poor planetesimals they accreted during formation (Podolak et al. 2022). Here we elaborate on this problem, and propose a new potential solution. We show that chemical reactions between planetesimals dominated by organic-rich refractory materials and the hydrogen in gaseous atmospheres of protoplanets can form large amounts of methane 'ice'. Uranus and Neptune could thus be compatible with having accreted refractory-dominated planetesimals, while still remaining icy. Using random statistical computer models for a wide parameter space, we show that the resulting methane-rich internal composition could be a natural solution, giving a good match to the size, mass and moment of inertia of Uranus and Neptune, whereas rock-rich models appear to only work if a rocky interior is heavily mixed with hydrogen. Our model predicts a lower than solar hydrogen to helium ratio, which can be tested. We conclude that Uranus, Neptune and similar exoplanets could be methane-rich, and discuss why Jupiter and Saturn cannot.</description>

Abstract: Sparse and serendipitous asteroid photometry obtained by wide field surveys such as the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (\ATLAS) is a valuable resource for studying the properties of large numbers of small Solar System bodies. We have gathered a large database of \ATLAS photometry in wideband optical cyan and orange filters, consisting of 9.6\e{7} observations of 4.5\e{5} main belt asteroids and Jupiter Trojans. We conduct a phase curve analysis of these asteroids considering each apparition separately, allowing us to accurately reject outlying observations and to remove apparitions and asteroids not suitable for phase curve determination. We obtain a dataset of absolute magnitudes and phase parameters for over 100,000 selected asteroids observed by \ATLAS, $\sim66,000$ of which had sufficient measurements to derive colours in the \ATLAS filters. To demonstrate the power of our dataset we consider the properties of the Nysa-Polana complex, for which the \ATLAS colours and phase parameters trace the S-like and C-like compositions amongst family members. We also compare the properties of the leading and trailing groups of Jupiter Trojans, finding no significant differences in their phase parameters or colours as measured by \ATLAS, supporting the consensus that these groups were captured from a common source population during planetary migration. Furthermore, we identify $\sim9000$ asteroids that exhibit large shifts in derived absolute magnitude between apparitions, indicating that these objects have both elongated shapes and spin axes with obliquity $\sim 90$ degrees.</description>

      <title>Are WASP-107-like Systems Consistent with High-eccentricity Migration?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: WASP-107 b seems to be a poster child of the long-suspected high-eccentricity migration scenario. It is on a 5.7-day, polar orbit. The planet is Jupiter-like in radius but Neptune-like in mass with exceptionally low density. WASP-107 c is on a 1100-day, $e=0.28$ orbit with at least Saturn mass. Planet b may still have a residual eccentricity of $0.06\pm 0.04$: the ongoing tidal dissipation leads to the observed internally heated atmosphere and hydrodynamic atmospheric erosion. We present a population synthesis study coupling octopole Lidov-Kozai oscillations with various short-range forces, while simultaneously accounting for the radius inflation and tidal disruption of the planet. We find that a high-eccentricity migration scenario can successfully explain nearly all observed system properties. Our simulations further suggest that the initial location of WASP-107 b at the onset of migration is likely within the snowline ($&lt;0.5\,{\rm AU}$). More distant initial orbits usually lead to tidal disruption or orbit crossing. WASP-107 b most likely lost no more than 20% of its mass during the high-eccentricity migration, i.e. it did not form as a Jupiter-mass object. More vigorous tidally-induced mass loss leads to disruption of the planet during migration. We predict that the current-day mutual inclination between the planets b and c is substantial: at least 25-55$^\circ$ which may be tested with future Gaia astrometric observations. Knowing the current-day mutual inclination may further constrain the initial orbit of planet b. We suggest that the proposed high-eccentricity migration scenario of WASP-107 may be applicable to HAT-P-11, GJ-3470, HAT-P-18, and GJ-436 which have similar orbital architectures.</description>
