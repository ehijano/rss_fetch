      <title>Contact line bundles, foliations, and integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the non-commutative integrability of contact systems on a contact manifold $(M,\mathcal H)$ using the Jacobi structure on the space of sections $\Gamma(L)$ of a contact line bundle $L$. In the cooriented case, if the line bundle is trivial and $\mathcal H$ is the kernel of a globally defined contact form $\alpha$, the Jacobi structure on the space of sections reduces to the standard Jacobi structure on $(M,\alpha)$. We therefore treat contact systems on cooriented and non-cooriented contact manifolds simultaneously. In particular, this allows us to work with dissipative Hamiltonian systems where the Hamiltonian does not have to be preserved by the Reeb vector field.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Holomorphic Hamiltonian Systems and K\"ahler Duality of Complex Coadjoint Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis is split up into two parts: The first one concerns (pseudo)-holomorphic Hamiltonian systems, while the second part is about K\"ahler structures of complex coadjoint orbits. We begin the first part by investigating basic properties of holomorphic Hamiltonian systems (HHSs) like maximal holomorphic trajectories and holomorphic Hamiltonian foliations. Afterwards, we use these notions to combine HHSs with two structures frequently studied in geometry, namely Lefschetz and almost toric fibrations, leading us to the notion of a holomorphic symplectic Lefschetz fibration. Following this examination, we formulate action functionals for HHSs. These action functionals are well-suited to find periodic orbits. However, it turns out that HHSs rarely exhibit periodic orbits. One possible obstruction for a HHS to possess periodic orbits is the integrability of the underlying complex structure. To circumvent this obstruction, we introduce the notion of pseudo-holomorphic Hamiltonian systems (PHHSs) which allow us to describe classical mechanics on almost complex manifolds. We show that PHHSs satisfy almost the same properties as HHSs. In the second part, we study coadjoint orbits of complex Lie groups and show that they also exhibit, next to their Hyperk\"ahler structure which was introduced by Kronheimer and Kovalev in the 90s, a holomorphic K\"ahler structure. A holomorphic K\"ahler structure can be thought of as a complexification of a usual K\"ahler structure. We call the fact that a space admits both Hyperk\"ahler and holomorphic K\"ahler structures ''K\"ahler duality''. In this thesis, we suspect that the K\"ahler duality of complex coadjoint orbits can be traced back to double cotangent bundles. Precisely speaking, we conjecture that double cotangent bundles naturally exhibit K\"ahler duality and that this K\"ahler duality transfers via reduction to complex coadjoint orbits.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian split tori in $S^2 \times S^2$ and billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify up to Hamiltonian isotopy Lagrangian tori that split as a product of circles in $S^2 \times S^2$, when the latter is equipped with a non-monotone split symplectic form. We show that this classification is equivalent to a problem of mathematical billiards in rectangles. We give many applications, among others: (1) answering a question on Lagrangian packing numbers raised by Polterovich--Shelukhin, (2) studying the topology of the space of Lagrangian tori, and (3) determining which split tori are images under symplectic ball embeddings of Chekanov or product tori in $\mathbb{R}^4$.</description>

      <title>Rationally Convex Surfaces with hyperbolic complex tangencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the first examples of rationally convex surfaces in the complex plane with hyperbolic complex tangencies. In fact, we give two very different types of rationally convex surfaces: those that admit analytic fillings by handle-bodies, and those that do not have any compact Riemann surfaces attached at all. The fillable examples all live in the round sphere and are unknotted, while the non-fillable examples can moreover be produced in several different smooth isotopy classes.</description>

      <title>A classification of infinite staircases for Hirzebruch surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ellipsoid embedding function of a symplectic manifold gives the smallest amount by which the symplectic form must be scaled in order for a standard ellipsoid of the given eccentricity to embed symplectically into the manifold. It was first computed for the standard four-ball (or equivalently, the complex projective plane) by McDuff and Schlenk, and found to contain the unexpected structure of an "infinite staircase," that is, an infinite sequence of nonsmooth points arranged in a piecewise linear stair-step pattern. Later work of Usher and Cristofaro-Gardiner--Holm--Mandini--Pires suggested that while four-dimensional symplectic toric manifolds with infinite staircases are plentiful, they are highly non-generic. This paper concludes the systematic study of one-point blowups of the complex projective plane, building on previous work of Bertozzi-Holm-Maw-McDuff-Mwakyoma-Pires-Weiler, Magill-McDuff, Magill-McDuff-Weiler, and Magill on these Hirzebruch surfaces.
  We prove a conjecture of Cristofaro-Gardiner--Holm--Mandini--Pires for this family: that if the blowup is of rational weight and the embedding function has an infinite staircase then that weight must be $1/3$. We show also that the function for this manifold does not have a descending staircase. Furthermore, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of an infinite staircase in this family which boils down to solving a quadratic equation and computing the function at one specific value. Many of our intermediate results also apply to the case of the polydisk (or equivalently, the symplectic product of two spheres).</description>

      <title>Graded Poisson and Graded Dirac structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been several attempts in recent years to extend the notions of symplectic and Poisson structures in order to create a suitable geometrical framework for classical field theories, trying to achieve a success similar to the use of these concepts in Hamiltonian mechanics. These notions always have a graded character, since the multisymplectic forms are of a higher degree than two. Another line of work has been to extend the concept of Dirac structures to these new scenarios. In the present paper we review all these notions, relate them and propose and study a generalization that (under some mild regularity conditions) includes them and is of graded nature. We expect this generalization to allow us to advance in the study of classical field theories, their integrability, reduction, numerical approximations and even their quantization.</description>
