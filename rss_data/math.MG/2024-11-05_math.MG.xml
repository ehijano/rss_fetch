      <title>Uniformization of intrinsic Gromov hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to provide a uniformization procedure for Gromov hyperbolic spaces, which need not be geodesic or proper. We prove that the conformal deformation of a Gromov hyperbolic space is a bounded uniform space. Further, we show that there is a natural quasi-isometry between the Gromov boundary and the metric boundary of the deformed space. Our main results are a generalization of the results of Bonk, Heninonen, and Koskela [Proposition 4.5, Proposition 4.13, Ast\'{e}risque 270 (2001)].</description>

      <title>The $L_p$-floating area, curvature entropy, and isoperimetric inequalities on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore analogs of classical centro-affine invariant isoperimetric inequalities, such as the Blaschke--Santal\'o inequality and the $L_p$-affine isoperimetric inequalities, for convex bodies in spherical space. Specifically, we establish an isoperimetric inequality for the floating area and prove a stability result based on the spherical volume difference.
  The floating area has previously been studied as a natural extension of classical affine surface area to non-Euclidean convex bodies in spaces of constant curvature. In this work, we introduce the $L_p$-floating areas for spherical convex bodies, extending Lutwak's centro-affine invariant family of $L_p$-affine surface area measures from Euclidean geometry. We prove a duality formula, monotonicity properties, and isoperimetric inequalities associated with this new family of curvature measures for spherical convex bodies.
  Additionally, we propose a novel curvature entropy functional for spherical convex bodies, based on the $L_p$-floating area, and establish a corresponding dual isoperimetric inequality.
  Finally, we extend our spherical notions to space forms with non-negative constant curvature in two distinct ways. One extension asymptotically connects with centro-affine geometry on convex bodies as curvature approaches zero, while the other converges with Euclidean geometry. Notably, our newly introduced curvature entropy for spherical convex bodies emerges as a natural counterpart to both the centro-affine entropy and the Gaussian entropy of convex bodies in Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Universal quasiconformal trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01726v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasiconformal tree is a doubling (compact) metric tree in which the diameter of each arc is comparable to the distance of its endpoints. We show that for each integer $n\geq 2$, the class of all quasiconformal trees with uniform branch separation and valence at most $n$, contains a quasisymmetrically "universal" element, that is, a an element of this class in which every other element can be embedded quasisymmetrically. We also show that every quasiconformal tree with uniform branch separation quasisymmetrically embeds into $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our results answer two questions of Bonk and Meyer from 2022 and partially answer one question of Bonk and Meyer from 2020.</description>

      <title>Metric properties of partial and robust Gromov-Wasserstein distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distances define a family of metrics, based on ideas from optimal transport, which enable comparisons between probability measures defined on distinct metric spaces. They are particularly useful in areas such as network analysis and geometry processing, as computation of a GW distance involves solving for registration between the objects which minimizes geometric distortion. Although GW distances have proven useful for various applications in the recent machine learning literature, it has been observed that they are inherently sensitive to outlier noise and cannot accommodate partial matching. This has been addressed by various constructions building on the GW framework; in this article, we focus specifically on a natural relaxation of the GW optimization problem, introduced by Chapel et al., which is aimed at addressing exactly these shortcomings. Our goal is to understand the theoretical properties of this relaxed optimization problem, from the viewpoint of metric geometry. While the relaxed problem fails to induce a metric, we derive precise characterizations of how it fails the axioms of non-degeneracy and triangle inequality. These observations lead us to define a novel family of distances, whose construction is inspired by the Prokhorov and Ky Fan distances, as well as by the recent work of Raghvendra et al.\ on robust versions of classical Wasserstein distance. We show that our new distances define true metrics, that they induce the same topology as the GW distances, and that they enjoy additional robustness to perturbations. These results provide a mathematically rigorous basis for using our robust partial GW distances in applications where outliers and partial matching are concerns.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic symmetrization, convex bodies, and isoperimetric inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with a P\'olya-Szeg\"o type inequality for anisotropic functionals of Sobolev functions. The relevant inequality entails a double-symmetrization involving both trial functions and functionals. A new approach that uncovers geometric aspects of the inequality is proposed. It relies upon anisotropic isoperimetric inequalities, fine properties of Sobolev functions, and results from the Brunn-Minkowski theory of convex bodies. Importantly, unlike previously available proofs, the one offered in this paper does not require approximation arguments and hence allows for a characterization of extremal functions.</description>

      <title>Membership Queries for Convex Floating Bodies via Hilbert Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the convex floating body membership problem, which consists of efficiently determining when a query point $a\in\mathbb{R}^d$ belongs to the so-called $\varepsilon$-convex floating body of a given bounded convex domain $K\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. We consider this problem in an approximate setting, i.e., given a parameter $\delta&gt;0$, the query can be answered either way if the Hilbert distance in $K$ of $a$ from the boundary of a relatively-scaled $\varepsilon$-convex floating body is less than $\delta$. We present a data structure for this problem that has storage size $O(\delta^{-d}\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2})$ and achieves query time of $O({\delta^{-1}}\ln 1/\varepsilon)$. Our construction is motivated by a recent work of Abdelkader and Mount on APM queries, and relies on a comparison of convex floating bodies with balls in the Hilbert metric on $K$.</description>

      <title>On $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the concepts of the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips simplicial set and the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips complex of a metric space, where $1\leq p \leq \infty.$ This theory unifies two established theories: for $p=\infty,$ this is the classical theory of Vietoris-Rips complexes, and for $p=1,$ this corresponds to the blurred magnitude homology theory. We prove several results that are known for the Vietoris-Rips complex in the general case: (1) we prove a stability theorem for the corresponding version of the persistent homology; (2) we show that, for a compact Riemannian manifold and a sufficiently small scale parameter, all the "$\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips spaces" are homotopy equivalent to the manifold; (3) we demonstrate that the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips spaces are invariant (up to homotopy) under taking the metric completion. Additionally, we show that the limit of the homology groups of the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips spaces, as the scale parameter tends to zero, does not depend on $p$; and that the homology groups of the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips spaces commute with filtered colimits of metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Lp Isoperimetric and Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17468v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schneider introduced an inter-dimensional difference body operator on convex bodies and proved an associated inequality. In the prequel to this work, we showed that this concept can be extended to a rich class of operators from convex geometry and proved the associated isoperimetric inequalities. The role of cosine-like operators, which generate convex bodies in $\mathbb R^n$ from those in $\mathbb R^n$, were replaced by inter-dimensional simplicial operators, which generate convex bodies in $\mathbb R^{nm}$ from those in $\mathbb R^{n}$ (or vice versa). In this work, we treat the $L^p$ extensions of these operators, and, furthermore, extend the role of the simplex to arbitrary $m$-dimensional convex bodies containing the origin. We establish $m$th-order $L^p$ isoperimetric inequalities, including the $m$th-order versions of the $L^p$ Petty projection inequality, $L^p$ Busemann-Petty centroid inequality, $L^p$ Santal\'o inequalities, and $L^p$ affine Sobolev inequalities. As an application, we obtain isoperimetric inequalities for the volume of the operator norm of linear functionals $(\mathbb R^n, \|\cdot\|_E) \to (\mathbb R^m, \|\cdot\|_F)$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Brunn-Minkowski and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities on Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Brunn-Minkowski and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities on a Riemannian manifold endowed with an exact magnetic field, replacing geodesics by minimizers of an action functional given by the length minus the integral of the magnetic potential. We prove that nonnegativity of a suitably defined magnetic Ricci curvature is equivalent to a magnetic Brunn-Minkowski inequality. More generally, given an arbitrary volume form on the manifold, we introduce a weighted magnetic Ricci curvature, and prove a magnetic version of the Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequality.</description>

      <title>Diffusions and random walks with prescribed sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given suitable functions $V, \Psi:[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on $V,\Psi$ for the existence of a metric measure space and a symmetric diffusion process that satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates with volume growth profile $V$ and escape time profile $\Psi$. We prove sufficiency by constructing a new family of diffusions. Special cases of this construction also leads to a new family of infinite graphs whose simple random walks satisfy sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates with prescribed volume growth and escape time profiles. In particular, these random walks on graphs generalizes earlier results of Barlow who considered the case $V(r)=r^\alpha$ and $\Psi(r)=r^\beta$ (Rev Mat Iberoam 2004). The family of diffusions we construct have martingale dimension one but can have arbitrarily high spectral dimension. Therefore our construction shows the impossibility of obtaining non-trivial lower bounds on martingale dimension in terms of spectral dimension which is in contrast with upper bounds on martingale dimension using spectral dimension obtained by Hino (Probab Theory Relat Fields 2013).</description>
