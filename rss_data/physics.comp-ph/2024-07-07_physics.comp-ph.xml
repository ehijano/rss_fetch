      <title>Exploring control of the emergent exciton insulator state in 1T-TiSe$_2$ monolayer by state-of-the-art theory models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TiSe$_2$ is of great research interest, having intriguing properties of charge density waves (CDW) and superconductivity under doping or pressurizing. The monolayer form of 1T-TiSe$_2$ also shows a CDW with a higher transition temperature T_c than the bulk, indicating a stronger CDW interaction. By using the meta-generalized gradient approximation (metaGGA)-based model Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) and many-body perturbation GW+BSE methods, we calculate the exciton binding energies and electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) for the 1T-TiSe$_2$ monolayer under different in-plane biaxial strains. We find that even without strain the 1T-TiSe$_2$ monolayer can have negative exciton energies at the Brillouin zone boundary point M, with a binding energy larger than the gap. The calculated EELS reinforces this picture, indicating EI (exciton insulator) states in 1T-TiSe$_2$ monolayer even without strain. The Wannier-Mott formula calculations of exciton binding energy corroborate results from GW+BSE. Small compressive strains enhance the EI state, and for tensile strains slightly less than 3%, the EI state in this monolayer persists. At large tensile strains, the material makes a transition to a normal semiconductor. Our results provide important information for understanding the quantum nature of this two-dimensional (2D) material. Our results from the standard G0W0@PBE+SOC+U+BSE approach are not qualitatively different from those of a more computationally efficient metaGGA-based SCAN+SOC+U+mBSE+$f_{xc}^{loc}$ approach that employs a model BSE.</description>

      <title>Peering inside the black box: Learning the relevance of many-body functions in Neural Network potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learned potentials are becoming a popular tool to define an effective energy model for complex systems, either incorporating electronic structure effects at the atomistic resolution, or effectively renormalizing part of the atomistic degrees of freedom at a coarse-grained resolution. One of the main criticisms to machine learned potentials is that the energy inferred by the network is not as interpretable as in more traditional approaches where a simpler functional form is used. Here we address this problem by extending tools recently proposed in the nascent field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to coarse-grained potentials based on graph neural networks (GNN). We demonstrate the approach on three different coarse-grained systems including two fluids (methane and water) and the protein NTL9. On these examples, we show that the neural network potentials can be in practice decomposed in relevance contributions to different orders, that can be directly interpreted and provide physical insights on the systems of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kernel polynomial method based on Jacobi polynomials $P_n^{\alpha,\beta}(x)$ is proposed. The optimal-resolution positivity-preserving kernels and the corresponding damping factors are obtained. The results provide a generalization of the Jackson damping factors for arbitrary Jacobi polynomials. For $\alpha =\pm 1/2$, $\beta =\pm 1/2$ (Chebyshev polynomials of the first to fourth kinds), explicit trigonometric expressions for the damping factors are obtained. The resulting algorithm can be easily introduced into existing implementations of the kernel polynomial method.</description>

      <title>Factorial Series Representation of Stieltjes Series Converging Factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The practical usefulness of Levin-type nonlinear sequence transformations as numerical tools for the summation of divergent series or for the convergence acceleration of slowly converging series, is nowadays beyond dispute. Weniger's transformation, in particular, is able to accomplish spectacular results when used to overcome resummation problems, often outperforming better known resummation techniques, the most known being Pad\'e approximants. However, our understanding of its theoretical features is still far from being satisfactory and particularly bad as far as the decoding of factorially divergent series is concerned.
  Stieltjes series represent a class of power series of fundamental interest in mathematical physics. In the present paper, it is shown how the Stieltjes series converging factor of any order is expressible as an inverse factorial series, whose terms can be analytically retrieved through a simple recursive algorithm. A few examples of applications of our algorithm are presented, in order to show its effectiveness and implementation ease. We believe the results presented here could constitute an important, preliminary step for the development of a general convergence theory of Weniger's transformation on Stieltjes series. A rather ambitious project, but worthy of being pursued in the future.</description>

      <title>Phase space path integral representation of the dynamic structure factor. Monte Carlo simulation of strongly correlated soft-sphere fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic structure factor (DSF) is a mathematical function that contains information about inter-particle correlations and their time evolution. Mostly the classical molecular dynamics is used to calculate the DSF of the classical systems. On the contrary this article deals with quantum systems and the quantum dynamic structure factor. The Wigner formulation of quantum mechanics was used to derive the path integral representation of the DSF, which is based on the Wiener-Khinchin theorem showing relation of the the power spectrum of a random paths to their correlation function. The $3 {\rm D} $ quantum system of strongly correlated soft-sphere fermions was considered as an interesting physical example.
  The developed Wigner path integral Monte Carlo (WPIMC) approach has been developed to calculate the spin--resolved DSFs, the radial distribution functions (RDFs) and other thermodynamic functions in a wide range of density and temperatures. The physical meaning of the peaks arising on the RDFs and DSF have been analyzed and explained by the manifestation of the interference effects of the exchange and interparticle interactions and, as well as, the wave interference between multiple-scattering. This phenomenon in the system of the soft-sphere scatterers may to be the precursor effect of the Anderson localization, which finds its origin in the wave interference between multiple-scattering paths.</description>

      <title>2500 vibronic eigenstates of the NO$_3$ radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nitrate radical NO$_3$ plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, yet many aspects of its coupled and anharmonic vibronic structure remain elusive. Here, using an accurate, coupled full-dimensional diabatic potential that includes five electronic states, we revisit the vibronic spectrum associated with the electronic $\tilde X ^2A_2'$ state. Using recently developed tensor network state methods, we are able to compute more than 2500 vibronic states, thereby increasing the number of computed full-dimensional states by a factor of 50, compared to previous work. While we obtain good agreement with experiment for most of the assigned vibronic levels, for several others, we observe striking disagreement. Further, for the antisymmetric bending motion we find remarkably large symmetry-induced level splittings that are larger than the zero-order reference. We discuss non-negligible nonadiabatic effects and show that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation leads to significant errors in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Predicting solvation free energies for neutral molecules in any solvent with openCOSMO-RS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of solvation free energies is critical for understanding various phenomena in the liquid phase, including reaction rates, equilibrium constants, activity coefficients, and partition coefficients. Despite extensive research, precise prediction of solvation free energies remains challenging. In this study, we introduce openCOSMO-RS 24a, an improved version of the open-source COSMO-RS model, capable of predicting solvation free energies alongside other liquid-phase properties. We parameterize openCOSMO-RS 24a using quantum chemical calculations from ORCA 6.0, leveraging a comprehensive dataset that includes solvation free energies, partition coefficients, and infinite dilution activity coefficients for various solutes and solvents at 25 {\deg}C. Additionally, we develop a Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships model to predict molar volumes of the solvents, an essential requirement for predicting solvation free energies from structure alone. Our results show that openCOSMO-RS 24a achieves an average absolute deviation of 0.45 kcal/mol for solvation free energies, 0.76 for partition coefficients, and 0.51 for infinite dilution activity coefficients, demonstrating improvements over the previous openCOSMO-RS 22 parameterization and comparable results to COSMOtherm 24 TZVP. A new command line interface for openCOSMO-RS 24a was developed which allows easy acces to the solvation energy model directly from within ORCA 6.0. This represents a significant advancement in the predictive modeling of solvation free energies and other solution-phase properties, providing researchers with a robust tool for applications in chemical and materials science.</description>

      <title>Accurate nuclear quantum statistics on machine-learned classical effective potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contribution of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) to the properties of various hydrogen-bound systems, including biomolecules, is increasingly recognized. Despite the development of many acceleration techniques, the computational overhead of incorporating NQEs in complex systems is sizable, particularly at low temperatures. In this work, we leverage deep learning and multiscale coarse-graining techniques to mitigate the computational burden of path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). Specifically, we employ a machine-learned potential to accurately represent corrections to classical potentials, thereby significantly reducing the computational cost of simulating NQEs. We validate our approach using four distinct systems: Morse potential, Zundel cation, single water molecule, and bulk water. Our framework allows us to accurately compute position-dependent static properties, as demonstrated by the excellent agreement obtained between the machine-learned potential and computationally intensive PIMD calculations, even in the presence of strong NQEs. This approach opens the way to the development of transferable machine-learned potentials capable of accurately reproducing NQEs in a wide range of molecular systems.</description>

      <title>What if? Numerical weather prediction at the crossroads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an outlook on the future of operational weather prediction given the recent evolution in science, computing and machine learning. In many parts, this evolution strongly deviates from the strategy operational centres have formulated only several years ago. New opportunities in digital technology have greatly accelerated progress, and the full integration of computational science in numerical weather prediction centres is common knowledge now. Within the last few years, a vast machine learning research community has emerged for creating new and tailor-made products, accelerating processing and - most of all - creating emulators for the entire production of global forecasts that outperform traditional systems. In this context, the role of both numerical models and observations is changing from being equation to data driven. Analyses and reanalyses are becoming the new currency for training machine learning, and operational centres are in a powerful position as they generate these datasets based on decades worth of experience. This environment creates incredible opportunities to progress much faster than in the past but also uncertainties about what the strategic implications on defining cost-effective and sustainable research and operations are, and how to achieve sufficient high-performance computing and data handling capacities. It will take individual national public services a while to understand what to focus on and how to coordinate their substantial investments in staff and infrastructure at institutional, national and international level. This paper addresses this new situation operational weather prediction finds itself in through formulating the most likely "what if?" scenarios for the near future and provides an outline for how weather centres could adapt.</description>

Abstract: Five time-dependent orbital optimized coupled-cluster (TD-ooCC) methods, of which four can converge to the complete active space self-consistent-field method, are presented for fermion-mixtures with arbitrary fermion kinds and numbers. Truncation schemes maintaining the intragroup orbital rotation invariance, as well as equations of motion of CC amplitudes and orbitals, are derived. Present methods are compact CC-parameterization alternatives to the time-dependent multiconfiguration self-consistent-field method for systems consisting of arbitrarily different kinds and numbers of interacting fermions. Theoretical analysis of applications of present methods to various chemical systems are reported.</description>

      <title>A spring pair method of finding saddle points using the minimum energy path as a compass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding index-1 saddle points is crucial for understanding phase transitions. In this work, we propose a simple yet efficient approach, the spring pair method (SPM), to accurately locate saddle points. Without requiring Hessian information, SPM evolves a single pair of spring-coupled particles on the potential energy surface. By cleverly designing complementary drifting and climbing dynamics based on gradient decomposition, the spring pair converges onto the minimum energy path (MEP) and spontaneously aligns its orientation with the MEP tangent, providing a reliable ascent direction for efficient convergence to saddle points. SPM fundamentally differs from traditional surface walking methods, which rely on the eigenvectors of Hessian that may deviate from the MEP tangent, potentially leading to convergence failure or undesired saddle points. The efficiency of SPM for finding saddle points is verified by ample examples, including high-dimensional Lennard-Jones cluster rearrangement and the Landau energy functional involving quasicrystal phase transitions.</description>

      <title>The ACCEL$^2$ project: simulating Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in large-volume hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological information is usually extracted from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest correlations using only either large-scale information interpreted through linear theory or using small-scale information interpreted by means of expensive hydrodynamical simulations. A complete cosmological interpretation of the 3D correlations at all measurable scales is challenged by the need of more realistic models including the complex growth of non-linear small scales that can only be studied within large hydrodynamical simulations. Past work were often limited by the trade off between the simulated cosmological volume and the resolution of the low-density intergalactic medium from which the Lyman-$\alpha$ signal originates. We conduct a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of the intergalactic medium, including one of the largest Lyman-$\alpha$ simulations ever performed in terms of volume (640 $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$), alongside simulations in smaller volumes with resolutions up to 25 $h^{-1}\mathrm{kpc}$. We compare the 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectra predicted by those simulations to different non-linear models. The inferred Lyman-$\alpha$ bias and RSD parameters, $b_\alpha$ and $\beta_\alpha$ are in remarkable agreement with those measured in SDSS and DESI data. We find that, contrary to intuition, the convergence of large-scale modes of the 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectra, which determines $\beta_\alpha$, is primarily influenced by the resolution of the simulation box through mode coupling, rather than the box size itself. Finally, we study the BAO signal encoded in the 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectra. For the first time with a hydrodynamical simulation, we clearly detect the BAO signal, however we only marginally detect its damping, associated with the non-linear growth of the structures.</description>

      <title>The miscibility of hydrogen and water in planetary atmospheres and interiors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many planets in the solar system and across the galaxy have hydrogen-rich atmospheres overlying more heavy element-rich interiors with which they interact for billions of years. Atmosphere-interior interactions are thus crucial to understanding the formation and evolution of these bodies. However, this understanding is still lacking in part because the relevant pressure-temperature conditions are extreme. We conduct molecular dynamics simulations based on Density Functional Theory to investigate how hydrogen and water interact over a wide range of pressure and temperature, encompassing the interiors of Neptune-sized and smaller planets. We determine the critical curve at which a single homogeneous phase exsolves into two separate, hydrogen-rich and water-rich phases, finding good agreement with existing experimental data. We find that the temperature along the critical curve increases with increasing pressure and shows the influence of a change in fluid structure from molecular to atomic near 30 GPa and 3000 K, which may impact magnetic field generation. The internal temperatures of many exoplanets, including TOI-270 d and K2-18 b may lie entirely above the critical curve: the envelope is expected to consist of a single homogeneous hydrogen-water fluid, that is much less susceptible to atmospheric loss as compared with a pure hydrogen envelope. As planets cool, they cross the critical curve, leading to rainout of water-rich fluid and an increase in internal luminosity. Compositions of the resulting outer, hydrogen-rich, and inner, water-rich envelopes depend on age and instellation and are governed by thermodynamics. Rainout of water may be occurring in Uranus and Neptune at present.</description>

Abstract: We report here a series of detailed statistical analyses on the sea level variations in the Port of Trieste using one of the largest existing catalogues that covers more than a century of measurements. We show that the distribution of waiting times, which are defined here akin to econophysics, namely the series of shortest time spans between a given sea level L and the next sea level of at least L + {\delta} in the catalogue, exhibits a distinct scale-free character for small values of {\delta}, while for larger values of {\delta} the distribution is very similar to the exponential distribution. The distribution of waiting times for small values of {\delta} is typical for complex systems exhibiting criticality and is reported abundantly in the literature, while the exponential-like distribution observed for large values of {\delta} has been observed in contexts as diverse as magnetic systems and light sleep duration.</description>

      <title>Learning tensor networks with tensor cross interpolation: new algorithms and libraries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm is a rank-revealing algorithm for decomposing low-rank, high-dimensional tensors into tensor trains/matrix product states (MPS). TCI learns a compact MPS representation of the entire object from a tiny training data set. Once obtained, the large existing MPS toolbox provides exponentially fast algorithms for performing a large set of operations. We discuss several improvements and variants of TCI. In particular, we show that replacing the cross interpolation by the partially rank-revealing LU decomposition yields a more stable and more flexible algorithm than the original algorithm. We also present two open source libraries, xfac in Python/C++ and TensorCrossInterpolation.jl in Julia, that implement these improved algorithms, and illustrate them on several applications. These include sign-problem-free integration in large dimension, the superhigh-resolution quantics representation of functions, the solution of partial differential equations, the superfast Fourier transform, the computation of partition functions, and the construction of matrix product operators.</description>

      <title>Convergence of variational Monte Carlo simulation and scale-invariant pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide theoretical convergence bounds for the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method as applied to optimize neural network wave functions for the electronic structure problem. We study both the energy minimization phase and the supervised pre-training phase that is commonly used prior to energy minimization. For the energy minimization phase, the standard algorithm is scale-invariant by design, and we provide a proof of convergence for this algorithm without modifications. The pre-training stage typically does not feature such scale-invariance. We propose using a scale-invariant loss for the pretraining phase and demonstrate empirically that it leads to faster pre-training.</description>

      <title>Measuring Trotter error and its application to precision-guaranteed Hamiltonian simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trotterization is the most common and convenient approximation method for Hamiltonian simulations on digital quantum computers, but estimating its error accurately is computationally difficult for large quantum systems. Here, we develop a method for measuring the Trotter error without ancillary qubits on quantum circuits by combining the $m$th- and $n$th-order ($m&lt;n$) Trotterizations rather than consulting with mathematical error bounds. Using this method, we make Trotterization precision-guaranteed, developing an algorithm named Trotter$(m,n)$, in which the Trotter error at each time step is within an error tolerance $\epsilon$ preset for our purpose. Trotter$(m,n)$ is applicable to both time- independent and dependent Hamiltonians, and it adaptively chooses almost the largest stepsize $\mathrm{d}t$, which keeps quantum circuits shallowest within the error tolerance. Benchmarking it in a quantum spin chain, we find the adaptively chosen $\mathrm{d}t$ to be about ten times larger than that inferred from known upper bounds of Trotter errors.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets): A Data-Driven Approach for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used to describe relevant phenomena in dynamical systems. In real-world applications, we commonly need to combine formal PDE models with (potentially noisy) observations. This is especially relevant in settings where we lack information about boundary or initial conditions, or where we need to identify unknown model parameters. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a popular tool for this kind of problems. In high-dimensional settings, however, PINNs often suffer from computational problems because they usually require dense collocation points over the entire computational domain. To address this problem, we present Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets) as a data-driven approach for solving PDEs in one dimension less than the original problem space. PIBI-Nets only require points at the computational domain boundary, while still achieving highly accurate results. Moreover, PIBI-Nets clearly outperform PINNs in several practical settings. Exploiting elementary properties of fundamental solutions of linear differential operators, we present a principled and simple way to handle point sources in inverse problems. We demonstrate the excellent performance of PIBI- Nets for the Laplace and Poisson equations, both on artificial datasets and within a real-world application concerning the reconstruction of groundwater flows.</description>

      <title>Exploiting decoupled discretization in meshless lattice Boltzmann method for high-Reynolds number flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most severe limitations of the Lattice Boltzmann Method in the context of simulating inertial flows is the coupling of the discretization of space to the velocity discretization. It causes the need to increase the size of computational meshes whenever one wants to increase the Reynolds number in the system for a fixed velocity and viscosity. This work aims at adopting the recently proposed meshless LBM formulation to the problem of high Reynolds number flows by using its internal property of decoupled space and velocity discretizations. In meshless formulation, one can change the reference length of the problem by scaling the distances between points that discretize the domain while the streaming distance remains fixed. By doing that, we increase the Reynolds number at no cost: additional nodes need not be inserted in the discretization. We measure the accuracy and efficiency of this approach in the flow around a circular obstacle at $Re=84$--$168$, the lid-driven cavity flow at $Re=100$--$5000$, and the flow through a porous sample at $Re=0.8$--$1500$. Additionally, we apply the meshless streaming step to the recently proposed fixed relaxation time $\tau=1$ LBM to extend its applicability to model inertial flows.</description>

      <title>Reconciling mean-squared radius differences in the silver chain through improved measurement and {\it ab initio} calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear charge radius differences in the silver isotopic chain have been reported through different combinations of experiment and theory, exhibiting a tension of two combined standard errors. This study investigates this issue by combining high-accuracy calculations for six low-lying states of atomic silver with an improved measurement of the $5s ^2S_{1/2} - 5p ^2P_{3/2}$ transition optical isotope shift. Our calculations predict measured electronic transition energies in Ag I at the 0.3\% level, the highest accuracy achieved in this system so far. We calculate electronic isotope shift factors by employing analytical response relativistic coupled-cluster theory, and find that a consistent charge radius difference between $^{107,109}$Ag is returned when combining our calculations with the available optical isotope shift measurements. We therefore recommend an improved value for the mean-squared charge radius difference between $^{107}$Ag and $^{109}$Ag as $0.207(3)[4]$ fm$^2$, within one combined error from the value derived from muonic Ag experiments, and an updated set of charge radii differences across the isotopic chain.</description>

      <title>Design principles of nonlinear optical materials for Terahertz lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated both inter-band and intra-band second order nonlinear optical conductivity based on the velocity correlation formalism and the spectral expansion technique. We propose a scenario in which the second order intra-band process is nonzero while the inter-band process is zero. This occurs for a band structure with momentum asymmetry in the Brillouin zone. Very low-energy photons are blocked by the Pauli exclusion principle from participating in the inter-band process; however, they are permitted to participate in the intra-band process, with the band smeared by some impurity scattering. We establish a connection between the inter-band nonlinear optical conductivity in the velocity gauge and the shift vector in the length gauge for a two-band model. Using a quasiclassical kinetic approach, we demonstrate the importance of intra-band transitions in high harmonic generations for the single tilted Dirac cone model and hexagonal warping model. We confirm that the Kramers-Kronig relations break down for the limit case of ($\omega$, $-\omega$) in the nonlinear optical conductivity. Finally, we calculate the superconducting transition temperature of NbN and the dielectric function of AlN, and the resistance of the NbN/AlN junction. The natural non-linearity of the Josephson junction brings a Josephson plasma with frequency in the Terahertz region.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Crank-Nicolson and Method of Lines for the Solution of Initial Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use a Variational Quantum Algorithm to solve Initial Value Problems with the Implicit Crank-Nicolson and the Method of Lines (MoL) evolution schemes. The unknown functions use a spectral decomposition with the Fourier basis. The examples developed to illustrate the implementation are the Advection equation, the wave equation written as a system of first order coupled equations and the viscous Burgers equation as a non-linear case. The problems are solved using: i) standard Finite Differences as the solution to compare with, ii) the State Vector Formalism (SVF), and iii) the Sampling Error Formalism (SEF). The contributions of this paper include: 1) cost functions for generic first order in time PDEs using the implicit Crank-Nicholson and the MoL, 2) detailed convergence or self-convergence tests are presented for all the equations solved, 3) a system of three coupled PDEs is solved, 4) solutions using sampling error are presented and 5) a fast version of the SVF and SEF was developed which can be used to test different optimizers faster.</description>

      <title>Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2's strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2 based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model based small molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on three different protein kinases and their type I and II inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.</description>

      <title>Genetics-based deperturbation analysis for the spin-orbit coupled ${\rm A}^1\Sigma^+$ and ${\rm b}^3\Pi_{0^+}$ states of LiRb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a deperturbation analysis of the spin-orbit coupled $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$ and $\rm b^3\Pi_{0^+}$ states of LiRb based on the rovibrational energy levels observed previously by photoassociation spectroscopy in bosonic $^7$Li$^{85}$Rb molecule. Using the genetic algorithm, we fit the potential energy curves of the $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$ state and the $\rm b^3\Pi$ state into point-wise form. We then fit these point-wise potentials along with the spin-orbit coupling into expanded Morse oscillator functional form and optimise analytical parameters based on the experimental data. From the fitted results, we calculate the transition dipole moment matrix elements for transitions from the rovibrational levels of the coupled $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$-$\rm b^3\Pi_{0^+}$ state to the Feshbach state and the absolute rovibrational ground state for fermionic $^6$Li$^{87}$Rb molecule. Based on the calculated transition dipole moment matrix elements, several levels of the coupled $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$-$\rm b^3\Pi_{0^+}$ state are predicted to be suitable as the intermediate state for stimulated Raman adiabatic passage transfer from the Feshbach state to the absolute rovibrational ground state. In addition, we also provide a similar estimation for ${\rm B}^1\Pi$-${\rm c}^3\Sigma_1^+$-${\rm b}^3\Pi_1$ state based on available $ab\ initio$ interaction potentials.</description>
