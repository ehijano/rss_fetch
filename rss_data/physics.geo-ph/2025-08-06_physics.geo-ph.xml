      <title>VLF Remote Sensing across and along the Totality Path during the April 8, 2024 Total Solar Eclipse using a VLF Receiver Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the total solar eclipse in the United States on April 8, 2024, we observed the amplitude and phase of VLF signals from five U.S. Navy VLF transmitters using a novel geometry of VLF receivers deployed along and across the totality path. Nine receiver sites (four of them inside the totality path) were deployed to collect the data in different transmitter-receiver configurations relative to the totality path, which intersected with the radio propagation paths from the Cutler, MA (NAA, 24 kHz) and the LaMoure, ND (NML, 25.2 kHz) Navy transmitters. The transmitters themselves experienced 98.7 (NAA) and 68 (NML) solar obscuration at 75 km altitude. The novelty of the observations is the near-total obscuration of one of the transmitters and observations of several radio propagation paths closely aligned to the path of totality. This configuration enabled observations of the effects of the Moon shadow progression from Texas to Maine for over three hours on a total of 28 radio paths (with coverage from 55 to 100) with transmitter-to-receiver distances ranging from 780 km to 7700 km. Both positive and negative (5- 10 dB) amplitude changes were observed by receivers throughout the eclipse period. The observed phase changes were mostly negative. The unique observations of VLF propagation along the totality path produced a temporally dynamic quasiperiodic `W' shaped response in amplitude that can be used to determine the gradients and spatial scales of the eclipse effect on the lower ionosphere. For observations within 780 km of NAA, the eclipse produced a 13 dB surge in amplitude.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Tohoku earthquake aftershocks in the framework of the phenomenological theory of aftershocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aftershocks of the Tohoku earthquake are analyzed in light of the phenomenological theory of aftershocks. The theory is based on the concept of an earthquake source as a dynamic system, the state of which is described by a deactivation coefficient. The concept of the proper time of the source is used, which in general differs from world time. The "underground clock" and the clock showing world time have been synchronized. For an observer using the underground impacts as time markers, the flow of world time will be uneven. The admissibility and effectiveness of the idea of this specific relativity of time is shown. Three phases of relaxation of the source after the main shock were discovered. In the initial phase, the deactivation coefficient is zero. In the main phase, the deactivation coefficient has a finite value and does not change over time. In the recovery phase, the deactivation coefficient changes randomly over time. The sharp transitions between phases resemble the phenomenon of bifurcation.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of the high-pressure structural stability of zirconolite materials for nuclear waste immobilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of the high-pressure behaviours of the nuclear waste immobilisation materials zirconolite-2M, -4M, -3O, and -3T. The materials are studied under high-pressure conditions using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction. For zirconolite-2M we also performed density-functional theory calculations. A new triclinic crystal structure (space group P-1), instead of the previously assigned monoclinic structure (space group C2/c) is proposed for zirconolite-2M. We named the triclinic structure as zirconolite-2TR. We also found that zirconolite-2TR undergoes a phase transition at 14.7 GPa to a monoclinic structure described by space group C2/c, which is different than the high-pressure structure previously proposed in the literature. These results are discussed in comparison with previous studies on zirconolite-2M and the related compound calzirtite. For the other three zirconolite structures (4M, 3O, and 3T) this is the first high-pressure study, and we find no evidence for pressure induced phase transitions in any of them. The linear compressibility of the studied compounds, as well as a room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state, are also presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>On the meaning of the dynamo radius in giant planets with stable layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current structure models of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that helium becomes immiscible in hydrogen in the outer part of the planets' electrically conducting regions. This likely leads to a layer in which overturning convection is inhibited due to a stabilizing compositional gradient. The presence of such a stably stratified layer impacts the location and mechanism of convectively-driven dynamo action. Juno's measurements of Jupiter's magnetic field enabled an estimate of its dynamo radius based on the magnetic Lowes spectrum. A depth of ~0.8R_J is obtained, where 1R_J is Jupiter's radius. This is rather deep, considering that the electrical conductivity inside Jupiter is expected to reach significant values at ~0.9R_J. Here we use 3-dimensional numerical dynamo simulations to explore the effects of the existence and location of a stably stratified helium rain layer on both the inferred Lowes radius and location of the radial extent of dynamo action. We focus on a Jupiter-like internal structure and electrical conductivity profile. We find that for shallower stable layers, there is no magnetic field generation occurring above the stable layer and the effective dynamo radius and the inferred Lowes radius is at the base of the layer. For deeper stable layers, Lowes radii of ~0.87R_J are inferred as a shallow secondary dynamo operates above the stable layer. Our results strongly suggest the existence of a stable layer extending from ~0.8R_J up to at least ~0.9R_J inside Jupiter. The physical origin of this extended stable layer and its connection to helium rain remain to be elucidated.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network for Elastic Wave-Mode Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mode conversion in non-homogeneous elastic media makes it challenging to interpret physical properties accurately. Decomposing these modes correctly is crucial across various scientific areas. Recent machine learning approaches have been proposed to address this problem, utilizing the Helmholtz decomposition technique. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of a physics-informed neural network (PINN) in separating P and S modes by solving a scalar Poisson equation. This scalar formulation offers a dimensionally scalable reduction in computational cost compared to the traditional vector formulation. We verify the proposed method in both homogeneous and realistic non-homogeneous elastic models as showcases. The obtained separated modes closely match those from conventional numerical techniques, while exhibiting reduced transverse wave leakage.</description>

      <title>Geomorphometric atlas of ice-free Antarctic areas: Problem statement, concept, and key principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we rationalize the need to develop a geomorphometric atlas of ice-free Antarctic areas. Geomorphometric mapping of such landscapes is necessary to obtain new knowledge about quantitative topographic characteristics of these unique objects and the further use of morphometric information in the geosciences. First, we present a concept, structure, and content of the atlas including a list of 194 areas to be modeled and mapped. For each area, the atlas will include the following materials: (a) a hypsometric map; (b) a map series of the eleven morphometric variables: slope, aspect, horizontal curvature, vertical curvature, minimal curvature, maximal curvature, catchment area, topographic wetness index, stream power index, total insolation, and wind exposition index; and (c) reference texts and tables. Second, we describe data and methods of geomorphometric modeling and mapping to be utilized for creating the atlas. Fragments of the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica will be used as input data for geomorphometric calculations and modeling. Next, we discuss specificity of the ice-free areas posing challenges in the atlas development. Finally, we consider possible applications of the derived maps. The principal feature and novelty of the atlas will be the system view on maps of key fundamental morphometric attributes associated with the theory of the topographic surface and the concept of general geomorphometry. The atlas will concentrate multi-scale, multi-aspect quantitative information on the ice-free Antarctic topography, will present it in a systematized, organized, and easy-to-read form as well as will provide scientific and information support for research in Antarctica.</description>
