      <title>Finite monodromy of some two-parameter families of exponential sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the set of polynomials $f(x)\in k[x]$, where $k$ is a finite field, such that the local system on $\mathbb G_m^2$ which parametrizes the family of exponential sums $(s,t)\mapsto\sum_{x\in k}\psi(sf(x)+tx)$ has finite monodromy, in two cases: when $f(x)=x^d+\lambda x^e$ is a binomial and when $f(x)=(x-\alpha)^d(x-\beta)^e$ is of Belyi type.</description>

      <title>Solvability of $\binom{2k}{k} = \binom{2a}{a} \binom{x+2b}{b}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $k,x,$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is a nonnegative integer such that $k=a+b$. In this paper, we will prove $\binom{2k}{k} = \binom{2a}{a} \binom{x+2b}{b}$ if and only if $x=a=1$. We do this by looking at different cases depending on the values of $x$ and $k$. We use varying techniques to prove the cases, such as direct proof, verification through Maple software, and a proof technique found in Moser's paper. Previous results from Hanson, St\u{a}nic\u{a}, Shanta, Shorey and Nair are also used.</description>

      <title>On the Field Isomorphism Problem for the Family of Simplest Quartic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciding whether or not two polynomials have isomoprhic splitting fields over the rationals is the Field Isomorphism Problem. We consider polynomials of the form $f_n(x) = x^4-nx^3-6x^2+nx+1$ with $n \neq 3$ a positive integer and we let $K_n$ denote the splitting field of $f_n(x)$; a `simplest quartic field'. Our main theorem states that under certain hypotheses there can be at most one positive integer $m \neq n$ such that $K_m=K_n$. The proof relies on the existence of squares in recurrent sequences and a result of J.H.E. Cohn [3]. These sequences allow us to establish uniqueness of the splitting field under additional hypotheses in Section (5) and to establish a connection with elliptic curves in Section (6).</description>

      <title>Extending class group action attacks via sesquilinear pairings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new tool for the study of isogeny-based cryptography, namely pairings which are sesquilinear (conjugate linear) with respect to the $\mathcal{O}$-module structure of an elliptic curve with CM by an imaginary quadratic order $\mathcal{O}$. We use these pairings to study the security of problems based on the class group action on collections of oriented ordinary or supersingular elliptic curves. This extends work of both (Castryck, Houben, Merz, Mula, Buuren, Vercauteren, 2023) and (De Feo, Fouotsa, Panny, 2024).</description>

      <title>Some remarks on the order structures of multi-polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multi-polylogarithm functions which are slightly different from the ordinary ones. These functions have two integral representations and an order structure similar to those of multiple zeta star values. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for the set of values of our multi-polylogarithm functions to be a dense set.</description>

      <title>Approximation measures for shifted logarithms of algebraic numbers via effective Poincare-Perron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we show new effective approximation measures for the shifted logarithm of algebraic numbers which belong to a number field of arbitrary degree. Our measures refine previous ones including those for usual logarithms. We adapt Pade approximants constructed by M. Kawashima and A. Poels in the rational case. Our key ingredient relies on the Poincare-Perron theorem which gives us asymptotic estimates at every archimedean place of the number field, that we apply to decide whether the shifted logarithm lies outside of the number field. We use Perron's second theorem and its modification due to M. Pituk to handle general cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there is a sequence of zeros of $\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)$ in the fourth quadrant. We show that the $n$-th zero $\rho_{-n}=\beta_{-n}+i\gamma_{-n}$, with $\beta_{-n}\sim 4\pi^2 n/\log^2n$ and $\gamma_{-n}\sim-4\pi n/\log n$. We give the first terms of an asymptotic development of $\rho_{-n}$ and an algorithm to calculate $\rho_{-n}$ from $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of the vanishing of Poincar\'e series for congruence subgroups. Denoting by $P_{k,m,N}$ the Poincar\'e series of weight $k$ and index $m$ for the group $\Gamma_0(N)$, we show that for certain choices of parameters $k,m,N$, the Poincar\'e series does not vanish. Our methods improve on previous results of Rankin (1980) and Mozzochi (1989).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper a proof is given of Sugawara's conjecture from 1936, that the ray class field of conductor $\mathfrak{f}$ over an imaginary quadratic field $K$ is generated over $K$ by a single primitive $\mathfrak{f}$-division value of the $\tau$-function, first defined by Weber and then modified by Hasse in his 1927 paper giving a new foundation of complex multiplication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a cyclic group of prime order, the non-trivial Dirichlet characters together with their Fourier transforms are functions that vanish at 0 and whose modulus is constant outside 0. Answering a question of H. Cohn, we construct new functions with these properties for non-safe primes. The proof relies on Floer homology. In the appendix we also apply this method to the  biunimodular functions problem.</description>

      <title>Injectivity theorems and cubical descent for schemes, stacks, and analytic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove relative injectivity, torsion-freeness, and vanishing theorems for generalized normal crossing pairs on schemes, algebraic stacks, formal schemes, semianalytic germs of complex analytic spaces, rigid analytic spaces, Berkovich spaces, and adic spaces locally of weakly finite type over a field, all in equal characteristic zero. We give a uniform proof for all these theorems in all the categories of spaces mentioned above, which were previously only known for varieties and complex analytic spaces due to work of Ambro and Fujino. Ambro and Fujino's results are integral in the proofs of the fundamental theorems of the minimal model program for (semi-)log canonical pairs and the theory of quasi-log structures. Our results resolve a significant barrier to extending these results on (semi-)log canonical pairs and quasi-log structures beyond the setting of varieties and complex analytic spaces.
  In order to prove our most general injectivity theorems, we generalize to all these categories of spaces a criterion due to Guill\'en and Navarro Aznar characterizing when functors defined on smooth varieties extend to all varieties. This extension result uses cubical hyperresolutions, which we construct in all categories of spaces mentioned above. Our extension result is very general and is of independent interest. We use this extension result to prove our injectivity theorems for generalized normal crossing pairs. We also apply our extension result to develop the theoretical foundations for the Deligne-Du Bois complex in these categories of spaces and to construct a weight filtration on the (pro-)\'etale cohomology of schemes and rigid analytic spaces. These results establish some aspects of Deligne-Hodge theory in all categories of spaces mentioned above.</description>

      <title>On entropy Marton-type inequalities and small symmetric differences with cosets of abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recognise that an entropy inequality akin to the main intermediate goal of recent works (Gowers, Green, Manners, Tao [3],[2]) regarding a conjecture of Marton provides a black box from which we can also through a short deduction recover another description: if a finite subset $A$ of an abelian group $G$ is such that the distribution of the sums $a+b$ with $(a,b) \in A \times A$ is only slightly more spread out than the uniform distribution on $A$, then $A$ has small symmetric difference with some finite coset of $G$. The resulting bounds are necessarily sharp up to a logarithmic factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that two automorphisms of an affine surface with dynamical degree strictly larger than 1 share a Zariski dense set of periodic points if and only if they have the same periodic points. We construct canonical heights for these automorphisms and use arithmetic equidistribution for adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties following the work of Yuan and Zhang. Finally, we extend the local arithmetic Hodge index theorem to a certain class of vertical adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties to conclude the proof.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, for any $c_1,c_2,c_3\in(1,41/35)$, every sufficiently large odd number $N$ can be represented as the sum of three primes $N = p_1 + p_2 +p_3$ such that $p_i = \lfloor n_{i}^{c_i}\rfloor$ for some $n_i \in{\mathbb N}$ for each $1 \leq i \leq 3$. Our arguments are based on a variant of Green's transference principle due to Matom\"aki, Maynard and Shao. We prove a necessary restriction estimate using Bourgain's strategy and employ Harman's sieve method to optimize our upper bound for $c_i$.</description>

      <title>A new generalized prime random approximation procedure and some of its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.08478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new random approximation method that yields the existence of a discrete Beurling prime system $\mathcal{P}=\{p_{1}, p_{2}, \dotso\}$ which is very close in a certain precise sense to a given non-decreasing, right-continuous, nonnegative, and unbounded function $F$. This discretization procedure improves an earlier discrete random approximation method due to H. Diamond, H. Montgomery, and U. Vorhauer [Math. Ann. 334 (2006), 1-36], and refined by W.-B. Zhang [Math. Ann. 337 (2007), 671-704].
  We obtain several applications. Our new method is applied to a question posed by M. Balazard concerning Dirichlet series with a unique zero in their half plane of convergence, to construct examples of very well-behaved generalized number systems that solve a recent open question raised by T. Hilberdink and A. Neamah in [Int. J. Number Theory 16 05 (2020), 1005-1011], and to improve the main result from [Adv. Math. 370 (2020), Article 107240], where a Beurling prime system with regular primes but extremely irregular integers was constructed.</description>

      <title>Efficient resolution of Thue-Mahler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Thue-Mahler equation is a Diophantine equation of the form $$F(X,Y) = a\cdot p_1^{z_1}\cdots p_v^{z_v}, \qquad \gcd(X,Y)=1$$ where $F$ be an irreducible homogeneous binary form of degree at least $3$ with integer coefficients, $a$ is a non-zero integer and $p_1, \dots, p_v$ are rational primes. Existing algorithms for resolving such equations require computations in the number field obtained by adjoining three roots of $F(X,1)=0$. We give a new algorithm that requires computations only in the number field obtained by adjoining one root, making it far more suited for higher degree examples. We also introduce a lattice sieving technique reminiscent of the Mordell--Weil sieve that makes it practical to tackle Thue--Mahler equations of higher degree and with larger sets of primes. We give several examples including one of degree $11$.
  Let $P(m)$ denote the largest prime divisor of an integer $m \ge 2$. As an application of our algorithm we determine all pairs $(X,Y)$ of coprime non-negative integers such that $P(X^4-2Y^4) \le 100$, finding that there are precisely $49$ such pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an earlier book of Arthur, the endoscopic classification of representations of quasi-split orthogonal and symplectic groups was established. Later Mok gave that of quasi-split unitary groups. After that, Kaletha, Minguez, Shin, and White gave that of non-quasi-split unitary groups for generic parameters. In this paper we prove the endoscopic classification of representations of non-quasi-split odd special orthogonal groups for generic parameters, following Kaletha, Minguez, Shin, and White.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every sum of squares in the rational function field in two variables $K(X,Y)$ over a hereditarily pythagorean field $K$ is a sum of $8$ squares. More precisely, we show that the Pythagoras number of every finite extension of $K(X)$ is at most $5$. The main ingredients of the proof are a local-global principle for quadratic forms over function fields in one variable over a complete rank-$1$ valued field due to V. Mehmeti and a valuation theoretic characterization of hereditarily pythagorean fields due to L. Br\"ocker.</description>

      <title>Ideal class groups of division fields of elliptic curves and everywhere unramified rational points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$, $p$ an odd prime number and $n$ a positive integer. In this article, we investigate the ideal class group $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathbb{Q}(E[p^n]))$ of the $p^n$-division field $\mathbb{Q}(E[p^n])$ of $E$. We introduce a certain subgroup $E(\mathbb{Q})_{\mathrm{ur},p^n}$ of $E(\mathbb{Q})$ and study the $p$-adic valuation of the class number $\#\mathrm{Cl}(\mathbb{Q}(E[p^n]))$. In addition, when $n = 1$, we further study $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathbb{Q}(E[p]))$ as a $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[p])/\mathbb{Q})$- module. More precisely, we study the semi-simplification $(\mathrm{Cl}(\mathbb{Q}(E[p]))\otimes \mathbb{Z}_p)^{\mathrm{ss}}$ of $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathbb{Q}(E[p]))\otimes \mathbb{Z}_p$ as a $\mathbb{Z}_p[\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[p])/\mathbb{Q})]$-module. We obtain a lower bound of the multiplicity of the $E[p]$-component in the semi-simplification when $E[p]$ is an irreducible $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[p])/\mathbb{Q})$-module.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev's bias for Fermat curves of prime degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that an asymptotic formula for the prime number race with respect to Fermat curves of prime degree is equivalent to part of the Deep Riemann Hypothesis (DRH), which is a conjecture on the convergence of partial Euler products of $L$-functions on the critical line. We also show that such an equivalence holds for some quotients of Fermat curves. As an application, we compute the order of zero at $s=1$ for the second moment $L$-functions of those curves under DRH.</description>

      <title>Sparse distribution of lattice points in annular regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is inspired by Richards' work on large gaps between sums of two squares [10]. It is shown in [10] that there exist arbitrarily large values of $\lambda$ and $\mu$, where $\mu \geq C \log \lambda$, such that intervals $[\lambda, \,\lambda + \mu ]$ do not contain any sums of two squares. Geometrically, these gaps between sums of two squares correspond to annuli in $\mathbb R^2$ that do not contain any integer lattice points. A major objective of this paper is to investigate the sparse distribution of integer lattice points within annular regions in $\mathbb R^2$. Specifically, we establish the existence of annuli $\{x\in \mathbb R^2: \lambda \leq |x|^2 \leq \lambda + \kappa\}$ with arbitrarily large $\lambda$ and $\kappa \geq C \lambda^s$ for $0&lt;s&lt;\frac{1}{4}$, satisfying that any two integer lattice points within any one of these annuli must be sufficiently far apart. This result is sharp, as such a property ceases to hold at and beyond the threshold $s=\frac{1}{4}$. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to include the sparse distribution of lattice points in spherical shells in $\mathbb R^3$.</description>

      <title>Applications of Moments of Dirichlet Coefficients in Elliptic Curve Families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moments of the coefficients of elliptic curve L-functions are related to numerous arithmetic problems. Rosen and Silverman proved a conjecture of Nagao relating the first moment of one-parameter families satisfying Tate's conjecture to the rank of the corresponding elliptic surface over Q(T); one can also construct families of moderate rank by finding families with large first moments. Michel proved that if j(T) is not constant, then the second moment of the family is of size p^2 + O(p^(3/2)); these two moments show that for suitably small support the behavior of zeros near the central point agree with that of eigenvalues from random matrix ensembles, with the higher moments impacting the rate of convergence.
  In his thesis, Miller noticed a negative bias in the second moment of every one-parameter family of elliptic curves over the rationals whose second moment had a calculable closed-form expression, specifically the first lower order term which does not average to zero is on average negative. This Bias Conjecture is confirmed for many families; however, these are highly non-generic families whose resulting Legendre sums can be determined. Inspired by the recent successes by Yang-Hui He, Kyu-Hwan Lee, Thomas Oliver, Alexey Pozdnyakov and others in investigations of murmurations of elliptic curve coefficients with machine learning techniques, we pose a similar problem for trying to understand the Bias Conjecture. As a start to this program, we numerically investigate the Bias Conjecture for a family whose bias is positive for half the primes. Since the numerics do not offer conclusive evidence that negative bias for the other half is enough to overwhelm the positive bias, the Bias Conjecture cannot be verified for the family.</description>

      <title>Bogomolov property for certain infinite non-Galois extensions</title>

Abstract: For an algebraic number $\alpha$, let $h(\alpha)$ denote its logarithmic Weil height. In 2002, Bombieri and Zannier obtained lower bounds for Weil height for totally $p$-adic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$, i.e., infinite Galois extension over $\mathbb{Q}$ with finite local degree over a rational prime $p$. In this paper, we formulate and prove the non-Galois analogue of this result. In particular, it leads to a $p$-adic equidistribution result i.e., if a positive proportion of conjugates of $\alpha\in\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ lie in a finite local extension $K_{v}/\mathbb{Q}_p$, then we obtain absolute lower bound for $h(\alpha)$. We also undertake the analoguous problem for canonical height of an elliptic curve $E/K$ and obtain explicit lower bounds for them on certain non-Galois infinite extensions.</description>

      <title>The Square-Root Law Does Not Hold in the Presence of Zero Divisors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite ring and define the paraboloid $P = \{(x_1, \dots, x_d)\in R^d|x_d = x_1^2 + \dots + x_{d-1}^2\}.$ Suppose that for a sequence of finite rings of size tending to infinity, the Fourier transform of $P$ satisfies a square-root law for some fixed constant $C$. Then all but finitely many of the rings are fields. Most of our argument works in greater generality: let $f$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients in $d-1$ variables, with a fixed order of variable multiplications (so that it defines a function $R^{d-1}\rightarrow R$ even when $R$ is noncommutative), and set $V_f = \{(x_1, \dots, x_d)\in R^d|x_d = f(x_1, \dots, x_{d-1})\}$. If (for a sequence of finite rings of size tending to infinity) we have a square root law for the Fourier transform of $V_f$, then all but finitely many of the rings are fields or matrix rings of small dimension. We also describe how our techniques let us see that certain varieties do not satisfy a square root law even over finite fields.</description>

Abstract: Given a correspondence $V$ between a connected Shimura variety $S$, a commutative connected algebraic group $G$, and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we prove that the $V$-images of any $n$ special points on $S$ outside a proper Zariski closed subset are algebraically independent. Our result unifies previous unlikely intersection results on multiplicative independence and linear independence. We prove multiplicative independence of differences of singular moduli, generalizing previous results by Pila-Tsimerman, and Aslanlyan-Eterovi\'c-Fowler. We also give an application to abelian varieties by proving that the special points of $S$ whose $V$-images lie in a finite-rank subgroup of $T$ are contained in a finite union of proper special subvarieties of $S$, only dependent on the rank of the subgroup. In this way, our result is a generalization of the works of Pila-Tsimerman and Buium-Poonen.</description>

Abstract: This book presents two important results in p-adic Hodge theory following the approach initiated by Faltings, namely (i) his main p-adic comparison theorem, and (ii) the Hodge-Tate spectral sequence. We establish for each of these results two versions, an absolute one and a relative one. While the absolute statements can reasonably be considered as well understood, particularly after their extension to rigid varieties by Scholze, Faltings' initial approach for the relative variants has remained much less studied. Although we follow the same strategy as that used by Faltings to establish his main p-adic comparison theorem, part of our proofs is based on new results. The relative Hodge-Tate spectral sequence is new in this approach.</description>

Abstract: Faltings initiated in 2005 a p-adic analogue of the (complex) Simpson correspondence whose construction has been taken up by various authors, according to several approaches. Following the one we initiated previously, we develop in this new monograph new features of the p-adic Simpson correspondence, inspired by our construction of the relative Hodge-Tate spectral sequence. First, we address the connection to Hodge-Tate local systems. Second, we establish the functoriality of the p-adic Simpson correspondence by proper direct image. Along the way, we expand the scope of our original construction.
  Faltings a d\'egag\'e en 2005 un analogue p-adique de la correspondance de Simpson (complexe) dont la construction a \'et\'e reprise par diff\'erents auteurs, selon plusieurs approches. Poursuivant celle que nous avons initi\'ee pr\'ec\'edemment, nous d\'eveloppons dans la pr\'esente monographie de nouveaux aspects de la correspondance de Simpson p-adique, inspir\'es par notre construction de la suite spectrale de Hodge-Tate relative. Nous traitons tout d'abord du lien avec les syst\`emes locaux de Hodge-Tate. Nous \'etablissons ensuite la fonctorialit\'e de la correspondance de Simpson p-adique par image directe propre. Chemin faisant, nous \'elargissons la port\'ee de notre construction initiale.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Quotient Polynomials with Applications to Exact Divisibility and Divisibility Testing of Sparse Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for monic polynomials $f, g \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ such that $g$ divides $f$, the $\ell_2$-norm of the quotient polynomial $f/g$ is bounded by $\lVert f \rVert_1 \cdot \tilde{O}(\lVert{g}\rVert_0^3\text{deg}^2{ f})^{\lVert{g}\rVert_0 - 1}$. This improves upon the previously known exponential (in $\text{deg}{ f}$) bounds for general polynomials. Our results implies that the trivial long division algorithm runs in quasi-linear time relative to the input size and number of terms of the quotient polynomial $f/g$, thus solving a long-standing problem on exact divisibility of sparse polynomials.
  We also study the problem of bounding the number of terms of $f/g$ in some special cases. When $f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $g$ is a cyclotomic-free (i.e., it has no cyclotomic factors) trinomial, we prove that $\lVert{f/g}\rVert_0 \leq O(\lVert{f}\rVert_0 \text{size}({f})^2 \cdot \log^6{\text{deg}{ g}})$. When $g$ is a binomial with $g(\pm 1) \neq 0$, we prove that the sparsity is at most $O(\lVert{f}\rVert_0 ( \log{\lVert{f}\rVert_0} + \log{\lVert{f}\rVert_{\infty}}))$. Both upper bounds are polynomial in the input-size. We leverage these results and give a polynomial time algorithm for deciding whether a cyclotomic-free trinomial divides a sparse polynomial over the integers.
  As our last result, we present a polynomial time algorithm for testing divisibility by pentanomials over small finite fields when $\text{deg}{ f} = \tilde{O}(\text{deg}{ g})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the difference analogue of Stothers-Mason theorem for entire functions of order less than 1, which can be seen as difference $abc$ theorem for entire functions with slow growth. We also obtain the difference analogue of truncated version of Nevanlinna second main theorem which reveals that meromorphic functions which are of hyper order less than 1 except periodic functions with period one cannot have too many points with long height in the complex plane. Both theorems depend on new definitions of height of shifting poles and shifting zeros of a given meromorphic function in a domain.</description>

Abstract: We show that even dimensional Fermat cubic hypersurfaces are rational over any field of characteristic different from three by producing explicit rational parametrizations given by polynomials of low degree. As a byproduct of our rationality constructions we get estimates on the number of their rational points over a number field, and a class of quadro-cubic Cremona correspondences of even dimensional projective spaces.</description>
