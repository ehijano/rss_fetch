      <title>Understanding Molecular Basis of PTPN11-Related Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PTPN11 gene encodes the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2), a key regulator of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis through its modulation of various signaling pathways, including the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. Missense variants in PTPN11 disrupt SHP2's proper catalytic activity and the regulation of signaling pathways, leading to disorders such as Noonan syndrome (NS), LEOPARD syndrome (LS), or juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). These missense variants have molecular disruptions resulting in gains and losses of function at both the molecular and phenotypic levels. Depending on their location within SHP2, missense substitutions disrupt inter-domain regulation or impair phosphatase function, resulting in altered phosphatase activity. In this study, we investigate the molecular basis underlying the differential pathogenicity of PTPN11 missense variants and predict the structural consequences of these variants using MutPred2 and AlphaFold2. We find that LOF and GOF variants display distinct functional mechanisms in sodium and DNA binding, and that NS-associated missense variants identified in fetuses with ultrasound-detected anomalies and familiar cases are more likely to be pathogenic.</description>

      <title>Treatment of phenol wastewater by electro-Fenton oxidative degradation based on efficient iron-based-gas diffusion-photocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel iron-based gas diffusion electrode-photocatalytic system aimed at enhancing the degradation of phenolic compounds in wastewater. Phenolic compounds are toxic environmental pollutants with significant resistance to biodegradation. The traditional methods for treating phenol wastewater, including biological treatments and adsorption techniques, often fall short in achieving complete mineralization. Our approach utilizes a dual-chamber electrochemical setup integrating stainless steel felt-2-EAQ gas diffusion electrodes with TiO2 photocatalysis. This combination significantly boosts hydroxyl radical production, critical for effective pollutant breakdown. Experimentally, the system achieved up to 92% degradation efficiency for phenol at an optimized operating current of 10 mA/cm^2 in 3 hours, surpassing traditional methods. Additionally, energy consumption was reduced by 40% compared to conventional electro-Fenton systems. The stability tests indicated that the electrodes maintain over 80% of their initial activity after five cycles of use. These findings suggest that our system offers a more sustainable and efficient solution for treating phenolic wastewater by enhancing both degradation rates and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>MDIntrinsicDimension: Dimensionality-Based Analysis of Collective Motions in Macromolecules from Molecular Dynamics Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide atomistic insights into the structure, dynamics, and function of biomolecules by generating time-resolved, high-dimensional trajectories. Analyzing such data benefits from estimating the minimal number of variables required to describe the explored conformational manifold, known as the intrinsic dimension (ID). We present MDIntrinsicDimension, an open-source Python package that estimates ID directly from MD trajectories by combining rotation- and translation-invariant molecular projections (e.g., backbone dihedrals and inter-residue distances) with state-of-the-art estimators. The package provides three complementary analysis modes: whole-molecule ID; sliding windows along the sequence; and per-secondary-structure elements. It computes both overall ID (a single summary value) and instantaneous, time-resolved ID that can reveal transitions and heterogeneity over time. We illustrate the approach on fast folding-unfolding trajectories from the DESRES dataset, demonstrating that ID complements conventional geometric descriptors by highlighting spatially localized flexibility and differences across structural segments.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Scoring Ebolavirus Protein-protein Docking Models Using PIsToN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein-protein docking is crucial for understanding how proteins interact. Numerous docking tools have been developed to discover possible conformations of two interacting proteins. However, the reliability and success of these docking tools rely on their scoring function. Accurate and efficient scoring functions are necessary to distinguish between native and non-native docking models to ensure the accuracy of a docking tool. Like in other fields where deep learning methods have been successfully utilized, these methods have also introduced innovative scoring functions. An outstanding tool for scoring and differentiating native-like docking models from non-native or incorrect conformations is called Protein binding Interfaces with Transformer Networks (PIsToN). PIsToN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art scoring functions. Using models of complexes obtained from binding the Ebola Virus Protein VP40 to the host cell's Sec24c protein as an example, we show how to evaluate docking models using PIsToN.</description>

      <title>cryoSENSE: Compressive Sensing Enables High-throughput Microscopy with Sparse and Generative Priors on the Protein Cryo-EM Image Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12931v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) enables the atomic-resolution visualization of biomolecules; however, modern direct detectors generate data volumes that far exceed the available storage and transfer bandwidth, thereby constraining practical throughput. We introduce cryoSENSE, the computational realization of a hardware-software co-designed framework for compressive cryo-EM sensing and acquisition. We show that cryo-EM images of proteins lie on low-dimensional manifolds that can be independently represented using sparse priors in predefined bases and generative priors captured by a denoising diffusion model. cryoSENSE leverages these low-dimensional manifolds to enable faithful image reconstruction from spatial and Fourier-domain undersampled measurements while preserving downstream structural resolution. In experiments, cryoSENSE increases acquisition throughput by up to 2.5$\times$ while retaining the original 3D resolution, offering controllable trade-offs between the number of masked measurements and the level of downsampling. Sparse priors favor faithful reconstruction from Fourier-domain measurements and moderate compression, whereas generative diffusion priors achieve accurate recovery from pixel-domain measurements and more severe undersampling.

      <title>Reaction Prediction via Interaction Modeling of Symmetric Difference Shingle Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction prediction remains a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry, where existing machine learning models face two critical limitations: sensitivity to input permutations (molecule/atom orderings) and inadequate modeling of substructural interactions governing reactivity. These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which extends the differential reaction fingerprint (DRFP) by representing shingles as continuous high-dimensional embeddings, capturing structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks. It shows enhanced robustness with an average improvement of 8.76% on R$^2$ under permutation perturbations.</description>
