      <title>A modular and scalable web platform for computational phylogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic analysis, which allow to understand the evolution of bacterial and viral epidemics, requires large quantities of data to be analysed and processed for knowledge extraction. One of the major challenges consists on the integration of the results from typing and phylogenetic inference methods with epidemiological data, namely in what concerns their integrated and simultaneous analysis and visualization. Numerous approaches to support phylogenetic analysis have been proposed, varying from standalone tools to integrative web applications that include tools and/or algorithms for executing the common analysis tasks for this kind of data. However, most of them lack the capacity to integrate epidemiological data. Others provide the ability for visualizing and analyzing such data, allowing the integration of epidemiological data but they do not scale for large data analysis and visualization. Namely, most of them run inference and/or visualization optimization tasks on the client side, which becomes often unfeasible for large amounts of data, usually implying transferring data from existing databases in order to be analysed. Moreover, the results and optimizations are not stored for reuse. We propose the PHYLOViZ Web Platform, a cloud based tool for phylogenetic analysis, that not only unifies the features of both existing versions of PHYLOViZ, but also supports structured and customized workflows for executing data processing and analyses tasks, and promotes the reproducibility of previous phylogenetic analyses. This platform supports large scale analyses by relying on a workflow system that enables the distribution of parallel computations on cloud and HPC environments. Moreover, it has a modular architecture, allowing easy integration of new methods and tools, as well as customized workflows, making it flexible and extensible.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of Training Set Size on Animal Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the automatic re-identification of animal individuals from images have opened up new possibilities for studying wildlife through camera traps and citizen science projects. Existing methods leverage distinct and permanent visual body markings, such as fur patterns or scars, and typically employ one of two strategies: local features or end-to-end learning. In this study, we delve into the impact of training set size by conducting comprehensive experiments across six different methods and five animal species. While it is well known that end-to-end learning-based methods surpass local feature-based methods given a sufficient amount of good-quality training data, the challenge of gathering such datasets for wildlife animals means that local feature-based methods remain a more practical approach for many species. We demonstrate the benefits of both local feature and end-to-end learning-based approaches and show that species-specific characteristics, particularly intra-individual variance, have a notable effect on training data requirements.</description>

      <title>A dissimilarity measure for semidirected networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semidirected networks have received interest in evolutionary biology as the appropriate generalization of unrooted trees to networks, in which some but not all edges are directed. Yet these networks lack proper theoretical study. We define here a general class of semidirected phylogenetic networks, with a stable set of leaves, tree nodes and hybrid nodes. We prove that for these networks, if we locally choose the direction of one edge, then globally the set of paths starting by this edge is stable across all choices to root the network. We define an edge-based representation of semidirected phylogenetic networks and use it to define a dissimilarity between networks, which can be efficiently computed in near-quadratic time. Our dissimilarity extends the widely-used Robinson-Foulds distance on both rooted trees and unrooted trees. After generalizing the notion of tree-child networks to semidirected networks, we prove that our edge-based dissimilarity is in fact a distance on the space of tree-child semidirected phylogenetic networks.</description>

      <title>Hidden Markov modelling of spatio-temporal dynamics of measles in 1750-1850 Finland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real world spatio-temporal datasets, and phenomena related to them, are often challenging to visualise or gain a general overview of. In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</description>

      <title>Exact phylodynamic likelihood via structured Markov genealogy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider genealogies arising from a Markov population process in which individuals are categorized into a discrete collection of compartments, with the requirement that individuals within the same compartment are statistically exchangeable. When equipped with a sampling process, each such population process induces a time-evolving tree-valued process defined as the genealogy of all sampled individuals. We provide a construction of this genealogy process and derive exact expressions for the likelihood of an observed genealogy in terms of filter equations. These filter equations can be numerically solved using standard Monte Carlo integration methods. Thus, we obtain statistically efficient likelihood-based inference for essentially arbitrary compartment models based on an observed genealogy of individuals sampled from the population.</description>

      <title>Rebound in epidemic control: How misaligned vaccination timing amplifies infection peaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the dynamic interplay between the timing of vaccination campaigns and the trajectory of disease spread in a population. Through comprehensive data analysis and modeling, we have uncovered a counter-intuitive phenomenon: initiating a vaccination process at an inopportune moment can paradoxically result in a more pronounced second peak of infections. This "rebound" phenomenon challenges the conventional understanding of vaccination impacts on epidemic dynamics. We provide a detailed examination of how improperly timed vaccination efforts can inadvertently reduce the overall immunity level in a population, considering both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Our findings reveal that such a decrease in population-wide immunity can lead to a delayed, yet more severe, resurgence of cases. This study not only adds a critical dimension to our understanding of vaccination strategies in controlling pandemics but also underscores the necessity for strategically timed interventions to optimize public health outcomes. Furthermore, we compute which vaccination strategies are optimal for a COVID-19 tailored mathematical model, and find that there are two types of optimal strategies. The first type prioritizes vaccinating early and rapidly to reduce the number of deaths, while the second type acts later and more slowly to reduce the number of cases; both of them target primarily the elderly population. Our results hold significant implications for the formulation of vaccination policies, particularly in the context of rapidly evolving infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Theory for Adaptive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01403v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation of adaptive dynamics, involving many degrees of freedom on two separated timescales, one for fast changes of state variables and another for the slow adaptation of parameters controlling the former's dynamics is crucial for understanding feedback mechanisms underlying evolutionary and learning processes. We present an extension of the Martin-Siggia-Rose-DeDominicis-Janssen (MSRDJ) path-integral approach to the study of nonequilibrium phase transitions in such dynamical systems. As an illustration, we apply our framework to biological adaptation under the genotype-phenotype feedback: phenotypic variations are shaped by the fast stochastic gene-expression dynamics and are coupled to the slow evolution of the distribution of genotypes, each encoded by a gene-regulatory network architecture. We establish that under this coevolution, genotypes responsible for high fitness are selected, leading to the emergence of phenotypic robustness within an intermediate level of environmental noise in reciprocal genetic networks.</description>

      <title>0-1 laws for pattern occurrences in phylogenetic trees and networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the question of determining the fraction of binary trees that contain a fixed pattern known as the snowflake was posed. We show that this fraction goes to 1, providing two very different proofs: a purely combinatorial one that is quantitative and specific to this problem; and a proof using branching process techniques that is less explicit, but also much more general, as it applies to any fixed patterns and can be extended to other trees and networks. In particular, it follows immediately from our second proof that the fraction of $d$-ary trees (resp. level-$k$ networks) that contain a fixed $d$-ary tree (resp. level-$k$ network) tends to $1$ as the number of leaves grows.</description>
