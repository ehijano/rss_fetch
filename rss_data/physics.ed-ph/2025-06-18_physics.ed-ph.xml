      <title>RoboBlimp: Enhancing Middle School STEM through Educational Bioinspired Blimps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the educational potential of Flappy, a low-cost, bioinspired robotic blimp platform modeled after the motion of manta rays, as a hands-on STEM learning tool for middle school students. Building on prior research emphasizing the role of social and bioinspired robotics in education, a one-day workshop was developed to introduce ten students to fundamental concepts in physics, engineering, and computer science. Participants constructed and programmed their own robotic blimps while engaging with a custom curriculum that incorporated visuals and collaborative activities. Quantitative analysis using pre- and post-assessments revealed significant learning gains, supported by a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test (p = 0.00195). Qualitative observations showed high levels of engagement, teamwork, and increased confidence with technical vocabulary and tools. The results suggest that affordable, bioinspired robotics platforms like Flappy can effectively enhance STEM comprehension and enthusiasm among younger learners, particularly when paired with structured, interactive instruction.</description>

      <title>Unique support from identity-based groups: Professional networks of women and LGBTQ+ physicists analyzed and compared by career sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a social network analysis of the professional support networks of 100 LGBTQ+ and/or women PhD physicists, comparing the networks based on the career sectors of academia, industry, and government/nonprofit. The methods for constructing and analyzing the ego networks, which are novel in many ways, are explained in greater detail in an earlier publication (Hatcher et. al., 2025). We use statistical tests of independence to explore differences between sectors in terms of whole network metrics, network composition based on alter characteristics, and support types. We find that alters associated with groups (like affinity groups and personal and professional interest groups) are more likely to provide identity-based and community building support, participants in Academia have fewer personal friends in their networks while those in Industry have more, participants in Government report less instrumental support, and those in Academia report less material support. These results and others lead to suggestions for employers in these sectors on how to better support these physicists, including continuing to promote participation in affinity and interest groups, providing more material support and/or personal time in the academic sector, and more instrumental support in the form of professional development or training in the government sector.</description>

      <title>SeePhys: Does Seeing Help Thinking? -- Benchmarking Vision-Based Physics Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19099v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SeePhys, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for LLM reasoning grounded in physics questions ranging from middle school to PhD qualifying exams. The benchmark covers 7 fundamental domains spanning the physics discipline, incorporating 21 categories of highly heterogeneous diagrams. In contrast to prior works where visual elements mainly serve auxiliary purposes, our benchmark features a substantial proportion of vision-essential problems (75%) that mandate visual information extraction for correct solutions. Through extensive evaluation, we observe that even the most advanced visual reasoning models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-pro and o4-mini) achieve sub-60% accuracy on our benchmark. These results reveal fundamental challenges in current large language models' visual understanding capabilities, particularly in: (i) establishing rigorous coupling between diagram interpretation and physics reasoning, and (ii) overcoming their persistent reliance on textual cues as cognitive shortcuts.</description>
