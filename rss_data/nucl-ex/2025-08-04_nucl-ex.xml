      <title>Evidence for shape coexistence in $^{120}$Sn from the first $0^+_3$ lifetime measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lifetime of the $0^+_3$ state in $^{120}$Sn was measured for the first time applying the fast-timing technique following thermal neutron capture. The mean lifetime of $\tau = 50(7)$~ps leads to a $E0$ transition strength of $10^3\times \rho^2(E0;0^+_3\rightarrow0^+_2) = 120(50)$, suggesting shape coexistence and a high degree of mixing between the $0^+_2$ and $0^+_3$ states. With the newly measured lifetime, the $B(E2;0^+_3\rightarrow 2^+_1)$ value is 0.50(7)~W.u., which reveals that the $\rho^2(E0;0^+_3\rightarrow0^+_1)$ increases by a factor of $\approx 3.4$ from $^{116}$Sn to $^{120}$Sn.</description>

      <title>Neutron emission following nuclear muon capture on palladium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy spectra of the neutrons emitted following nuclear muon capture on palladium isotopes ($A=104$, 105, 106, 108, and 110) were measured using isotopically enriched target. \item[Method] The experiment was performed at the MuSIC-M1 beamline at the Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP), Osaka University. The neutrons and $\gamma$ rays were detected with twenty-one liquid scintillators and BaF$_2$ detectors. The time-of-flight method was used to determine the neutron energy. \item[Results] Neutron energy spectra from 1\,MeV up to 20\,MeV were measured for five palladium isotopes, providing the first systematic data in the $A\sim100$ region. The spectral shapes were compared with the previous measurement for heavy nuclei and theoretical calculations. The neutron-neutron opening angle distribution was also measured and an indication of small angle correlation was found. \item[Conclusions] The spectral shape below 4\,MeV was well explained consistently with the previous measurement by the evaporation model introducing a mass number scaling. The neutron energy spectrum around 10\,MeV plays a key role in understanding the dynamics of the nuclear muon capture reaction because it is the result of the transition from the direct and pre-equilibrium neutron emission onto the evaporation process.</description>

      <title>Determination of proton and neutron contributions to the $0_{g.s.}^+ \rightarrow 2_1^+$ excitations in $^{42}$Si and $^{44}$S using inelastic proton scattering in inverse kinematics and intermediate energy Coulomb excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have measured the $0_{g.s.}^+ \rightarrow 2_1^+$ transition in the neutron rich $N=28$ isotope $^{42}$Si using the probes of intermediate energy Coulomb excitation and inelastic proton scattering in inverse kinematics at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams with beam particle rates of $\approx 5$ particles/s. The results of these two measurements allowed us to determine $M_n/M_p$, the ratio of the neutron and proton transition matrix elements for the $0_{g.s.}^+ \rightarrow 2_1^+$ transition. In addition, we have measured the $0_{\mathrm{g.s.}}^+ \rightarrow 2_1^+$ transition in the isotone $^{44}$S using inverse kinematics inelastic proton scattering. By comparing the $^{44}$S proton scattering result with a recent intermediate energy Coulomb excitation result on the same transition, we were able to determine $M_n/M_p$ for the $0_{g.s.}^+ \rightarrow 2_1^+$ transition in this nucleus as well. This work strengthens the evidence that $^{42}$Si has a stable quadrupole deformation in its ground state and that $^{44}$S does not. Both conclusions are further supported by shell model calculations carried out with the FSU interaction.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric figure of merit and the deconfinement phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric phenomena are traditionally associated with the interconversion of thermal and electrical energy in many-body systems. In the context of high-temperature quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, thermoelectric responses can provide insight into the evolving microscopic dynamics and the redistribution of effective degrees of freedom across the phase transition region. In this work, for the first time, we present a phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit (\( ZT \)) in hot QCD matter, with a particular focus on its behavior across the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. Using model-based calculations for the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, we analyze the temperature dependence of \( ZT \) and identify characteristic features near the QCD phase transition temperature. Our results indicate that \( ZT \) exhibits nontrivial behavior near the transition region, reflecting the changing transport properties and active degrees of freedom in the medium. This phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit provides a complementary perspective to traditional transport studies and may provide critical insights for advancing the understanding of QCD matter through the transition region.</description>

      <title>Series Testing and Characterization of 1100 Hamamatsu H12700 Multianode Photomultiplier Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both the future CBM-RICH and the recently upgraded HADES-RICH use Hamamatsu H12700 Multi-Anode Photomultipliers (MAPMTs) as their photon detectors. To test the MAPMTs thoroughly before using them in the detectors, the photon sensors were qualified well in advance and a test bench was built to efficiently characterize each MAPMT. The test bench measures the single photoelectron gain, dark rate, relative efficiency, and afterpulse probability of each channel. This article describes the operating principle of the test bench and discusses the distributions of each measured quantity over 1,100 MAPMTs. Additionally, the long-term aging effects of the H12700 MAPMT are investigated based on repeated measurements of individual MAPMTs.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel contributions to the GDH sum rule from the J\"ulich-Bonn approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn (GDH) sum rule within a dynamical coupled-channel approach, the J\"ulich-Bonn model for light baryon resonances based on fits to an extensive data base of pion and photon induced data. Recently published photoproduction data for different observables with $\pi N$ and $\eta N$ final states are analyzed simultaneously with older data for the reactions $\pi N\to \pi N$, $\eta N$, $K\Lambda$, $K\Sigma$ and $\gamma p\to\pi N$, $\eta N$, $K\Lambda$, $K\Sigma$. The impact of the new data on the resonance spectrum is investigated and the contribution of the individual channels to the GDH integral is determined.</description>

      <title>Muonic X-Ray Measurement for the Nuclear Charge Distribution: the Case of Stable Palladium Isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: The nuclear charge radius and distribution are the most fundamental quantities of the atomic nucleus. From the muonic transition energies, the absolute charge radius has been experimentally obtained, while there have been no established methods to discuss the distribution.
  Purpose: The muonic transition energies for five palladium isotopes with the mass number $A = 104$, $105$, $106$, $108$ and $110$ were measured. The procedure to deduce the charge radii and the method to discuss the charge distribution from the muonic transition energies are proposed.
  Method: The experiment was performed at the MuSIC-M1 beamline at Research Center for Nuclear Physics, Osaka University. A continuous muon beam impinged on the enriched palladium targets. Muonic X rays were measured by high-purity germanium detectors.
  Results: The muonic transition energies up to $4f$-$3d$ transitions were determined for five palladium isotopes.
  Discussion and conclusion: The root-mean-square charge radii are deduced assuming the two-parameter Fermi distribution. The charge distribution of the nucleus is discussed employing the Barrett model. The muonic transition energies of the $3d$-$2p$ transitions are crucial to discuss both the charge radius and the charge distribution.</description>

      <title>Quenching of single-particle strength inferred from nucleon-removal transfer reactions on $^{15}$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The difference in the proton and neutron separation energies ($\Delta S$) of the weakly bound $^{15}$C ground state is -19.86 MeV, an extreme value. Data from intermediate-energy heavy-ion induced (HI-induced) knockout reactions on nuclei spanning $-20\lesssim\Delta S\lesssim+20$ MeV, suggest that the degree to which single-particle strength is quenched, $R\mathrm{_{s}}$, has a negative correlation with $\Delta S$, decreasing from unity around $-20$~MeV to around 0.2 at $+20$~MeV. For the $^{15}$C ground state ($R_s=0.96(4)$ in HI-induced knockout), contrasting results have recently been obtained via the neutron-adding transfer reaction, which reveal a value of $R_s=0.64(15)$, similar to the value observed at modest $\Delta S$ and more extreme values of $\Delta S$ with reaction probes other than HI knockout. In order to explore the any potential differences between $adding$ and $removing$ processes in transfer reactions at extreme $\Delta S$, single-neutron removal transfer reactions on $^{15}$C were performed at 7.1MeV/u in inverse kinematics. The removal of a valence neutron in 2$s_{1/2}$ orbit using both ($p$,$d$) and ($d$,$t$) reactions shows consistent quenching factors and agrees with those from the neutron-adding reaction. The present results, which can be compared with neutron knockout reaction, suggest that correlations, represented by the quenching factor, show limited dependence on neutron-proton asymmetry under the most extreme asymmetry conditions so far achieved in transfer reactions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of production branching ratio after muon nuclear capture reaction of Al and Si isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Muon nuclear capture is a reaction between a muon and a proton inside a nucleus through weak interactions. This reaction results in the formation of an excited nucleus, which subsequently de-excites by emitting several particles. Examination of the excited state allows for an investigation of the properties of nuclear excitation and particle emission in highly excited nuclei. Purpose: This study investigates muon nuclear capture of 27Al and 28,29,30Si, focusing on determining the absolute production branching ratio (BR) following muon nuclear capture and subsequent particle emissions. By measuring the absolute production BR, we can collect valuable information on the excitation energy distribution of muon nuclear capture. Methods: Measurements were conducted using the in-beam activation method at two pulsed muon facilities: RIKEN-RAL beamline and MLF at J-PARC. Absolute BRs were determined by measuring the number of muons irradiating the target using a plastic scintillator and the beta-delayed gamma-rays emitted from the produced nuclei using germanium detectors. Results: The absolute production branching ratios of muon nuclear capture on 27Al and 28,29,30Si were obtained with the highest accuracy to date. Predominant neutron emissions, even-odd atomic number dependence of particle emission probabilities, and influence of the neutron excess were observed. These results were compared with previous measurements and theoretical models and discussed regarding the excitation energy distribution, particle emission mechanism, and nuclear properties, such as resonance in the isovector transition. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the importance of considering nuclear structure effects, even-odd effects of proton and neutron numbers, neutron excess, nucleon pairing effect, and particle emission mechanisms, in the context of the muon nuclear capture reaction.</description>
