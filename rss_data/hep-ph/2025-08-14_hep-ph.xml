      <title>Dark Higgs-strahlung at Belle II: A distinctive dark sector signature with displaced vertices and missing energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photons with kinetic mixing are compelling mediators for the interactions between dark matter and Standard Model particles. While most experimental searches focus on fully visible or fully invisible decays of dark photons, we explore processes that involve dark Higgs-strahlung, i.e. the emission of a dark Higgs boson connected to the mass generation of the dark photon. If the dark Higgs boson is the lightest dark sector particle, it is expected to be long-lived and decay into Standard Model particles via Higgs mixing. At electron-positron colliders, dark Higgs-strahlung may occur either in isolation (leading to a single displaced vertex and missing energy) or accompanied by a photon from initial-state radiation. Both signatures offer distinctive kinematic features, such as peaks in photon energy or missing invariant mass, which enable efficient background suppression and enhances sensitivity beyond existing searches. Our study suggests that Belle II could significantly improve coverage of dark sector models by targeting this previously unexplored final state and that combining dark Higgs-strahlung events with and without additional photon offers great potential for reconstructing the properties of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>The Neutrino Kaleidoscope: Searches for Non-Standard Neutrino Oscillations at Neutrino Telescopes with a TeV Muon Accelerator Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon accelerators, a potential technology for enabling $\mathcal{O}$(10 TeV) parton center of mass energy collisions, would also source an intense, collimated beam of neutrinos at TeV energies. The energy and size of this beam would be excellently matched as a source for existing and planned neutrino telescopes: gigaton-sized detectors of astrophysical neutrinos at and above TeV energies. In this paper, we introduce the technical considerations and scientific reach of pairing a muon accelerator source of neutrinos with a neutrino telescope detector, a combination we dub the ''Neutrino Kaleidoscope''. In particular, such a pairing would enable searches for non-standard oscillations of the beam neutrinos as they traverse the earth between source and detector. These non-standard neutrino oscillations could be sourced by Lorentz invariance violation, which a neutrino kaleidoscope could probe up to the quantum gravity-motivated Planck scale. Such a search would also have a reach on sterile neutrinos orders of magnitude beyond existing terrestrial limits. Finally, we touch on some of the non-oscillation potential of a neutrino kaleidoscope.</description>

      <title>Charge dependence of mesons with flavored contact-interaction couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective interaction models of quantum chromodynamics, based on quark degrees of freedom, have been successfully employed to compute the properties of a large array of ground and excited meson and baryon states, along with their electromagnetic form factors, distribution functions and thermal behavior. Amongst them, the contact-interaction model, while non-renormalizable, implements confinement, satisfies Lorentz covariance and correctly describes chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking pattern. Original studies focused on the light hadron sector in the isospin limit and were thereafter extended to heavy mesons and baryons. The strong effective couplings, as well as infrared and ultraviolet regulators, are flavor-dependent model parameters adjusted to reproduce hadronic observables. In contrast, in this study we combine SU(4) flavor-symmetry breaking couplings, obtained from one-loop vacuum polarization amplitudes in the presence of background constituent quark currents, with the contact-interaction model. This allows us to reduce the number of mass-dimensioned parameters and to consistently relate all flavored couplings to a single mass scale, while the masses and weak decay constants of the pions, kaons, $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are in good agreement with average reference values. Allowing for realistic isospin breaking, $m_d/m_u = 1.7$, in conjunction with the effect of the flavored couplings, leads to a mass splitting, $m_{\pi^+}- m_{\pi^0} \approx 0.3$ MeV, that agrees with lattice QCD values. For the kaons, the mass difference is $m_{K^0}- m_{K^\pm} \approx 2.3$ MeV, whereas $m_{D^\pm} - m_{D^0} \approx 0.5$ MeV and the $\eta_c$ is 6\% lighter than the experimental mass.</description>

      <title>Control of nonlinear Compton scattering in a squeezed vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic radiation by accelerated charges is a fundamental process in physics. Here, we introduce a quantum-optical framework for controlling the emission of radiation of an electron in an intense laser field via squeezed vacuum states. By engineering the quantum fluctuations of the emission modes, we demonstrate that the probability of nonlinear Compton scattering can be significantly enhanced or suppressed through tunable squeezing amplitude and angle. Our predictions are experimentally accessible with current squeezing technologies, establishing a new paradigm for quantum control in high-intensity light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Effects of CPT violation on the neutrino charge radius in the Standard Model Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CPT-odd effects on the neutrino charge radius are studied within the Standard Model Extension. We consider CPT violation from the electroweak Yang-Mills sector, characterized by Lorentz-violating coefficients $(k_1)_\mu$ and $(k_2)_\mu$, which have positive mass units. The $\bar{\nu}\nu \gamma$ vertex arises at tree level via exchange of two $Z$ bosons. Although suppressed by $\frac{1}{m_Z^4}$, this process is notable. The vertex function $\Gamma_\mu$ includes three independent gauge structures satisfying the Ward identity $q^\mu \Gamma_\mu = 0$, characteristic of neutral particles, and induces gauge-independent electromagnetic form factors. Besides charge and anapole, two novel form factors appear. The charge form factor $f_Q(q^2)$ contains an energy-dependent term causing $f_Q(0)\neq 0$, so electromagnetic properties are undefined for real photons with CPT violation. Instead, $f_Q$ and the charge radius are defined in the static limit: $q^0=0$ and $\mathbf{q}\to 0$. Here, $f_Q(0, \mathbf{0})=0$ and a correction to the SM neutrino charge radius is found: \[ \langle r^2_\nu \rangle_{CPTV} = \frac{3c_{2W}}{2c_W^4} \left[\frac{k_2^2}{m_Z^2} + \frac{\mathbf{k}_2^2}{m_Z^2}\cos^2\theta_\gamma \right] \frac{1}{m_Z^2}, \] with $\theta_\gamma$ the angle between $\mathbf{q}$ and $\mathbf{k}_2$. Using recent bounds on $(k_i)_\mu$ and reasonable assumptions, we obtain a small correction $\langle r^2_\nu \rangle_{CPTV} \leq 0.83 \times 10^{-51}\ \mathrm{cm}^2$.</description>

      <title>Spinless glueballs in generalized linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the generalized linear sigma model, a comprehensive analysis of scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs and their mixing with mesons is presented. The Lagrangian of the model contains two chiral nonets, a quark-antiquark type and a two-quark two-antiquark type. The pseudoscalar and scalar glueballs are introduced through their connections with the axial and the trace anomalies of QCD, respectively. It is found that in order to satisfy the axial anomaly and at the same time accurately generate all seven eta masses, it is necessary to include at least two pseudoscalar glueballs, a physical one and an unphysical one that gets integrated out and yields an effective instanton-type term which is needed in generation of the eta masses. At the leading order, which corresponds to keeping effective terms in the Lagrangian that contain no more than eight underlying quarks and antiquarks, the mass spectrum of the model is worked out and shown to be in complete agreement with experiment. The quark and glue contents of the isosinglet scalars below 2 GeV, and of the isosinglet pseudoscalars up to around 2.2 GeV, are analyzed in detail and their correlations with the scalar glueball condensate are examined. Decay widths of isosinglet scalars as well as different self consistencies within this framework are used to probe the glueball condensate and thereby estimate the quark and glue contents of these states. In the pseudoscalar sector, the state that is dominantly made of glue is clearly a state with mass above 2 GeV. In the scalar sector, the identification of glue contents is less certain and in principle the three isosinglets in the 1.5-2.0 GeV can contain substantial glue. These glue contents are determined as functions of the scalar glueball condensate which is the key quantity in this analysis.</description>

      <title>Unitarization of the Sommerfeld enhancement through the renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a pair of dark matter particles interacts via a long-range force mediated by a light particle, their nonrelativistic annihilation cross section can be significantly enhanced - a phenomenon known as the Sommerfeld enhancement. This enhancement exhibits resonant behavior if the long-range potential supports shallow bound states or narrow resonances, which can lead to violations of the partial-wave unitarity bound. We identify the origin of this pathological behavior as the emergence of secular terms in perturbative expansions associated with low-energy composite states of the long-range potential. To address this issue, we propose a renormalization group improvement of the perturbative series. The resulting improved amplitude provides a unitarity-consistent form of the Sommerfeld enhancement, with its poles acquiring an imaginary part that reflects the decay width of the annihilating bound states. We also briefly discuss the implications of our approach from the perspective of Wilsonian renormalization group, and comment on its potential application to higher-order annihilation processes such as bound-state formation.</description>

      <title>The virtual contributions from $K^*$ in the $B \to K^*\pi h$ and $B \to K\rho h$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the significant virtual contributions of the subprocesses $D^{*}/B^{*}\to D\pi$ and $ \rho\to\omega \pi/K\bar{K}$ in the three-body hadronic $B$ meson decays, we study the off-shell effects of the resonance $K^*$ decaying into the $K^*\pi$ or $K\rho$ system in the decays $B \to K^*\pi h$ and $B \to K\rho h$ (with $h=\pi, K$) within the perturbative QCD approach. The strong coupling constants $g_{K^*K^*\pi}$ and $g_{K^*K\rho}$ involved in this work are derived from the coupling constant $g_{\rho\omega\pi}$ under the flavor SU$(3)$ symmetry. The $CP$ averaged branching fractions for the quasi-two-body decays $B\to K^*[\to K^*\pi] h$ and $B\to K^*[\to K\rho] h$ are predicted to be on the order of $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-7}$ in this study. And the branching fractions for the decays $B\to K^*[\to K\rho] h$ are found to be around half of the corresponding results for the $B\to K^*[\to K^*\pi] h$ channels, mainly due to the phase space difference between the $K\rho$ and $K^*\pi$ pairs originating from the intermediate state $K^*$. Experimental data for the $K^*$ decaying into the final states $K^*\pi$ and $K\rho$ in the $B$ meson decays is expected to be obtained by the LHCb and Belle-II experiments in the near future.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Mass Predictions with an AI-based Algorithm under $A_4$ Modular Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research undertakes a comprehensive exploration of neutrino mass model grounded in $A_4$ discrete non-Abelian modular symmetry formulated within a linear seesaw framework that modifies the conventional type-I seesaw structure with a focus on optimizing the model parameters using incomprehensible but intelligible-in-time logics optimization algorithm (ILA), an AI-based algorithm. In contrast to traditional discrete flavor symmetry frameworks, modular symmetry significantly reduces the number and complexity of flavon fields needed to generate realistic fermion mass textures. The key predictions include neutrino masses, $U_{PMNS}$ matrices, effective neutrino masses for neutrinoless double beta decay, beta decay, Dirac and Majorana CP violation phases for normal (NO) and inverted mass ordering (IO), offering testable implications. The working efficiency of the ILA optimization technique is also estimated. The optimized neutrino oscillation parameters are well consistent with recent experimental data. Our analysis also aligns with Planck cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses $0.06&lt;\Sigma m&lt;0.12$.</description>

      <title>$U$-spin sum rules for two-body decays of bottom baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $U$-spin symmetry, which reflects the symmetry between the down-type $d$ and $s$ quarks, is a powerful tool for analyzing heavy hadron weak decays. Motivated by recent experimental achievements in the bottom baryon sector, we study the $U$-spin sum rules for bottom baryon decays. The effective Hamiltonian for $b$ quark decay is zero under the $U$-spin lowering operators $U_-^n$, permitting us to derive $U$-spin sum rules involving only the $b\to d$ transition or $b\to s$ transition. Moreover, a new operator, $S_b=U_++rU_3-r^2U_-$, is proposed to generate $U$-spin sum rules involving both the $b\to d$ and $b\to s$ transitions. The proof that the effective Hamiltonian for $b$ quark decay is zero under $U_-^n$ and $S_b$ is presented. The master formulas for generating $U$-spin sum rules for the two-body decays of bottom baryons involving $b\to c\overline cd/s$, $b\to c\overline ud/s$, $b\to u\overline ud/s$, and $b\to u\overline cd/s$ transitions are derived. Numerous $U$-spin sum rules for the two-body decays of bottom baryons are obtained through these master formulas. The sum rules provide hints for new decay modes and enable the extraction of dynamical information. As phenomenological analyses, several branching fractions are predicted according to the $U$-spin symmetry. The $U$-spin conjugate modes in $b\to u\overline ud/s$ transitions, for which $CP$ asymmetry ratios can be estimated from branching fractions in the $U$-spin limit, are presented.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of $\mathrm{U(1)_X}$ Breaking and Right-Handed Neutrino Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) leaves several fundamental questions unanswered, including the origin of neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, and the nature of dark matter. Motivated by these gaps, we investigate an extension of the SM with an additional local $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry and a complex scalar singlet that spontaneously breaks this symmetry via its vacuum expectation value. The extended framework naturally accommodates three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to ensure anomaly cancellation and implements a type-I seesaw mechanism for active neutrino masses. We perform a detailed numerical analysis demonstrating consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, including predictions for the effective Majorana mass parameter relevant to neutrinoless double beta decay. Furthermore, we estimate the key parameters of the first-order phase transition and compute the resulting stochastic gravitational wave spectrum, demonstrating that it can lie within the reach of forthcoming experiments such as LISA, DECIGO, BBO, and the Einstein Telescope. The right-handed neutrinos also open a viable path for thermal leptogenesis, providing a unified link between neutrino mass generation, baryogenesis, and gravitational wave signatures. Our results demonstrate that this minimal $U(1)_X$ scenario remains a promising probe for physics beyond the Standard Model, accessible through upcoming gravitational wave and neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Multipolar transitions excited by twisted photons in heavy quarkonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the excitation of multipole transitions in quarkonium systems by high-energy photons carrying orbital angular momentum. We derive explicit expressions for the amplitude and probability of photoexcitation incorporating the dynamics of the quarkonium center of mass. It is shown that the leading contribution to the transitions induced by twisted photons comes from the multipole $j=|m_\gamma|$ and $m_\gamma=l'-l$ in the long-wave approximation. Despite the fact that similar transitions can be excited by plane-wave photons, twisted photons with $|m_\gamma|&gt;1$ enable the isolation of higher multipoles offering a unique spectroscopic tool. The fulfillment of the derived selection rules imposes constraints on the parameters of the wave packet of the quarkonium center of mass, since, in general, the angular momentum can be transferred to the center of mass. As a case study, we examine the octupole transition $1^{3}G_3 \rightarrow 3^{3}P_0$ in the charmonium system. We also compare the probabilities of excitation of this multipole transition by plane-wave and twisted photons with different polarizations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present state-of-the-art predictions for the inclusive cross section of gluon-initiated $ZH$ production, following the recommendations of the LHC Higgs Working Group. In particular, we include NLO QCD corrections, where the virtual corrections are obtained from the combination of a forward expansion and a high-energy expansion, and the real corrections are exact. The expanded results for the virtual corrections are compared in detail to full numerical results. The updated predictions show a reduction of the scale uncertainties to the level of 15%, and they include an estimate of the top-mass-scheme uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: We present a critical assessment of the present $B$ anomalies in the exclusive $b \to s \ell\ell$ mode based on the QCD factorisation approach (QCDf). In particular, we analyse the impact of different local form factor calculations and of the largest bin in the low-$q^2$ region.
  We also present a model-independent analysis of the new results of the CMS experiment on the $B \to K^* \mu^+\mu^-$ angular observables and compare them with the corresponding LHCb data. In addition, we update the global fit by including all $b \to s$ observables incorporating the new data from CMS. In these analyses, we use 10% or higher guesstimates of the non-factorisable power corrections as additional uncertainties, serving as a placeholder for robust estimates of these contributions.
  Updating earlier results, we also analyse the combined LHCb and CMS data on the $B \to K^* \mu^+\mu^-$ angular observables using data-driven approaches to find indications whether these tensions between the QCDf predictions and the present data are due to underestimated subleading hadronic contributions or due to new physics effects.</description>

      <title>Bubble Trouble: a Review on Electroweak Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the universal asymmetry between matter and antimatter remains a mystery. Electroweak baryogenesis is a well-motivated mechanism for generating the asymmetry dynamically, using interesting features of the Standard Model. In addition, it relies on beyond-the-Standard Model physics active around the electroweak scale: new physics coupling to the Higgs to make the electroweak phase transition first order, and a new mechanism of CP violation. The relatively low energy scale at which electroweak baryogenesis occurs makes certain aspects of the mechanism testable through collider experiments, electric dipole moment measurements, and gravitational wave observations. However, scenarios of electroweak baryogenesis are increasingly challenged by results from contemporary experiments. The developing experimental programs will play a crucial role in either falsifying or detecting the new physics responsible for electroweak baryogenesis. To achieve this, it is essential to make precise predictions for the baryon asymmetry and the corresponding experimental signatures within specific scenarios. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the rich physics involved in these predictions. Our goal is to offer a practical computational guide, with a focus on recent developments in the field.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity and Entanglement in Particle Physics and Gravitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some approaches to Quantum Gravity (QG) entail decoherence of quantum matter propagating in it, due to an ``environment'' of QG degrees of freedom inaccessible to low-energy observers. In the first part of this talk, I discuss potential, and rather unique, effects of QG-induced decoherence on entangled particle states, specifically an induced modification of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations of entangled neutral-meson states in meson factories ($\omega$-effect). In the second part, I summarise a recent work in which axion-like fields, forming a kind of condensate clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) astrophysical black holes, can lead to superradiant instabilities, and, through these, to the production of EPR-like entangled states of gravitons, with the entanglement pertaining to (left, right) polarisation degrees of freedom. In the presence of axions and Kerr geometries, there are non-trivial gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS)-type anomalous terms in the respective low-energy gravitational effective actions. Depending on whether the graviton entanglement is due to the non-anomalous terms (of General-Relativity type) in the effective action, or to the gCS terms, one obtains different structures of the resulting entangled squeezed-graviton states, which resemble somewhat the $\omega$-effect.</description>

      <title>Probing ALP-photon couplings in Neutron Stars: scalar versus pseudoscalar cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of an interacting axion-like massive field within a magnetized Neutron Star. For this we consider the effect of an intense density-dependent axially symmetric stellar magnetic field ${\bf B}(r,\theta)$ adding another much weaker, but non-vanishing, electric field. We particularize the latter for the case when a finite chiral charge density is present. The axion field is thus coupled to a generic function $Q(F_0,G_0)$ depending on Lorentz invariants $F_0, G_0$ which can be constructed from these electromagnetic fields. From this, the static axion field equations are solved as function of stellar radial coordinate and angular direction, $a(r,\theta)$, using a prescribed linear form for $Q$. In addition, we use a semi-analytical approach to calculate the stellar structure in this hybrid system where pressure components are treated under a perturbative scheme, provided induced deformations with respect to spherical symmetry are tiny. Our results show that the axion couplings to magnetic and electric fields along with its mass, critically determine the axion spatial distribution. Furthermore, we focus on the possibility that the axion field might accumulate in specific outer regions of the star, particularly within the crust, where it could form a condensate. We explore the possible presence of magnetic flux tubes from superconductor phases in this outer layers and qualitatively show they may enhance local conversion into photons. We explore prospects of detectability through indirect methods.</description>

      <title>Generation of High Order Harmonics in Vacuum for Various Configurations of Interacting Electromagnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High order harmonic (HOH) generation by interacting extremely intense electromagnetic waves in the quantum vacuum is investigated within the framework of the Heisenberg-Euler formalism. We consider here the process in the lowest order of a perturbation theory relative to the electromagnetic (EM) beam intensity, giving contribution to the HOH generation. The main expressions are obtained for a general geometry, whyle polarizations of different sub-beams forming the EM beam focus are almost the same. Nevertheless, explicit expressions for the HOH generation are derived for the $4\pi$-dipole in-coming waves and for the two crossing Gaussian beams. The former geometry of the EM beam is optimal at a given EM wave power, whereas the latter one is more realistic from the experimental point of view. We consider also a relationship of our present general results with the results, obtained earlier for the HOH generation during of collision of two plane electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Strings from Almost Nothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that string theory emerges inevitably from a few simple assumptions about physical scattering. Consistency alone requires that all tree-level four-point scattering amplitudes exhibit vanishing residues at prescribed values of the momentum transfer. Assuming ultrasoft high-energy behavior, we then prove that the space of minimally consistent amplitudes, whose residues exhibit these mandated zeros and nothing more, are precisely the amplitudes of Veneziano and Virasoro-Shapiro, thus establishing the uniqueness of strings. Similar logic also applies to five-point scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the chiral symmetry of the Standard Model is not explicitly broken by its ABJ anomaly, but is instead made non-invertible. In this work, I quantify the breaking of non-invertible symmetries of this type by calculating the symmetry breaking scales and effective charges $q(r)$ originally studied for continuous invertible higher-form symmetries. As an example I consider the explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry of massless QED by introducing Yukawa couplings between the electron and a massive real scalar in the UV. I briefly comment on how one might quantify the breaking of general non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a model of nuclear structure that takes into account the quark substructure of the baryons to understand the behavior of static two-point correlation functions of meson fields in dense nuclear matter. We show that these correlation functions display ``moat'' regimes, where the inverse static correlation function is nonmonotonic in momentum space. This can have interesting consequences for the nature of nuclear matter, and it strengthens the possibility of a liquid-crystal phase for high densities.</description>

      <title>Exact expressions for nonperturbative guiding center theory in symmetric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a recently-developed nonperturbative guiding center formalism to charged particle dynamics in fields with two-parameter continuous symmetry groups. This entails finding exact constants of motion, valid in the nonperturbative regime, that agree with Kruskal's adiabatic invariant series to all orders in the perturbative regime, when the field scale length is large compared with a typical gyroradius. We demonstrate that the nonperturbative guiding center model makes exact predictions in these cases, even though it eliminates the cyclotron timescale, thereby establishing a theoretical baseline for performance of the nonperturbative formalism.</description>

      <title>Linear Polarization in a Black Hole, 4U~1957+115 and its X-ray Spectral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new spectro-polarimetric method for estimation of the inclination of X-ray binaries using the linear polarization (LP) value in black hole (BH) sources, based on the early paper by Sunyaev \&amp; Titarchuk (1985, ST85). The X-ray LP arises from multiple scattering of initially soft photons in a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) using a flat geometry. ST85 showed that the LP degree $P$ depends on the binary inclination $i$ and remains independent of the photon energy. Moreover, the $P$ follows a characteristic angular distribution based on the CC optical depth $\tau_0$, in particular for $\tau_0 &gt;$ 10 the LP follows the Chandrasekhar (1950) distribution. In light of the vast number of recent IXPE spectro-polarimetric observations of BHs, testing this approach in combination with spectral analysis of these sources by other missions is desirable. In particular, the BH source, 4U 1957+115 was observed with IXPE in the high/soft state for which $P\sim 2\%$ was found (Marra et al. 2024). To apply the new method, in addition to knowing $P$ for a given source, it is necessary to estimate the CC optical depth $\tau_0$ and then to calculate of the best-fit photon index $\Gamma$ and the plasma temperature $kT_e$. We present the X-ray spectral analysis of 4U~1957+11 using data from IXPE, NuSTAR, NICER, RXTE}, Swift, Suzaku and ASCA. We show that the X-ray source spectra are well described by the Comptonization model with $\Gamma$ varying from 1.5 to 3. We find a monotonic increase in $\Gamma$ with the mass accretion rate, $\dot M$, and a final saturation of the index at $\Gamma\sim3$ for high $\dot M$. We determine a BH mass by the scaling method: $M_{1957}=4.8 \pm 1.8~M_{\odot}$, assuming a source distance of 22 kpc, using H 1743-322, 4U 1630-47, and GRS 1915+105 as reference sources.</description>

Abstract: Searching for radio pulsars orbiting around the Galactic centre black hole (BH), Sagittarius A$^\star$ (Sgr A$^\star$), represents a holy grail goal for large-area radio telescopes, in particular for the Square Kilometre Array. Follow-up timing observation of such a PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ binary system with an orbital period $\lesssim O(1\,{\rm year})$ will bring forward a handful of new tests on different aspects of fundamental physics that are barely accessible with other means. However, mass perturbation in the Galactic centre harms the gravitational cleanness of PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ systems. In order to flexibly account for perturbations, a numerical pulsar timing model is gradually being built, which can be used to probe the spacetime around Sgr A$^\star$ BH and study the nature of dark matter.</description>

Abstract: The electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of the nucleon are studied simultaneously using a covariant quark-diquark approach, and the pion cloud effect on the form factors is explicitly discussed. In this study, the electromagnetic form factors are calculated to determine the parameters of our approach. Then, the gravitational form factors of the nucleon are evaluated with the same parameters. The electromagnetic and mechanical properties, such as charge radii, magnetic moments, and mass radii are presented. Moreover, the D-term, which is believed to be connected with the internal force inside the nucleon, is also discussed in this paper. Our results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental and lattice results, and it is suggested that the pion cloud contribution plays an indispensable role, especially for the magnetic moments and the sign of D-term.</description>

Abstract: We propose a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge extension to the SM, in which the dark sector is stabilized through a matter parity symmetry preserved after spontaneous symmetry breaking. The fermion spectrum includes three neutral right-handed fields with $B-L$ charges $(-4,-4, 5)$, that make the model free of gauge anomalies. Two of these neutral fermion fields serve as mediators in a scotogenic mechanism for light-active Majorana neutrino masses. The corresponding neutrino mass matrix has rank 2, predicting a massless state and a lower bound for neutrinoless double beta decay. Regions in the parameter space consistent with dark matter relic abundance are accomplished by the lightest neutral mediator.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Neutrino-Dark Matter Interaction in DSNB and AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a neutrino-scalar dark matter (DM) $\nu\phi$ interaction encountering distinctive neutrino sources, namely Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The interaction is mediated by a fermionic particle $F$, in which the $\nu\phi$ scattering cross section characterizes different energy dependent with respect to the kinematic regions, and manifests itself through the attenuation of neutrino fluxes from these sources. We model the unscattered neutrino flux from DSNB via core-collapse supernova (CCSN) and star-formation rate (SFR), then incorporate the present Super-Kamionkande and future DUNE/Hyper-Kamiokande experiments to set limits on DM-neutrino interaction. For AGNs, NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056, where the neutrino carries energy above TeV, we select the kinematic region $m^2_F \gg E_\nu m_\phi \gg m^2_\phi$ such that the $\nu \phi$ scattering cross section features an enhancement at high energy. Furthermore, taking into account the DM spike profile at the center of AGN, we constrain on $m_\phi$ and scattering cross section via computing the neutrino flux at IceCube, where the $\phi\phi^*$ annihilation cross section is implemented to determine the saturation density of the spikes. Notice that the later results heavily rely on the existence of DM spike at the center of AGN, otherwise, our results may alter.</description>

Abstract: We report on the complete computation of the mixed QCD-electroweak corrections to the neutral-current Drell-Yan process. Our calculation holds in the entire range of dilepton invariant masses. We present phenomenological results for several kinematical distributions in the case of bare muons both in the resonant region and for high invariant masses. We also consider the forward-backward asymmetry, which is a key observable to measure the weak mixing angle. We finally extend our calculation to dressed leptons and compare our results in the massless limit to those available in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We discuss exclusive $\phi$-meson electroproduction off the proton near threshold within the GPD factorization framework. We propose the `threshold approximation' in which only the leading term of the conformal partial wave expansion of the meson production amplitudes is kept in both the quark and gluon exchange channels. We test the validity of this approximation to next-to-leading order in QCD and demonstrate the strong sensitivity of the cross section to the gluon and strangeness gravitational form factors. We also perform realistic event generator simulations both for Jefferson Lab and EIC kinematics and demonstrate the capabilities of future facilities for measuring near-threshold $\phi$ electroproduction.</description>

      <title>Exotic $h \to Z a$ Higgs decays into $\tau$ leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exotic Higgs decays are among the most promising areas to be explored at the High-Luminosity LHC, given the unprecedentedly large amount $(\sim 3 \times 10^8)$ of 125 GeV Higgs bosons that will be produced. In this context, we propose a new search channel for which the Higgs boson decays to a (leptonically decaying) $Z$ boson and a light BSM pseudoscalar $a$, which subsequently decays to a pair of $\tau$-leptons ($h \to Z a \to \ell\ell \tau\tau $). After performing a validation of existing ATLAS and CMS exotic Higgs decay searches in related channels, we analyze the HL-LHC projected sensitivity of our $a\to \tau\tau$ search, targeting the kinematic region where the exotic Higgs decay is two-body. We are able to probe pseudoscalar masses $m_a \in [5,\, 33]$ GeV by leveraging both leptonic and hadronic $\tau$ decays, and establish model-independent 95\% C.L. sensitivity projections on the branching fraction ${\rm BR}(h \to Z a) \times {\rm BR}(a \to \tau\tau)$. These $a\to \tau\tau$ projections yield a competitive probe of light pseudoscalars, which depending on the model can become significantly more sensitive than projections from existing experimental searches in $a \to \mu\mu$ and $a \to \gamma\gamma$ final states. Finally, we explore the potential of our search to probe an Axion-Like-Particle (ALP) solution to the muon $(g-2)$ anomaly (when taken face-value), finding that our proposed $h\to Z a$, $a\to\tau\tau$ search can provide valuable constraints on such ALP scenario, in complementarity with existing $h\to Z a$, $a \to \gamma\gamma$ experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Topological amplitudes of bottom baryon decays in the $SU(3)_F$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the first observation of CP violation in baryon decays, we study the topological amplitudes of bottom baryon decays in the $SU(3)_F$ limit. The topological diagrams of the charmless two-body decays of bottom baryons are presented in detail. The linear relations between topologies and $SU(3)$ irreducible amplitudes are derived through tensor contraction and $SU(3)$ decomposition. Four amplitudes among the 13 independent amplitudes are critical to the CP asymmetries. The small CP asymmetries might indicate small relative strong phases between amplitudes $A_2$ and $A_{12,14}^\prime$. To avoid them, we suggest measuring CP asymmetries in the $\Xi^0_b\to pK^-$ and $\Xi^-_b\to \Lambda^0 K^-$ decays. Furthermore, the K\"orner-Pati-Woo theorem can be tested by measuring the branching fractions of the $\Lambda_b^0\to\Sigma^0K^0_S$ and $\Lambda_b^0\to\Sigma^-K^+$ modes.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall dynamics from nonequilibrium quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the coupled dynamics between the bubble wall and the plasma from first principles using nonequilibrium quantum field theory. The commonly used equation of motion of the bubble wall in the kinetic approach is shown to be incomplete. In the language of the two-particle-irreducible effective action, the conventional equation misses higher-loop terms generated by the condensate-particle type vertices (e.g.,~$\varphi\phi\chi^2$, where $\varphi$ is the background field describing the bubble wall, $\phi$ the corresponding particle excitation and $\chi$ another particle species in the plasma). From the missing terms, we identify an additional dissipative friction which is contributed by particle production processes from the condensate-particle type vertices. We also show how other transmission processes beyond the 1-to-1 elementary transmission studied in the literature for ultrarelativistic bubble walls, e.g., 1-to-1 mixing and 1-to-2 transition radiation, can be understood from the kinetic approach.</description>

      <title>Post-hoc reweighting of hadron production in the Lund string model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for reweighting flavor selection in the Lund string fragmentation model. This is the process of calculating and applying event weights enabling fast and exact variation of hadronization parameters on pre-generated event samples. The procedure is post hoc, requiring only a small amount of additional information stored per event, and allowing for efficient estimation of hadronization uncertainties without repeated simulation. Weight expressions are derived from the hadronization algorithm itself, and validated against direct simulation for a wide range of observables and parameter shifts. The hadronization algorithm can be viewed as a hierarchical Markov process with stochastic rejections, a structure common to many complex simulations outside of high-energy physics. This perspective makes the method modular, extensible, and potentially transferable to other domains. We demonstrate the approach in Pythia, including both numerical stability and timing benefits.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Independent Orbital Decay Bounds on Ultralight Bosons from OJ287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons, predicted in scenarios beyond the Standard Model and viable dark matter (DM) candidates, can form superradiant clouds around spinning black holes influencing their dynamics. Using century-long monitored OJ287 supermassive black hole binary we set first DM-independent, dynamical constraints on their masses $\mu = (8.5-22) \times 10^{-22}$ eV. These dynamical constraints, driven by boson cloud friction, are robust against DM-model uncertainties and offer a novel ultralight boson probe. We show that analogous superradiant dynamics across the cosmic population of supermassive black hole systems could help resolve final-parsec evolution stalling problem and imprint a detectable suppression and break in the gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Correction to the Higgs Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the complete one-loop corrected Higgs mass within the Standard Model. It is crucial to identify the observable mass as the renormalized one that depends on the external momentum. The correction is finite and dominated by the loops involving the W bosons and the top quark. These contributions exhibit a power-law running with momentum, which may be verifiable at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of axion-like particle (ALP) production in SUSY DFSZ-like model at the ILC and LHeC. We calculate the differential and total cross-sections in $\gamma^{*}e^{-}$ and $e^{-}e^{+}$ collisions including the effect of the scattering angle, the polarization coefficients, the energy and the ALP mass. From that, we compare the total cross-sections at the LHeC to those at the ILC. To predict the existence of ALP signals, we evaluate the significance level of the final state followed by ALP decaying di-photon at the LHeC and the ILC.</description>

      <title>Hyperon spin correlation in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental data show an unexpectedly large spin alignment of $\phi$ mesons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, which can be explained by short-distance fluctuations of strong force fields (vector $\phi$ fields) within the constituent-quark model. We calculate the hyperon spin correlations within the same model, taking into account hydrodynamic effects and a $\phi$ field fluctuating in space-time according to a Gaussian distribution. The $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ spin correlation induced by the $\phi$ field is shown to be negative as opposed to that of $\Lambda\Lambda$ or $\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$. We thus propose a new net spin correlation as a sensitive probe to separate strong force effects from hydrodynamic ones. With the strength of the field fluctuations extracted from the observed $\phi$ spin alignment, we predict the collision energy dependence of the hyperon spin correlations and also investigate the dependence of net spin correlation on azimuthal-angle and rapidity difference.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Simulations of Scattering in Scalar Field Theory on 120 Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations of collisions of fundamental particles on a quantum computer are expected to have an exponential advantage over classical methods and promise to enhance searches for new physics. Furthermore, scattering in scalar field theory has been shown to be BQP-complete, making it a representative problem for which quantum computation is efficient. As a step toward large-scale quantum simulations of collision processes, scattering of wavepackets in one-dimensional scalar field theory is simulated using 120 qubits of IBM's Heron superconducting quantum computer ibm_fez. Variational circuits compressing vacuum preparation, wavepacket initialization, and time evolution are determined using classical resources. By leveraging physical properties of states in the theory, such as symmetries and locality, the variational quantum algorithm constructs scalable circuits that can be used to simulate arbitrarily-large system sizes. A new strategy is introduced to mitigate errors in quantum simulations, which enables the extraction of meaningful results from circuits with up to 4924 two-qubit gates and two-qubit gate depths of 103. The effect of interactions is clearly seen, and is found to be in agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations. The developments that will be necessary to simulate high-energy inelastic collisions on a quantum computer are discussed.</description>

      <title>Three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from intersecting D6-branes on rigid cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intersecting D6-brane models without discrete torsion typically suffer from unstabilized open string moduli, arising from D-brane positions and Wilson lines. These moduli generate additional massless adjoint fields, obstructing the realization of negative beta functions necessary for asymptotic freedom unless they are decoupled around string scale. A viable solution involves utilizing rigid cycles, which eliminate these unwanted adjoint fields. In this work, we for the first time present a class of consistent three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from rigid intersecting D6-branes on the factorizable $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^\prime)$ orientifold with discrete torsion. These models satisfy all the known consistency conditions, including $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, K-theory constraints, tadpole cancellation, and recent swampland bounds on the maximal gauge group rank. We provide detailed particle spectra, analyze their phenomenological implications, and discuss the decoupling of exotic states through strong dynamics in the hidden sector.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Survey of Transient Lensing Opportunities for Primordial Black Hole Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of short astrophysical transients provides a uniquely direct avenue for searching for primordial black holes (PBHs) across a vast range of masses. While past search efforts have focused on particular source classes-such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gamma-ray burst spikes-no systematic, multi-wavelength survey has compared their relative potential for PBH discovery. We present here a broad assessment of transient lensing search opportunities, spanning more than twenty decades in photon frequency and over twelve orders of magnitude in PBH mass. For each class, we determine the accessible PBH mass window by accounting for wave-optics suppression and time-delay resolution limits, and we estimate potential sensitivities to the PBH abundance using representative event rates, distances, and optical depths. Our survey includes low-frequency radio events (FRBs, pulsar giant pulses, planetary cyclotron bursts), optical/infrared signals, and high-energy phenomena (gamma-ray burst spikes, fast X-ray transients, TeV blazar flares). We synthesize these results in a unified mass-abundance diagram and comprehensive tables summarizing both physical reach and observational requirements. This work serves as a roadmap for optimizing future multi-wavelength lensing searches, guiding the design of instruments and strategies to explore the PBH dark matter hypothesis across its remaining viable parameter space.</description>
