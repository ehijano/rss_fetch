      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: II. Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: I. Calculation of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously obtained expressions describing the intensity of stationary fluorescence emitted by a multicomponent solution were significantly improved by using matrix calculus. Then, using a similar technique, new expressions describing the decay of the fluorescence intensity of the multicomponent system after pulsed excitation were found. In both of these cases, the effects of the internal filter, the effects of multistep radiative transfer of excitation energy, the possibility of radiative back-transfer, as well as the possibility of changes in the quantum yield of individual components due to radiationless transfer of excitation energy were taken into account. The cases of one-, two- and three-component systems were discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Unified Generative Modeling of 3D Molecules via Bayesian Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced generative model (e.g., diffusion model) derived from simplified continuity assumptions of data distribution, though showing promising progress, has been difficult to apply directly to geometry generation applications due to the multi-modality and noise-sensitive nature of molecule geometry. This work introduces Geometric Bayesian Flow Networks (GeoBFN), which naturally fits molecule geometry by modeling diverse modalities in the differentiable parameter space of distributions. GeoBFN maintains the SE-(3) invariant density modeling property by incorporating equivariant inter-dependency modeling on parameters of distributions and unifying the probabilistic modeling of different modalities. Through optimized training and sampling techniques, we demonstrate that GeoBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple 3D molecule generation benchmarks in terms of generation quality (90.87% molecule stability in QM9 and 85.6% atom stability in GEOM-DRUG. GeoBFN can also conduct sampling with any number of steps to reach an optimal trade-off between efficiency and quality (e.g., 20-times speedup without sacrificing performance).</description>

      <title>Automatic State Interaction with Large Localized Active Spaces for Multimetallic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localized active space self consistent field (LASSCF) method factorizes a complete active space (CAS) wave function into an antisymmetrized product of localized active space wave function fragments. Correlation between fragments is then reintroduced through LAS state interaction (LASSI), in which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized in a model space of LAS states. However, the optimal procedure for defining the LAS fragments and LASSI model space is unknown. We here present an automated framework to explore systematically convergent sets of model spaces, which we call LASSI[$r$,$q$]. This method requires the user to select only $r$, the number of electron hops from one fragment to another and $q$, the number of fragment basis functions per Hilbert space, which converges to CASCI in the limit of $r,q\to\infty$. Numerical tests of this method on the tri-metal complexes [Fe(III)Al(III)Fe(II)($\mu_3$-O)]$^{6+}$ and [Fe(III)$_2$Fe(II)($\mu_3$-O)]$^{6+}$ show efficient convergence to the CASCI limit with 4-10 orders of magnitude fewer states.</description>

      <title>Precision spectroscopy of non-thermal molecular plasmas using mid-infrared optical frequency comb Fourier transform spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-thermal molecular plasmas play a crucial role in numerous industrial processes and hold significant potential for driving essential chemical transformations. Accurate information about the molecular composition of the plasmas and the distribution of populations among quantum states is essential for understanding and optimizing plasma processes. Here, we apply a mid-infrared frequency comb-based Fourier transform spectrometer to measure high-resolution spectra of plasmas containing hydrogen, nitrogen, and a carbon source in the 2800 - 3400 cm$^{-1}$ range. The spectrally broadband and high-resolution capabilities of this technique enable quantum-state-resolved spectroscopy of multiple plasma-generated species simultaneously, including CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_2$, C$_2$H$_6$, NH$_3$, and HCN, providing detailed information beyond the limitations of current methods. Using a line-by-line fitting approach, we analyzed 548 resolved transitions across five vibrational bands of plasma-generated HCN. The results indicate a significant non-thermal distribution of the populations among the quantum states, with distinct temperatures observed for lower and higher rotational quantum numbers, with a temperature difference of about 62 K. Broadband state-resolved-spectroscopy via comb-based methods provides unprecedented fundamental insights into the non-thermal nature of molecular plasmas - a detailed picture that has never been accomplished before for such complex non-thermal environment.</description>

      <title>Spectral profile of ro-vibrational transitions of HCl broadened by He, Ar and SF6: testing the $\beta$-correction to the Hartmann-Tran profile and the speed dependent (complex) hard collision model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\beta$-correction to the Hartmann-Tran (HT) profile, recently introduced to model the spectral shape of a molecular transition strongly affected by the Dicke narrowing effect (Konefal et al., JQSRT 242 (2020) 106784), the HT profile (Ngo et al., JQSRT 129 (2013) 89), and the speed dependent (complex) hard collision model (SDcHC, in which the velocity changing collision rate is characterized by a complex number) are tested using spectra of two rovibrational lines of HCl. The R(5) and R(9) lines of the fundamental band of HCl broadened by He, Ar and SF$_6$ have been recorded with a difference-frequency laser spectrometer for total pressures ranging from 12 to 930 mbar. These lines, measured in large pressure ranges with different collision-partners provide a meaningful test of the above-mentioned line-shape models. The results confirm that non-Voigt effects are significant for HCl broadened by Ar and SF$_6$ and mainly due to the large influence of the Dicke narrowing effect. For HCl-SF$_6$ and HCl-Ar, especially for the R(9) line, using the $\beta$-correction together with the HT profile (and with the speed-dependent hard collision model, SDHC) significantly improves the fit residuals while it has no effect on (or tends to deteriorate) the quality of the fit for HCl-He and for the R(5) line of HCl-SF$_6$, for which the influence of velocity changing collisions is smaller. Except for HCl-He, the SDcHC model leads to better quality of fit compared to the HT profile. The results also show that numerical correlations between refined line-shape parameters of the HT profile are important and can lead to ill-determined parameters while they are more properly determined with the SDcHC model.</description>

      <title>Reactions dynamics for X + H2 insertion reactions(X=C(1D), N(2D), O(1D), S(1D)) with Cayley Propagator ring-polymer molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, rate coefficients of four prototypical insertion reactions, X + H2 -- H + XH (X=C(1D), N(2D), O(1D), S(1D)) and associated isotope reactions are calculated based on ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) with Cayley propagator (Cayley-RPMD). The associated kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are systematically studied too. The Cayley propagator used in this work increases the stability of numerical integration in RPMD calculations, and also supports a larger evolution time interval, allowing us to reach both high accuracy and efficiency. So, our results do not only provide chemical kinetic data for the title reactions in an extended temperature range, but also consist of experimental results, standard RPMD, and other theoretical methods. The results in this work also reflect that Cayley-RPMD has strong consistency and high reliability in the investigations of chemical dynamics for insertion reactions.</description>

      <title>Application of Floquet-Magnus expansion and Fer expansion to investigate the chemical shift anisotropy in solid-state NMR when irradiated with the triple oscillating field technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Floquet-Magnus and Fer expansion schemes were introduced in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in 2011 and 2006, respectively. Key features of the Floquet magnus expansion are its ability to account for the calculations developed in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space instead of an infinite-dimensional space within the Floquet theory as well as its use of its distinguishable function from other theories such as average Hamiltonian theory, Floquet theory, and Fer expansion, which facilitates the evaluation of the spin behavior in between the stroboscopic observation points. This article focuses on revisiting the Floquet-Magnus and Fer expansion approaches and applying both methods to calculate the effective Hamiltonians and propagators, which control the spin system evolution during the Triple Oscillating Field Technique radiation experiment (TOFU). The TOFU pulse sequence is an important technique that was shown to avoid the dipolar truncation problem and form a new basis for accurate distance measurement by solid-state NMR. We take advantage of the interaction frequencies and the time modulation arising from the TOFU pulse sequence allowing selective recoupling of specific terms in the Hamiltonian that fulfill determined specific conditions. The work presented unifies and generalizes existing results of the Floquet-Magnus and Fer expansions and delivers illustrations of novel springs that boost previous applications that are based on the classical information. We believe that the generality of this work points to potential applications in problems related to theoretical developments of spectroscopy as well as interdisciplinary research areas whenever they include the spin dynamics concepts.</description>

      <title>Highly dispersed Ru nanoparticles anchored on NiAl layered double oxides catalyst for selective hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin-derived feedstocks into value-added chemicals with high efficiency and selectivity is desirable for the utilization of biomass resource. The complex oxygen-containing groups of lignin-derived substance result in the challenge of the low selectivity toward the required product. In this work, highly dispersed Ru nanoparticles anchored on Ni3Al1 layered double oxides (LDOs) catalyst derived from NiAl layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with flower-shaped morphology was constructed by a simple deposition-reduction method. The introduction of LDHs-derived support can significantly impact the catalytic activity for the HDO of lignin-derived vanillin (VL) into 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP). The Ru/Ni3Al1-400 catalyst obtained complete conversion of VL and 94.2% yield of MMP at 130 {\deg}C in methanol solvent, much better than the catalysts without LDHs-derived support. The methanol solvent is beneficial for the conversion of reaction intermediate of vanillin alcohol (VA). Detailed characterization reveals that the existence of the enhanced metal-support interaction over Ru/Ni3Al1-400 and the easily accessible acid sites facilitate the production of MMP.</description>

      <title>Topological iron silicide with H* intermediate modulated surface for efficient electrocatalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in neutral medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (Ph-NO2) reaction (EHNR) has been considered as a potential alternative to the traditional thermocatalytic process in the production of high-value aniline (Ph-NH2). However, due to the absence of robust catalyst and low surface H* coverage, the EHNR faces the challenges of undesired performance and indetermined mechanism. Herein, we construct a type of noble-metal free topological FeSi (M-FeSi) materials through a solvent-free microwave strategy for efficient EHNR in neutral medium. Impressively, benefiting from abundant active H* intermediates on the surface of M-FeSi catalyst, the topological M-FeSi catalyst exhibits 99.7% conversion of Ph-NO2 and 93.8% yield of Ph-NH2 after 200 C in neutral medium, which are superior to previous candidates and FeSi catalyst synthesized via the traditional arc-melting method under same conditions. Besides, theoretical calculations validate that high surface H* coverage over M-FeSi catalyst is conducive to switching the rate-determining step from Ph-NO2* Ph-NO* to Ph-NO* Ph-NHOH*, and thus decreasing the total energy barrier of electrocatalytic Ph-NH2 production.</description>

      <title>Preparation of tautomer-pure molecular beams by electrostatic deflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tautomers are ubiquitous throughout chemistry, and typically considered inseparable in solution. Yet (bio)chemical activity is highly tautomer specific, with common examples being the amino and nucleic acids. While tautomers exist in an equilibrium in solution, in the cold environment of a molecular beam the barrier to tautomerization is typically much too high for interconversion, and tautomers can be considered separate species. Here we demonstrate the separation of tautomers and production of tautomerically-pure gas-phase samples. We show this for the 2-pyridone / 2-hydroxypyridine system, an important structural motif in both uracil and cytosine. Spatial separation of the tautomers is achieved via electrostatic deflection in strong inhomogeneous fields. We furthermore collect tautomer-resolved photoelectron spectra using femtosecond multiphoton ionization. This paves the way for studying the structure-function-dynamic relationship on the level of individual tautomers, using approaches that typically lack the resolution to do so, such as ultrafast dynamics experiments.</description>

      <title>Facile synthesis of CoSi alloy with rich vacancy for base- and solvent-free aerobic oxidation of aromatic alcohols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rational design and green synthesis of low-cost and robust catalysts efficient for the selective oxidation of various alcohols are full of challenges. Herein, we report a fast and solvent-free arc-melting (AM) method to controllably synthesize semimetal CoSi alloy (abbreviated as AM-CoSi) that is efficient for the base- and solvent-free oxidation of six types of aromatic alcohols. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and aberration corrected high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (AC HAADF-STEM) confirmed the successful synthesis of AM-CoSi with rich Si vacancy (Siv). The as-prepared CoSi alloy catalysts exhibit an order of magnitude activity enhancement in the oxidation of model reactant benzyl alcohol (BAL) to benzyl benzoate (BBE) compared with its mono counterparts, whereas 70 % yield of BBE which is the highest yield to date. Experimental results and DFT calculations well verify that the CoSi alloy structure improves the BAL conversion and Si vacancy mainly contributes to the generation of BBE. After that, CoSi alloy maintains high stability and a potential pathway is rationally proposed. Besides, CoSi alloy also efficiently works for the selective oxidation of various alcohols with different groups. This work demonstrates for the first time that semimetal CoSi alloy is robust for the green oxidation of various alcohols and provides a vast opportunity for reasonable design and application of other semimetal alloy catalysts.</description>

      <title>Direct activation of PMS by highly dispersed amorphous CoOx clusters in anatase TiO2 nanosheets for efficient oxidation of biomass-derived alcohols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a green and cost-effective catalytic system for the selective oxidation of biomass-derived alcohols is vital for the sustainable synthesis of fine chemicals. Herein, highly dispersed subnanometric amorphous CoOx clusters in anatase TiO2 nanosheets (Co-TiO2) fabricated by green solvent CO2 assisted approach could directly activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for the highly selective oxidation of various biomass-derived alcohols. Advanced characterizations (e.g., EXAFS, EPR, AC HAADF-STEM) reveal that a strong interaction of CoOx clusters and the anatase TiO2 support exist in Co-TiO2 and Co atom in Co-TiO2 is mainly consisted of Co2+ and Co3+. The Co-TiO2 catalyst offers superior catalytic performance in the conversion of six types of alcohols (e.g., benzyl alcohol (BAL), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)) with high selectivity to produce corresponding aldehydes. Highly dispersed CoOx clusters and the interaction between CoOx clusters and TiO2 support contribute to the superior performance. Mechanism studies show that SO4 radicals play the dominant role in the selective oxidation of model reactant BAL and 1O2 participates in the non-radical pathway. DFT calculations are well matched with experiment and decipher that the strong interaction between CoOx clusters and TiO2 support promotes the formation of SO4 and SO5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanostructured catalysts have attracted the increased attention for biomass conversion into high-valued chemicals due to the rapid depletion of fossil resources and increasingly severe environmental issues. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) fluid is an attractive medium for synthesizing nanostructured materials due to its favorable properties. In this review, the properties of scCO2 and the roles of scCO2 in the fabrication of metal nanoparticles were assessed in detailed. A general overview of the synthesis of different types of metal nanoparticles (including metal oxide nanoparticles) using scCO2 and the relationship between the structure of the obtained metal nanoparticles and the preparation conditions such as reaction temperature and pressure, types of metal precursors, and deposition time are system summarized and compared in tables. Besides, compared to the meatal catalysts using the conventional methods, the catalysts obtained using scCO2 exhibited excellent catalytic performance on biomass conversion reactions, mainly focused on oxidation, hydrogenation reactions. Finally, opportunities and challenges of metal nanoparticle preparation using scCO2 for biomass valorization to chemicals and liquid fuels are highlighted. This review could be helpful for the rational design of more efficient metal catalysts for the selective synthesis of fine chemicals and fuels from biomass-derived chemicals.</description>

      <title>Multimodal operando microscopy reveals that interfacial chemistry and nanoscale performance disorder dictate perovskite solar cell stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation low-cost semiconductors such as halide perovskites exhibit optoelectronic properties dominated by nanoscale variations in their structure, composition and photophysics. While microscopy provides a proxy for ultimate device function, past works have focused on neat thin-films on insulating substrates, missing crucial information about charge extraction losses and recombination losses introduced by transport layers. Here we use a multimodal operando microscopy toolkit to measure nanoscale current-voltage curves, recombination losses and chemical composition in an array of state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells before and after extended operational stress. We apply this toolkit to the same scan areas before and after extended operation to reveal that devices with the highest performance have the lowest initial performance spatial heterogeneity - a crucial link that is missed in conventional microscopy. We find that subtle compositional engineering of the perovskite has surprising effects on local disorder and resilience to operational stress. Minimising variations in local efficiency, rather than compositional disorder, is predictive of improved performance and stability. Modulating the interfaces with different contact layers or passivation treatments can increase initial performance but can also lead to dramatic nanoscale, interface-dominated degradation even in the presence of local performance homogeneity, inducing spatially varying transport, recombination, and electrical losses. These operando measurements of full devices act as screenable diagnostic tools, uniquely unveiling the microscopic mechanistic origins of device performance losses and degradation in an array of halide perovskite devices and treatments. This information in turn reveals guidelines for future improvements to both performance and stability.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Band Gap Problem with a Machine-Learned Exchange Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systematic underestimation of band gaps is one of the most fundamental challenges in semilocal density functional theory (DFT). In addition to hindering the application of DFT to predicting electronic properties, the band gap problem is intimately related to self-interaction and delocalization errors, which make the study of charge transfer mechanisms with DFT difficult. In this work, we present two key innovations to address the band gap problem. First, we design an approach for machine learning density functionals based on Gaussian processes to explicitly fit single-particle energy levels. Second, we introduce novel nonlocal features of the density matrix that are expressive enough to fit these single-particle levels. Combining these developments, we train a machine-learned functional for the exact exchange energy that predicts molecular energy gaps and reaction energies of a wide range of molecules in excellent agreement with reference hybrid DFT calculations. In addition, while being trained solely on molecular data, our model predicts reasonable formation energies of polarons in solids, showcasing its transferability and robustness. Our approach generalizes straightforwardly to full exchange-correlation functionals, thus paving the way to the design of novel state-of-the-art functionals for the prediction of electronic properties of molecules and materials.</description>

      <title>A Linear Time-Delay Scheme to Propagate Reduced Electron Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of reduced $1$-electron density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the reduced $1$-electron density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems (H$_2$ and HeH$^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To derive our method, we calculate the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our calculation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This calculation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: AI-assisted exploration and active design of polymers with high intrinsic thermal conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing polymers with high intrinsic thermal conductivity (TC) is critically important for the thermal management of organic electronics and photonics. However, this is a challenging task owing to the diversity of the chemical space and the barriers to advanced synthetic experiments/characterization techniques for polymers. In this Tutorial, the fundamentals and implementation of combining classical molecular dynamics simulation and machine learning (ML) for the development of polymers with high TC are comprehensively introduced. We begin by describing the core components of a universal ML framework, involving polymer datasets, property calculators, feature engineering and informatics algorithms. Then, the process of constructing interpretable regression algorithms for TC prediction is introduced, aiming to extract the underlying relationships between microstructures and TCs for polymers. We also explore the design of sequence-ordered polymers with high TC using lightweight and mainstream active learning algorithms. Lastly, we conclude by addressing the current limitations and suggesting potential avenues for future research on this topic.</description>

      <title>Multi-radius Soler-Williams Augmented Plane Waves (SAPMR) and multi-radius Soler-Williams Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (SLAPWMR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structures (Density Functional Theory (DFT)) calculations. It extends Soler Williams Linearized Augmented plane Wave (SLAPW) basis sets by allowing variable radii for the different angular momentum channels and wave vectors. This allows to match additional derivatives of the wave function at the Muffin Tin (MT) radius without having to resort to additional higher derivative terms. This should lead to low wave vector basis set and low linearization energy errors. We dub these basis sets SAPWMR and SLAPWMR. Similarly Local orbital (LO and lo) basis wave functions are suggested with a variable radius. Full Potential Hamiltonian calculations (FLAPW) are extended to FSLAPWMR full potential calculations in the appendix.</description>

      <title>The effect of inter-track coupling on H$_2$O$_2$ productions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Lower production of H$_2$O$_2$ in water is a hallmark of ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) compared to the conventional dose rate (CDR). However, the current computational models based on the predicted yield of H$_2$O$_2$ are in opposite of the experimental data. Methods: We construct an analytical model for the rate equation in the production of H$_2$O$_2$ from \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals and use it as a guide to propose a hypothetical geometrical inhomogeneity in the configuration of particles in the FLASH-UHDR beams. We perform a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the track structures for a system of charged particles impinging the medium in the form of clusters and/or bunches. Results: We demonstrate the interplay of diffusion, reaction rates, and overlaps in track-spacing attribute to a lower yield of H$_2$O$_2$ at FLASH-UHDR vs. CDR. This trend is reversed if spacing among the tracks becomes larger than a critical value, with a length scale that is proportional to the diffusion length of \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals modulated by a rate of decay due to recombination with other species, available within a track, and the space among the tracks. The latter is substantial on the suppressing of the H$_2$O$_2$ population at FLASH-UHDR relative to CDR. Conclusions: Based on our analysis of the present work, at FLASH-UHDR, the lower yield in H$_2$O$_2$ can be interpreted as a signature of bunching the particles in beams of ionizing radiation. The beams enter the medium in closely packed clusters and form inhomogeneities in the track-structure distribution. Thus the MC simulations based on the assumption of uniformly distributed tracks are unable to explain the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Chemical homogenization for non-mixing reactive interfaces in porous media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Porous media, while ubiquitous across many engineering disciplines, is inherently difficult to characterize due to their innate stochasticity and heterogeneity. The key for predicting porous material behavior comes down to the structuring of its microstructure, where the linkages of microstructural properties to mesoscale effects remain as one of the key questions in unlocking understanding of this class of materials. One proposed method of linking scales comes down to using Minkowski functionals -- geometric morphometers that describe the spatial and topological features of a convex space -- to draw connections from microstructural form to mesoscale features. In this work, chemical equilibrium and kinetics on a microstructure surface were explored, with Minkowski functionals used as the basis for relating microstructural geometry to chemical performance. Using surface CRNs to model chemical behavior -- a novel asynchronous cellular automaton -- linkages were found between the Minkowski functionals and equilibrium equilibrium constant, as well as properties related to the dynamics of the system's reaction quotient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Redox potentials of electron transfer reactions are of fundamental importance for the performance and description of electrochemical devices. Despite decades of research, accurate computational predictions for the redox potential of even simple metals remain very challenging. Here we use a combination of first principles calculations and machine learning to predict the redox potentials of three redox couples, $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$/$\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}$/$\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$/$\mathrm{Ag}^{2+}$. Using a hybrid functional with a fraction of 25\% exact exchange (PBE0) the predicted values are 0.92, 0.26 and 1.99 V in good agreement with the best experimental estimates (0.77, 0.15, 1.98 V). We explain in detail, how we combine machine learning, thermodynamic integration from machine learning to semi-local functionals, as well as a combination of thermodynamic perturbation theory and $\Delta$-machine learning to determine the redox potentials for computationally expensive hybrid functionals. The combination of these approaches allows one to obtain statistically accurate results.</description>

      <title>Elevated temperature effects (T &gt; 100 {\deg}C) on the interfacial water and microstructure swelling of Na-montmorillonite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Montmorillonite-based barriers are key elements of the engineered barrier systems (EBS) in geological disposal facilities (GDF). Their performance at temperatures above 100 {\deg}C is not sufficiently understood to assess the possibility of raising the temperature limits in GDF designs that could reduce construction costs and CO2 footprint. The present work provides new fundamental insights through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Na-montmorillonite's water-clay interactions and swelling pressure at temperatures 298-500 K and basal spacings of 1.5-3.5 nm. At temperatures above 100 {\deg}C, the swelling behaviour is governed by the attractive van der Waals force and the repulsive hydration force instead of the repulsive electrostatic (double layer) force. The swelling pressure reduction with increasing temperature is related to the weakened hydration repulsion and electric double layer repulsion, which result from the deterioration of the interlayer water layer structure and the shrinkage of the electric double layer. The applicability and breakdown of the classic Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory at elevated temperatures are examined. By excluding the osmotic contribution in the DLVO theory, the summation of the van der Waals interaction in DLVO and an additional non-DLVO hydration interaction can predict our MD system's swelling under high temperatures. The findings of this study provide a fundamental understanding of the swelling behaviour and the underlying molecular-level mechanisms of the clay microstructure under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Hot electrons and dark excitons modulate strong-coupling conditions in metal-organic optical microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polaritons are promising for important applications including organic solar cells, optical logic gates, and qubits. In low-Q microcavities, polaritonic signatures of strongly hybridized photons and Frenkel excitons were previously found to decay together with dark excitons. There remain unresolved questions regarding whether dark excitons affect the strength of exciton-photon coupling. Additionally, the contributions of dark excitons in organic layers and hot electrons in metal films to the polaritonic response are not fully understood. Here, we identified that due to delocalization of polaritons over organic and metal layers, they are sensitive to both dark excitons and hot electrons. Dark excitons modulate exciton-photon coupling strength, whereas hot-electrons imprint two-temperature dynamics onto the polaritonic response. Both organic and metal films contribute to transient Fano-like gain-loss spectra of exciton-polaritons. These and other mechanistic insights into the strong-coupling dynamics were supported by the theory of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian mechanics, axially-resolved optical simulations, global analysis of pump-probe spectra, and statistical correlation analysis. The developed methodology can be applied to other microcavity structures. Our findings are important for disentangling pure polaritonic effects from other excitations in organic and metal layers, with the ultimate aim of achieving photonic control over photophysical and photochemical processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, our framework yields admissible position and momentum states, inter-convertible via a generalized Fourier transform. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We identify two features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, many molecular species are intrinsically rotation-spin entangled in a way that cannot be broken without transitioning to another species or breaking symmetry. Second, each molecular position state houses an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed.</description>
