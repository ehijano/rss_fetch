      <title>Genotype-Phenotype Integration through Machine Learning and Personalized Gene Regulatory Networks for Cancer Metastasis Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, yet most predictive models rely on shallow architectures and neglect patient-specific regulatory mechanisms. Here, we integrate classical machine learning and deep learning to predict metastatic potential across multiple cancer types. Gene expression profiles from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia were combined with a transcription factor-target prior from DoRothEA, focusing on nine metastasis-associated regulators. After selecting differential genes using the Kruskal-Wallis test, ElasticNet, Random Forest, and XGBoost models were trained for benchmarking. Personalized gene regulatory networks were then constructed using PANDA and LIONESS and analyzed through a graph attention neural network (GATv2) to learn topological and expression-based representations. While XGBoost achieved the highest AUROC (0.7051), the GNN captured non-linear regulatory dependencies at the patient level. These results demonstrate that combining traditional machine learning with graph-based deep learning enables a scalable and interpretable framework for metastasis risk prediction in precision oncology.</description>

      <title>Methylator: A Modular Framework for DNA Methylation Analysis in Mammals and Plants Using Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA cytosine methylation is a critical epigenetic mark regulating gene expression and thus playing an important role in development and differentiation across eukaryotes. Existing tools for high-throughput methylation analysis often lack cross-species flexibility or require command-line expertise. We present Methylator, a novel, end-to-end DNA methylation analysis framework integrated into the Galaxy platform, enabling accessible DNA methylation analysis for mammals and plants. Methylator supports analyses from data obtained using diverse protocols like WGBS, RRBS, and PBAT and handles all contexts of DNA methylation (CpG, CHG, and CHH). The Methylator framework includes quality control, alignment, methylation calling, differential analysis, and functional analysis through reproducible, user-friendly workflows. Its unique Dirty-Harry alignment method enhances mapping efficiency, while a Shiny-based interface allows for interactive, publication-ready visualizations. Methylator is freely available, offering researchers a versatile, user-friendly solution for epigenomic studies.</description>

      <title>On the distributions of restriction sites in human and pangolin sarbecoviruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since early 2020, several theories have suggested that a distribution of restriction endonuclease recognition sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicates a synthetic origin. The most influential of these, a 2022 preprint by Bruttel et al. claimed: "The BsaI/BsmBI restriction map of SARS-CoV-2 is unlike any wild-type coronavirus, and it is unlikely to evolve from its closest relatives." To test this, I reanalyzed the same 11 contested sites using an expanded set of sarbecovirus genomes, including bat coronaviruses published after the Bruttel et al. preprint. For each site, I identified the bat coronaviruses most closely matching SARS-CoV-2 in the surrounding sequences, excluding the sites themselves. The Bruttel et al. hypothesis predicts that these closely related viruses should differ from SARS-CoV-2 at many of the contested sites if restriction sites had been artificially introduced or removed. Contrary to this prediction, one or more of the most closely related bat coronaviruses are identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all 11 sites. Equivalent "synthetic fingerprints" were identified in natural pangolin sarbecoviruses. Finally, I conducted a re-analysis of the dataset that Bruttel et al. used to test where the SARS-CoV-2 BsaI/BsmBI restriction map was significantly more "evenly spaced" than expected in a natural genome. I found technical and conceptual errors that resulted in Bruttel et al. reporting that their chosen metric was 0.07% likely to occur by chance rather than 4.2%, reducing the apparent rarity 60-fold. Using a more informative metric, I tested whether restriction sites in SARS-CoV-2 or two pangolin sarbecoviruses were significantly more evenly spaced than expected and found they were not. These results show that the restriction maps of SARS-CoV-2 and related pangolin viruses are unremarkable in the context of related bat coronaviruses.</description>
