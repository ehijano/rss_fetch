      <title>Unsupervised learning for variability detection with Gaia DR3 photometry. The main sequence-white dwarf valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented volume and quality of data from space- and ground-based telescopes present an opportunity for machine learning to identify new classes of variable stars and peculiar systems that may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Extending prior methodological work, this study investigates the potential of an unsupervised learning approach to scale effectively to larger stellar populations, including objects in crowded fields, and without the need for pre-selected catalogues, specifically focusing on 13 405 sources selected from Gaia DR3 and lying in the selected region of the CMD. Our methodology incorporates unsupervised clustering techniques based primarily on statistical features extracted from Gaia DR3 epoch photometry. We used the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) algorithm to identify variability classes, their subtypes, and spurious variability induced by instrumental effects. The clustering results revealed distinct groups, including hot subdwarfs, cataclysmic variables (CVs), eclipsing binaries, and objects in crowded fields, such as those in the Andromeda (M31) field. Several potential stellar subtypes also emerged within these clusters. Notably, objects previously labelled as RR Lyrae were found in an unexpected region of the CMD, potentially due to either unreliable astrometric measurements (e.g., due to binarity) or alternative evolutionary pathways. This study emphasises the robustness of the proposed method in finding variable objects in a large region of the Gaia CMD, including variable hot subdwarfs and CVs, while demonstrating its efficiency in detecting variability in extended stellar populations. The proposed unsupervised learning framework demonstrates scalability to large datasets and yields promising results in identifying stellar subclasses.</description>

      <title>New Trends in Astrophysical Self-Organized Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review is focused on recent {\sl Self-Organized Criticality (SOC)} literature of astrophysical phenomena, covering the last decade of (2015-2025), while previous SOC literature (1987-2014) is reviewed elsewhere. The selection of literature is mostly based on searches with the NASA-supported {\sl Astrophysics Data System (ADS)}. The discussed astrophysical SOC phenomena are subdivided into solar flares, solar atmosphere (photosphere, chromosphere, corona), heliospheric systems (coronal mass ejections, solar wind, solar energetic particles), planetary systems (asteroids and small bodies, lunar cratering, Saturnian ring systems, magnetospheric systems), stellar flares, and galactic systems (pulsar glitches, gamma ray bursts, soft gamma-ray repeaters, supergiant fast X-ray transients, fast transient radio bursts, magnetars, blazars, black holes).</description>

      <title>Six binary brown dwarf candidates identified by microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze microlensing events from the 2023 and 2024 observing seasons to identify cases likely caused by binary systems composed of BDs. By applying criteria that the binary-lens events exhibit well-resolved caustics, short time scales ($t_{\rm E} \lesssim 9$ days), and have small angular Einstein radii ($\theta_{\rm E} \lesssim 0.17$~mas), we identify six candidate binary BD events: MOA-2023-BLG-331, KMT-2023-BLG-2019, KMT-2024-BLG-1005, KMT-2024-BLG-1518, MOA-2024-BLG-181, and KMT-2024-BLG-2486. Analysis of these events leads to models that provide precise estimates for both lensing observables, $t_{\rm E}$ and $\theta_{\rm E}$. We estimate the masses of the binary components through Bayesian analysis, utilizing the constraints from $t_{\rm E}$ and $\theta_{\rm E}$. The results show that for the events KMT-2024-BLG-1005, KMT-2024-BLG-1518, MOA-2024-BLG-181, and KMT-2024-BLG-2486, the probability that both binary components lie within the BD mass range exceeds 50\%, indicating a high likelihood that the lenses of these events are binary BDs. In contrast, for MOA-2023-BLG-331L and KMT-2023-BLG-2019L, the probabilities that the lower-mass components of the binary lenses lie within the BD mass range exceed 50\%, while the probabilities for the heavier components are below 50\%, suggesting that these systems are more likely to consist of a low-mass M dwarf and a BD. The brown-dwarf nature of the binary candidates can ultimately be confirmed by combining the measured lens-source relative proper motions with high-resolution imaging taken at a later time.</description>

      <title>Radiatively-Cooled Mass Transfer: Disk Properties and L2 outflows across Mass Transfer Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High rates of stable mass transfer (MT) occur for some binary star systems, resulting in luminous transients and circumbinary outflows. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a $10 \ M_\odot$ donor star and a $5\ M_\odot$ point mass secondary, incorporating approximate effects of radiative cooling. By varying the orbital separation of the system, we probe MT rates between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-1} M_\odot$/yr. Mass flows from the donor into an accretion disk, with significant equatorially-concentrated outflows through the outer Lagrange point L2 occurring for MT rates $\gtrsim 10^{-3} M_\odot$/yr, while the MT remaining mostly conservative for lower MT rates. In all cases, any outflowing gas approximately carries the specific angular momentum of L2. The gas cooling luminosity $L$ and temperature increases with MT rate, with $L \sim 10^{5} L_\odot$ and $T \sim 10^4 \, {\rm K}$ for simulations featuring the strongest outflows, with contributions from both the accretion disk and circumbinary outflow. The most luminous transients associated with mass outflows will be rare due to the high MT rate requirement, but generate significant optical emission from both the accretor's disk and the circumbinary outflow.</description>

      <title>Alpha Core-Beam Origin in Low-$\beta$ Solar Wind Plasma: Insights from Fully Kinetic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-situ observations of the fast solar wind in the inner-heliosphere show that minor ions and ion sub-populations often exhibit distinct drift velocities. Both alpha particles and proton beams stream at speeds that rarely exceed the local Alfv\'{e}n speed relative to the core protons, suggesting the presence of instabilities that constrain their maximum drift. We aim to propose a mechanism that generates an alpha-particle beam through non-linear Landau damping, primarily driven by the relative super-Alfv\'{e}nic drift between protons and alpha particles. To investigate this process, we perform one-dimensional, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of a non-equilibrium multi-species plasma, complemented by its linear theory to validate the model during the linear phase. Our results provide clear evidence that the system evolves by producing an alpha-particle beam, thereby suggesting a local mechanism for alpha-beam generation via non-linear Landau damping.</description>

      <title>Eppur si eclissa: Eccentric low-mass companions and time-in-dust selection explain long secondary periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24281v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [abbreviated] Long Secondary Periods (LSPs) are observed in about one third of pulsating red giants yet remain unexplained. Four key observational constraints anchor the discussion: (i) a roughly 30 percent occurrence rate in semi-regular variable AGB stars (SRVs), with a much lower rate or absence in regularly pulsating Mira-type AGB stars (Miras), (ii) about 50 percent of LSP stars show a secondary mid-infrared minimum, (iii) Keplerian fits to radial-velocity curves favor argument of periastron greater than 180 degrees, and (iv) the radial-velocity to light-curve phase lag clusters around minus 90 degrees. We test whether a close-in, eccentric, low-mass companion that spends only part of its orbit within the giant's dust-formation zone can match all four empirical constraints. Guided by observed radial-velocity amplitudes and periods of about 500 to 1500 days, we adopt companion masses of 0.08 to 0.25 solar masses, orbital separations of 1.5 to 3 AU, eccentricities up to 0.6, and dust condensation radii of about 2.5 to 3 AU for SRVs (larger for Miras via scaling with luminosity). We compute the fraction of the orbit spent outside the condensation radius and apply line-of-sight criteria for detectability. We test the first three empirical constraints analytically, then model the phase offset using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Our scenario explains the observed excess of systems with argument of periastron greater than 180 degrees and yields LSP detectability of about 27 percent for SRVs and about 2.5 percent for Miras, with a conditional secondary mid-infrared eclipse fraction of about 44 percent. The hydrodynamical models place the optical-depth maximum downstream of the companion near apastron and then shift it forward by roughly 90 to 225 degrees later in the orbit, consistent with the observed radial-velocity to light-curve offsets.</description>

      <title>Pulsation Mode Identification and Classification of 46 High-Amplitude $\delta$ Scuti Stars from 50 Candidates with TESS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismic modelling of high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti (HADS) variables critically depends on their accurate classification, which provides robust constraints on stellar physical parameters. As a foundational step in this direction, we present a detailed analysis of the pulsational behavior of 50 HADS star candidates using high-precision photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We confirm 46 as genuine HADS variables, with 40 stars having their dominant frequencies identified for the first time. Among them, 7 pulsate solely in the fundamental mode; 21 exhibit the fundamental mode alongside at least one low-amplitude nonradial mode; 5 are pure double-mode pulsators (the fundamental and first-overtone modes), 13 show double-mode pulsations accompanied by additional low-amplitude nonradial modes. The remaining four stars are classified as other types of variables: two (TIC 69546708 and TIC 110937533) are confirmed hot subdwarfs, one (TIC 8765832) is a cataclysmic variable, and one (TIC 32302937) is a likely hot subluminous star, but it requires further spectroscopic confirmation. We investigate the period-luminosity (PL) relation, also known as the Leavitt law, for these 46 confirmed HADS stars, deriving a revised relation: $M_{V}= (-3.31 \pm0.39)~\mathrm{log}~P+(-1.68 \pm 0.39)$. This result is consistent with previous studies. Their distribution in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram indicates that HADS stars are not strictly confined to be within a narrow instability strip previously found, but can extend beyond it, with a distribution toward lower temperatures. The refined classifications presented here establish a high-quality sample for precise asteroseismic modelling and enhance the potential for future machine-learning-assisted searches and classifications of HADS stars in large-scale photometric surveys.</description>

      <title>Modeling Decadal and Centennial Solar UV Irradiance Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructions of solar spectral irradiance - especially in the ultraviolet (UV) range - are crucial for understanding Earth's climate system. Although total solar irradiance (TSI) has been thoroughly investigated, the spectral composition of solar radiation offers a deeper insight into its interactions with the atmosphere, biosphere, and climate. UV radiation, in particular, plays a key role in stratospheric chemistry and the dynamics of stratospheric ozone. Reconstructing solar irradiance over the past centuries requires accounting for both the cyclic modulation of active-region coverage associated with the 11-year solar cycle and the longer-term secular trends, including their centennial variability. This study utilizes an empirical framework, based on a 1000-year record of Open Solar Flux, to characterize the various temporal components of solar irradiance variability. We then combine these components to reconstruct Solar UV irradiance variations in spectral bands crucial for Earth's atmospheric studies.</description>

      <title>The largest ground-based catalogue of M-dwarf flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest ground-based catalogue of M-dwarf flares to date, comprising 1,229 time-resolved events identified in Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 17. Using high-cadence ZTF observations collected between April 2018 and September 2020, we analyzed over 93 million variable light curves containing 4.1 billion photometric measurements. Flare candidates were identified through a machine-learning pipeline trained on simulated light curves generated by injecting TESS-based flare templates into ZTF data and then refined through an extensive post-filtering stage combining an additional classifier, metadata checks, and human inspection. For 655 flares with reliable Gaia-based distances and well-sampled light curves, we derived bolometric energies ranging from 10^31 to 10^35 erg. A clear correlation is observed between flare frequency and spectral subtype, with a sharp increase toward later M dwarfs, particularly near M4-M5, coinciding with the transition to full convection. Using 680 flaring stars with known vertical distances from the Galactic plane, we find that the fraction of flaring stars decreases with increasing Galactic height. The resulting catalogue provides the most comprehensive ground-based sample of M-dwarf flares and establishes a framework for flare detection and classification in upcoming wide-field surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Implications for the formation of Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets in dense environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most stars form in dense stellar environments, where frequent close encounters can strongly perturb and reshape the early architecture of planetary systems. The solar system, with its rich population of distant comets, provides a natural laboratory to study these processes. We perform detailed numerical simulations using the LonelyPlanets framework that combines NBODY6++GPU and REBOUND, to explore the evolution of debris disks around solar system analogues embedded in stellar clusters. Two initial configurations are considered, an $Extended$ and a $Compact$ model, each containing four giant planets and either an extended or compact debris disk. We find that compact disks primarily form Kuiper belt and scattered disk-like populations through planet-disk interactions, while extended disks are more strongly shaped by stellar encounters, producing Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets with ejection velocities of 1-3 km/s. Stellar perturbations are most effective for encounter inclinations between $0^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$, giving rise to distinct dynamical populations, like Sednoids, and inner Oort cloud analogues, and a characteristic tail in semi-major axis-eccentricity space. In coplanar encounters, the disk remains largely flattened, whereas polar flybys redistribute angular momentum vertically, producing nearly isotropic outer populations that resemble an emerging Oort cloud. Our results suggest that cometary reservoirs and interstellar objects are natural byproducts of planet-disk interactions and stellar flybys in dense clusters, linking the architecture of outer planetary systems to their birth environments.</description>

      <title>Giant Planet Evolution with MESA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of gaseous planets is a complex process influenced by various physical parameters and processes. In this study, we present critical modifications to the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code to enhance its applicability to giant planet modelling. We introduce an equation of state specifically tailored for materials at planetary conditions. The equation of state considers the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures and heavy elements, improving the accuracy of internal structure calculations. We also present modifications to the radiative opacity to allow the modelling of grains, clouds and opacity windows. Furthermore, we refine the treatment of convective mixing processes in MESA to better replicate convective mixing with the presence of composition gradients. Finally, we add a treatment for helium rain and settling. These modifications aim to enhance the predictive capabilities of MESA for giant planet evolution and are publicly available. We hope that these improvements will lead to a deeper understanding of giant planet evolution in the solar system and beyond.</description>

      <title>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Roman Sees Where You Are: Predicting Exoplanet Transit Yields in the Rosette Nebula with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young stars host only a small fraction of the known exoplanet population because their photometric variability, magnetic activity, and frequent placement in dense, poorly-resolved regions hamper exoplanet detections. Yet, measuring planets at these ages is crucial since these phases are when dynamical processes that drive planetary migration are most active. We assess the expected yield of a hypothetical Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope transit survey of the Rosette Nebula, a $\sim10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ star-forming region with a dense and diverse stellar population. Using the Roman Exposure Time Calculator to quantify sensitivity to Rosette members, we establish detection thresholds for companions and evaluate yields via Monte Carlo injection-recovery simulations. We predict the detection of $33 \pm 9$ young transiting exoplanets orbiting stellar hosts in a month-long survey, and $29 \pm 8$ in a two-week survey. The extended baseline primarily improves sensitivity to longer-period planets orbiting FGK stars, while most M dwarf detections are well-sampled within two weeks. Irrespective of the temporal baseline, transit detections are dominated by of 1-2\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earths and sub-Neptunes with $P\lesssim8$\,days. Such a sample would substantially expand the census of only three detected planets younger than $20\,\mathrm{Myr}$, probing an age regime in which planetary radii remain inflated, the stability of close-in orbits is uncertain, and planetary migration may still be ongoing. This survey offers a path to constrain early planetary evolution and establish prime follow-up targets for the James Webb Space Telescope, Vera Rubin Observatory, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to Sub-Io-sized Exosatellite Transits in the MIRI LRS Lightcurve of the Nearest Substellar Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST's unprecedented sensitivity enables precise spectrophotometric monitoring of substellar worlds, revealing atmospheric variability driven by mechanisms operating across different pressure levels. This same precision now permits exceptionally sensitive searches for transiting exosatellites, small terrestrial companions to these worlds. Using a novel simultaneous dual-band search method to address host variability, we present a search for transiting exosatellites in an 8-hour JWST/MIRI LRS lightcurve of the nearby ($2.0\,pc$) substellar binary WISE J1049-5319AB, composed of two $\sim30 M_{\rm Jup}$ brown dwarfs separated by $3.5\,au$ and viewed near edge-on. Although we detect no statistically significant transits, our injection-recovery tests demonstrate sensitivity to satellites as small as $0.275\,R_{\oplus}$ ($0.96\,R_{\rm Io}$ or $\sim$1 lunar radius), corresponding to 300ppm transit depths, and satellite-to-host mass ratios $&gt;$$10^{-6}$. This approach paves the way for detecting Galilean-moon analogs around directly imaged brown dwarfs, free-floating planets, and wide-orbit exoplanets, dozens of which are already scheduled for JWST lightcurve monitoring. In our Solar System, each giant planet hosts on average 3.5 moons above this threshold, suggesting that JWST now probes a regime where such companions are expected to be abundant. The technique and sensitivities demonstrated here mark a critical step toward detecting exosatellites and ultimately enabling constraints on the occurrence rates of small terrestrial worlds orbiting $1\text{-}70$$M_{\rm Jup}$ hosts.</description>

      <title>Continuous gravitational waves from magnetized white dwarfs: Quantifying the detection plausibility by LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) are frequently observed to have strong magnetic fields up to $10^9$ G and expected to have a possible internal field as high as $\sim 10^{14}$ G. High internal fields can significantly deform a WD's equilibrium structure, generating a quadrupole moment. If the rotation axis is misaligned with the magnetic axis, the deformation can lead to the emission of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). We examine the potential for detecting CGWs from magnetized WDs with future space-based detectors such as LISA, ALIA, DECIGO, Deci-Hz, BBO and TianQin. We model the field-induced deformation and compute the resulting GW strain, incorporating amplitude decay due to angular momentum loss from electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. This sets a timescale for detection -`active timescale' of $10^{5-6}$ yr, requiring observation while the object remains sufficiently young. Our results suggest that LISA could detect a few dozens of highly magnetized WDs across the Galaxy during its mission. As a specific case, we investigate ZTF J1901+1458- a compact, massive, fast-rotating, and strongly magnetized WD with spin period $\sim416$ s and inferred surface field $\sim10^{9}$ G. We find that this object would be detectable by LISA with four years of continuous data. This highlights the potential of CGW observations to probe magnetic field structure in WDs and their role in type Ia supernova progenitors.</description>

      <title>ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz) and S250818k: A Candidate Superkilonova from a Sub-threshold Sub-Solar Gravitational Wave Trigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported gravitational waves from a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger. If astrophysical, this event would have a surprisingly low chirp mass, suggesting that at least one neutron star was below a solar mass. The Zwicky Transient Facility mapped the coarse localization and discovered a transient, ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz), that was spatially and temporally coincident with the gravitational wave trigger. The first week of follow-up suggested properties reminiscent of a GW170817-like kilonova. Subsequent follow-up suggests properties most similar to a young, stripped-envelope, Type IIb supernova. Although we cannot statistically rule out chance coincidence, we undertake due diligence analysis to explore the possible association between ZTF25abjmnps and S250818k. Theoretical models have been proposed wherein sub-solar neutron star(s) may form (and subsequently merge) via accretion disk fragmentation or core fission inside a core-collapse supernova i.e. a ``superkilonova". Here, we qualitatively discuss our multi-wavelength dataset in the context of the superkilonova picture. Future higher significance gravitational wave detections of sub-solar neutron star mergers with extensive electromagnetic follow-up would conclusively resolve this tantalizing multi-messenger association.</description>

      <title>How External Medium outside Prestellar Cores Affects Protostellar Growth: Variations in Accretion Rate and Evolution of Disks and Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the external medium surrounding prestellar cores affects the star formation process by conducting three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The initial cores follow critical Bonnor-Ebert profiles and are embedded in environments with different ambient densities. The simulations follow the evolution at least until the envelope mass within a radius equal to twice the critical Bonnor-Ebert radius drops to 35% of the initial cloud mass. We reveal that in environments with higher external density, enhanced mass inflow from the envelope leads to Bondi-like accretion as the protostellar mass increases. The continued inflow substantially increases the final stellar mass, resulting in star formation efficiencies that appear to exceed unity in dense environments. The external medium also influences the evolution of circumstellar disks and protostellar outflows: with the high-density external medium, disks grow rapidly but their mass becomes smaller relative to the protostellar mass, and the outflow is sustained over a long duration. However, the ratio of angular momentum removed by outflows and magnetic braking to that introduced by inflowing gas decreases with increasing external density. These results suggest that the density of the external medium regulates not only protostellar mass growth but also the inflow-outflow balance and angular momentum transport in magnetized, rotating star-forming cores.</description>

      <title>Detailed Abundance Determination of Metal-Poor Stars with X-Shooter I. Unusual Chemistry in Halo Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed chemical analysis study of 16 candidate metal-poor stars, previously identified with 2dF+AAOmega, using X-Shooter spectra and the Korg 1D LTE spectral synthesis code. We generally confirm the earlier metallicity estimates and reveal four EMP ([Fe/H] $&lt; -3$) stars in the current sample. Two of these stars, including the most metal-poor at [Fe/H] = $-3.83 \pm 0.07$, are kinematically associated with the GSE accretion event, increasing the number of known GSE stars with [Fe/H] $&lt; -3.5$ to eight. From the X-Shooter spectra we also determine abundances for 16 elements, with the element-to-iron abundance ratios generally consistent with high-resolution studies of Galactic halo stars. Within the sample, we identify three peculiar stars: the first is a GSE nitrogen enhanced metal poor (NEMP; [N/Fe] $= 1.62 \pm 0.10$ and [C/Fe] $= 0.27 \pm 0.08$) star with unusually high Na ([Na/Fe] $= 2.28 \pm 0.07$) and Li (A(Li)$_{\rm 3DNLTE} = 1.90 \pm 0.08$) abundances, but which lacks any enhancement in [Al/Fe] or [Mg/Fe]. The second is a halo r-II star significantly enhanced in Sr ([Sr/Ba] $= 0.37 \pm 0.08$), suggesting mixture of r-process and s-process enrichment, uncommon for r-II stars. Whilst the third is a halo star very depleted in N ([N/Fe] $&lt; -1.13$), with low C ([C/Fe] $= -0.36 \pm 0.08$) and otherwise 'normal' [X/Fe] abundances, suggesting enrichment with Type II supernova that proceeds enrichment from massive AGB stars. This study reveals the substantial degree of chemical diversity in the stellar populations which assembled the early Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Inclusion of Higher-order Ca$^+$ Isotope Shifts in the King's Plot Yields an Order Improvement on the $e^-$-$n$ Coupling Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By critically evaluating higher-order nonlinear effects to the isotope shifts (ISs) in the low-lying transition frequencies of the singly charged calcium ion, stringent constraint on the electron-neutron coupling due to a hypothetical boson describing physics beyond the Standard Model is inferred. It shows an order magnitude difference compared to the previously reported limit demonstrating importance of higher-order effects in the analysis of nonlinearity in the King's plot. The first-order IS parameters and enhancement factor ($D$) were evaluated using two complementary approaches in the relativistic coupled-cluster theory framework: namely finite-field (FF) and analytical response (AR) approaches. Extraction of the second-order IS parameters in the FF approach show numerical instabilities, so they are determined in the AR approach. Comparison of these factors with previous calculation shows substantial differences in the magnitudes. However, $D$ values from both the FF and AR approaches display excellent agreement. We also show explicitly roles of electron correlation effects in the evaluation of $D$ values accurately.</description>

      <title>A Deep Search for Exomoons Around WISE 0855 With JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST is collecting time-series observations of many free-floating planets (FFPs) to study their weather, but these light curves are the ideal datasets to search for exomoons that transit the FFP during observations. In this paper, we present observations of the planetary-mass Y dwarf ($T=250-285K$, $M = 6.5\pm3.5 M_{Jup}$, d = 2.3$\,$pc) WISE J085510.83-071442.5 (WISE 0855), whose proximity and brightness make it ideal for a transiting exomoon search. We examine 11 hours of time-series spectra from the JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) whose sensitivity, in combination with Gaussian process (GP) modeling, allows for the disentanglement of exomoon transits from WISE 0855's variability. We do not find statistically significant evidence of an exomoon transit in this dataset. Using injection and recovery tests of artificial transits for depths ranging between 0.1-1% (0.35-1.12 $R_{\oplus}$) we explore the exomoon parameter space where we could successfully detect transits. For transit depths $\geq 0.5\%$ (1.96$\,R_{\text{Titan}}$), our detection rate is 96%, which, for WISE 0855, corresponds to a moon with a companion-to-host mass ratio similar to that of Titan and Saturn. Given our sensitivity, transit probabilities, and our observational duration, we determine a $\sim$91% probability of detecting a Titan mass analog exomoon after 18 such observations if every observed system hosts a Titan mass analog exomoon in a Galilean-like system. This suggests that JWST observations of dozens of FFPs could yield meaningful constraints on the occurrence rate of exomoons. This paper is the first demonstration that JWST is sensitive to Galilean moon mass analogs around FFPs.</description>
