      <title>Intrusions and turbulent mixing above a small Eastern Mediterranean seafloor-slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing evidence is found in observations and numerical modelling of the importance of steep seafloor topography for turbulent diapycnal mixing leading to redistribution of suspended matter and nutrients, especially in waters with abundant internal tides. One of the remaining questions is the extent of turbulent mixing away from and above nearly flat topography, which is addressed in this paper. Evaluated are observations from an opportunistic, week-long mooring of high-resolution temperature sensors above a small seafloor slope in about 1200 m water depth of the Eastern Mediterranean. The environment has weak tides, so that near-inertial motions and -shear dominate internal waves. Vertical displacement shapes suggest instabilities to represent locally generated turbulent overturns, rather than partial salinity-compensated intrusions dispersed isopycnally from turbulence near the slope. This conclusion is supported by the duration of instabilities, as all individual overturns last shorter than the mean buoyancy period and sequences of overturns last shorter than the local inertial period. The displacement shapes are more erratic than observed in stronger stratified waters in which shear drives turbulence, and better correspond with predominantly buoyancy-driven convection-turbulence. This convection-turbulence is confirmed from spectral information, generally occurring dominant close to the seafloor and only in weakly stratified layers well above it. Mean turbulence values are 10-100 times smaller than found above steep ocean topography, but 10 times larger than found in the open-ocean interior.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Horizontal Shear on Extracting Water Currents From Surface Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersive motion of surface waves is now routinely used to remotely measure the currents close beneath the surface of oceans and other natural flows. The current manifests as wavelength-dependent Doppler shifts in the spatiotemporal wave spectrum, which is obtained by performing a Fourier transform of an observed wave field, a procedure which assumes that the current is horizontally uniform within the field of view. This assumption is frequently not satisfied. We here analyze the effects of the presence of horizontal shear in the velocity field, with special emphasis on biases: ``measured'' velocities which differ systematically in magnitude and/or direction compared to the average current within the field of view. We generate random synthetic wave data according to a spectrum prescribed at the domain center while varying the current and its gradient, and the mean direction $\theta_0$ and angular spread of the waves' propagation direction, from which we extract Doppler shift velocities (DSVs) using one of the most common numerical schemes. Assuming currents vary by up to 10\% of a characteristic wave phase velocity across the field of view, we find that strong biases can occur for highly directional wave spectra, strongly dependent on $\theta_0$ and the current direction relative to that of its magnitude gradient. We discuss how biases arise in the DSV extraction procedure and suggest practical steps to discover the presence of biases.</description>
