      <title>Random-sketching Techniques to Enhance the Numerically Stability of Block Orthogonalization Algorithms for s-step GMRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We integrate random sketching techniques into block orthogonalization schemes needed for s-step GMRES. The resulting block orthogonalization schemes generate the basis vectors whose overall orthogonality error is bounded by machine precision as long as each of the corresponding block vectors are numerically full rank. We implement these randomized block orthogonalization schemes using standard distributed-memory linear algebra kernels for s-step GMRES available in the Trilinos software packages. Our performance results on the Perlmutter supercomputer (with four NVIDIA A100 GPUs per node) demonstrate that these randomized techniques can enhance the numerical stability of the orthogonalization and overall solver, without a significant increase in the execution time.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamically consistent phase-field model for mass transport with interfacial reaction and deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model is proposed to describe the mass transport and reaction processes of multiple species in a fluid. A key feature of this model is that reactions between different species occur only at the interface, and may induce deformation of the interface. For the governing equations derived based on the energy variational method, we propose a structure-preserving numerical scheme that satisfies the mass conservation and energy dissipation laws at the discrete level. Furthermore, we carry out a rigorous error analysis of the time-discrete scheme for a simplified case. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the model as well as the accuracy and stability of the scheme. In particular, we simulate microvessels with straight and bifurcated structures to illustrate the risk of microaneurysm formation.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of wormhole propagation with the mixed hybridized discontinuous Galerkin finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acid treatment of carbonate reservoirs is a widely employed technique for enhancing the productivity of oil and gas reservoirs. In this paper, we present a novel combined hybridized mixed discontinuous Galerkin (HMDG) finite element method to simulate the dissolution process near the wellbore, commonly referred to as the wormhole phenomenon. The primary contribution of this work lies in the application of hybridization techniques to both the pressure and concentration equations. Additionally, an upwind scheme is utilized to address convection-dominant scenarios, and a ``cut-off" operator is introduced to maintain the boundedness of porosity. Compared to traditional discontinuous Galerkin methods, the proposed approach results in a global system with fewer unknowns and sparser stencils, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of the new combined method and derive optimal error estimates using the developed technique. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>A fourth-order cut-cell method for solving the two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation with moving boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fourth-order cut-cell method for solving the two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation with moving boundaries on a Cartesian grid. We employ the ARMS technique to give an explicit and accurate representation of moving boundaries, and introduce a cell-merging technique to overcome discontinuities caused by topological changes in cut cells and the small cell problem. We use a polynomial interpolation technique base on poised lattice generation to achieve fourth-order spatial discretization, and use a fourth-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for time integration. Numerical tests are performed on various moving regions, with advection velocity both matching and differing from boundary velocity, which demonstrate the fourth-order accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations of Fully Eulerian Fluid-Structure Contact Interaction using a Ghost-Penalty Cut Finite Element Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a cut-based unfitted finite element formulation for solving nonlinear, nonstationary fluid-structure interaction with contact in Eulerian coordinates. In the Eulerian description fluid flow modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations remains in Eulerian coordinates, while elastic solids are transformed from Lagrangian coordinates into the Eulerian system. A monolithic description is adopted. For the spatial discretization, we employ an unfitted finite element method with ghost penalties based on inf-sup stable finite elements. To handle contact, we use a relaxation of the contact condition in combination with a unified Nitsche approach that takes care implicitly of the switch between fluid-structure interaction and contact conditions. The temporal discretization is based on a backward Euler scheme with implicit extensions of solutions at the previous time step. The nonlinear system is solved with a semi-smooth Newton's method with line search. Our formulation, discretization and implementation are substantiated with an elastic falling ball that comes into contact with the bottom boundary, constituting a challenging state-of-the-art benchmark.</description>

      <title>Babu\v{s}ka's paradox in a nonlinear bending model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Babu\v{s}ka or plate paradox concerns the failure of convergence when a domain with curved boundary is approximated by polygonal domains in linear bending problems with simple support boundary conditions. It can be explained via a boundary integral representation of the total Gaussian curvature that is part of the Kirchhoff--Love bending energy. It is shown that the paradox also occurs for a nonlinear bending-folding model which enforces vanishing Gaussian curvature. A simple remedy that is compatible with simplicial finite element methods to avoid wrong convergence is devised.</description>

      <title>High Accuracy Techniques Based Adaptive Finite Element Methods for Elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop an efficient adaptive finite element method for the second-order elliptic problem. Although the theory for adaptive finite element methods based on residual-type a posteriori error estimator and bisection refinement has been well established, in practical computations, the use of non-asymptotic exact of error estimator and the excessive number of adaptive iteration steps often lead to inefficiency of the adaptive algorithm. We propose an efficient adaptive finite element method based on high-accuracy techniques including the superconvergence recovery technique and high-quality mesh optimization. The centroidal Voronoi Delaunay triangulation mesh optimization is embedded in the mesh adaption to provide high-quality mesh, and then assure that the superconvergence property of the recovered gradient and the asymptotical exactness of the error estimator. A tailored adaptive strategy, which could generate high-quality meshes with a target number of vertices, is developed to ensure the adaptive computation process terminated within $7$ steps. The effectiveness and robustness of the adaptive algorithm is numerically demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Learning to Solve Related Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving multiple parametrised related systems is an essential component of many numerical tasks. Borrowing strength from the solved systems and learning will make this process faster. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic linear solver over the parameter space. This leverages information from the solved linear systems in a regression setting to provide an efficient posterior mean and covariance. We advocate using this as companion regression model for the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, and discuss the favourable properties of the posterior mean and covariance as the initial guess and preconditioner. We also provide several design choices for this companion solver. Numerical experiments showcase the benefits of using our novel solver in a hyperparameter optimisation problem.</description>

      <title>Filtered Rayleigh-Ritz is all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the (block) Lanczos algorithm can be used to extract approximate energy spectra and matrix elements from (matrices of) correlation functions in quantum field theory, and identified exact coincidences between Lanczos analysis methods and others. In this work, we note another coincidence: the Lanczos algorithm is equivalent to the well-known Rayleigh-Ritz method applied to Krylov subspaces. Rayleigh-Ritz provides optimal eigenvalue approximations within subspaces; we find that spurious-state filtering allows these optimality guarantees to be retained in the presence of statistical noise. We explore the relation between Lanczos and Prony's method, their block generalizations, generalized pencil of functions (GPOF), and methods based on the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP), and find they all fall into a larger "Prony-Ritz equivalence class", identified as all methods which solve a finite-dimensional spectrum exactly given sufficient correlation function (matrix) data. This equivalence allows simpler and more numerically stable implementations of (block) Lanczos analyses.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Discrete Minimum Energy Path</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimum energy path (MEP) describes the mechanism of reaction, and the energy barrier along the path can be used to calculate the reaction rate in thermal systems. The nudged elastic band (NEB) method is one of the most commonly used schemes to compute MEPs numerically. It approximates an MEP by a discrete set of configuration images, where the discretization size determines both computational cost and accuracy of the simulations. In this paper, we consider a discrete MEP to be a stationary state of the NEB method and prove an optimal convergence rate of the discrete MEP with respect to the number of images. Numerical simulations for the transitions of some several proto-typical model systems are performed to support the theory.</description>

      <title>Recursive construction of biorthogonal polynomials for handling polynomial regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An adaptive procedure for constructing polynomials which are biorthogonal to the basis of monomials in the same finite-dimensional inner product space is proposed. By taking advantage of available orthogonal polynomials, the proposed methodology reduces the well-known instability problem arising from the matrix inversion involved in classical polynomial regression. The recurrent generation of the biorthogonal basis facilitates the upgrading of all its members to include an additional one. Moreover, it allows for a natural downgrading of the basis. This convenient feature leads to a straightforward approach for reducing the number of terms in the polynomial regression approximation. The merit of this approach is illustrated through a series of examples where the resulting biorthogonal basis is derived from Legendre, Laguerre, and Chebyshev orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>A recipe based on Lebesgue functions for learning Variably Scaled Kernels via Discontinuous Neural Networks ({\delta}NN-VSKs)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficacy of interpolating via Variably Scaled Kernels (VSKs) is known to be dependent on the definition of a proper scaling function, but no numerical recipes to construct it are available. Previous works suggest that such a function should mimic the target one, but no theoretical evidence is provided. This paper fills both the gaps: it proves that a scaling function reflecting the target one may lead to enhanced approximation accuracy, and it provides a user-independent tool for learning the scaling function by means of Discontinuous Neural Networks ($\delta$NN), i.e., NNs able to deal with possible discontinuities. Numerical evidence supports our claims, as it shows that the key features of the target function can be clearly recovered in the learned scaling function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the conditioning of optimal control problems constrained by linear parabolic equations with Neumann boundary conditions. While we concentrate on a given end-time target function the results hold also when the target function is given over the whole time horizon. When implicit time discretization and conforming finite elements in space are employed we show that the reduced problem formulation has condition numbers which are bounded independently of the discretization level in arbitrary space dimension. In addition we propose for the all-at-once approach, i.e. for the first-order conditions of the unreduced system a preconditioner based on work by Greif and Sch\"otzau, which provides also bounds on the eigenvalue distribution independently of the discretization level. Numerical experiments demonstrate the obtained results and the efficiency of the suggested preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Achieving $h$- and $p$-robust monolithic multigrid solvers for the Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical analysis of higher-order mixed finite-element discretizations for saddle-point problems, such as the Stokes equations, has been well-studied in recent years. While the theory and practice of such discretizations is now well-understood, the same cannot be said for efficient preconditioners for solving the resulting linear (or linearized) systems of equations. In this work, we propose and study variants of the well-known Vanka relaxation scheme that lead to effective geometric multigrid preconditioners for both the conforming Taylor-Hood discretizations and non-conforming ${\bf H}(\text{div})$-$L^2$ discretizations of the Stokes equations. Numerical results demonstrate robust performance with respect to FGMRES iteration counts for increasing polynomial order for some of the considered discretizations, and expose open questions about stopping tolerances for effectively preconditioned iterations at high polynomial order.</description>

      <title>A Finite Volume Method for Elastic Waves in Heterogeneous, Anisotropic and Fractured Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of elastic wave propagation in the subsurface requires applicability to heterogeneous, anisotropic and discontinuous media, as well as support of free surface boundary conditions. Here we study the cell-centered finite volume method Multi-Point Stress Approximation with weak symmetry (MPSA-W) for solving the elastic wave equation. Finite volume methods are geometrically flexible, locally conserving and they are suitable for handling material discontinuities and anisotropies. For discretization in time we have utilized the Newmark method, thereby developing an MPSA-Newmark discretization for the elastic wave equation. An important aspect of this work is the integration of absorbing boundary conditions into the MPSA-Newmark method to limit possible boundary reflections.
  We verify the MPSA-Newmark discretization numerically for model problems. Convergence analysis of MPSA-Newmark is performed using a known solution in a medium with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The analysis demonstrates the expected convergence rates of second order for primary variables (displacements) and between first and second order for secondary variables (tractions). Further verification is conducted through convergence analysis with the inclusion of absorbing boundary conditions. The stability of the scheme is shown through numerical energy decay analyses for waves travelling with various incidence angles onto the absorbing boundaries. Lastly, we present simulation examples of wave propagation in fractured, heterogeneous and transversely isotropic media to demonstrate the versatility of the MPSA-Newmark discretization.</description>

      <title>Shape Taylor expansion for wave scattering problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Taylor expansion of wave fields with respect to shape parameters has a wide range of applications in wave scattering problems, including inverse scattering, optimal design, and uncertainty quantification. However, deriving the high order shape derivatives required for this expansion poses significant challenges with conventional methods. This paper addresses these difficulties by introducing elegant recurrence formulas for computing high order shape derivatives. The derivation employs tools from exterior differential forms, Lie derivatives, and material derivatives. The work establishes a unified framework for computing the high order shape perturbations in scattering problems. In particular, the recurrence formulas are applicable to both acoustic and electromagnetic scattering models under a variety of boundary conditions, including Dirichlet, Neumann, impedance, and transmission types.</description>

      <title>Three-precision iterative refinement with parameter regularization and prediction for solving large sparse linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04229v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel mixed-precision iterative refinement algorithm, GADI-IR, within the general alternating-direction implicit (GADI) framework, designed for efficiently solving large-scale sparse linear systems. By employing low-precision arithmetic, particularly half-precision (FP16), for computationally intensive inner iterations, the method achieves substantial acceleration while maintaining high numerical accuracy. Key challenges such as overflow in FP16 and convergence issues for low precision are addressed through careful backward error analysis and the application of a regularization parameter $\alpha$. Furthermore, the integration of low-precision arithmetic into the parameter prediction process, using Gaussian process regression (GPR), significantly reduces computational time without degrading performance. The method is particularly effective for large-scale linear systems arising from discretized partial differential equations and other high-dimensional problems, where both accuracy and efficiency are critical. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the use of FP16 and mixed-precision strategies not only accelerates computation but also ensures robust convergence, making the approach advantageous for various applications. The results highlight the potential of leveraging lower-precision arithmetic to achieve superior computational efficiency in high-performance computing.</description>

      <title>A New Approach for Fourier Extension Based on Weighted Generalized Inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the Fourier extension from a new perspective of solving the compact operator equation with perturbed data. By converting the approximation target from the best approximate solution to the weighted best approximate solution, the oscillation in the extended region has been overcome. The error estimation of the solution is theoretically established. Furthermore, we point out the difficulties faced by the original weighted operator in calculation due to the limitation of machine precision and propose an effective correction operator. The relevant parameters involved in the method are further tested, and finally the effectiveness of the method is verified through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Sinc-collocation methods for Volterra-Fredholm integral equations of the second kind and their theoretical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sinc-collocation methods for Volterra-Fredholm integral equations of the second kind were proposed in 2012 and 2013 by multiple authors independently. Their theoretical analyses and numerical experiments suggest that the presented methods can attain root-exponential convergence. However, the convergence of these methods has not been strictly proved. This study first improves their methods to make them easier to implement, and provides a convergence theorem of the improved method. For the same equations, another Sinc-collocation method was proposed in 2016. This method is regarded as an improvement in the variable transformation employed in the method proposed in 2012. The method in 2016 may attain a higher rate than the previous methods, but its convergence has not yet been proved. For the method in 2016 as well, this study improves it to be easy to implement, and provides a convergence theorem.</description>

      <title>Besov regularity of non-linear parabolic PDEs on non-convex polyhedral domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.13355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the regularity of solutions to parabolic evolution equations. We consider semilinear problems on non-convex domains. Special attention is paid to the smoothness in the specific scale $B^r_{\tau,\tau}$, $\frac{1}{\tau}=\frac rd+ \frac 1p$ of Besov spaces. The regularity in these spaces determines the approximation order that can be achieved by adaptive and other nonlinear approximation schemes. We show that for all cases under consideration the Besov regularity is high enough to justify the use of adaptive algorithms. Our proofs are based on Schauder's fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Computation-Aware Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are notorious for scaling cubically with the size of the training set, preventing application to very large regression problems. Computation-aware Gaussian processes (CAGPs) tackle this scaling issue by exploiting probabilistic linear solvers to reduce complexity, widening the posterior with additional computational uncertainty due to reduced computation. However, the most commonly used CAGP framework results in (sometimes dramatically) conservative uncertainty quantification, making the posterior unrealistic in practice. In this work, we prove that if the utilised probabilistic linear solver is calibrated, in a rigorous statistical sense, then so too is the induced CAGP. We thus propose a new CAGP framework, CAGP-GS, based on using Gauss-Seidel iterations for the underlying probabilistic linear solver. CAGP-GS performs favourably compared to existing approaches when the test set is low-dimensional and few iterations are performed. We test the calibratedness on a synthetic problem, and compare the performance to existing approaches on a large-scale global temperature regression problem.</description>

      <title>The High-Order Magnetic Near-Axis Expansion: Ill-Posedness and Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When analyzing stellarator configurations, it is common to perform an asymptotic expansion about the magnetic axis. This so-called near-axis expansion is convenient for the same reason asymptotic expansions often are, namely, it reduces the dimension of the problem. This leads to convenient and quickly computed expressions of physical quantities, such as quasisymmetry and stability criteria, which can be used to gain further insight. However, it has been repeatedly found that the expansion diverges at high orders in the distance from axis, limiting the physics the expansion can describe. In this paper, we show that the near-axis expansion diverges in vacuum due to ill-posedness and that it can be regularized to improve its convergence. Then, using realistic stellarator coil sets, we demonstrate numerical convergence of the vacuum magnetic field and flux surfaces to the true values as the order increases. We numerically find that the regularization improves the solutions of the near-axis expansion under perturbation, and we demonstrate that the radius of convergence of the vacuum near-axis expansion is correlated with the distance from the axis to the coils.</description>

      <title>Synthesis Method for Obtaining Characteristic Modes of Multi-Structure Systems via independent Structure T-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel and efficient method for characteristic mode decomposition in multi-structure systems. By leveraging the translation and rotation matrices of vector spherical wavefunctions, our approach enables the synthesis of a composite system's characteristic modes using independently computed simulations of its constituent structures. The computationally intensive translation process is simplified by decomposing it into three streamlined sub-tasks: rotation, z-axis translation, and inverse rotation, collectively achieving significant improvements in computational efficiency. Furthermore, this method facilitates the exploration of structural orientation effects without incurring additional computational overhead. A series of illustrative numerical examples is provided to validate the accuracy of the proposed method and underscore its substantial advantages in both computational efficiency and practical applicability.</description>
