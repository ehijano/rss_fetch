      <title>The two-variable elliptic genus in odd dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A kind of two-variable elliptic genus for almost-complex manifolds was introduced by Ping Li and its various properties were established by him. In this paper, we define a two-variable elliptic genus for odd dimensional spin manifolds which is the index for some Toeplitz operator and a holomorphic $SL(2,Z)$-Jacobi form. We also define some two-variable elliptic genera for almost-complex manifolds and odd dimensional spin manifolds which are holomorphic $\Gamma_0(2)$, $\Gamma^0(2)$, $\Gamma _{\theta}$-Jacobi forms. By these Jacobi forms, we can get some $SL(2,{\bf Z})$ and $\Gamma^0(2)$ modular forms. By these $SL(2,{\bf Z})$ and $\Gamma^0(2)$ modular forms, we get some interesting anomaly cancellation formulas for almost complex manifolds and odd spin manifolds. As corollaries, we get some divisibility results of the holomorphic Euler characteristic number and the index of Toeplitz operators. In addition, we also define some another two-variable elliptic genera for even (rep. odd ) dimensional manifolds which are meromorphic $\Gamma_0(2)$, $\Gamma^0(2)$, $\Gamma _{\theta}$-Jacobi forms.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior of the Hermitian-Yang-Mills flow on non-K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the long-time behavior of the Hermitian-Yang-Mills flow over compact Hermitian manifolds. We obtain the monotonicity of lower bound and upper bound of the eigenvalues of the mean curvature along the Hermitian-Yang-Mills flow. In the Gauduchon case, we show that the eigenvalues of the mean curvature converge to geometric invariants determined by the Harder-Narasimhan type. Furthermore, we generalize the Atiyah-Bott-Bando-Siu question to the non-K\"ahler case.</description>

      <title>Stationaere Kurven auf endlichdimensionalen Mannigfaltigkeiten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we discuss the notion of stationary curves of the length functional, the so-called (weak) geodesics, on a Riemannian manifold. The motivation behind this work is to give a detailed description of many key concepts from differential geometry that one needs in order to understand the important notion of a (weak) geodesic. For this, we mainly focus on finite-dimensional smooth manifolds, so that we can develop an intuitive and geometric understanding of the concepts that we want to discuss. At the end of this work, we also provide a rough description of how one can generalise these ideas into infinite dimensions and how one can use (weak) geodesics in special algorithms for image matching (see [21]).</description>

      <title>Apollonius problem in terms of oriented circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution of Apollonius' problem on constructing a circle (line), tangent to three given circles (lines), is presented in terms of oriented circles and inversive invariants. Tangency is understood as the coincidence of tangent vectors at the common point, in contrast to counter-tangency. The problem has 0, 1 or 2 solutions. By reversing each of the given circles one by one, we obtain the remaining solutions of the classical non-oriented problem.</description>

      <title>Non-extendability of complex structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exists a complex structure $J$ on a connected open subset $S^3_{\delta}\times S^3$ of $S^6$. The present paper proves that: (1) $J$ can be extended to a global almost complex structure $\widetilde{J}$ on $S^6$; (2) any extension to $S^6$ is necessarily non-integrable. Therefore, it is impossible to deform $\widetilde{J}$ to an integrable almost complex structure on $S^6$ while fixing it on $S^3_{\delta}\times S^3$. This phenomenon indicates that the deformation strategy suggested by S.-T. Yau in his Problem 52 cannot be realized in this sense.</description>

      <title>Existence of nontrival $n$-harmonic maps via min-max methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any $n \geq 3$ and any closed manifold $\mathcal{N}$ with $\pi_{n+k}(\mathcal{N}) \neq \{0\}$ for some $k \geq 0$, we establish the existence of nontrivial $n$-harmonic maps from $\mathbb{S}^n$ into $\mathcal{N}$. When $k\geq 1$, these maps naturally appear as bubbling limits of $p$-harmonic maps with $p &gt; n$, obtained by min-max constructions in the limit $p \to n^+$.</description>

      <title>Compact quotients of homogeneous spaces and homotopy theory of sphere bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reductive homogeneous space $G/H$ is always diffeomorphic to the normal bundle of an orbit of a maximal compact subgroup of $G$. We prove that if $G/H$ admits compact quotients, then the sphere bundle associated to this normal bundle is fiber-homotopically trivial. We deduce that many reductive homogeneous spaces do not admit compact quotients, such as the complex spheres $\mathrm{O}(n+1,\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{O}(n,\mathbb{C})$ for all $n \notin \{1,3,7\}$, or $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SL}(m,\mathbb{R})$ for all $n&gt;m&gt;1$, which solves conjectures of T. Kobayashi from the early 1990s. We also prove that if the pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic space $\mathbf{H}^{p,q}$ of signature $(p,q)$ admits compact quotients, then $p$ must be divisible by at least $2^{\lfloor q/2\rfloor}$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity Results for Compact Submanifolds with Pinched Ricci Curvature in Euclidean and Spherical Space Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For compact submanifolds in Euclidean and Spherical space forms with Ricci curvature bounded below by a function $\alpha(n,k,H,c)$ of mean curvature, we prove that the submanifold is either isometric to the Einstein Clifford torus, or a topological sphere for the maximal bound $\alpha(n,[\frac{n}{2}],H,c)$, or has up to $k$-th homology groups vanishing. This gives an almost complete (except for the differentiable sphere theorem) characterization of compact submanifolds with pinched Ricci curvature, generalizing celebrated rigidity results obtained by Ejiri, Xu-Tian, Xu-Gu, Xu-Leng-Gu, Vlachos, Dajczer-Vlachos.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Riemann curvature to Regge metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generalization of the Riemann curvature tensor on manifolds (of dimension two or higher) endowed with a Regge metric. Specifically, while all components of the metric tensor are assumed to be smooth within elements of a triangulation of the manifold, they need not be smooth across element interfaces, where only continuity of the tangential components is assumed. While linear derivatives of the metric can be generalized to Schwartz distributions, similarly generalizing the classical Riemann curvature tensor, a nonlinear second-order derivative of the metric, requires more care. We propose a generalization that combines the classical angle defect and jumps in the second fundamental form across element interfaces, and argue its correctness. Specifically, if a piecewise smooth metric approximates a globally smooth metric, then our generalized Riemann curvature tensor approximates the classical Riemann curvature tensor associated with the latter. Moreover, we show that if the metric approximation converges at some rate in a mesh-dependent norm equivalent to the $L^2$ norm, then the curvature approximation converges in the negative Sobolev space $H^{-2}$, the dual space of $H^2_0$, at the same rate, under additional assumptions. By appropriate contractions of the generalized Riemann curvature tensor, this work also provides generalizations of scalar curvature, the Ricci curvature tensor, and the Einstein tensor in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric inequality for nearly spherical domains in the Bergman ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative isoperimetric inequality for the nearly spherical subset of the Bergman ball in $\mathbb{C}^2$. We prove the Fuglede theorem for such sets. This result is a counterpart of a similar result obtained for the hyperbolic unit ball and it makes the first result on the isoperimetric phenomenon in the Bergman ball.</description>

      <title>Bondi Mass, Memory Effect and Balance Law of Polyhomogeneous Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of a combination of powers of 1/r and ln r are known as polyhomogeneous spacetimes. The asymptotic behaviour of the Newman-Penrose quantities for the vacuum polyhomogeneous spacetimes is presented under certain gauges. The Bondi mass is revisited via the Iyer-Wald formalism. The memory effect of the gravitational radiation in the vacuum polyhomogeneous spacetimes is also discussed. It is found that the appearance of the logarithmic terms does not affect the balance law and it remains identical to that of spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of powers of 1/r.</description>
