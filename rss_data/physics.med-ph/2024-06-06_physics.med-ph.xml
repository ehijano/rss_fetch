      <title>Rapid 2D 23Na MRI of the calf using a denoising convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 23Na MRI can be used to quantify in-vivo tissue sodium concentration (TSC), but the low 23Na signal leads to long scan times and/or noisy or low-resolution images. Reconstruction algorithms such as CS have been proposed to mitigate low SNR; although, these can result in unnatural images, suboptimal denoising and long processing times. Recently, ML has been used to denoise 1H MRI acquisitions; however, this approach typically requires large volumes of high-quality training data, which is not readily available for 23Na MRI. Here, we train a denoising CNN using 1H data, which we subsequently demonstrate on prospective 23Na images of the calf. 1893 1H transverse slices of the knee were used to train denoising CNNs for different levels of noise. Low SNR images were generated by adding gaussian noise to the high-quality 1H kspace data before reconstruction to create paired training data. For prospective testing, 23Na images of the calf were acquired in 10 volunteers with 150 averages, which were used as a reference throughout the study. From this data, lower-average images were reconstructed using a NUFFT as well as CS, with the NUFFT images subsequently denoised using the trained CNN. CNNs were successfully applied to 23Na images reconstructed with 50, 40 and 30 averages. SNR was significantly higher in CNN images compared to NUFFT, CS and reference images. Edge sharpness was equivalent for all images. For image quality ranking, CNN images ranked equally best with reference images and significantly better than NUFFT and CS images. Muscle and skin TSC quantification from CNN images were equivalent to those from CS images, with &lt;0.9 mM bias compared to reference values. Denoising CNNs trained on 1H data can be successfully applied to 23Na images of the calf; thus, allowing scan time to be reduced from 10 minutes to 2 minutes with little impact on image quality or TSC quantification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimising microstructural characterisation of white-matter phantoms: impact of gradient waveform modulation on Non-uniform Oscillating Gradient Spin-Echo sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changes in the nervous system due to neurological diseases take place at very small spatial scales, on the order of the micro and nanometers. Developing non-invasive imaging methods for obtaining this microscopic information as quantitative biomarkers is therefore crucial for improved medical diagnosis. In this context, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging has shown significant advances in revealing tissue microstructural features by probing molecular diffusion processes. Implementing modulated gradient spin-echo sequences allows monitoring time-dependent diffusion processes to reveal such detailed information. In particular, one of those sequences termed Non-uniform Oscillating Gradient Spin-Echo (NOGSE), has shown to selectively characterise microstructure sizes by generating an image contrast based on a signal decay-shift rather than on the conventionally used signal decay rate. In this work, we prove that such decay-shift is more pronounced with instantaneous switches of the magnetic field gradient strength sign. As fast gradient ramps need to be avoided in clinical settings, due to potential patient discomfort and artefacts in imaging, we evaluate the method's efficacy for estimating microstructure sizes using both idealised, sharp gradient modulations and more realistic, smooth modulations. In this more realistic scenario, we find that the signal decay shift might be lost as the diffusion time increases, likely hindering the accurate estimation of microstructural characteristics. We demonstrate, by a combination of numerical simulations, information theory analysis and proof-of-principle experiments with white-matter phantoms, that optimal sequence design to estimate microstructure size distributions can be achieved using either sharp or smooth gradient spin-echo modulations. This approach simplifies the translation of the NOGSE method for its use in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Conductivity and Electrode Placement Variability: Evaluating the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound in 2D Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging modality that has earned significant attention for its potential in real-time monitoring of various physiological parameters. Despite its promise, the sensitivity and resolution of EIT remain areas of active research. This article presents a new way to analyse the sensitivity of EIT systems using the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). This statistical tool provides a theoretical lower bound on the variance of unbiased estimators. To simulate the EIT full cycle, we compared two forward models: standard Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) and restricted DtN. By taking the CRLB over modelled with Finite Elements Method (FEM) 2D circular area with various conductivity patterns, we showed the influence of electrode configuration on each basic FEM element sensitivity. Also, the sensitivity on small perturbations for different conductivity patterns was offered. This article aims to bridge the gap between the research of widely used hardware implementations standard forward DtN model and theoretically approved restricted DtN. We conclude with a discussion on the motivation behind this research and the objectives our work introduces for the inverse restricted DtN model in practice.</description>

      <title>Designing the system to measure the depth-dose profile of a proton beam using CsI(Tl) scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the standard CsI(Tl) scintillator was used to determine the characteristics of a proton beam. By irradiating the scintillator with a proton beam, it was able to subsequently measure the emitted light using a spectrometer. This work presents the dose response of a scintillator and its use to measure the depth-dose profile of a proton beam. The measurement of the dose response showed that the emission light of the scintillator depended on the total dose of the proton beam. For the design of the depth-dose measurement, the setup of the water phantom included a scintillator and a water tank. The depth-dose profile was determined through varying the water depth at various positions along the path of the proton beam until the end of the Bragg peak region. To compare the measured depth-dose profile, the deposited energy was simulated and fitted Birks constant for collecting quenching. Furthermore, the recommended measurement design suggested using a thin scintillator, as it resulted in a narrower shape of the depth-dose profile. Based on experiment and simulation data, a standard CsI(Tl) scintillator was promising for determining the characteristic proton beam.</description>

      <title>Using Modularized Pin Ridge Filter in Proton FLASH Planning for Liver Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We previously developed a FLASH planning framework for streamlined pin-ridge-filter (pin-RF) design, demonstrating its feasibility for single-energy proton FLASH planning. In this study, we refined the pin-RF design for easy assembly using reusable modules, focusing on its application in liver SABR. This framework generates an intermediate IMPT plan and translates it into step widths and thicknesses of pin-RFs for a single-energy FLASH plan. Parameters like energy spacing, monitor unit limit, and spot quantity were adjusted during IMPT planning, resulting in pin-RFs assembled using predefined modules with widths from 1 to 6 mm, each with a WET of 5 mm. This approach was validated on three liver SABR cases. FLASH doses, quantified using the FLASH effectiveness model at 1 to 5 Gy thresholds, were compared to conventional IMPT (IMPT-CONV) doses to assess clinical benefits. The highest demand for 6 mm width modules, moderate for 2-4 mm, and minimal for 1- and 5-mm modules were shown across all cases. At lower dose thresholds, the two-beam case showed significant dose reductions (&gt;23%), while the other two three-beam cases showed moderate reductions (up to 14.7%), indicating the need for higher fractional beam doses for an enhanced FLASH effect. Positive clinical benefits were seen only in the two-beam case at the 5 Gy threshold. At the 1 Gy threshold, the FLASH plan of the two-beam case outperformed its IMPT-CONV plan, reducing dose indicators by up to 28.3%. However, the three-beam cases showed negative clinical benefits at the 1 Gy threshold, with some dose indicators increasing by up to 16% due to lower fractional beam doses and closer beam arrangements. This study evaluated the feasibility of modularizing streamlined pin-RFs in single-energy proton FLASH planning for liver SABR, offering guidance on optimal module composition and strategies to enhance FLASH planning.</description>

      <title>The HS-CMU Dataset for Diagnosing Benign and Malignant Diseases through Hysteroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hysteroscopy enables direct visualization of morphological changes in the endometrium, serving as an important means for screening, diagnosing, and treating intrauterine lesions. Accurate identification of the benign or malignant nature of diseases is crucial. However, the complexity and variability of uterine morphology increase the difficulty of identification, leading to missed diagnoses and misdiagnoses, often requiring the expertise of experienced gynecologists and pathologists. Here, we provide the video and image dataset of hysteroscopic examinations conducted at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University (named the HS-CMU dataset), recording videos of 175 patients undergoing hysteroscopic surgery to explore the uterine cavity. These data were obtained using corresponding supporting software. From these videos, 3385 high-quality images from 8 categories were selected to form the HS-CMU dataset. These images were annotated by two experienced obstetricians and gynecologists using lableme software. We hope that this dataset can be used as an auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of intrauterine benign and malignant diseases.</description>

      <title>Ghost imaging-based Non-contact Heart Rate Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote heart rate measurement is an increasingly concerned research field, usually using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) to collect heart rate information through video data collection. However, in certain specific scenarios (such as low light conditions, intense lighting, and non-line-of-sight situations), traditional imaging methods fail to capture image information effectively, that may lead to difficulty or inability in measuring heart rate. To address these limitations, this study proposes using ghost imaging as a substitute for traditional imaging in the aforementioned scenarios. The mean absolute error between experimental measurements and reference true values is 4.24 bpm.Additionally, the bucket signals obtained by the ghost imaging system can be directly processed using digital signal processing techniques, thereby enhancing personal privacy protection.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Proton and Carbon-12 Ion Beam for Tumor/Cancer Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Treating cancer is one of the most challenging task in medical sciences. Only limited types of cancer treatments are available as their study is still ongoing. The earlier therapies like radiotherapy with x-rays, chemotherapy are associated with lot of side-effects. One of the most desirable cancer treatment is using particle beam therapies. These therapies are quite less risky than other types of cancer and tumor treatments. In this paper we present the proton and carbon-12 ion beam simulation that can help in tumor and cancer treatment. We simulated the proton and carbon-12 ion beam in water and soft tissue using geant4 toolkit. The protons are observed to have much better energy deposition in the water and soft tissue than carbon-12 ion and gamma photon beams.</description>
