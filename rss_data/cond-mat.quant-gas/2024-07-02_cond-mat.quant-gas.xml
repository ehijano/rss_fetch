      <title>Symmetry oscillations in strongly interacting one-dimensional mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-component quantum mixtures in one dimension can be characterized by their symmetry under particle exchange. For a strongly-interacting Bose-Bose mixture, we show that the time evolution of the momentum distribution from an initially symmetry-mixed state is quasi-constant for a SU(2) symmetry conserving Hamiltonian, while it displays large oscillations in time for the symmetry-breaking case where inter- and intra-species interactions are different. Using the property that the momentum distribution operator at strong interactions commutes with the class-sum operator, the latter acting as a symmetry witness, we show that the momentum distribution oscillations correspond to symmetry oscillations, with a mechanism analog to neutrino flavour oscillations.</description>

      <title>Dissipative chaos and steady state of open Tavis-Cummings dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a coupled atom-photon system described by the Tavis-Cummings dimer (two coupled cavities) in the presence of photon loss and atomic pumping, to investigate the quantum signature of dissipative chaos. The appropriate classical limit of the model allows us to obtain a phase diagram identifying different dynamical phases, especially the onset of chaos. Both classically and quantum mechanically, we demonstrate the emergence of a steady state in the chaotic regime and analyze its properties. The interplay between quantum fluctuation and chaos leads to enhanced mixing dynamics and dephasing, resulting in the formation of an incoherent photonic fluid. The steady state exhibits an intriguing phenomenon of subsystem thermalization even outside the chaotic regime; however, its effective temperature increases with the degree of chaos. Moreover, the statistical properties of the steady state show a close connection with the random matrix theory. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <title>Orbital phases of $p$-band ultracold fermions in the frustrated triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital degrees of freedom play an important role for understanding the emergence of unconventional quantum phases. Ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices provide a wonderful platform to simulate orbital physics. In this work, we consider spinless fermionic atoms loaded into $p$-orbital bands of a two-dimensional frustrated triangular lattice. The system can be described by an extended Fermi-Hubbard model, which is numerically solved by using the orbital version of real-space dynamical mean-field theory. Low-temperature phase diagrams are obtained, which contain stripe-, ferro- and para-orbital ordered quantum phases, due to the interplay of anisotropic hoppings and geometrical frustration. In order to understand the underlying mechanics of competing orbital orders, we derive an effective orbital-exchange model, which yields consistent explanation with our main numerical results.</description>

      <title>Direct free energy calculation from ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations of warm dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out highly accurate \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to directly estimate the free energy of various warm dense matter systems including the uniform electron gas and hydrogen without any nodal restrictions or other approximations. Since our approach is based on an effective ensemble in a bosonic configuration space, it does not increase the computational complexity beyond the usual fermion sign problem. Its application to inhomogeneous cases such as an electronic system in a fixed external ion potential is straightforward and opens up the enticing possibility to benchmark density functional theory and other existing methods. Finally, it is not limited to warm dense matter, and can be applied to a gamut of other systems such ultracold atoms and electrons in quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Excitations of a two-dimensional supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the excitations of the two-dimensional supersolid state of a Bose-Einstein condensate with either dipole-dipole interactions or soft-core interactions. This supersolid state has three gapless excitation branches arising from the spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Two of these branches are related to longitudinal sound waves, similar to those in one-dimensional supersolids. The third branch is a transverse wave arising from the non-zero shear modulus of the two-dimensional crystal. We present the results of numerical calculations for the excitations and dynamic structure factor characterising the density fluctuations, and study their behavior across the discontinuous superfluid to supersolid transition. We show that the speeds of sound are described by a hydrodynamic theory that incorporates generalized elastic parameters, including the shear modulus. Furthermore, we establish that dipolar and soft-core supersolids manifest distinct characteristics, falling into the bulk incompressible and rigid lattice limits, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation with Gauge Fixing: from Ising Lattice Gauge Theory to Dynamical Flux Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much attentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge theories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories with local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected Hamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way towards the simulation of gauge theories based on \emph{gauge fixing}. To demonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a fluctuating dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is confinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Adiabatons in a double tripod coherent atom-light coupling scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical adiabatons are specific shape-invariant pulse pairs propagating at the reduced group velocity and without optical absorption in the medium. The purpose of this study is to analyze and demonstrate adiabaton formation in many level atomic systems. Here we focus on the analysis of five level M-type and double tripod systems. It is found that M-type atomic systems are prone to intensity dependent group velocity and pulse front steepening which prevents the formation of long range optical adiabatons. In contrast, the double tripod atomic system is quite favorable for the formation of optical adiabatons leading to two different optical field configurations propagating with invariant shape.</description>

      <title>Symmetry: a fundamental resource for quantum coherence and metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for the preparation of deeply entangled states useful for quantum metrology. We show that when the quantum state is an eigenstate of an operator $A$, observables $G$ which are completely off-diagonal with respect to $A$ have purely quantum fluctuations, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information, namely $F_Q(G)=4\langle G^2 \rangle$. This property holds regardless of the purity of the quantum state, and it implies that off-diagonal fluctuations represent a metrological resource for phase estimation. In particular, for many-body systems such as quantum spin ensembles or bosonic gases, the presence of off-diagonal long-range order (for a spin observable, or for bosonic operators) directly translates into a metrological resource, provided that the system remains in a well-defined symmetry sector. The latter is defined e.g. by one component of the collective spin or by its parity in spin systems; and by a particle-number sector for bosons. Our results establish the optimal use for metrology of arbitrarily non-Gaussian quantum correlations in a large variety of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Pairing by disorder of dopants in a magnetic spin ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I demonstrate a pairing mechanism of dopants in a magnetic lattice, emerging from the underlying \emph{high-temperature disorder} of the spins. The effect is demonstrated in a mixed-dimensional model, where dopants travel along a two-leg ladder, while the spins feature Ising interactions along the rungs and the legs of the ladder. The dynamics following the sudden immersion of two nearest neighbor dopants in an infinite temperature spin lattice shows that thermal spin disorder frustrates the relative motion of the dopants and enforces them to co-propagate. The predictions are shown to be realistically testable in quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian skin effect in arbitrary dimensions: non-Bloch band theory and classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a distinctive phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems, characterized by a significant accumulation of eigenstates at system boundaries. While well-understood in one dimension via non-Bloch band theory, unraveling the NHSE in higher dimensions faces formidable challenges due to the diversity of open boundary conditions or lattice geometries and inevitable numerical errors. Key issues, including higher-dimensional non-Bloch band theory, geometric dependency, spectral convergence and stability, and a complete classification of NHSE, remain elusive. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting a geometry-adaptive non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary dimensions, through the lens of spectral potential. Our formulation accurately determines the energy spectra, density of states, and generalized Brillouin zone for a given geometry in the thermodynamic limit (TDL), revealing their geometric dependencies. Furthermore, we systematically classify the NHSE into critical and non-reciprocal types using net winding numbers. In the critical case, we identify novel scale-free skin modes residing on the boundary. In the nonreciprocal case, the skin modes manifest in various forms, including normal or anomalous corner modes, boundary modes or scale-free modes. We reveal the non-convergence and instability of the non-Bloch spectra in the presence of scale-free modes and attribute it to the non-exchangeability of the zero-perturbation limit and the TDL. The instability drives the energy spectra towards the Amoeba spectra in the critical case. Our findings provide a unified non-Bloch band theory governing the energy spectra, density of states, and generalized Brillouin zone in the TDL, offering a comprehensive understanding of NHSE in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Large-scale universality in quantum reaction-diffusion from Keldysh field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum reaction-diffusion dynamics in $d$ spatial dimensions of a Fermi gas subject to binary annihilation reactions $A+A \to \emptyset$. These systems display collective nonequilibrium long-time behavior, which is signalled by an algebraic decay of the particle density. Building on the Keldysh formalism, we devise a field theoretical approach for the reaction-limited regime, where annihilation reactions are scarce. By means of a perturbative expansion of the dissipative interaction, we derive a description in terms of a large-scale universal kinetic equation. Our approach shows how the time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble assumption, which is often employed for treating low-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, emerges from systematic diagrammatics. It also allows to exactly compute -- for arbitrary spatial dimension -- the decay exponent of the particle density. The latter is based on the large-scale description of the quantum dynamics and it differs from the mean-field prediction even in dimension larger than one. We moreover consider spatially inhomogeneous setups involving an external potential. In confined systems the density decay is accelerated towards the mean-field algebraic behavior, while for deconfined scenarios the power-law decay is replaced by a slower non-algebraic decay.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Anyons in Periodically Driven Abelian Spin Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that non-Abelian anyons can emerge from an Abelian topologically ordered system subject to local time-periodic driving. This is illustrated with the toric-code model, as the canonical representative of a broad class of Abelian topological spin liquids. The Abelian anyons in the toric code include fermionic and bosonic quasiparticle excitations which see each other as $\pi$ fluxes, namely they result in the accumulation of a $\pi$ phase if wound around each other. Non-Abelian behaviour emerges because the Floquet modulation can engineer a non-trivial band topology for the fermions, inducing their fractionalization into Floquet-Majorana modes bound to the bosons. The latter then develop non-Abelian character akin to vortices in topological superconductors, realizing Ising topological order. Our findings shed light on the nonequilibrium physics of driven topologically ordered quantum matter and may facilitate the observation of non-Abelian behaviour in engineered quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Atomic clock interferometry using optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clock interferometry refers to the coherent splitting of a clock into two different paths and recombining in a way that reveals the proper time difference between them. Unlike the comparison of two separate clocks, this approach allows testing how non-flat spacetime influences quantum coherence. Atomic clocks are currently the most accurate time keeping devices. Here we propose using optical tweezers to implement clock interferometry. Our proposed clock interferometer employs an alkaline-earth-like atom held in an optical trap at the magic wavelength. Through a combination of adiabatic, tweezer-based, splitting and recombining schemes and a modified Ramsey sequence on the clock states, we achieve a linear sensitivity to the gravitational time dilation. Moreover, the measurement of the time dilation is insensitive to relative fluctuations in the intensity of the tweezer beams. We analyze the tweezer clock interferometer and show that it is feasible with current technological capabilities. The proposed interferometer could test the effect of gravitational redshift on quantum coherence, and implement the quantum twin paradox.</description>
