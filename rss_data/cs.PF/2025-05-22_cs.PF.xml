      <title>Towards Stream-Based Monitoring for EVM Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We believe that leveraging real-time blockchain operational data is of particular interest in the context of the current rapid expansion of rollup networks in the Ethereum ecosystem. Given the compatible but also competing ground that rollups offer for applications, stream-based monitoring can be of use both to developers and to EVM networks governance. In this paper, we discuss this perspective and propose a basic monitoring pipeline.</description>

      <title>Performance of Confidential Computing GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines latency, throughput, and other metrics when performing inference on confidential GPUs. We explore different traffic patterns and scheduling strategies using a single Virtual Machine with one NVIDIA H100 GPU, to perform relaxed batch inferences on multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), operating under the constraint of swapping models in and out of memory, which necessitates efficient control. The experiments simulate diverse real-world scenarios by varying parameters such as traffic load, traffic distribution patterns, scheduling strategies, and Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. The findings provide insights into the differences between confidential and non-confidential settings when performing inference in scenarios requiring active model swapping. Results indicate that in No-CC mode, relaxed batch inference with model swapping latency is 20-30% lower than in confidential mode. Additionally, SLA attainment is 15-20% higher in No-CC settings. Throughput in No-CC scenarios surpasses that of confidential mode by 45-70%, and GPU utilization is approximately 50% higher in No-CC environments. Overall, performance in the confidential setting is inferior to that in the No-CC scenario, primarily due to the additional encryption and decryption overhead required for loading models onto the GPU in confidential environments.</description>

      <title>Edge-First Language Model Inference: Models, Metrics, and Tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Language Models (LMs) across industries is driving interest in deploying these services across the computing continuum, from the cloud to the network edge. This shift aims to reduce costs, lower latency, and improve reliability and privacy. Small Language Models (SLMs), enabled by advances in model compression, are central to this shift, offering a path to on-device inference on resource-constrained edge platforms. This work examines the interplay between edge and cloud deployments, starting from detailed benchmarking of SLM capabilities on single edge devices, and extending to distributed edge clusters. We identify scenarios where edge inference offers comparable performance with lower costs, and others where cloud fallback becomes essential due to limits in scalability or model capacity. Rather than proposing a one-size-fits-all solution, we present platform-level comparisons and design insights for building efficient, adaptive LM inference systems across heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Asynchronous Federated Learning: A~Delicate Trade-Off Between Model-Parameter Staleness and Update Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronous federated learning (FL) scales poorly with the number of clients due to the straggler effect. Algorithms like FedAsync and GeneralizedFedAsync address this limitation by enabling asynchronous communication between clients and the central server. In this work, we rely on stochastic modeling and analysis to better understand the impact of design choices in asynchronous FL algorithms, such as the concurrency level and routing probabilities, and we leverage this knowledge to optimize loss. Compared to most existing studies, we account for the joint impact of heterogeneous and variable service speeds and heterogeneous datasets at the clients. We characterize in particular a fundamental trade-off for optimizing asynchronous FL: minimizing gradient estimation errors by avoiding model parameter staleness, while also speeding up the system by increasing the throughput of model updates. Our two main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we prove a discrete variant of Little's law to derive a closed-form expression for relative delay, a metric that quantifies staleness. This allows us to efficiently minimize the average loss per model update, which has been the gold standard in literature to date. Second, we observe that naively optimizing this metric leads us to slow down the system drastically by overemphazing staleness at the detriment of throughput. This motivates us to introduce an alternative metric that also takes system speed into account, for which we derive a tractable upper-bound that can be minimized numerically. Extensive numerical results show that these optimizations enhance accuracy by 10% to 30%.</description>
