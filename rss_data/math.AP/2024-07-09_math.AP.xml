      <title>Positive and nodal limiting profiles for a semilinear elliptic equation with a shrinking region of attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and concentration of positive and nodal solutions to a Schr\"odinger equation in the presence of a shrinking self-focusing core of arbitrary shape. Via a suitable rescaling, the concentration gives rise to a limiting profile that solves a nonautonomous elliptic semilinear equation with a sharp sign change in the nonlinearity. We characterize the (radial or foliated Schwarz) symmetries and the (polynomial) decay of the least-energy positive and nodal limiting profiles.</description>

      <title>A Trilinear Strichartz estimate for the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation with application in well-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the modified Zakharov-Kusnetsov equation. We prove the associated Cauchy problem is locally (in time) well-posed in $H^s(\R \times \T)$ for $s &gt;1$. The new ingredient in this work is a trilinear estimate in the context of Bourgain spaces which controls the cubic non-linearity of the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation in the contraction argument.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Finsler $N$-Laplacian Liouville equation in convex cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the anisotropic Finsler $N$-Laplacian Liouville equation \[-\Delta ^{H}_{N}u=e^u \qquad {\rm{in}}\,\, \mathcal{C},\] where $N\geq2$, $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is an open convex cone including $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, the half space $\mathbb{R}^{N}_{+}$ and $\frac{1}{2^{m}}$-space $\mathbb{R}^{N}_{2^{-m}}:=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{N}\mid x_{1},\cdots,x_{m}&gt;0\}$ ($m=1,\cdots,N$), and the anisotropic Finsler $N$-Laplacian $\Delta ^{H}_{N}$ is induced by a positively homogeneous function $H(x)$ of degree $1$. All solutions to the Finsler $N$-Laplacian Liouville equation with finite mass are completely classified. In particular, if $H(\xi)=|\xi|$, then the Finsler $N$-Laplacian $\Delta ^{H}_{N}$ reduces to the regular $N$-Laplacian $\Delta_N$. Our result is a counterpart in the limiting case $p=N$ of the classification results in \cite{CFR} for the critical anisotropic $p$-Laplacian equations with $1&lt;p&lt;N$ in convex cones, and also extends the classification results in \cite{CK,CL,CW,CL2,E} for Liouville equation in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ to general convex cones. In our proof, besides exploiting the anisotropic isoperimetric inequality inside convex cones, we have also proved and applied the radial Poincar\'{e} type inequality (Lemma \ref{A1}), which are key ingredients in the proof and of their own importance and interests.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the two-dimensional stationary Navier--Stokes equations around a uniform flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the solvability of the two-dimensional stationary Navier--Stokes equations on the whole plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. In [6], it was proved that the stationary Navier--Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^2$ is ill-posed for solutions around zero. In contrast, considering solutions around the non-zero constant flow, the perturbed system has a better regularity in the linear part, which enables us to prove the unique existence of solutions in the scaling critical spaces of the Besov type.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we show how one can restore an unknown nonlinear partial differential equation of a sine-Gordon type from its linearization around an unknown stationary kink. The key idea is to regard the ground state of the linear problem as the translation-related Goldstone mode of the nonlinear PDE sought after.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness for local and nonlocal quasilinear evolution equations in fluids and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a Schauder-type estimate for general local and non-local linear parabolic system $$\partial_tu+\mathbf{L}_su=\Lambda^\gamma f+g$$ in $(0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^d$ where $\Lambda=(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, $0&lt;\gamma\leq s$, $\mathbf{L}_s$ is the Pesudo-differential operator defined by \begin{equation}
  \mathbf{L}_su(t,x)=(2\pi)^{-\frac{d}{2}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\mathsf{A}(t,x,\xi)\hat u(t,\xi)e^{ix\cdot\xi}d\xi,\quad\quad \mathsf{A}(t,x,\xi)\sim |\xi|^s.
  \end{equation}
  To prove this, we develop a new freezing coefficient method for kernel, where we freeze the coefficient at $x_0$, then derive a representation formula of the solution, and finally we take $x_0=x$ when estimating the solution.
  By applying our Schauder-type estimate to suitably chosen differential operators $\mathcal{L}_s$, we obtain critical well-posedness results of various local and non-local nonlinear evolution equations in geometry and fluids, including hypoviscous Navier--Stokes equations, the surface quasi-geostrophic equation, mean curvature equations, Willmore flow, surface diffusion flow, Peskin equations, thin-film equations and Muskat equations.</description>

      <title>Recovery of an inclusion in Photoacoustic imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In photoacoustic imaging the objective is to determine the optical properties of biological tissue from boundary measurement of the generated acoustic wave. Here, we propose a restriction to piecewise constant media parameters. Precisely we assume that the acoustic speed and the optical coefficients take two different constants inside and outside a star shaped inclusion. We show that the inclusion can be uniquely recovered from a single measurement. We also derive a stability estimate of Lipschitz type of the inversion. The proof of stability is based on an integral representation and a new observability inequality for the wave equation with piecewise constant speed that is of interest itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in four-dimensional Dirac-Klein-Gordon equations, a fundamental model in particle physics. The main goal of this paper is to establish global existence of solutions to the coupled system and to explore their long-time behavior. The results are valid uniformly for mass parameters varying in the interval $[0,1]$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\mathfrak g}$ be a Garding-Dirichlet operator on the set S(n) of symmetric $n\times n$ matrices. We assume that ${\mathfrak g}$ is $I$-central, that is, $D_I {\mathfrak g} = k I$ for some $k&gt;0$. Then $$ {\mathfrak g}(A)^{1\over N} \ \geq\ {\mathfrak g}(I)^{1\over N} (\det\, A)^{1\over n} \qquad \forall\, A&gt;0. $$ From work of Guo, Phong, Tong, Abja, Dinew, Olive and many others, this inequality has important applications.</description>

      <title>Sharp Sobolev regularity for widely degenerate parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider local weak solutions to the widely degenerate parabolic PDE \[ \partial_{t}u-\mathrm{div}\left((\vert Du\vert-\lambda)_{+}^{p-1}\frac{Du}{\vert Du\vert}\right)=f\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm{in}\,\,\,\Omega_{T}=\Omega\times(0,T), \] where $p\geq2$, $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq2$, $\lambda$ is a non-negative constant and $\left(\,\cdot\,\right)_{+}$ stands for the positive part. Assuming that the datum $f$ belongs to a suitable Lebesgue-Besov parabolic space when $p&gt;2$ and that $f\in L_{loc}^{2}(\Omega_{T})$ if $p=2$, we prove the Sobolev spatial regularity of a novel nonlinear function of the spatial gradient of the weak solutions. This result, in turn, implies the existence of the weak time derivative for the solutions of the evolutionary $p$-Poisson equation. The main novelty here is that $f$ only has a Besov or Lebesgue spatial regularity, unlike the previous work [6], where $f$ was assumed to possess a Sobolev spatial regularity of integer order. We emphasize that the results obtained here can be considered, on the one hand, as the parabolic analog of some elliptic results established in [5], and on the other hand as the extension to a strongly degenerate setting of some known results for less degenerate parabolic equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider evolution (non-stationary) space-periodic solutions to the $n$-dimensional non-linear Navier-Stokes equations of anisotropic fluids with the viscosity coefficient tensor variable in space and time and satisfying the relaxed ellipticity condition. Employing the Galerkin algorithm, we prove the existence of Serrin-type solutions, that is, weak solutions with the velocity in the periodic space $L_2(0,T;\dot{\mathbf H}^{n/2}_{\#\sigma})$, $n\ge 2$. The solution uniqueness and regularity results are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study semi-linear evolutionary problems where the linear part is the generator of a positive $C_0$-semigroup. The non-linear part is assumed to be quasi-increasing. Given an initial value in between a sub- and a super-solution of the stationary problem we find a solution of the semi-linear evolutionary problem. Convergence as $t\to\infty$ is also studied for the solutions. Our results are applied to the logistic equation with diffusion, to a Lotka-Volterra competition model and the Fisher equation from population genetics.</description>

      <title>On the existence of strong solutions for unsteady motion of incompressible chemically reacting generalized Newtonian fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of nonlinear partial differential equations modeling the unsteady motion of an incompressible generalized Newtonian fluid with chemical reactions. The system consists of the generalized Navier-Stokes equations with power-law type viscosity with a power-law index depending on the concentration, and the convection-diffusion equation which describes chemical concentration. This system of partial differential equations arises in the mathematical models describing the synovial fluid which can be found in the cavities of movable joints. We prove the existence of a global strong solution for the two and three-dimensional spatially periodic domain, provided that the power-law index is greater than or equal to $(d+2)/2$ where $d$ is the dimension of the spatial domain. Moreover, we also prove that such a solution is unique under the further assumption that $p^+ &lt; \frac{3}{2} p^-$ for the two-dimensional case and $p^+ &lt; \frac{7}{6}p^-$ for the three-dimensional case, where $p^-$ and $p^+$ are the lower and upper bounds of the power-law index $p(\cdot)$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Gradient regularity for a class of doubly nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the local gradient regularity of non-negative weak solutions to doubly nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations of the type \begin{align*}
  \partial_t u^q - \mbox{div}\, A(x,t,Du)=0
  \qquad\mbox{in $\Omega_T$}, \end{align*} with $q&gt;0$, $\Omega_T=\Omega\times(0,T)\subset\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ a space-time cylinder, and $A=A(x,t,\xi)$ a vector field satisfying standard $p$-growth conditions. Our main result establishes the local H\"older continuity of the spatial gradient of non-negative weak solutions in the super-critical fast diffusion regime $$0&lt;p-1&lt;q&lt;\frac{n(p-1)}{(n-p)_+}.$$ This result is achieved by utilizing a time-insensitive Harnack inequality and Schauder estimates that are developed for equations of parabolic $p$-Laplacian type. Additionally, we establish a local $L^{\infty}$-bound for the spatial gradient.</description>

The main point of the current article is, comparing to previous work \cite{Deng2023}, that we obtain estimates beyond the semiclassical time regime. Our estimate is sharp in the sense that one can construct examples which saturate this estimate.</description>

      <title>Uniform resolvent and orthonormal Strichartz estimates for repulsive Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the uniform resolvent and orthonormal Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger operator. First we prove the Keel-Tao type theorem for the orthonormal Strichartz estimates, which means that the dispersive estimates yield the orthonormal Strichartz estimates for strongly continuous unitary groups. This result applies to many Schr\"odinger propagators which are difficult to treat by the smooth perturbation theory, for example, local-in-time estimates for the Schr\"odinger operator with unbounded electromagnetic potentials, the $(k, a)$-generalized Laguerre operators and global-in-time estimates for the Schr\"odinger operator with scaling critical magnetic potentials including the Aharonov-Bohm potentials. Next we observe mapping properties of resolvents for the repulsive Hamiltonian and apply to the orthonormal Strichartz estimates. We prove the Kato-Yajima type uniform resolvent estimates with logarithmic decaying weight functions. This is new even when without perturbations. The proof is dependent on the microlocal analysis and the Mourre theory. We also discuss mapping properties on the Schwartz class and the Lebesgue space.</description>

      <title>Cellular diffusion processes in singularly perturbed domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many processes in cell biology that can be modeled in terms of particles diffusing in a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^d$ containing a set of small subdomains or interior compartments $\calU_j$, $j=1,\ldots,N$ (singularly-perturbed diffusion problems). The domain $\Omega$ could represent the cell membrane, the cell cytoplasm, the cell nucleus or the extracellular volume, while an individual compartment could represent a synapse, a membrane protein cluster, a biological condensate, or a quorum sensing bacterial cell. In this review we use a combination of matched asymptotic analysis and Green's function methods to solve a general type of singular boundary value problems (BVP) in 2D and 3D, in which an inhomogeneous Robin condition is imposed on each interior boundary $\partial \calU_j$. This allows us to incorporate a variety of previous studies of singularly perturbed diffusion problems into a single mathematical modeling framework. We mainly focus on steady-state solutions and the approach to steady-state, but also highlight some of the current challenges in dealing with time-dependent solutions and randomly switching processes</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we provide a new proof of the $W^{2,p}$ \textit{Calder\'on-Zygmund} regularity estimates for the Laplacian, i.e., $\Delta u=f$ and its parabolic counterpart $\partial_t u-\Delta u=f$. Our proof is an adaptation of a contradiction and compactness argument that so far had been only used to prove estimates in H\"older spaces. This new approach is simpler than previous ones, and avoids the use of any interpolation theorem.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Carrollian fluids II: $C^1$ blow-up criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Carrollian fluid equations arise from the equations for relativistic fluids in the limit as the speed of light vanishes, and have recently experienced a surge of interest in the theoretical physics community in the context of asymptotic symmetries and flat-space holography. In this paper we initiate the rigorous systematic analysis of these equations by studying them in one space dimension in the $C^1$ setting. We begin by proposing a notion of isentropic Carrollian equations, and use this to reduce the Carrollian equations to a $2 \times 2$ system of conservation laws. Using the scheme of Lax, we then classify when $C^1$ solutions to the isentropic Carrollian equations exist globally, or blow up in finite time. Our analysis assumes a Carrollian analogue of a constitutive relation for the Carrollian energy density, with exponent in the range $\gamma \in (1,3]$.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional Carrollian Fluids III: Global Existence and Weak Continuity in $L^\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Carrollian fluid equations arise as the $c \to 0$ limit of the relativistic fluid equations and have recently experienced a surge of activity in the flat-space holography community. However, the rigorous mathematical well-posedness theory for these equations does not appear to have been previously studied. This paper is the third in a series in which we initiate the systematic analysis of the Carrollian fluid equations. In the present work we prove the global-in-time existence of bounded entropy solutions to the isentropic Carrollian fluid equations in one spatial dimension for a particular constitutive law ($\gamma = 3$). Our method is to use a vanishing viscosity approximation for which we establish a compensated compactness framework. Using this framework we also prove the compactness of entropy solutions in $L^\infty$, and establish a kinetic formulation of the problem. This global existence result in $L^\infty$ extends the $C^1$ theory presented in our companion paper ``One-Dimensional Carrollian Fluids II: $C^1$ Blow-up Criteria''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every given $\beta&lt;0$, we study the problem of maximizing the first Robin eigenvalue of the Laplacian $\lambda_\beta(\Omega)$ among convex (not necessarily smooth) sets $\Omega\subset\mathbb{S}^{n}$ with fixed perimeter. In particular, denoting by $\sigma_n$ the perimeter of the $n$-dimensional hemisphere, we show that for fixed perimeters $P&lt;\sigma_n$, geodesic balls maximize the eigenvalue. Moreover, we prove a quantitative stability result for this isoperimetric inequality in terms of volume difference between $\Omega$ and the ball $D$ of the same perimeter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a possible nonlocal approximation of the Willmore functional, in the sense of Gamma-convergence, based on the first variation ot the fractional Allen-Cahn energies, and we prove the corresponding $\Gamma$-limsup estimate. Our analysis is based on the expansion of the fractional Laplacian in Fermi coordinates and fine estimates on the decay of higher order derivatives of the one-dimensional nonlocal optimal profile. This result is the nonlocal counterpart of that obtained by Bellettini and Paolini, where they proposed a phase-field approximation of the Willmore functional based on the first variation of the (local) Allen-Cahn energies.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness in the Leray-Hopf class for a dyadic Navier-Stokes model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uniqueness of Leray-Hopf solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations remains a significant open question in fluid mechanics. This paper proposes a potential mechanism for non-uniqueness, illustrated in a natural dyadic shell model. We show that, for the Obukhov model with $d&gt;2$, there exist initial data at the critical regularity that give rise to two distinct Leray-Hopf solutions. These solutions exhibit an approximately discretely self-similar structure, with non-uniqueness resulting from a partial breaking of the scaling symmetry. The fundamental observation is that, in a certain scenario, the dynamics reduce to a sequence of weakly coupled finite-dimensional systems. Moreover, the predominant nonlinear interactions are identical to those arising in convex integration, suggesting the possibility of a similar construction in the full PDE setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solutions of Stochastic Differential Equations can have three types of explosive behaviors: almost-sure non-explosive, explosion with positive probability, and almost sure explosion. In this paper, we will provide a survey of Khasminskii's Lyapunov method for classifying explosive behaviors of solutions of stochastic differential equations. We will embark our expedition by examining the renowned Feller's test for explosion and observing its shortfalls. Afterwards, we will present Khasminskii's Lyapunov method for almost-sure non-explosion, explosion with positive probability, and almost-sure explosion. Ample examples will be provided to illuminate the power of Khasminskii's Lyapunov methods. Furthermore, quick layovers will be made to extend Khasminskii's Lyapunov method for almost-sure non-explosion and explosion with positive probability for jump processes with constant Poisson intensities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reparable systems are systems that are characterized by their ability to undergo maintenance actions when failures occur. These systems are often described by transport equations, all coupled through an integro-differential equation. In this paper, we address the understudied aspect of the controllability of reparable systems. In particular, we focus on a two-state reparable system and our goal is to design a control strategy that enhances the system availability -- the probability of being operational when needed. We establish bilinear controllability, demonstrating that appropriate control actions can manipulate system dynamics to achieve desired availability levels. We provide theoretical foundations and develop control strategies that leverage the bilinear structure of the equations.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and Bilinear Controllability of a Repairable System with Degraded State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the dynamics of repairable systems characterized by three distinct states: one signifying normal operational states, another representing degraded conditions and a third denoting failed conditions. These systems are characterized by their ability to be repaired when failures and/or degradation occur. Typically described by transport equations, these systems exhibit a coupled nature, interlinked through integro-differential equations and integral boundary conditions that dictate the transitions among all the states. In this paper, we address two less-explored facets: 1) the well-posedness and the asymptotic behavior of such systems with maximum repair time being finite; and 2) the bilinear controllability of the system via repair actions. In particular, we focus on the case where only one degraded and one failed states exist. We first discuss part 1) for given time-independent repair rates and then design the space-time dependent repair strategies that can manipulate system dynamics to achieve the desired level over a finite horizon. Our objective is to enhance the system availability -- the probability of being operational when needed over a fixed period of time. We present rigorous analysis and develop control strategies that leverage the bilinear structure of the system model.</description>

      <title>An example of a small-time globally approximately controllable bilinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of physically relevant bilinear Schr\"odinger equations are known to be globally approximately controllable in large times. There are however examples which are globally approximately controllable in large times, but not in small times. This obstruction happens e.g. in the presence of (sub)quadratic potentials, because Gaussian states are preserved, at least for small times.
  In this work, we provide the first examples of small-time globally approximately controllable bilinear Schr\"odinger equations. In particular, we show that a control on the frequency of a quadratic potential permits to construct approximate solutions that evolve arbitrarily fast along specific transport flows, namely, space-dilations. Once we have access to space-dilations, we can exploit them to generate time-contractions. In this way, we build on previous results of large-time control, to obtain global approximate controllability in small times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $N$-branching Brownian motion with selection ($N$-BBM) is a particle system consisting of $N$ independent particles that diffuse as Brownian motions in $\mathbb{R}$, branch at rate one, and whose size is kept constant by removing the leftmost particle at each branching event. We establish the following selection principle: as $N \rightarrow \infty$ the stationary empirical measure of the $N$-particle system converges to the minimal travelling wave of the associated free boundary PDE. This resolves an open question going back at least to \cite[p.19]{Maillard2012} and \cite{GroismanJonckheer}, and follows a recent related result by the second author establishing a similar selection principle for the so-called Fleming-Viot particle system \cite{Tough23}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a boundary integral formulation for the dynamic problem of electromagnetic scattering and transmission by homogeneous dielectric obstacles. In the spirit of Costabel and Stephan, we use the transmission conditions to reduce the number of unknown densities and to formulate a system of coupled boundary integral equations describing the scattered and transmitted waves. The system is transformed into the Laplace domain where it is proven to be stable and uniquely solvable. The Laplace domain stability estimates are then used to establish the stability and unique solvability of the original time domain problem. Finally, we show how the bounds obtained in both Laplace and time domains can be used to derive error estimates for semi discrete Galerkin discretizations in space and for fully discrete numerical schemes that use Convolution Quadrature for time discretization and a conforming Galerkin method for discretization of the space variables.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, an approach to the moment closure problem on the basis of orthogonal polynomials derived from Gram matrices is proposed. Its properties are studied in the context of the moment closure problem arising in gas kinetic theory, for which the proposed approach is proven to have multiple attractive mathematical properties. Numerical studies are carried out for model gas particle distributions and the approach is compared to other moment closure methods, such as Grad's closure and the maximum-entropy method. The proposed ``Gramian'' closure is shown to provide very accurate results for a wide range of distribution functions.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem of a system of quadratic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations which was introduced by M. Colin and T. Colin (2004) as a model of laser-plasma interaction. For the nonperiodic case, the author proved the small data global well-posedness and the scattering at the scaling critical regularity for $d\geq 2$ when the coefficients of Laplacian satisfy some condition. In the present paper, we prove the well-posedness of the system for the periodic case. In particular, well-posedness is proved at the scaling critical regularity for $d\geq 3$ under some condition for the coefficients of Laplacian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.09097v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a model describing the evolution of thickness in a shallow ice sheet lying over a lithosphere. The model is thus governed by a set of variational inequalities that involve nonlinearities in the time derivative and in the elliptic term. Solutions are constructed via a finite difference scheme in time.</description>

      <title>Friction mediated by transient elastic linkages : asymptotic expansions and fat tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several results in previous works, strongly depend on the exponential tail of the linkages' distribution in our adhesive models. The purpose of this paper is to weaken this hypothesis and to allow more fat tails for large ages. From the biological point of view this means that we allow adhesions to be stronger, because linkages break less often. Moreover, in our previous articles, the asymptotic expansion of adhesion site's position and the corresponding error estimates also used some fast decay properties of the kernel, we show, when the kernel is a given function of age but constant in time, how to overcome this problem and construct asymptotic expansions in a systematic way at any order with respect to a small parameter $\epsilon$ representing the linkages' turnover.</description>

Abstract: In the article we study the Neumann $(p,q)$-eigenvalue problems in bounded H\"older $\gamma$-singular domains $\Omega_{\gamma}\subset \mathbb{R}^n$. In the case $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and $1&lt;q&lt;p^{*}_{\gamma}$ we prove solvability of this eigenvalue problem and existence of the minimizer of the associated variational problem. In addition, we establish some regularity results of the eigenfunctions and some estimates of $(p,q)$-eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>The prescribed mean curvature measure equation in non-parametric form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10592v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a weak formulation of the non-parametric prescribed mean curvature equation with measure data and show the existence and several properties of $BV$ solutions under natural assumptions on the prescribed measure. Our approach does not rely on approximate or viscosity-type solutions. It requires combining various ingredients, including Anzellotti's pairing theory for divergence-measure fields and its recent developments, a refinement of Anzellotti-Giaquinta approximation, and convex duality theory. We also prove a Gamma-convergence result valid for suitable smooth approximations of the prescribed measure, and a maximum principle for continuous weak solutions. We finally construct some examples of non-uniqueness, showing at the same time the need for the continuity assumption in the maximum principle and an unexpected feature of weak solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study is devoted to the interpretation and wellposedness of a stochastic NLS model with a quadratic nonlinearity and a space-time fractional noise. We focus on a rough regime corresponding to the case where the Hurst indexes of the fractional noise are small. In this specific case, we exhibit an explicit renormalization procedure allowing to restore the (local) convergence of the approximated solutions. We follow a pathwise-type approach emphasizing the distinction between the stochastic objects at the core of the dynamics and the general deterministic machinery.</description>

Abstract: We prove that arbitrary smooth perturbations of the zero equilibrium state of the repulsive pressureless Euler-Poisson equations, which describe the behavior of cold plasma, blow up for any non-constant doping profile already in one-dimensional space. Further, we study small perturbations of the equilibrium to determine which properties of the doping profile contribute to the blow-up. We also propose a numerical procedure that allows one to find the blow-up time for any initial data and present examples of such calculations for various doping profiles for standard initial data, corresponding to the laser pulse.</description>

      <title>On a Stochastic PDE Model for Epigenetic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a stochastic model to investigate epigenetic mutations, i.e., modifications of the genetic information that control gene expression patterns in a cell but do not alter the DNA sequence. Epigenetic mutations are related to environmental fluctuations, which leads us to consider (additive) noise as the driving element for such mutations. We focus on two applications: firstly, cancer immunotherapy involving macrophages' epigenetic modifications that we call tumor microenvironment noise-induced polarizations, and secondly, cell fate determination and mutation of the flower Arabidopsis thaliana. Due to the technicalities involving cancer biology for the first case, we present only a general review of this topic and show the details in a separate manuscript since our principal concerns here are the mathematical results that are important to validate our system as an appropriate epigenetic model; for such results, we rely on the theory of Stochastic PDE, theory of large deviations, and ergodic theory. Moreover, since epigenetic mutations are reversible, a fact currently exploited to develop so-called epi-drugs to treat diseases like cancer, we also investigate an optimal control problem for our system to study the reversal of epigenetic mutations.</description>

      <title>A Hidden Convexity of Nonlinear Elasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A technique for developing convex dual variational principles for the governing PDE of nonlinear elastostatics and elastodynamics is presented. This allows the definition of notions of a variational dual solution and a dual solution corresponding to the PDEs of nonlinear elasticity, even when the latter arise as formal Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to non-quasiconvex elastic energy functionals whose energy minimizers do not exist. This is demonstrated rigorously in the case of elastostatics for the Saint-Venant Kirchhoff material (in all dimensions), where the existence of variational dual solutions is also proven. The existence of a variational dual solution for the incompressible neo-Hookean material in 2-d is also shown. Stressed and unstressed elastostatic and elastodynamic solutions in 1 space dimension corresponding to a non-convex, double-well energy are computed using the dual methodology. In particular, we show the stability of a dual elastodynamic equilibrium solution for which there are regions of non-vanishing length with negative elastic stiffness, i.e.~non-hyperbolic regions, for which the corresponding primal problem is ill-posed and demonstrates an explosive `Hadamard instability;' this appears to have implications for the modeling of physically observed softening behavior in macroscopic mechanical response.</description>

We consider this problem for the cases with and without phase information. We prove uniqueness results and present examples of non-uniqueness for this problem for the case of compactly supported source function, and a Lipshitz stability estimate for the phased case is established. Relations with inverse scattering problem for the discrete Schr\"{o}dinger operators in the Born approximation are also provided.</description>

Abstract: We consider the singular limit of a chemotaxis model of bacterial collective motion recently introduced in arXiv:2009.11048 [math.AP]. The equation models aggregation-diffusion phenomena with advection that is discontinuous and depends sharply on the gradient of the density itself. The quasi-linearity of the problem poses major challenges in the construction of the solution and complications arise in the proof of regularity. Our method overcomes these obstacle by relying solely on entropy inequalities and the theory of monotone operators. We provide existence, uniqueness and smoothing estimates in any dimensional space.</description>

Abstract: We study the global dynamics of the collision of two solitons having the same mass for one-dimensional Nonlinear Schr\"odinger models with multi-power nonlinearity. For any natural number k, it is verified that if the incoming speed v between the two solitary waves is small enough, then, after the collision, the two solitons will move away with an outcoming speed v_{f}=v+O(v^{k}) and the remainder of the solution will also have energy and weighted norms of order O(v^{k}). This is applied to the one-dimensional models with polynomial odd nonlinearity having a stable soliton such as the cubic NLS and the cubic-quintic NLS.</description>

      <title>Poroelastic plate model obtained by simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16220v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the starting point of our analysis is \ a coupled system of linear elasticity and Stokes equation. We consider two small parameters: the thickness $h$ of the thin plate and the pore scale $\varepsilon(h)$ which depends on $h$. We will focus specifically on the case when the pore size is comparatively small relative to the thickness of the plate. The main goal here is derive a model of a poroelastic plate, starting from the $3D$ problem as $h$ goes to zero, using simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction techniques. The obtained model generalizes the poroelastic plate model derived by A. Mikeli\'c et. al. in 2015 using dimension reduction techniques from $3D$ Biot's equations in the sense that it also covers the case of contacts of poroelastic and (poro)elastic plate as well as the evolution equation with inertial term.</description>

In the mass critical and supercritical cases, we establish a criterion for blow-up of solutions to the problem for cylindrically symmetric data. The results extend the known ones with respect to blow-up of solutions to the problem for radially symmetric data in \cite{BHL}.</description>

Abstract: We prove \emph{uniform solvability estimates} for certain families of elliptic problems posed in a bounded family of domains (for example, a sequence that converges to another domain). We provide uniform estimates both in weighted and in usual Sobolev spaces. When the limit domain is a \emph{polygon} and the other domains are smooth, our results amount to rounding off'' the corners of the limit domain. The technique of proof is based on a suitable conformal modification of the metric, which makes the union of the domains a manifold with boundary and relative bounded geometry.</description>

Abstract: We investigate existence of global in time solutions and blow-up of solutions to the semilinear heat equation posed on infinite graphs. The source term is a general function $f(u)$. We always assume that the infimum of the spectrum of the Laplace operator $\lambda_1(G)$ on the graph is positive. According to an interaction between the behavior of $f$ close to $0$ and the value $\lambda_1(G)$, we get the existence of a global in time solution or blow-up of any nonnegative solution, provided that the initial datum is nontrivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.00247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work offers a new prospective on asymptotic perturbation theory for varying self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators. Employing symplectic formulation of self-adjointness we obtain a new version of Krein formula for resolvent difference which facilitates asymptotic analysis of resolvent operators via first order expansion for the family of Lagrangian planes associated with perturbed operators. Specifically, we derive a Riccati-type differential equation and the first order asymptotic expansion for resolvents of self-adjoint extensions determined by smooth one-parameter families of Lagrangian planes. This asymptotic perturbation theory yields a symplectic version of the abstract Kato selection theorem and Hadamard-Rellich-type variational formula for slopes of multiple eigenvalue curves bifurcating from an eigenvalue of the unperturbed operator. The latter, in turn, gives a general infinitesimal version of the celebrated formula equating the spectral flow of a path of self-adjoint extensions and the Maslov index of the corresponding path of Lagrangian planes. Applications are given to quantum graphs, periodic Kronig-Penney model, elliptic second order partial differential operators with Robin boundary conditions, and physically relevant heat equations with thermal conductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10560v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any $K&gt;2$ and the multiplicative cyclic group $\Omega_K$ of order $K$, consider any function $f:\Omega_K^n\to\mathbf{C}$ and its Fourier expansion $f(z)=\sum_{\alpha\in\{0,1,\ldots,K-1\}^n}a_\alpha z^\alpha$, with $d:=\text{deg}(f)$ denoting its degree as a multivariate polynomial.
  We prove a Bohnenblust--Hille (BH) inequality in this setting: the $\ell_{2d/(d+1)}$ norm of the Fourier coefficients of $f$ is bounded by $C(d,K)\|f\|_\infty$ with $C(d,K)$ independent of $n$.
  This is the interpolating case between the now well-understood BH inequalities for functions on the poly-torus ($K =\infty$) and the hypercube ($K=2$) but those extreme cases of $K$ have special properties whose absence for intermediate $K$ prevent a proof by the standard BH framework.
  New techniques are developed exploiting the group structure of $\Omega_K^n$.
  By known reductions, the cyclic group BH inequality also entails a noncommutative BH inequality for tensor products of the $K \times K$ complex matrix algebra (or in the language of quantum mechanics, systems of $K$-level qudits). These new BH inequalities generalize several applications in harmonic analysis and statistical learning theory to broader classes of functions and operators.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of singular Gibbs measures for three-dimensional Schr\"odinger-wave system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study singular Gibbs measures for the three-dimensional Schr\"odinger-wave system, also known as the Yukawa system. Our primary result is the phase transition between weak and strong coupling cases, a phenomenon absent in one- and two-dimensional cases. Therefore, the three-dimensional model turns out to be critical, exhibiting the phase transition. In the weak coupling case, the Gibbs measure can be normalized as a probability measure and is shown to be singular with respect to the Gaussian free field. Conversely, in the strong coupling case, the Gibbs measure cannot be constructed as a probability measure. In particular, the finite-dimensional truncated Gibbs measures have no weak limit in an appropriate space, even up to a subsequence.</description>

      <title>A critical drift-diffusion equation: intermittent behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a drift-diffusion process with a time-independent and divergence-free random drift that is of white-noise character. We are interested in the critical case of two space dimensions, where one has to impose a small-scale cut-off for well-posedness, and is interested in the marginally super-diffusive behavior on large scales.
  In the presence of an (artificial) large-scale cut-off at scale L, as a consequence of standard stochastic homogenization theory, there exist harmonic coordinates with a stationary gradient $F_L$; the merit of these coordinates being that under their lens, the drift-diffusion process turns into a martingale.
  It has recently been established that the second moments diverge as $\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2\sim\sqrt{\ln L}$ for $L\uparrow\infty$. We quantitatively show that in this limit, and in the regime of small P\'eclet number, $|F_L|^2/\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2$ is not equi-integrable, and that $\mathbb{E}|{\rm det}F_L|/\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2 $ is small. Hence the Jacobian matrix of the harmonic coordinates is very peaked and non-conformal.
  We establish this asymptotic behavior by characterizing a proxy $\tilde F_L$ introduced in previous work as the solution of an It\^{o} SDE w. r. t. the variable $\ln L$, and which implements the concept of a scale-by-scale homogenization based on a variance decomposition and admits an efficient calculus. For this proxy, we establish $\mathbb{E}|\tilde F_L|^4\gg(\mathbb{E}|\tilde F_L|^2)^2$ and $\mathbb{E}({\rm det}\tilde F_L-1)^2\ll 1$. In view of the former property, we assimilate this phenomenon to intermittency. In fact, $\tilde F_L$ behaves like a tensorial stochastic exponential, and as a field can be assimilated to multiplicative Gaussian chaos.</description>

      <title>Starshaped compact hypersurfaces in warped product manifolds II: a class of Hessian type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we are concerned with one particular class of fully nonlinear Hessian quotient type equations, which were initiated by Chu and Jiao in [Curvature estimates for a class of Hessian type equations. Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations $\textbf{60}$ (2021).]. Previously, various second order estimates have been derived for the $(k,l)$ quotients when $k-l \geq 2$, by following arguments of Chu-Jiao. Here we settle the remaining $k-l=1$ case by invoking a convenient lemma of Chen-Dong-Han in [Interior Hessian estimates for a class of Hessian type equations. Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations $\textbf{62}$ (2023).].</description>

      <title>Deformation of the heat kernel and the Brownian motion from the perspective of the Ben Sa\"id--Kobayashi--{\O}rsted $(k,a)$-generalized Laguerre semigroup theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We deform the heat kernel and the Brownian motion on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ from the perspective of "$(k,a)$-generalized Fourier analysis" with $k=0$. This is a new type of harmonic analysis proposed by S.Ben Sa\"id--T.Kobayashi--B.{\O}rsted from the representation theoretic viewpoint. In this paper, we construct the $a$-deformed heat kernel and $a$-deformed Brownian motion, and explore their some basic properties. We also prove that the $(k,a)$-generalized Fourier integral kernels are polynomial growth when $k=0$, for a justification of some discussions.</description>
