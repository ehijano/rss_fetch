      <title>On Hopf hypersurfaces of the complex quadric with constant principal curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify the Hopf hypersurfaces of the complex quadric $Q^m=SO_{m+2}/(SO_2SO_m)$ ($m\geq3$) with at most five distinct constant principal curvatures. We also classify the Hopf hypersurfaces of $Q^m$ ($m=3,4,5$) with constant principal curvatures. All these real hypersurfaces are open parts of homogeneous examples.</description>

      <title>On the creation of conjugate points for thermostats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M, g)$ be a closed oriented Riemannian surface, and let $SM$ be its unit tangent bundle. We show that the interior in the $\mathcal{C}^2$ topology of the set of smooth functions $\lambda:SM\to \mathbb{R}$ for which the thermostat $(M, g, \lambda)$ has no conjugate points is a subset of those functions for which the thermostat is projectively Anosov. Moreover, we prove that if a reversible thermostat is projectively Anosov, then its non-wandering set contains no conjugate points.</description>

      <title>Defects in unidimensional structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous work of the first authors, a non-holonomic model, generalising the micromorphic models and allowing for curvature (disclinations) to arise from the kinematic values, was presented. In the present paper, a generalisation of the classical models of Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko bending beams based on the mentioned work is proposed. The former is still composed of only one unidimensional scalar field, while the later introduces a third unidimensional scalar field, correcting the second order terms. The generalised Euler-Bernoulli beam is then shown to exhibit curvature (i.e. disclinations) linked to a third order derivative of the displacement, but no torsion (dislocations). Parallelly, the generalised Timoshenko beam is shown to exhibit both curvature and torsion, where the former is linked to the non-holonomy introduced in the generalisation. Lastly, using variational calculus, asymptotic values for the value taken by the curvature in static equilibrium are obtained when the second order contribution becomes negligible; along with an equation for the torsion in the generalised Timoshenko beam.</description>

      <title>A representation of range decreasing group homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The method of range decreasing group homomorphisms can be applied to study various maps between mapping spaces, includin holomorphic maps, group homomorphisms, linear maps, semigroup homomorphisms, Lie algebra homomorphisms and algebra homomorphisms [Z1, Z2]. Previous studies on range decreasing group homomorphisms have primarily focused on specific subsets of mapping groups. In this paper, we provide a characterization of a general range decreasing group homomorphism applicable to the entire mapping group. As applications, we compute a particular class of homomorphisms between mapping groups and identify all range decreasing group homomorphisms defined on specific mapping groups.</description>

      <title>Geodesic causality in Kerr spacetimes with $|a|\geq M$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytic extension of the Kerr spacetimes into the negative radial region contains closed causal curves for any non-zero rotation parameter $a$ and mass parameter $M$. Furthermore, the spacetimes become totally vicious when $|a|&gt;M$, meaning that through every point there exists a closed timelike curve. Despite this, we prove that the Kerr spacetimes do not admit any closed null geodesics when $|a|\geq M$. This result generalises recent findings by one of the authors, which showed the nonexistence of closed causal geodesics in the case $|a|&lt;M$. Combining these results, we establish the absence of closed null geodesics in Kerr spacetimes for any non-zero $a$.</description>

      <title>Four dimensional almost complex torus manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dimension 4, we extend the correspondence between compact nonsingular toric varieties and regular fans to a correspondence between almost complex torus manifolds and families of multi-fans in a geometric way, where an (almost) complex torus manifold is a $2n$-dimensional compact connected (almost) complex manifold equipped with an effective action of a real $n$-dimensional torus $T^n$ that has fixed points.
  Let $M$ be a 4-dimensional almost complex torus manifold. To $M$, we associate two equivalent combinatorial objects, a family $\Delta$ of multi-fans and a graph $\Gamma$, which encode the data on the fixed point set. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for each of $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$.
  Moreover, we provide a minimal model and operations for each of $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$. We introduce operations on a multi-fan and a graph that correspond to blow up and down of a manifold, and show that we can blow up and down $M$ to a minimal manifold $M'$ whose weights at the fixed points are unit vectors in $\mathbb{Z}^2$, $\Delta$ to a family of minimal multi-fans that has unit vectors only, and $\Gamma$ to a minimal graph whose edges all have unit vectors as labels.
  As an application, if $M$ is complex, $\Delta$ is a fan and determines $M$, $\Gamma$ encodes the equivariant cohomology of $M$, and $M'$ is $\mathbb{CP}^1 \times \mathbb{CP}^1$. This implies that any two 4-dimensional complex torus manifolds are obtained from each other by equivariant blow up and down.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results for non-K\"ahler Calabi-Yau geometries on threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a canonical symmetry reduction associated to a compact non-K\"ahler Bismut-Hermitian-Einstein manifold. In real dimension $6$, the transverse geometry is conformally K\"ahler, and we give a complete description in terms of a single scalar PDE for the underlying K\"ahler structure. In the case when the soliton potential is constant, we show that that the Bott-Chern number $h^{1,1}_{BC} \geq 2$, and that equality holds if and only if the metric is Bismut-flat, and hence a quotient of either $\SU(2) \times \mathbb R \times \mathbb C$ or $\SU(2) \times \SU(2)$.</description>

      <title>Partial AHS-Structures, their Cartan description and partial BGG sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: G-structures and Cartan geometries are two major approaches to the description of geometric structures (in the sense of differential geometry) on manifolds of some fixed dimension $n$. We show that both descriptions naturally extend to the setting of manifolds of dimension $\geq n$ which are endowed with a distinguished involutive distribution $F$ of rank $n$. The resulting ``partial'' structures are most naturally interpreted as smooth families of standard G-structures or Cartan geometries on the leaves of the foliation defined by $F$.
  We prove that for the special class of AHS-structures (also known as $|1|$-graded parabolic geometries) the construction of a canonical Cartan geometry associated to a G-structure extends to this general setting. As an application, we prove that for partial AHS-structures there is an analog of the machinery of BGG sequences. This constructs sequences of differential operators of arbitrarily high order intrinsic to the structures. Under appropriate flatness conditions, these sequence are fine resolutions of sheaves which locally can be realized as pullbacks of sheaves on local leaf spaces for the foliation defined by $F$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we will prove some rigidity theorems for blow up limits to Type II singularities of Lagrangian mean curvature flow with zero Maslov class or almost calibrated Lagrangian mean curvature flows, especially for Lagrangian translating solitons in any dimension. These theorems generalized previous corresponding results from two dimensional case to arbitrarily dimensional case.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a closed regular $(4k+1)$-Sasakian manifold $(M,h_0)$ admits a family of non-isometric metrics $h_\rho, \rho\geq 0,$ such that $\pi_1({\rm Isom}(M, h_\rho))$, the fundamental group of the isometry group, is infinite for $\rho&gt;0.$ For $M= S^{4k+1}$, this result holds for all $\rho&gt;0$, but fails at $\rho=0.$</description>

      <title>A Priori Estimates for Singularities of the Lagrangian Mean Curvature Flow with Supercritical Phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove interior a priori estimates for singularities of the Lagrangian mean curvature flow assuming the Lagrangian phase is supercritical. We prove a Jacobi inequality that holds good when the Lagrangian phase is critical and supercritical. We further extend our results to a broader class of Lagrangian mean curvature type equations.</description>

      <title>Contact homology of contact manifolds and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a survey of contact homology and its applications to the study of contact manifolds. It is a small tribute to Yasha Eliashberg's huge generosity with his countless explanations of his deep mathematical insights all along his career. It is also the author's wishful thinking that this text could be useful to students and young mathematicians for learning about some of the holomorphic curves based invariants in contact geometry.</description>
