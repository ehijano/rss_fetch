      <title>Frustrated Spin Systems: History of the Emergence of a Modern Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1977, G\'erard Toulouse has proposed a new concept termed as "frustration" in spin systems. Using this definition, several frustrated models have been created and studied, among them we can mention the Villain's model, the fully frustrated simple cubic lattice, the antiferromagnetic triangular lattice. The former models are systems with mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds, while in the latter containing only an antiferromagnetic interaction, the frustration is caused by the lattice geometry. These frustrated spin systems have novel properties that we will review in this paper. One of the striking aspects is the fact that well-established methods such as the renormalization group fail to deal with the nature of the phase transition in frustrated systems. Investigations of properties of frustrated spin systems have been intensive since the 80's. I myself got involved in several investigations of frustrated spin systems soon after my PhD. I have learned a lot from numerous discussions with G\'erard Toulouse. Until today, I am still working on frustrated systems such as skyrmions. In this review, I trace back a number of my works over the years on frustrated spin systems going from exactly solved 2D Ising frustrated models, to XY and Heisenberg 2D and 3D frustrated lattices. At the end I present my latest results on skyrmions resulting from the frustration caused by the competition between the exchange interaction and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction under an applied magnetic field. A quantum spin-wave theory using the Green's function method is shown and discussed.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Domain Adaptation in Spin Models with Continuous Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main question raised in the letter is the applicability of a neural network trained on a spin lattice model in one universality class to test a model in another universality class. The quantities of interest are the critical phase transition temperature and the correlation length exponent. In other words, the question of transfer learning is how ``universal'' the trained network is and under what conditions. The traditional approach with training and testing spin distributions turns out to be inapplicable for this purpose. Instead, we propose to use training and testing on binding energy distributions, which leads to successful estimates of the critical temperature and correlation length exponent for cross-tested Baxter-Wu and Ising models belonging to different universality classes.</description>

      <title>Testing the generalized conjugate field formalism in the kinetic Ising model with nonantisymmetric magnetic fields: A Monte Carlo simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed Monte Carlo simulations for the investigation of dynamic phase transitions on a honeycomb lattice which has garnered a significant amount of interest from the viewpoint of tailoring the intrinsic magnetism in two-dimensional materials. For the system under the influence of time-dependent magnetic field sequences exhibiting the half-wave anti-symmetry, we have located a second order dynamic phase transition between dynamic ferromagnetic and dynamic paramagnetic states. Particular emphasis was devoted for the examination of the generalized conjugate field formalism previously introduced in the kinetic Ising model [\color{blue}Quintana and Berger, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{104}, 044125 (202); Phys. Rev. E \textbf{109}, 054112] \color{black}. Based on the simulation data, in the presence of a second magnetic field component with amplitude $H_{2}$ and period $P/2$, the half-wave anti-symmetry is broken and the generalized conjugate field formalism is found to be valid for the present system. However, dynamic scaling exponent significantly deviates from its equilibrium value along with the manifestation of a dynamically field polarized state for non-vanishing $H_{2}$ values.</description>

      <title>Lax random matrices from Calogero systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of random matrices arising from the Lax matrix structure of classical integrable systems, particularly the Calogero family of models. Our focus is the density of eigenvalues for these random matrices. The problem can be mapped to analyzing the density of eigenvalues for generalized versions of conventional random matrix ensembles, including a modified form of the log-gas. The mapping comes from the underlying integrable structure of these models. Such deep connection is confirmed by extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. Thereby we move forward not only in terms of understanding such class of random matrices arising from integrable many-body systems, but also by providing a building block for the generalized hydrodynamic description of integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Effective dimensional reduction of complex systems based on tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact treatment of Markovian models of complex systems requires knowledge of probability distributions exponentially large in the number of components $n$. Mean-field approximations provide an effective reduction in complexity of the models, requiring only a number of phase space variables polynomial in system size. However, this comes at the cost of losing accuracy close to critical points in the systems dynamics and an inability to capture correlations in the system. In this work, we introduce a tunable approximation scheme for Markovian spreading models on networks based on Matrix Product States (MPS). By controlling the bond dimensions of the MPS, we can investigate the effective dimensionality needed to accurately represent the exact $2^n$ dimensional steady-state distribution. We introduce the entanglement entropy as a measure of the compressibility of the system and find that it peaks just after the phase transition on the disordered side, in line with the intuition that more complex states are at the 'edge of chaos'. We compare the accuracy of the MPS with exact methods on different types of small random networks and with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for a simplified version of the railway network of the Netherlands with 55 nodes. The MPS provides a systematic way to tune the accuracy of the approximation by reducing the dimensionality of the systems state vector, leading to an improvement over second-order mean-field approximations for sufficiently large bond dimensions.</description>

      <title>Crystal to liquid cross-over in the active Calogero-Moser model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional system comprising of $N$ run-and-tumble particles confined in a harmonic trap interacting via a repulsive inverse-square power-law interaction. This is the ``active" version of the Calogero-Moser system where the particles are associated with telegraphic noise with two possible states $\pm v_0$. We numerically compute the global density profile in the steady state which shows interesting crossovers between three different regimes: as the activity increases, we observe a change from a density with sharp peaks characteristic of a crystal region to a smooth bell-shaped density profile, passing through the intermediate stage of a smooth Wigner semi-circle characteristic of a liquid phase. We also investigate analytically the crossover between the crystal and the liquid regions by computing the covariance of the positions of these particles in the steady state in the weak noise limit. It is achieved by using the method introduced in Touzo {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 109}, 014136 (2024)] to study the active Dyson Brownian motion. Our analytical results are corroborated by thorough numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Deep Boundary Perturbations at a Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new class of problems in the study of (quantum) critical phenomena, termed "deep boundary criticality". Traditionally, critical systems are analyzed with two types of perturbations: those uniformly distributed throughout the bulk, which can significantly alter the bulk criticality by triggering a nontrivial bulk renormalization group flow, and those confined to a boundary or subdimensional defect, which affect only the boundary or defect condition. Here, we go beyond this paradigm by studying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay algebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying the decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect on the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this new regime using two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions. Through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover exotic scaling laws in simple observables and observe qualitative changes in model behavior as the decay exponent varies.</description>

      <title>A Universal Protocol for Quantum-Enhanced Sensing via Information Scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel protocol, which enables Heisenberg-limited quantum-enhanced sensing using the dynamics of any interacting many-body Hamiltonian. Our approach - dubbed butterfly metrology - utilizes a single application of forward and reverse time evolution to produce a coherent superposition of a "scrambled" and "unscrambled" quantum state. In this way, we create metrologically-useful long-range entanglement from generic local quantum interactions. The sensitivity of butterfly metrology is given by a sum of local out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) - the prototypical diagnostic of quantum information scrambling. Our approach broadens the landscape of platforms capable of performing quantum-enhanced metrology; as an example, we provide detailed blueprints and numerical studies demonstrating a route to scalable quantum-enhanced sensing in ensembles of solid-state spin defects.</description>

      <title>D-commuting SYK model: building quantum chaos from integrable blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of quantum chaotic models by combining multiple copies of integrable commuting SYK models. As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal.
  Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Parisi-Sourlas Supertranslation and Scale without Conformal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the possibility of emergent supersymmetry in critical random systems, we study a field theory model with a quartic potential of one superfield, possessing the Parisi-Sourlas supertranslation symmetry. Within perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion, we find nine non-trivial scale invariant renormalization group fixed points, but only one of them is conformal. We, however, believe scale invariance without conformal invariance cannot occur without a sophisticated mechanism because it predicts the existence of a non-conserved but non-renormalized vector operator called virial current, whose existence must be non-generic. We show that the virial current in this model is related to the supercurrent by supertranslation. The supertranslation Ward-Takahashi identity circumvents the genericity argument, explaining its non-renormalization property.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Thermal Fluctuations on Bosonic Correlations and the AC Stark Effect in Two-Level Atoms: A Superstatistical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of thermal fluctuations on the two-time correlation functions of bosonic baths within a superstatistics framework by assuming that fluctuations follow the gamma distribution. We further establish a connection between superstatistics and Tsallis non-additive thermodynamics by introducing a temperature-renormalizing parameter. Our results show that, for an Ohmic model, the system's correlation functions exhibit diverse time-dependent behaviors, with the real and imaginary parts displaying enhancement or suppression depending on temperature and fluctuation strength. Additionally, we analyze the impact of these fluctuations on the quantum master equation of a damped two-level atom coupled to an out-of-equilibrium radiation bath. We demonstrate that while the equation's algebraic structure remains intact, the coupling constants are modified by the fluctuation parameters and cavity volume. Specifically, we observe that the AC Stark effect undergoes significant modifications, with fluctuations influencing the transition between repulsive and attractive energy levels.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian entanglement asymmetry in random states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry measures the extent to which a symmetry is broken within a subsystem of an extended quantum system. Here, we analyse this quantity in Haar random states for arbitrary compact, semi-simple Lie groups, building on and generalising recent results obtained for the $U(1)$ symmetric case. We find that, for any symmetry group, the average entanglement asymmetry vanishes in the thermodynamic limit when the subsystem is smaller than its complement. When the subsystem and its complement are of equal size, the entanglement asymmetry jumps to a finite value, indicating a sudden transition of the subsystem from a fully symmetric state to one devoid of any symmetry. For larger subsystem sizes, the entanglement asymmetry displays a logarithmic scaling with a coefficient fixed by the dimension of the group. We also investigate the fluctuations of the entanglement asymmetry, which tend to zero in the thermodynamic limit. We check our findings against exact numerical calculations for the $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ groups. We further discuss their implications for the thermalisation of isolated quantum systems and black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>Topological comparison of flexible and semiflexible chains in polymer melts with $\theta$-chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central paradigm of polymer physics states that chains in melts behave like random walks as intra- and interchain interactions effectively cancel each other out. Likewise, $\theta$-chains, i.e., chains at the transition from a swollen coil to a globular phase, are also thought to behave like ideal chains, as attractive forces are counterbalanced by repulsive entropic contributions. While the simple mapping to an equivalent Kuhn chain works rather well in most scenarios with corrections to scaling, random walks do not accurately capture the topology and knots particularly for flexible chains. In this paper, we demonstrate with Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations that chains in polymer melts and $\theta$-chains not only agree on a structural level for a range of stiffnesses, but also topologically. They exhibit similar knotting probabilities and knot sizes, both of which are not captured by ideal chain representations. This discrepancy comes from the suppression of small knots in real chains, which is strongest for very flexible chains because excluded volume effects are still active locally and become weaker with increasing semiflexibility. Our findings suggest that corrections to ideal behavior are indeed similar for the two scenarios of real chains and that structure and topology of a chain in a melt can be approximately reproduced by a corresponding $\theta$-chain.</description>

      <title>The Dean-Kawasaki equation and stochastic density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dean-Kawasaki (DK) equation, which is at the basis of stochastic density functional theory (SDFT), was proposed in the mid-nineties to describe the evolution of the density of interacting Brownian particles, which can represent a large number of systems such as colloidal suspensions, supercooled liquids, polymer melts, biological molecules, active or chemotactic particles, or ions in solution. This theoretical framework, which can be summarized as a mathematical reformulation of the coupled overdamped Langevin equations that govern the dynamics of the particles, has attracted a significant amount of attention during the past thirty years. In this review, I present the context in which this framework was introduced, and I recall the main assumptions and calculation techniques that are employed to derive the DK equation. Then, in the broader context of statistical mechanics, I show how SDFT is connected to other theories, such fluctuating hydrodynamics, macroscopic fluctuation theory, or mode-coupling theory. The mathematical questions that are raised by the DK equation are presented in a non-specialist language. In the last parts of the review, I show how the original result was extended in several directions, I present the different strategies and approximations that have been employed to solve the DK equation, both analytically and numerically. I finally list the different situations where SDFT was employed to describe the fluctuations of Brownian suspensions, from the physics of active matter to the description of charged particles and electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Information scrambling and entanglement dynamics in Floquet Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and entanglement of entropy as quantitative measures of information propagation in disordered many-body systems exhibiting Floquet time-crystal (FTC) phases. We find that OTOC spreads in the FTC with different characteristic timescales due to the existence of a preferred ``quasi-protected'' direction - denoted as $\ell$-bit direction - along which the spins stabilize their period-doubling magnetization for exponentially long times. While orthogonal to this direction the OTOC thermalizes as an usual MBL time-independent system (at stroboscopic times), along the $\ell$-bit direction the system features a more complex structure. The scrambling appears as a combination of an initially frozen dynamics (while in the stable period doubling magnetization time window) and a later logarithmic slow growth (over its decoherence regime) till full thermalization. Interestingly, in the late time regime, since the wavefront propagation of correlations has already settled through the whole chain, scrambling occurs at the same rate regardless of the distance between the spins, thus resulting in an overall envelope-like structure of all OTOCs, independent of their distance, merging into a single growth. Alongside, the entanglement entropy shows a logarithmic growth over all time, reflecting the slow dynamics up to a thermal volume-law saturation.</description>

      <title>Far from equilibrium relaxation in the weak coupling limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly assumed that a large system, weakly coupled to a thermal environment through its boundaries, relaxes quasistatically towards the new equilibrium even when the temperature of the environment changes abruptly. Here we show how this intuitive picture can break down for discrete energy systems, even in the case of infinitely weak coupling. We provide an example in the Ising chain, showing how the interaction among degrees of freedom can create corrugated energy landscapes that are responsible for far-from-equilibrium and allow anomalous relaxation effects to survive infinitely weak couplings.</description>

      <title>Timescales of quantum and classical chaotic spin models evolving toward equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quench dynamics in a one-dimensional spin model, comparing both quantum and classical descriptions. Our primary focus is on the different timescales involved in the evolution of the observables as they approach statistical relaxation. Numerical simulations, supported by semi-analytical analysis, reveal that the relaxation of single-particle energies (global quantity) and on-site magnetization (local observable) occurs on a timescale independent of the system size $L$. This relaxation process is equally well-described by classical equations of motion and quantum solutions, demonstrating excellent quantum-classical correspondence, provided the system be strongly chaotic. The correspondence persists even for small quantum spin values ($S=1$), where a semi-classical approximation is not applicable. Conversely, for the participation ratio, which characterizes the initial state spread in the many-body Hilbert space and which lacks a classical analogue, the relaxation timescale is system-size dependent.</description>

      <title>Algebraic depletion interactions in two-temperature mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase separation that occurs in two-temperature mixtures, which are driven out of equilibrium at the local scale, has been thoroughly characterized, but much less is known about the depletion interactions that drive it. Using numerical simulations in dimension 2, we show that the depletion interactions extend beyond two particle diameters in dilute systems, as expected at equilibrium, and decay algebraically with an exponent $-4$. Solving for the $N$-particle distribution function in the stationary state, perturbatively in the interaction potential, we show that algebraic correlations with an exponent $-2d$ arise from triplets of particles at different temperatures in spatial dimension $d$. Finally, simulations allow us to extend our results beyond the perturbative limit.</description>

      <title>Energy cascade and Burgers turbulence in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of initial long-wavelength excitations of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain has been the subject of intense investigations since the pioneering work of Fermi and collaborators. We have recently found a new regime where the spectrum of the Fourier modes decays with a power-law and we have interpreted this regime as a transient turbulence associated with the Burgers equation. In this paper we present the full derivation of the latter equation from the lattice dynamics using a newly developed infinite dimensional Hamiltonian perturbation theory. This theory allows us to relate the time evolution of the Fourier spectrum $E_k$ of the Burgers equation to the one of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain. As a consequence, we derive analytically both the shock time and the power-law $-8/3$ of the spectrum at this time. Using the shock time as a unit, we follow numerically the time-evolution of the spectrum and observe the persistence of the power $-2$ over an extensive time window. The exponent $-2$ has been widely discussed in the literature on the Burgers equation. The analysis of the Burgers equation in Fourier space also gives information on the time evolution of the energy of each single mode which, at short time, is also a power-law depending on the $k$-th wavenumber $E_k \sim t^{2k-2}$. This approach to the FPUT dynamics opens the way to a wider study of scaling regimes arising from more general initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of charged dual-unitary circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetries and entanglement in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems is currently at the centre of an intense multidisciplinary research effort. Here we introduce a setting where these questions can be characterised exactly by considering dual-unitary circuits with an arbitrary number of $U(1)$ charges. After providing a complete characterisation of these systems we show that one can introduce a class of solvable states, which extends that of generic dual unitary circuits, for which the non-equilibrium dynamics can be solved exactly. In contrast to the known class of solvable states, which relax to the infinite temperature state, these states relax to a family of non-trivial generalised Gibbs ensembles. The relaxation process of these states can be simply described by a linear growth of the entanglement entropy followed by saturation to a non-maximal value but with maximal entanglement velocity. We then move on to consider the dynamics from non-solvable states, combining exact results with the entanglement membrane picture we argue that the entanglement dynamics from these states is qualitatively different from that of the solvable ones. It shows two different growth regimes characterised by two distinct slopes, both corresponding to sub-maximal entanglement velocities. Moreover, we show that non-solvable initial states can give rise to the quantum Mpemba effect, where less symmetric initial states restore the symmetry faster than more symmetric ones.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of symmetry-resolved entanglement and entanglement asymmetry: Exact asymptotics in Rule 54</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry resolved entanglement and entanglement asymmetry are two measures of quantum correlations sensitive to symmetries of the system. Here we discuss their non-equilibrium dynamics in the Rule 54 cellular automaton, a simple, yet interacting, integrable model. Both quantities can be expressed in terms of the more analytically tractable "charged moments", i.e. traces of powers of a suitably deformed density matrix, via a replica trick. We express them in terms of a tensor network, which we contract in space using a system of local algebraic relations. This gives the asymptotic form for the charged moments, valid in the regime of large but finite time that is shorter than all the relevant subsystem sizes. In this regime the charge moments decay exponentially with the rate given by the leading solution to a cubic equation.</description>

      <title>Population Dynamics of Schr\"odinger Cats</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate an exact equivalence between classical population dynamics and Lindbladian evolution admitting a dark state and obeying a set of certain local symmetries. We then introduce {\em quantum population dynamics} as models in which this local symmetry condition is relaxed. This allows for non-classical processes in which animals behave like Schr\"odinger's cat and enter superpositions of live and dead states, thus resulting in coherent superpositions of different population numbers. We develop a field theory treatment of quantum population models as a synthesis of Keldysh and third quantization techniques and draw comparisons to the stochastic Doi-Peliti field theory description of classical population models. We apply this formalism to study a prototypical ``Schr\"odigner cat'' population model on a $d$-dimensional lattice, which exhibits a phase transition between a dark extinct phase and an active phase that supports a stable quantum population. Using a perturbative renormalization group approach, we find a critical scaling of the Schr\"odinger cat population distinct from that observed in both classical population dynamics and usual quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Decomposing force fields as flows on graphs reconstructed from stochastic trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disentangling irreversible and reversible forces from random fluctuations is a challenging problem in the analysis of stochastic trajectories measured from real-world dynamical systems. We present an approach to approximate the dynamics of a stationary Langevin process as a discrete-state Markov process evolving over a graph-representation of phase-space, reconstructed from stochastic trajectories. Next, we utilise the analogy of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of an edge-flow on a contractible simplicial complex with the associated decomposition of a stochastic process into its irreversible and reversible parts. This allows us to decompose our reconstructed flow and to differentiate between the irreversible currents and reversible gradient flows underlying the stochastic trajectories. We validate our approach on a range of solvable and nonlinear systems and apply it to derive insight into the dynamics of flickering red-blood cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. In particular, we capture the difference in irreversible circulating currents between healthy and passive cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. Our method breaks new ground at the interface of data-driven approaches to stochastic dynamics and graph signal processing, with the potential for further applications in the analysis of biological experiments and physiological recordings. Finally, it prompts future analysis of the convergence of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition in discrete and continuous spaces.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the constant Yang-Baxter equation: additive charge conservation in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find all solutions to the constant Yang--Baxter equation $R_{12}R_{13}R_{23}=R_{23}R_{13}R_{12}$ in three dimensions, subject to an additive charge-conservation ansatz. This ansatz is a generalisation of (strict) charge-conservation, for which a complete classification in all dimensions was recently obtained. Additive charge-conservation introduces additional sector-coupling parameters -- in 3 dimensions there are $4$ such parameters. In the generic dimension 3 case, in which all of the $4$ parameters are nonzero, we find there is a single 3 parameter family of solutions. We give a complete analysis of this solution, giving the structure of the centraliser (symmetry) algebra in all orders. We also solve the remaining cases with three, two, or one nonzero sector-coupling parameter(s).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that slow growth of the number entropy following a quench from a local product state is consistent with many-body localization. To do this we construct a random circuit l-bit model with exponentially localized l-bits and exponentially decaying interactions between them. We observe an ultraslow growth of the number entropy starting from a N\'eel state, saturating at a value that grows with system size. This suggests that the observation of such growth in microscopic models is not sufficient to rule out many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Sensing atomic superfluid rotation beyond the standard quantum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic superfluids formed using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a ring trap are currently being investigated in the context of superfluid hydrodynamics, quantum sensing and matter-wave interferometry. The characterization of the rotational properties of such superfluids is important, but can presently only be performed by using optical absorption imaging, which completely destroys the condensate. Recent studies have proposed coupling the ring BEC to optical cavity modes carrying orbital angular momentum to make minimally destructive measurements of the condensate rotation. The sensitivity of these proposals, however, is bounded below by the standard quantum limit set by the combination of laser shot noise and radiation pressure noise. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework that exploits the fact that the interaction between the scattered modes of the condensate and the light reduces to effective optomechanical equations of motion. We present a detailed theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the use of squeezed light and backaction evasion techniques allows the angular momentum of the condensate to be sensed with noise well below the standard quantum limit. Our proposal is relevant to atomtronics, quantum sensing and quantum information.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the scaling behavior of Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes in the ordered phase of the Vicsek model, introducing a phenomenological equation of motion (EOM) incorporating a previously overlooked non-linear term. This term arises from the interaction between velocity fields and density fluctuations, leading to new scaling behaviors. We derive exact scaling exponents in two dimensions, which reproduce the isotropic scaling behavior reported in a prior numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Open-system eigenstate thermalization in a noninteracting integrable model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant attention has been devoted to the problem of thermalization of observables in isolated quantum setups by individual eigenstates. Here, we address this issue from an open quantum system perspective, examining an isolated setup where a small system (specifically, a single fermionic level) is coupled to a macroscopic fermionic bath. We argue that in such a model, despite its full integrability, the system observables exhibit thermalization when the system-bath setup resides in a typical eigenstate of its Hamiltonian, a phenomenon known as weak eigenstate thermalization. This thermalization occurs unless it is suppressed by localization due to strong coupling. We further show that following the quench of the system Hamiltonian, the system occupancy typically relaxes to the thermal value corresponding to the new Hamiltonian. Finally, we demonstrate that system thermalization also arises when the system is coupled to a bath that has been initialized in a typical eigenstate of its Hamiltonian. Our findings suggest that nonintegrability is not the sole driver of thermalization, highlighting the need for complementary approaches to fully understand the emergence of statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

Abstract: Results regarding spin glass models are, to this day, mainly confined to models with Ising spins. Spin glass models with continuous spins exhibit interesting new physical behaviors related to the additional degrees of freedom, but have been primarily studied on fully connected topologies. Only recently some advancements have been made in the study of continuous models on sparse graphs. In this work we partially fill this void by introducing a method to solve numerically the Belief Propagation equations for systems of Heisenberg spins on sparse random graphs via a discretization of the sphere. We introduce techniques to study the finite-temperature, finite-connectivity case as well as novel algorithms to deal with the zero-temperature and large connectivity limits. As an application, we locate the de Almeida-Thouless line for this class of models and the critical field at zero temperature, showing the full consistency of the methods presented. Beyond the specific results reported for Heisenberg models, the approaches presented in this paper have a much broader scope of application and pave the way to the solution of strongly disordered models with continuous variables.</description>

      <title>Fermionic and parafermionic CFTs with $\widehat{su}(2)$ and $\widehat{su}(3)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with affine $\widehat{su}(2)$ and $\widehat{su}(3)$ algebra symmetry. Their bosonic modular-invariant partition functions have been fully classified based on the ADE classification. In this work, we extend the classification to include fermionic and parafermionic CFTs with the same affine symmetries, utilizing techniques of fermionization and parafermionization. We find that the fermionic and parafermionic $\widehat{su}(2)$ models are related to non-simply laced Dynkin diagrams.</description>
