      <title>WaterWise: Co-optimizing Carbon- and Water-Footprint Toward Environmentally Sustainable Cloud Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The carbon and water footprint of large-scale computing systems poses serious environmental sustainability risks. In this study, we discover that, unfortunately, carbon and water sustainability are at odds with each other - and, optimizing one alone hurts the other. Toward that goal, we introduce, WaterWise, a novel job scheduler for parallel workloads that intelligently co-optimizes carbon and water footprint to improve the sustainability of geographically distributed data centers.</description>

      <title>MirLibSpark: A Scalable NGS Plant MicroRNA Prediction Pipeline for Multi-Library Functional Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the Next Generation Sequencing increases drastically the volume of transcriptomic data. Although many standalone algorithms and workflows for novel microRNA (miRNA) prediction have been proposed, few are designed for processing large volume of sequence data from large genomes, and even fewer further annotate functional miRNAs by analyzing multiple libraries. We propose an improved pipeline for a high volume data facility by implementing mirLibSpark based on the Apache Spark framework. This pipeline is the fastest actual method, and provides an accuracy improvement compared to the standard. In this paper, we deliver the first distributed functional miRNA predictor as a standalone and fully automated package. It is an efficient and accurate miRNA predictor with functional insight. Furthermore, it compiles with the gold-standard requirement on plant miRNA predictions.</description>

      <title>Scalable HPC Job Scheduling and Resource Management in SST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient job scheduling and resource management contribute towards system throughput and efficiency maximization in high-performance computing (HPC) systems. In this paper, we introduce a scalable job scheduling and resource management component within the structural simulation toolkit (SST), a cycle-accurate and parallel discrete-event simulator. Our proposed simulator includes state-of-the-art job scheduling algorithms and resource management techniques. Additionally, it introduces workflow management components that support the simulation of task dependencies and resource allocations, crucial for workflows typical in scientific computing and data-intensive applications. We present the validation and scalability results of our job scheduling simulator. Simulation shows that our simulator achieves good accuracy in various metrics (e.g., job wait times, number of nodes usage) and also achieves good parallel performance.</description>

      <title>Semaphores Augmented with a Waiting Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semaphores are a widely used and foundational synchronization and coordination construct used for shared memory multithreaded programming. They are a keystone concept, in the sense that most other synchronization constructs can be implemented in terms of semaphores, although the converse does not generally hold. Semaphores and the quality of their implementation are of consequence as they remain heavily used in the Linux kernel and are also available for application programming via the pthreads programming interface.
  We first show that semaphores can be implemented by borrowing ideas from the classic ticket lock algorithm. The resulting "ticket-semaphore" algorithm is simple and compact (space efficient) but does not scale well because of the detrimental impact of global spinning. We then transform "ticket-semaphore" into the "TWA-semaphore" by the applying techniques derived from the "TWA - Ticket Locks Augmented with a Waiting Array" algorithm, yielding a scalable semaphore that remains compact and has extremely low latency.</description>

      <title>Update Estimation and Scheduling for Over-the-Air Federated Learning with Energy Harvesting Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) for energy harvesting devices with heterogeneous data distribution over wireless fading multiple access channel (MAC). To address the impact of low energy arrivals and data heterogeneity on global learning, we propose user scheduling strategies. Specifically, we develop two approaches: 1) entropy-based scheduling for known data distributions and 2) least-squares-based user representation estimation for scheduling with unknown data distributions at the parameter server. Both methods aim to select diverse users, mitigating bias and enhancing convergence. Numerical and analytical results demonstrate improved learning performance by reducing redundancy and conserving energy.</description>

      <title>Knowledge in multi-robot systems: an interplay of dynamics, computation and communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the hybrid systems perspective of distributed multi-robot systems is compatible with logical models of knowledge already used in distributed computing, and demonstrate its usefulness by deriving sufficient epistemic conditions for exploration and gathering robot tasks to be solvable. We provide a separation of the physical and computational aspects of a robotic system, allowing us to decouple the problems related to each and directly use methods from control theory and distributed computing, fields that are traditionally distant in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate a novel approach for reasoning about the knowledge in multi-robot systems through a principled method of converting a switched hybrid dynamical system into a temporal-epistemic logic model, passing through an abstract state machine representation. This creates space for methods and results to be exchanged across the fields of control theory, distributed computing and temporal-epistemic logic, while reasoning about multi-robot systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Resource-Efficient Compound AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compound AI Systems, integrating multiple interacting components like models, retrievers, and external tools, have emerged as essential for addressing complex AI tasks. However, current implementations suffer from inefficient resource utilization due to tight coupling between application logic and execution details, a disconnect between orchestration and resource management layers, and the perceived exclusiveness between efficiency and quality.
  We propose a vision for resource-efficient Compound AI Systems through a declarative workflow programming model and an adaptive runtime system for dynamic scheduling and resource-aware decision-making. Decoupling application logic from low-level details exposes levers for the runtime to flexibly configure the execution environment and resources, without compromising on quality. Enabling collaboration between the workflow orchestration and cluster manager enables higher efficiency through better scheduling and resource management.
  We are building a prototype system, called Murakkab, to realize this vision. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates speedups up to $\sim 3.4\times$ in workflow completion times while delivering $\sim 4.5\times$ higher energy efficiency, showing promise in optimizing resources and advancing AI system design.</description>

      <title>Memory-Efficient Community Detection on Large Graphs Using Weighted Sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection in graphs identifies groups of nodes with denser connections within the groups than between them, and while existing studies often focus on optimizing detection performance, memory constraints become critical when processing large graphs on shared-memory systems. We recently proposed efficient implementations of the Louvain, Leiden, and Label Propagation Algorithms (LPA) for community detection. However, these incur significant memory overhead from the use of collision-free per-thread hashtables. To address this, we introduce memory-efficient alternatives using weighted Misra-Gries (MG) sketches, which replace the per-thread hashtables, and reduce memory demands in Louvain, Leiden, and LPA implementations - while incurring only a minor quality drop (up to 1%) and moderate runtime penalties. We believe that these approaches, though slightly slower, are well-suited for parallel processing and could outperform current memory-intensive techniques on systems with many threads.</description>

      <title>Revisiting LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD: Improved Rates and Missing Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD are widely used methods in distributed stochastic optimization, with numerous applications in machine learning, large-scale data processing, and federated learning. However, rigorously establishing their theoretical advantages over simpler methods, such as minibatch SGD (MbSGD), has proven challenging, as existing analyses often rely on strong assumptions, unrealistic premises, or overly restrictive scenarios.
  In this work, we revisit the convergence properties of LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD under a variety of existing or weaker conditions, including gradient similarity, Hessian similarity, weak convexity, and Lipschitz continuity of the Hessian. Our analysis shows that (i) LocalSGD achieves faster convergence compared to MbSGD for weakly convex functions without requiring stronger gradient similarity assumptions; (ii) LocalSGD benefits significantly from higher-order similarity and smoothness; and (iii) SCAFFOLD demonstrates faster convergence than MbSGD for a broader class of non-quadratic functions. These theoretical insights provide a clearer understanding of the conditions under which LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD outperform MbSGD.</description>
