      <title>Integrating an ISO 30401-compliant Knowledge Management System with the processes of an Integrated Management System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the evolution of process approaches within organizations, the increasing importance of quality management systems (like ISO 9001) and the recent introduction of ISO 30401 for knowledge management, we examine how these different elements converge within the framework of an Integrated Management System. The article specifically demonstrates how an ISO30401-compliant knowledge management system can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI model through the steps of the PDCA cycle as applied in the processes of the integrated management system.</description>

      <title>SMECS: A Software Metadata Extraction and Curation Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metadata play a crucial role in adopting the FAIR principles for research software and enables findability and reusability. However, creating high-quality metadata can be resource-intensive for researchers and research software engineers. To address this challenge, we developed the Software Metadata Extraction and Curation Software (SMECS) which integrates the extraction of metadata from existing sources together with a user-friendly interface for metadata curation. SMECS extracts metadata from online repositories such as GitHub and presents it to researchers through an interactive interface for further curation and export as a CodeMeta file. The usability of SMECS was evaluated through usability experiments which confirmed that SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience. SMECS supports the FAIRification of research software by simplifying metadata creation.</description>

      <title>Integrating an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge management system with existing business processes of an organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes, sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard, introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS) entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI model through the steps of PDCA cycles.</description>

      <title>Factual Inconsistencies in Multilingual Wikipedia Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles, defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset. These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia content.</description>
