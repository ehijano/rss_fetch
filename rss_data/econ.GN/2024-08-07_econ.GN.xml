      <title>The Impossible Trinity of Human Space Usage between Home, Workplace and Amenity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an impossible trinity of human space usage between home, workplace, and amenity in this paper to explain mobility pattern changes and shifts in demand for space during COVID-19. We developed detailed time usage and location visit profiles for 60,131 people in England and Wales by analyzing about 120 million cell phone location and timestamp records from March 2020 and 2021. We found that both at-home time and amenity visits increased during COVID-19, while workplace visits decreased. Individual visits to different locations are determined by three key factors: individual preference measured by pre-pandemic location visit frequency, time constraints influenced by work-from-home, and space accessibility. We also find that WFH improves equality of individual amenity usage between people of different incomes. Low-income and middle-income people saw an 8% and 4% increase in additional amenity visits, respectively, compared to high-income people during the pandemic.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of quadratic and linear mean-variance equilibria in general semimartingale markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical topic of quadratic and linear mean-variance equilibria with both financial and real assets. The novelty of our results is that they are the first allowing for equilibrium prices driven by general semimartingales and hold in discrete as well as continuous time. For agents with quadratic utility functions, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of equilibria. We complement our analysis by providing explicit examples showing non-uniqueness or non-existence of equilibria. We then study the more difficult case of linear mean-variance preferences. We first show that under mild assumptions, a linear mean-variance equilibrium corresponds to a quadratic equilibrium (for different preference parameters). We then use this link to study a fixed-point problem that establishes existence (and uniqueness in a suitable class) of linear mean-variance equilibria. Our results rely on fine properties of dynamic mean-variance hedging in general semimartingale markets.</description>

      <title>Visibility graph analysis of the grains and oilseeds indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grains and Oilseeds Index (GOI) and its sub-indices of wheat, maize, soyabeans, rice, and barley are daily price indexes reflect the price changes of the global spot markets of staple agro-food crops. In this paper, we carry out a visibility graph (VG) analysis of the GOI and its five sub-indices. Our findings reveal that the degree distributions of the VGs, except for rice, exhibit exponentially truncated power-law tails, while the rice VG conforms to a power-law tail. The average clustering coefficients of the six VGs are quite large ($&gt;0.5$) and exhibit a nice power-law relation with respect to the average degrees of the VGs. For each VG, the clustering coefficients of nodes are inversely proportional to their degrees for large degrees and are correlated to their degrees as a power law for small degrees. All the six VGs exhibit small-world characteristics. The degree-degree correlation coefficients shows that the VGs for maize and soyabeans indices exhibit weak assortative mixing patterns, while the other four VGs are weakly disassortative. The average nearest neighbor degree functions have similar patterns, and each function shows a more complex mixing pattern which decreases for small degrees, increases for mediate degrees, and decreases again for large degrees.</description>
