      <title>Space Environment and Debris: A Review of Micro-Meteoroids and Orbital Debris Impact Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The threat posed by MMOD to spacecraft has escalated with the growing density of orbital objects, driven by the proliferation of satellite constellations such as Starlink and OneWeb. This paper reviews the current challenges and advancements in MMOD impact protection, emphasizing innovations in shielding technologies. The synthesis of recent developments highlights the role of hybrid materials, additive manufacturing, and international collaboration in ensuring spacecraft resilience while promoting orbital sustainability.</description>

      <title>Energy Cascade and Damping in Fast-Mode Compressible Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents hybrid and fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of fast-mode compressible turbulence. Turbulence damping at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales closely follows linear transit-time damping theory. Despite strong phase steepening, turbulence sustains robust cross-scale energy cascading. These findings resolve the long-standing question about the validity of classical wave theories in strongly nonlinear regimes and overturn the common presumption that wave steepening disrupts compressible turbulence cascade, thereby providing a more complete picture of MHD turbulence.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler Divergence as a Measure of Irreversible Information Loss Near Black Hole Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework that integrates information theory, thermodynamics, and general relativity to analyze the fundamental limit of decoding time-encoded signals in curved spacetime. In particular, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) as a quantitative measure of the mismatch between the transmitted and received symbol distributions induced by gravitational time dilation. Using a minimal communication model, we derive the critical radius at which information decoding becomes thermodynamically impossible due to the divergence of the KLD. We show that this radius approaches the Schwarzschild horizon in the limit where the information entropy cost becomes negligible relative to the transmission energy. This result provides a novel information-theoretic interpretation of the event horizon as a boundary of irreversible information loss governed by universal thermodynamic principles. Our framework offers new insights into the entropic and energetic constraints on communication in strong gravitational fields and may extend to general relativistic and quantum information settings.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the collisionless tearing mode by flow shear: implications for reconnection onset in the Alfv\'enic solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the collisionless tearing mode instability of a current sheet with a strong shear flow across the layer. The growth rate decreases with increasing shear flow, and is completely stabilized as the shear flow becomes Alfv\'enic. We also show that in the presence of strong flow shear, the tearing mode growth rate decreases with increasing background ion-to-electron temperature ratio, the opposite behaviour to the tearing mode without flow shear. We find that even a relatively small flow shear is enough to dramatically alter the scaling behaviour of the mode, because the growth rate is small compared to the shear flow across the ion scales (but large compared to shear flow across the electron scales). Our results may explain the relative absence of reconnection events in the near-Sun Alfv\'enic solar wind observed recently by NASA's Parker Solar Probe.</description>

      <title>Development of Space Qualified Signal Processing Readout Electronics for HabWorlds and Origins Space Telescope Detector and Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) -- a flagship ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope recommended by the National Academies' Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics -- will require detector technologies capable of supporting significantly larger pixel-count arrays than previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), naturally suited to microwave multiplexing readout, are already in use across several balloon-borne missions with FPGA based systems. To transition this capability to space, we are developing a radiation-hardened detector readout system that builds directly on the technical and environmental requirements defined by the PRIMA mission. PRIMA serves as a critical pathfinder, informing the radiation tolerance, resource constraints, and on-board processing capabilities needed for HWO. In this work, we present our current results on algorithm implementation, hardware architecture, and firmware development using the radiation-hardened AMD Kintex Ultrascale FPGA, aligning with PRIMA's stringent specifications to ensure compatibility with future space-based observatories like HWO.</description>
