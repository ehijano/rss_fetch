      <title>Integral representation of translation-invariant operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suppose that $G$ is a locally compact abelian group, $Y$ is a measure space, and $H$ is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space on $G\times Y$ such that $H$ is naturally embedded into $L^2(G\times Y)$ and it is invariant under the translations associated with $G$. We consider the von Neumann algebra of all bounded linear operators acting on $H$ that commute with these translations. Assuming that this algebra is commutative, we represent its elements as integral operators and characterize the corresponding integral kernels. Furthermore, we give W*-algebra structure on the functions associated with the integral kernels. We apply this general scheme to a series of examples, including rotation- or translation-invariant operators in Bergman or Fock spaces.</description>

      <title>Fibrewise compactifications and generalised limits in commutative and noncommutative topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce fibrewise compactifications in both the setting of locally compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps, and the parallel setting of $C^*$-algebras and nondegenerate multiplier-valued $*$-homomorphisms. In both situations, we use fibrewise compactifications to define regulated limits. In the topological setting, regulated limits extend classical inverse limits so that the resulting limit space remains locally compact; examples include the path spaces of directed graphs. In the operator-algebraic setting, regulated limits realise a direct-limit construction for multiplier-valued $*$-homomorphisms; examples include the cores of relative Cuntz-Pimsner algebras.</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter type operators on trusses and derived structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce and study the concepts of the Rota-Baxter operator and Reynolds operator within the framework of trusses. Moreover, we introduce and discuss dendriform trusses, tridendriform trusses, and NS-trusses as fundamental algebraic structures underlying these classes of operators. Furthermore, we consider the notions of Nijenhuis operator and averaging operator to trusses, exploring their properties and applications to uncover new algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Siegel disc as symplectic and Kaehler quotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the restricted infinite-dimensional Siegel disc as a Marsden-Weinstein symplectic reduced space and as Kaehler quotient of a weak Kaehler manifold. The obtained symplectic form is invariant with respect to the left action of the infinite-dimensional restricted symplectic group and coincides with the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau symplectic form of the restricted Siegel disc obtained via the identification with an affine coadjoint orbit of the restricted symplectic group, or equivalently with a coadjoint orbit of the universal central extension of the restricted symplectic group.</description>

      <title>The linking von Neumann algebras of W*-TROs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10154v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we show that a von Neumann algebra can be written as the linking von Neumann algebra of a W*-TRO if and only if it contains no abelian direct summand. We also provide some new characterizations of nuclear TROs and $W^\ast$-exact TROs in terms of the properties of their linking algebras.</description>

      <title>Multiplier modules of Hilbert C*-modules revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of multiplier modules of Hilbert C*-modules is reconsidered to obtain more properties of these special Hilbert C*-modules. The property of a Hilbert C*-module to be a multiplier C*-module is shown to be an invariant with respect to the consideration as a left or right Hilbert C*-module in the sense of a C*-correspondence in strong Morita equivalence theory. The interrelation of the C*-algebras of ''compact'' operators, the Banach algebras of bounded module operators and the Banach spaces of bounded module operators of a Hilbert C*-module to its C*-dual Banach C*-module are characterized for pairs of Hilbert C*-modules and their respective multiplier modules. The structures on the latter are always isometrically embedded into the respective structures on the former. Examples for which continuation of these kinds of bounded module operators from the initial Hilbert C*-module to its multiplier module fails are given, however existing continuations turn out to be always unique. Similarly, bounded modular functionals from both kinds of Hilbert C*-modules to their respective C*-algebras of coefficients are compared, and eventually existing continuations are shown to be unique.</description>

      <title>Delocalized eta invariants of the signature operator on G-proper manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected, linear real reductive group and let $X$ be a cocompact $G$-proper manifold without boundary. We define delocalized eta invariants associated to a $L^2$-invertible perturbed Dirac operator $D_X+A$ with $A$ a suitable smoothing perturbation. We also investigate the case in which $D_X$ is not invertible but $0$ is isolated in the $L^2$-spectrum of $D_X$. We prove index formulas relating these delocalized eta invariants to Atiyah-Patodi-Singer delocalized indices on $G$-proper manifolds with boundary. In order to achieve this program we give a detailed account of both the large and small time behaviour of the heat-kernel of perturbed Dirac operators, as a map from the positive real line to the algebra of Lafforgue integral operators. We apply these results to the definition of rho-numbers associated to $G$-homotopy equivalences between closed $G$-proper manifolds and to the study of their bordism properties. We also define delocalized signatures of manifolds with boundary satisfying an invertibility assumption on the differential form Laplacian of the boundary in middle degree and prove an Atiyah-Patodi-Singer formula for these delocalized signatures.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines Frobenius subalgebra posets within abelian monoidal categories, demonstrating that under certain general conditions--satisfied in all semisimple tensor categories--these posets are lattices. Building on this, we extend Watatani's finiteness theorem for intermediate subfactors by proving that, under a weak positivity assumption--met by all semisimple tensor categories over the complex field--and a compatibility condition--fulfilled by all pivotal ones--the lattices arising from connected Frobenius algebras are finite. We also derive a non-semisimple version via semisimplification. Our approach relies on the concept of a formal angle, and the extension of key results--such as the planar algebraic exchange relation and Landau's theorems--to linear monoidal categories.
  Major applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{M}$-ideals: from Banach spaces to rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a class of ring ideals, termed ring $\mathrm{M}$-ideals, inspired by the Alfsen--Effros theory of $\mathrm{M}$-ideals in Banach spaces. We show that $\mathrm{M}$-ideals extend the classical notion of essential ideals and subsume them as a subclass. The central theorem provides a full characterization: an ideal is an $\mathrm{M}$-ideal if and only if it is either essential or relatively irreducible. This dichotomy reveals the abundant and diverse nature of $\mathrm{M}$-ideals, encompassing both essential and minimal ideals, and admits natural generalizations in rings beyond the commutative and unital settings.
  We systematically study the algebraic stability of $\mathrm{M}$-ideals under standard constructions such as intersection, quotient, direct product, and Morita equivalence and establish their behavior in topological rings and operator algebras. In certain rings such as $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and C*-algebras, we completely classify $\mathrm{M}$-ideals and relate them to algebraically minimal projections and central idempotents. The ring $\mathrm{M}$-ideals in $C(K)$ are shown to be precisely the essential ideals or those minimal ideals corresponding to isolated points.
  Structurally, we show that the absence of proper $\mathrm{M}$-ideals characterizes simplicity, while rings in which every proper $\mathrm{M}$-ideal is a direct summand must decompose as finite direct sums of simple rings. In closing, we introduce the notion of $\mathrm{M}$-complements, drawing an analogy with essential extensions in module theory, and demonstrate their existence.</description>
