      <title>Three-loop jet function for boosted heavy quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the inclusive jet function for boosted heavy quarks to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. The jet function is defined and calculated in the framework of boosted Heavy-Quark Effective Theory (bHQET). It describes the effect of radiation collimated in narrow jets arising from energetic heavy quarks on observables probing the jet invariant mass $M$ in the region where $M^2 - m^2 \ll m^2$, with $m$ the heavy quark mass. This kinematic situation is relevant e.g. in boosted top (pair) production at high-energy colliders. We have verified that our result satisfies non-Abelian exponentiation and checked that our calculation reproduces the known cusp and non-cusp anomalous dimensions of the jet function to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. We also confirmed that the $n_\ell^2\alpha_s^3$ contribution, where $n_\ell$ is the number of massless quark flavors, agrees with the prediction from renormalon calculus. Our computation provides the last missing piece to obtain the N$^3$LL$^\prime$ resummed (self-normalized) thrust distribution used for the calibration of the top quark mass parameter in parton-shower Monte Carlo generators. Our result also contributes to the invariant mass distribution of reconstructed top quarks at N$^3$LL$^\prime$, which can be employed for a precise top mass determination at future lepton colliders. As a by-product, we obtain the relation between the pole and short-distance jet-mass schemes at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. Finally, we estimate the non-logarithmic contribution to the four-loop jet function based on renormalon dominance.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes (as Dark Matter) from the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in detail the production of primordial black holes (PBHs), as well as their mass and initial spin, due to the phase transitions corresponding to radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) and featuring a large supercooling. The latter property allows us to use a model-independent approach. In this context, we demonstrate that the decay rate of the false vacuum grows exponentially with time to a high degree of accuracy, justifying a time dependence commonly assumed in the literature. Our study provides ready-to-use results for determining the abundance, mass and initial spin of PBHs generated in a generic RSB model with large supercooling. We find that PBHs are generically produced in a broad region of the model-independent parameter space. Notably, we identify the subregion that may explain recently observed microlensing anomalies. Additionally, we show that a simple Standard-Model extension, with right-handed neutrinos and gauged $B-L$ featuring RSB, may explain an anomaly of this sort in a region of its parameter space.</description>

      <title>Do we owe our existence to a Gravitational Anomaly?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review a mechanism for a potential explanation of the dominance of matter over antimatter in the Universe (``our existence''), based on a (3+1)-dimensional string-inspired cosmological model, characterised by (uncancelled) gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) anomalies in the premordial epochs. The model is consistent with general covariance but entails spontaneous Lorentz (LV) and CPT Violation (CPTV), due to appropriate backgrounds of axion fields, which couple to the anomaly terms. Upon condensation of the gCS terms, due to primordial gravitational waves, these axions acquire a linear potential, which drives inflation of a Running-Vacuum-Model (RVM) type, while the effective action is also characterised by imaginary parts as well, which imply metastability of this RVM inflation. The axion backgrounds remain undiluted until the exit from inflation, and are responsible for yielding unconventional LV and CPTV Leptogenesis, which is then communicated to the baryon sector (Baryogenesis) via sphaleron processes. The model provides a phenomenologically consistent cosmological evolution from inflation till the modern era.</description>

      <title>A first computation of three-loop master integrals for the production of two off-shell vector bosons with different masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytic results on physical kinematics for four integral families that are relevant to the production of two off-shell vector bosons with different masses. Our study consists of a ladder-box, a tennis-court, and two reducible ladder-box-like families. The results for the master integrals of these families are expressed up to order six in the dimensional regulator in terms of real-valued multiple polylogarithms. Furthermore, a semi-numeric solution is provided, employing generalized power series expansions using the package DiffExp.</description>

      <title>Product Manifold Machine Learning for Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical data are representations of the fundamental laws governing the Universe, hiding complex compositional structures often well captured by hierarchical graphs. Hyperbolic spaces are endowed with a non-Euclidean geometry that naturally embeds those structures. To leverage the benefits of non-Euclidean geometries in representing natural data we develop machine learning on $\mathcal P \mathcal M$ spaces, Cartesian products of constant curvature Riemannian manifolds. As a use case we consider the classification of "jets", sprays of hadrons and other subatomic particles produced by the hadronization of quarks and gluons in collider experiments. We compare the performance of $\mathcal P \mathcal M$-MLP and $\mathcal P \mathcal M$-Transformer models across several possible representations. Our experiments show that $\mathcal P \mathcal M$ representations generally perform equal or better to fully Euclidean models of similar size, with the most significant gains found for highly hierarchical jets and small models. We discover significant correlation between the degree of hierarchical structure at a per-jet level and classification performance with the $\mathcal P \mathcal M$-Transformer in top tagging benchmarks. This is a promising result highlighting a potential direction for further improving machine learning model performance through tailoring geometric representation at a per-sample level in hierarchical datasets. These results reinforce the view of geometric representation as a key parameter in maximizing both performance and efficiency of machine learning on natural data.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Neutrino Flavor State Transition Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically determine neutrino transitional probabilities and abundance ratios at various distances from the source of creation in several astrophysical contexts, including the Sun, supernovae and cosmic rays. In doing so, we determine the probability of a higher-order transition state from $\nu_\tau\rightarrow\nu_\lambda$, where $\nu_\lambda$ represents a more massive generation than Standard Model neutrinos. We first calculate an approximate cross section for high-energy neutrinos which allows us to formulate comparisons for the oscillation distances of solar, supernova and higher-energy cosmic ray neutrinos. The flavor distributions of the resulting neutrino populations from each source detected at Earth are then compared via fractional density charts.</description>

      <title>Single production of the singlet vector-like leptons at the ILC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector-like leptons (VLLs) as one kind of interesting new particles can produce rich phenomenology at low- and high-energy experiments. In the framework of the singlet VLS model, we investigate the discovery potential of VLL via its single production at the International Linear Collider (ILC) with the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s} =$ 1 TeV and the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}$ = 1 ab$^{-1}$, taking into account the appropriate polarization. For the signal and SM background analysis, we have considered two kinds of decay channels for the W boson, i.e. pure leptonic and fully hadronic decay channels. Our analytic results show that the parameter space $M_{F}\in$ [300, 675] GeV and $\kappa \in$ [0.0294, 0.1] might be detected by the proposed ILC for pure leptonic decay channel. For fully hadronic decay channel, larger detection region of the parameter space are derived as $M_{F}\in$ [300, 700] GeV and $\kappa \in$ [0.0264, 0.0941].</description>

      <title>Truncation orders, external constraints, and the determination of $|V_{cb}|$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model selection framework for the extraction of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$ from exclusive $B \to D^* l \nu$ decays. By framing the truncation of the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) parameterization as a model selection task, we apply the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to choose the optimal truncation order. We demonstrate the performance of our approach through a comprehensive toy study, comparing it to the Nested Hypothesis Test (NHT) method used in previous analyses. Our results show that the AIC-based approach produces unbiased estimates of $|V_{cb}|$, albeit with some issues of undercoverage. We further investigate the impact of unitarity constraints and explore model averaging using the Global AIC (gAIC) approach, which produced unbiased results with correct coverage properties. Our findings suggest that model selection techniques based on information criteria and model averaging offer a promising path towards more reliable $|V_{cb}|$ determinations.</description>

      <title>Scale Separation, Strong Coupling UV Phases, and the Identification of the Edge of the Conformal Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a simple holographic model to discuss approaching the edge of the conformal window in strongly coupled gauge theories to draw lessons for lattice studies. Walking gauge theories have a gap between the scale where they enter the strong coupling regime and the scale of chiral symmetry breaking. We highlight that there can also be a gap between the scale where the critical value of the quark anti-quark operator's anomalous dimension is passed and the scale of the condensate. This potentially makes identifying the edge of the conformal window in a lattice simulation with UV bare coupling below the fixed point value on a finite lattice difficult. A resolution is to study the theory with a coupling above the fixed point value at the UV cut off. Here we show that an ``artefact" phase with chiral symmetry breaking triggered at the UV cut off exists and lies arbitrarily close to the fixed point at the edge of the conformal window. We quantify the chance of a misidentification of a chiral symmetry breaking theory as IR conformal. We also quantify where the artefact phase lies, tuned to the fixed point value. We use the latest lattice results for SU(3) gauge theory with ten quark flavours in [Hasenfratz:2023wbr] as a test case; we conclude their identification that the theory is in the conformal window is reliable.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the FCNC couplings between the top quark and the photon in $\gamma\gamma$ and $\gamma^{*}\gamma^{*}$ collisions at the CLIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of flavour-changing neutral current transitions(FCNC) involving the top quark are only possible with new theoretical frameworks that extend the Standard Model(SM), given that these transitions are almost entirely suppressed within the SM. In this regard, examining these transitions with extended theories beyond the SM may provide significant insights into future experiments. To this end, we present a phenomological study about the anomalous FCNC transitions via $tq\gamma$ couplings with effective field theory. Here, ${\gamma \gamma}{\rightarrow} {\textit{l}} {\nu}_\textit{l} b \bar{q} $ , ${e^{+}} {e^{-}} {\rightarrow} {e^{+}} {\gamma}^{} {\gamma}^{} {\rightarrow} {e^{+}} \textit{l}{} {\nu_\textit{ l}} b \bar{q} {e^{-}} $, $\gamma \gamma {\rightarrow} j \bar{j} b \bar{q} $ and ${e^{+}} {e ^{-}} {\rightarrow} {e^{+}} {\gamma}^{} {\gamma}^{} {e^{-}} {\rightarrow}{e^{+}} j \bar{j} b \bar{q} {e^{-}} $ processes are investigated for the CLIC at $\sqrt{s} =1.5$TeV and 3 TeV. Thus, we have calculated the constraints at $95{\%}$ confidence level on the $BR(t\rightarrow q\gamma)$. As a result, the obtained constraints are at least one order of magnitude better than the available experimental ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complication in the treatment of any strongly charged particle is the SU(3) color structure. For the standard model quarks antiquarks and gluons there are various well-known strategies for dealing with the color structure, including orthogonal multiplet bases. For exotic representations, beyond triplets, antitriplets and octets, non-orthogonal bases have been systematically worked out only recently. In this letter we demonstrate how to construct orthogonal multiplet bases also for processes including exotic representations.</description>

      <title>Toward a Direct Measurement of Partial Restoration of Chiral Symmetry at J-PARC E16 via Density-induced Chiral Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degeneracy of chiral partners is an ideal signal for measuring the restoration of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. In this work, we investigate the observability of the $\phi$ - $f_1(1420)$ degeneracy in the J-PARC E16 experiment, which measures di-electrons emitted from 30 GeV pA collisions. We for this purpose make use of an effective Lagrangian approach, which naturally incorporates the broken charge-conjugation symmetry in nuclear matter and the ensuing anomaly-induced mixing between vector and axial-vector mesons, to compute the spectral function relevant for the experimental measurement. The real-time dynamics of the pA collision is obtained from a transport simulation. Including experimental background and resolution effects on top of that, we find that a signal of the $\phi$ - $f_1(1420)$ mixing can be observed around 2.5 $\sigma$ with the Run2 statistics planned for the J-PARC E16 experiment with an ideal mixing strength.</description>

      <title>Confronting the broken phase N2HDM with Higgs Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The broken phase of the Next-to two-Higgs-doublet model (N2HDM) constitutes an archetype of extended Higgs sectors. In the presence of a softly-broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry throughout the scalar and Yukawa sectors, as the additional gauge singlet field does not interact with fermions, the model admits four variants of Yukawa interactions between the doublets and Standard Model fermions. We confront each type with experimental Higgs Data, especially from CMS and ATLAS detectors at the LHC. Interfacing the models with the state-of-the-art package $\mathtt{HiggsTools}$, we perform a statistical $\chi^2$ analysis to determine the best-fit points and exclusion limits at the $95\%$ and $68\%$ C.L., and identify SM-like Higgs measurements that affect each type the most. We further analyze the exclusion bounds on the additional Higgs bosons at the $95\%$ C.L., paying special attention to searches of hypothetical non-SM Higgs resonances decaying into a pair of bosons or fermions. We show regions where the additional Higgs bosons do not satisfy the narrow-width approximation utilized in most experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Implementation and investigation of electron-nucleus scattering in NEUT neutrino event generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding nuclear effects is essential for improving the sensitivity of neutrino oscillation measurements. Validating nuclear models solely through neutrino scattering data is challenging due to limited statistics and the broad energy spectrum of neutrinos. In contrast, electron scattering experiments provide abundant high-precision data with various monochromatic energies and angles. Since both neutrinos and electrons interact via electroweak interactions, the same nuclear models can be applied to simulate both interactions. Thus, high-precision electron scattering data is essential for validating the nuclear models used in neutrino experiments. To enable this, the author has newly implemented electron scattering in the \texttt{NEUT} neutrino event generator, covering two interaction modes: quasielastic (QE) and single pion production. \texttt{NEUT} predictions of QE agree well with numerical calculations, supporting the validity of this implementation. From comparisons with \texttt{NEUT} predictions and inclusive electron scattering data, the momentum-dependent binding energy correction is derived, corresponding to effects beyond the plane wave impulse approximation. The impact of this correction on neutrino interactions is also evaluated. Significant differences in charged lepton kinematics are observed, with approximately 20\,MeV of peak shift in the reconstructed neutrino energy distribution, which is important for accurately measuring neutrino oscillation parameters. It is expected to serve as a foundation for future discussions on electron scattering using \texttt{NEUT}.</description>

      <title>The magic of top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing collaboration between the fields of quantum computing and high energy physics, including using LHC processes such as top (anti-)quark pair production to perform high energy tests of quantum entanglement. In this proceeding, I will review another interesting property from quantum computing ("magic"), that is needed to make quantum computers with genuine computational advantage over their classical counterparts. How to make and enhance magic in general quantum systems is an open question, such that new insights are always useful. To this end, I will show that the LHC naturally produces magic top quarks, providing a novel playground for further study in this area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent experimental and theoretical results for the electromagnetic form factors of hyperons (Y) in the timelike region, accessible in the reactions $e^+e^-\to \bar YY$. Specifically, we focus on the final states $\bar \Lambda\Lambda$, $\bar\Lambda\Sigma^0$/$\bar \Sigma^0\Lambda$, $\bar \Sigma\Sigma$, $\bar \Xi\Xi$, and $\bar\Omega\Omega$. The $\bar \Lambda_c\Lambda_c$ system is also discussed.</description>

      <title>On the quantum numbers of the $X(1880)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of the $X(1880)$, the structure around the $\bar{p}p$ threshold that appears in the $3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ invariant mass spectrum in the decay process of $J/\psi \to \gamma 3(\pi^+\pi^-)$. Nucleon-antinucleon rescattering is taken into account in our analysis, and the decay amplitude of $J/\psi \to \gamma 3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ can be obtained by the distorted wave Born approximation. With these amplitudes, we analyze the contributions to the $X(1880)$ from different partial waves. Our analysis suggests that the $X(1880)$ should be isoscalar $0^{-+}$, and it is generated by the threshold behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of a novel approach to the QCD Light-Cone Sum Rule method, employing $B$-meson Light-Cone Distribution Amplitudes. This method circumvents the semi-global quark-hadron duality (QHD) approximation, which can introduce an unknown and potentially significant systematic error in form factor predictions. Instead, our approach is more dependent on higher-order contributions in perturbation theory and higher-twist contributions. Unlike the systematic errors from semi-global QHD, truncation errors can be evaluated and systematically improved, allowing for robust form factor predictions.</description>

      <title>Natural solution of SUSY $\mu$ problem from modulus stabilization in modular flavor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to solve the SUSY $\mu$-problem in the framework of modular flavor symmetry. The bare $\mu$-term is forbidden by modular symmetry and the effective $\mu$-term is re-generated after the modulus field is stabilized. We discuss the stabilization mechanism of a single modulus field with the presence of SUSY breaking contributions described in the non-linear realized SUSY scheme with nilpotent goldstino $X_{nl}$ superfield. The presence of $X_{nl}$ contributions can possibly slightly change the original stabilized modulus VEV to a value located in the vicinity of some fixed points. Natural value of $\mu_{eff}$, which is much smaller than the SUSY scale, can either be the consequence of expansion of typical modular forms in terms of the tiny deviation parameter (away from the fixed point $\omega$), or be the joint consequence of suppression from both powers of $q$ [or $(2\Im\tau)^{-1}$] and the asymptotic suppression behavior of typical modular forms away from the fixed point $i\infty$.</description>

      <title>An EWPD SMEFT likelihood for the LHC -- and how to improve it with measurements of W and Z boson properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a computer code for analyzing electroweak precision data (EWPD) in the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), highlights the importance of recent ATLAS and CMS precision measurements, and introduces a novel analysis of the forward-backward asymmetry at the LHC. The computer code provides the likelihood of SMEFT Wilson coefficients based on precision measurements of $W$ and $Z$ pole observables, interpolation formulas for Standard Model predictions, and modular SMEFT parametrizations. SMEFT predictions including next-to-leading-order (NLO) effects in perturbative and SMEFT expansion are available and five alternative electroweak input parameter schemes are supported. The likelihood addresses shortcomings of previous formulations in the treatment of parametric uncertainties and can be straightforwardly included in SMEFT fits of LHC data. The input parameter scheme dependence and role of NLO corrections is studied for the EWPD fit in the SMEFT. Furthermore, the impact of recent ATLAS and CMS measurements - of the $W$ boson mass and width, of the lepton flavour universality (LFU) of $W$ branching fractions, and the effective leptonic weak mixing angle - is analyzed. A test of LFU that surpasses the precision other tests is proposed based on the weak mixing angle measurement. Finally, an ATLAS Drell-Yan triple-differential cross-section measurement is reinterpreted in the SMEFT and combined with the EWPD likelihood. This analysis demonstrates the feasibility of the LFU precision test, improves constraints on muon couplings with respect to the world average, and determines a combination of the quark-coupling asymmetry parameters $A_u$ and $A_d$ with a precision close to the heavy flavour parameters $A_c$ and $A_b$.</description>

      <title>In Search of an Invisible $Z^\prime$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider extending the Standard Model by an anomaly-free and possibly flavour non-universal $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, whose breaking gives a $Z^\prime$ boson that does not affect electroweak precision observables at tree-level or at 1-loop. Provided it does not also couple to electrons, such a $Z^\prime$ boson would be largely invisible to an electroweak precision machine like FCC-ee or CEPC. We show that, while this class of $Z^\prime$ models can also evade tests of quark flavour violation, the constraint of anomaly-cancellation implies that valence quarks, muons, and taus are all charged under $U(1)_X$, with the up quark charge being necessarily large. The conclusion holds even if one augments the SM by three right-handed neutrinos to try and absorb anomalies. This means such $Z^\prime$ bosons cannot simultaneously hide below the TeV scale from $pp \to \ell\ell$ Drell--Yan measurements at the LHC and, even if we entertain esoteric models in which the lepton charges are numerically very small, we cannot escape dijet searches at the LHC. For equitable quark and lepton charges, $pp\to\ell\ell$ already excludes such a $Z^\prime$ up to $M/g \gtrsim$ 10 TeV, with a reach of 20 TeV expected by the end of the High-Luminosity LHC. The dijet bounds currently sit around 5 TeV, while sensitivity up to 10 TeV could be achieved at HL-LHC. We thus find an excellent complementarity between FCC-ee and HL-LHC in covering all anomaly-free $Z^\prime$ bosons up to several TeV.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Aspects of Models with Low Scale Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various phenomenological consequences of seesaw theories for the generation of the fermion mass hierarchy of the Standard Model have been analyzed, with an emphasis on models in which the light-active neutrino masses are derived from low-scale seesaw mechanisms. In particular, fermion masses and lepton flavor-violating decay processes, the flavor-changing neutral current, have been studied, and the implications of these theories for the observed dark matter relic density in the Universe have been determined. From the analysis of these phenomenological aspects, it was possible to determine the allowed parameter spaces of these theories and to obtain a parameter fit consistent with the currently measured experimental values. In this way, correlations between the different observables of the fermionic sector could be obtained, where all values were within the experimental ranges at $3\sigma$. Predictions for new physics consistent with cosmological limits were also obtained.</description>

      <title>New calculation of the geo-neutrino energy spectrum and its implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos plays a vital role in the experimental measurement of geo-neutrinos that have profound implications for both particle physics and earth sciences. In this letter, we present a state-of-the-art calculation of the energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos originating from the beta decay of Uranium-238 and Thorium-232. Our calculation is underpinned by the latest updates in the nuclear database, accounts for previously overlooked forbidden transitions, and incorporates advanced corrections for the beta decay. This brand new geo-neutrino flux model, compared to the widely-used estimates from Enomoto~\cite{Enomoto}, reveals notable distinction in the energy spectrum shape because of our comprehensive approach. When considering the inverse beta decay (IBD) detection process, our findings show a significant deviation in the predicted IBD yield of around 4\% for Uranium-238 and 9\% for Thorium-232 decay chains. The implications of using the new geo-neutrino flux model for the experimental analysis are substantial, potentially affecting the analysis results of geo-neutrino measurements of KamLAND and Borexino by around 10\% to 20\%.</description>

      <title>Probing nonperturbative transverse momentum dependent PDFs with chiral perturbation theory: the $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use chiral perturbation theory to study the long distance regime of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMD PDFs). Chiral corrections to the TMD PDFs are computed from proton to pion/baryon splittings. For consistent power counting, we find that the fraction of the proton's momentum that a pion may carry must be kept small. We make predictions for a $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ asymmetry in the proton's TMD PDFs and find that the effective theory gives a natural exponential suppression of the TMD PDF at long distances. We then explore the effects that additional nonperturbative physics may have on the TMD $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Isgur-Wise functions for $\boldsymbol{\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c\left({1 \over 2}^\pm \right)}$ transitions in the Bakamjian-Thomas Relativistic Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transitions ${\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c\left({1 \over 2}^\pm \right)}$ in the Bakamjian-Thomas (BT) relativistic quark model formalism, which describes hadrons with a fixed number of constituents. In the heavy quark limit, the BT model yields covariant form factors and Isgur-Wise (IW) scaling, regardless of the spectroscopic model used to describe the bound states. It has been extensively applied to heavy mesons where subtle properties of the IW limit of QCD, including the Bjorken-Uraltsev sum rules, have been shown to be satisfied. The present paper, where the BT construction is applied to baryons, is unavoidably technical because one is dealing with a three-body problem. The complications originate from the natural choice of the Jacobi coordinates ${\vec \rho}$ (relative space coordinate between the two light spectator quarks) and ${\vec \lambda}$ (relative space coordinate between the center-of-mass of the two light quarks and the heavy quark). The corresponding orbital angular momenta are denoted by ${\vec \ell}_\rho$ and ${\vec \ell}_\lambda$, with ${\vec \ell}_\rho + {\vec \ell}_\lambda = {\vec L}$. For the transitions $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c\left({1 \over 2}^\pm\right)$, i.e. $L = 0 \to L = 0$ or $L = 0 \to L = 1$, one can see that the moduli $\ell_\rho$ and $\ell_\lambda$ can take an infinite number of values. For $L = 0 \to L = 0$ one has the constraint $\ell_\lambda = \ell_\rho$ and for $L = 0 \to L = 1$ the constraint is $\ell_\lambda = \ell_\rho \pm 1$. We compute explicitly the IW function $\xi_\Lambda (w)$ in the elastic case $\Lambda_b \left({1 \over 2}^+ \right) \to \Lambda_c \left({1 \over 2}^+ \right)$ and the much more involved IW function $\sigma_\Lambda (w)$ in the inelastic case $\Lambda_b \left({1 \over 2}^+ \right) \to \Lambda_c \left({1 \over 2}^- \right)$. These functions exhibit the expected properties of covariance and IW scaling.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic dark energy from the perspective of multi-messenger gravitational wave astronomy: future joint observations with short gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors opens new opportunities for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star merger events, holding significant potential for probing the history of cosmic expansion. In this paper, we investigate the holographic dark energy (HDE) model by using the future GW standard siren data observed from the 3G GW detectors and the short $\gamma$-ray burst THESEUS-like detector joint observations. We find that GW data alone can achieve a relatively precise estimation of the Hubble constant, with precision of $0.2\%$-$0.6\%$, but its ability to constrain other cosmological parameters remains limited. Nonetheless, since the GW data can break parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB + BAO + SN (CBS), GW standard sirens play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of parameter estimation. With the addition of GW data to CBS, the constraints on cosmological parameters $H_0$, $c$ and $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ can be improved by $63\%$-$88\%$, $27\%$-$44\%$ and $55\%$-$70\%$. In summary, observations of GW standard sirens from 3G GW detectors could be pivotal in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Dark Astronomy with Dark Matter Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way of probing non-gravitational dark matter interactions: dark astronomy, which leverages the dark radiation emitted by dissipative dark sectors. If the mediator of the dark matter self interactions is a dark photon with a small mass that kinetically mixes with the visible photon, the dark radiation flux becomes accessible to underground experiments. We argue that the emission may be dominantly longitudinally polarized, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of direct detection experiments such as XENON and SENSEI to this signal. We introduce a new detection mechanism based on resonant dark-photon-to-photon conversion at the surface of conducting materials, which offers unique directional sensitivity to dark radiation. This mechanism facilitates the development of experiments that combine dark matter detection techniques with methods of traditional astronomy, opening the possibility to map dark radiation sources within our galaxy.</description>

      <title>Exploring the circumstellar environment of Tycho's supernova remnant. II. Impact on the broadband non-thermal emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the environment around Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) has long been believed to be close to homogeneous, the latest analysis of Chandra data has identified a substantial deceleration of the forward shock which poses a major challenges to this picture. arXiv:2310.14841 showed that the existence of dense molecular cloud (MC) surrounding a rarefied wind-like circumstellar matter (CSM) can explain this observational finding in term of the shock-expansion dynamics, supporting the so-called single-degenerate scenario for the progenitor system. We here extend this work to study the non-thermal emission processes and investigate whether such an environment is consistent with the observed multi-wavelength spectrum. While the simulated broadband spectrum based on the wind-MC environment is largely consistent with observations, we find that such an environment predicts a harder gamma-ray spectrum than observed due to the relatively low CSM density in the cavity interior of the MC. This difference can be at least partially attributed to the present one-dimensional setup of the model which does not account for the clumpy and multi-dimensional structure of the CSM. Our model provides predictions for the long-term evolution of the broadband spectrum which can be used to further probe Tycho's surrounding environment in the future, a key to resolving the long-standing issue of type Ia supernova progenitor channels.</description>

      <title>Investigation of $\pi N$ contributions to nucleon matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an improved method to extract nucleon matrix elements from lattice 3-point functions using a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) with nucleon and pion-nucleon interpolating fields. Our method avoids the computation of the costly three-point functions that have pion-nucleon interpolators at both source and sink. We demonstrate that excited state contamination from $N\pi$ is minimized in nucleon matrix elements of the scalar, vector, pseudoscalar, axial, and tensor currents and discuss our results based on a physical-point ensemble with a pion mass value of 131 MeV. We find that the GEVP is most significant for the isovector pseudoscalar and axial currents.</description>

      <title>Kick it like DESI: PNGB quintessence with a dynamically generated initial velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the hint for time-dependent dynamical dark energy from an analysis of the DESI Baryon Accoustic Oscillation (BAO) data together with information from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Supernovae (SN), we relax the assumption of a vanishing initial velocity for a quintessence field. In particular we focus on pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson (PNGB) quintessence in the form of an axion like particle, that can arise as the phase of a complex scalar and could possess derivative couplings to fermions or topological couplings to abelian gauge fields, without upsetting the necessary flatness of its potential. We discuss mechanisms from the aforementioned interactions for sourcing an initial axion field velocity $\dot{\theta_i}$ at redshifts $3\leq z\leq 10$, that will "kick" it into motion. Driven by this initial velocity the axion will first roll up in its potential, similar to "freezing" dark energy. After it has reached the pinnacle of its trajectory, it will start to roll down, and behave as "thawing" quintessence. As a proof of concept we undertake a combined fit to BAO, SN and CMB data at the background level. We find that a scenario with $\dot{\theta_i}=\mathcal{O}(1) \; m_a$, where $m_a$ is the axion mass, is slightly preferred over both $\Lambda$CDM and the conventional "thawing" quintessence with $\dot{\theta_i}=0$. The best fit points for this case exhibit transplanckian decay constants and very flat potentials, which both are in tension with conjectures from string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain walls represent two-dimensional topological defects that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries in various new physics models. In this study, we undertake the first calculation of gravitational waves produced by scalar perturbations generated from the domain wall network. Our findings indicate that the gravitational wave spectrum is notably distinct from that of other sources. This opens up a promising avenue for future gravitational wave experiments aimed at exploring the role of domain walls in the early Universe. Our results could significantly enhance the capabilities of gravitational wave experiments, serving as a valuable method for testing new physics and better identifying diverse sources of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Fastest spinning millisecond pulsars: indicators for quark matter in neutron stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rotating hybrid stars, with a particular emphasis on the effect of a deconfinement phase transition on their properties at high spin. Our analysis is based on a hybrid equation of state with a phase transition from hypernuclear matter to color-superconducting quark matter, where both phases are described within a relativistic density functional approach. By varying the vector and diquark couplings of quark matter, we obtain different hybrid star sequences with varying extension of the quark matter core, ensuring consistency with astrophysical constraints from mass, radius and tidal deformability measurements. We demonstrate the impact of an increasing rotational frequency on the maximum gravitational mass, the central energy density of compact stars, the rise of the quasi-radial oscillations and non-axisymmetric instabilities. We demonstrate that for the most favorable parameter sets with a strong vector coupling, hybrid star configurations with color-superconducting quark matter core can describe the fastest spinning and heaviest galactic pulsar J0952-0607, while it is out of reach for the purely hadronic hypernuclear star configuration.
  We also revise the previously proposed empirical relation between the Kepler frequency, gravitational mass, and radius of non-rotating neutron stars, obtained based on the assumption that all neutron stars, up to the heaviest, are hadronic. We show how the phase transition to quark matter alters this relation and, consequently, the constraints on the dense matter equation of state. Our findings reveal that incorporating the hybrid equation of state has significant implications for the constraints on the properties of strongly interacting matter and neutron stars, placing the upper limit on $R_{1.4}\leq14.90$ km (considering the 716 Hz frequency limit from J1748+2446ad) and $R_{1.4}\leq$11.90~km (for 1000 Hz).</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of extended multiHiggs doublet models with $S_4$ family symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose extended 3HDM and 4HDM models where the SM gauge symmetry is enlarged by the spontaneously broken $S_4$ group, the preserved $Z_2$ and broken $Z_4$ cyclic symmetries. Each model has three active $SU(2)$ scalar doublets, in addition, the first one has an extra inert scalar singlet, whereas the second model has an inert scalar doublet. Furthermore, each model has several extra gauge singlet scalars, which are triplets under $S_4$. Both models yield the same structure of the mass matrices for the fermion sector, where a radiative seesaw generates the tiny light active neutrinos masses at one-loop level, through the $S_4$ triplets. The presence of flavor changing neutral currents mediated by heavy scalars allowed us to study the $(K^0-\overline{K}^0)$ and $(B_{d,s}^0-\overline{B}_{d,s}^0)$ meson mixings, in the parameter space that currently satisfies the experimental constraints. On the other hand, due to the preserved $Z_2$ symmetry, our proposed models have stable scalar and fermionic dark matter candidates. Furthermore, these models are consistent with the current pattern of SM fermion masses and mixings, with the measured dark matter relic abundance and successfully accommodate the constraints arising from meson oscillations and oblique parameters. The extra scalars in our models provide radiative corrections to the oblique parameters, where due to the presence of the scalar inert doublet, renders the 4HDM less restrictive than the 3HDM one.</description>

      <title>Shear and bulk viscosity of quark-gluon plasma with Gribov gluons and quasiparticle quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the transport properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma, focusing on bulk ($\zeta$) and shear ($\eta$) viscosities at vanishing chemical potential. To describe the QGP, we employ a quasiparticle model for quarks along with Gribov's prescription for gluons, which effectively captures non-perturbative dynamics. The Gribov parameter $\gamma_G$ and the dynamical mass $m_g$ are obtained by solving the one-loop gap equation in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ renormalization scheme and further using lattice QCD data for the equation of state (EoS) of pure gluonic matter. The interaction between quarks and gluons is reflected in the quark quasi-mass $m_q$, again obtained using lattice EoS data for (2+1)-flavor QCD. Our primary goal is to invertigate the influence of quasi-quarks on the transport coefficients of QGP. Interestingly, we find a substantial decrease in the scaled transport coefficients with rising temperatures within the range ($1 \le T/T_c \le 3.5$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13389v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study an extension of the Standard Model which includes a new massive vector field in the fundamental representation of SU(2)_L. The neutral component of the new vector field is a natural dark matter candidate. We compute the Annihilation Cross Section with Sommerfeld Enhancement and the Photon Flux arising from Dark Matter annihilation events. We found that the model exhibits a resonant mass part around the range of 2-10 TeV. This resonance is influenced by the choice of portal Higgs coupling parameter. We show that these predictions can be partially tested by CTA in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of antinuclei in cosmic rays provides a unique opportunity to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. Antinuclei in our Galaxy may stem either from annihilation or decay of dark matter, or from collisions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, which constitute the background of indirect dark matter searches. Understanding the formation mechanism of (anti)nuclei is crucial for setting limits on their production in space. Coalescence models, which describe the formation of light nuclei from final-state interaction of nucleons, have been widely employed in high-energy collisions. In this work, we introduce ToMCCA (Toy Monte Carlo Coalescence Afterburner), which allows for detailed studies of the nuclear formation processes without the overload of general-purpose event generators. ToMCCA contains parameterizations of the multiplicity dependence of the transverse momentum distributions of protons and of the baryon-emitting source size, extracted from ALICE measurements in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5 - 13$ TeV, as well as of the event multiplicity distributions, taken from the EPOS event generator. ToMCCA provides predictions of the deuteron transverse momentum distributions, with an agreement of $\sim5\%$ with the experimental data. The results of ToMCCA show that the coalescence mechanism in pp collisions depends only on the event multiplicity rather than on the collision system or its energy. This allows the model to be utilized for predictions at lower center-of-mass collision energies, which are the most relevant for the production of antinuclei from processes related to dark matter. This model can also be extended to heavier nuclei as long as the target nucleus wave function and its Wigner function are known.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Reactor Anti-Neutrino 5 MeV Bump with $^{13}$C Neutral-Current Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we comprehensively examine the potential of neutrino-nucleus neutral current interactions with $^{13}$C to determine the origin of the 5-MeV bump in reactor antineutrino spectra observed through the inverse beta decay (IBD) process. This anomaly may be due to new physics, reactor antineutrino flux inaccuracies, or IBD systematics. The primary signal is the 3.685 MeV photon released during the de-excitation of $^{13}$C$^*$ to its ground state, detectable in various liquid scintillator detectors. This interaction is most common for reactor antineutrinos within the energy range of the 5-MeV bump, providing unique sensitivity to its origins. Remarkably, we confirm the powerfulness of our proposal by completely ruling out a new physics scenario explaining the bump from the existing NEOS data. The main systematic challenge in distinguishing flux models is the accuracy of cross section measurements; thus, minimizing these uncertainties is essential. Hence, we explore the potential of current and forthcoming experiments, including solar neutrino studies at JUNO, pion and muon decay-at-rest experiments at OscSNS, and isotope decay-at-rest studies at Yemilab, to obtain precise cross section measurements. Additionally, we propose a novel method to track the time evolution of reactor isotopes by analyzing the $^{13}$C signal. This technique yields critical insights into the contributions of $^{235}$U and $^{239}$Pu to the observed bump, acting as a robust tool to differentiate between flux models and explore new physics explanations for the 5-MeV bump.</description>

Abstract: We present results from a complete next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation of $e^+e^-\rightarrow ZH$ in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework, including all contributions from dimension-6 operators. At NLO, there are novel dependencies on CP violating parameters in the gauge sector, on modifications to the Higgs boson self-couplings, on alterations to the top quark Yukawa couplings, and on 4-fermion operators involving the electron and the top quark, among others. We show that including only the logarithms resulting from renormalization group scaling can produce misleading results, and further, we explicitly demonstrate the constraining power of combining measurements from different energy scales.</description>

Abstract: In this work we analyze the scenario where a MeV scale $L_\mu - L_\tau$ gauge boson can explain the deficit in the diffuse ultra high energy (UHE) astrophysical neutrino spectrum observed in IceCube, as well as the discrepancy between experimental and $e^+e^-$ dispersion data driven SM calculations of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. We map the parameter space of the model where the elastic resonant s-channel scattering of UHE neutrinos with the cosmic neutrino background, mediated by the new Z', can improve the description of the observed cascade and track spectra over the no-scattering hypothesis. Comparing to recent NA64$\mu$ results, we find that some part of the parameter space remains unexplored, but at a data volume of $10^{11}$ muons on target NA64$\mu$ will completely probe this region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $P_c(4457)$ has been discovered over five years, but the parity of this particle remains undetermined. In this letter we propose a new interpretation for $P_c(4457)$, which is the state generated from the coupled-channel $\bar{D}^0\Lambda_c^{+}(2595)$ and $\pi^0 P_c(4312)$ since they can exchange an almost on-shell $\Sigma_c^+$. In this scenario, the parity of $P_c(4457)$ will be positive, which is different from the candidate of the bound state of $\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c$. The main decay channel of $P_c(4457)$ in this model is $P_c(4312)\pi$. We propose three processes $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi K_s p \pi^-$, $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi K^- p \pi^0$, and $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi p \pi^- \pi^+ K^-$ to verify $P_c(4457)\to P_c(4312)\pi$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we consider a classically scale-invariant extension of the Standard Model (SM) with two-component dark matter (DM) candidates, including a Dirac spinor and a scalar DM. We probe the parameter space of the model, constrained by relic density and direct detection, and investigate the generation of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by an electroweak first-order phase transition. The analysis demonstrates that there are points in the parameter space, leading to a detectable GW spectrum arising from the first-order phase transition, which is also consistent with the DM relic abundance and direct detection bounds. These GWs could be observed by forthcoming space-based interferometers such as the Big Bang Observer, Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, and Ultimate-Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory.</description>

      <title>Scalar Dark Matter Production through the Bubble Expansion Mechanism:The Role of the Lorentz factor and Non-Renormalizable Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Bubble Expansion mechanism for the production of scalar dark matter during a first-order phase transition in the very early Universe. Seeking for a dark matter energy density in agreement with observations, we study different renormalizable and non-renormalizable interactions between the dark matter species and the field undergoing the transition, considering all possible regimes for the Lorentz boost factor associated with the motion of the bubble wall. By employing a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we demonstrate that sufficient dark matter production is achievable even in the previously unexplored low-velocity bubble expansion regime, enlarging the parameter space and possibilities of the scenario. Notably, for the non-renormalizable interactions it is found that the produced dark matter abundances exhibit a similar qualitative behavior to the renormalizable case, even for low Lorentz boost factors. Furthermore, for a transition around the electroweak scale, the associated gravitational wave spectrum is within the reach of future detectors.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Enabled Intensity Interferometry in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important tool in studying the sub-femtoscale spacetime structure of matter in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) intensity interferometry of identical particles in the final state of such collisions. We show here that a variant of an entanglement enabled intensity interferometry ($E^2 I^2$) proposed by Cotler and Wilczek provides a powerful alternative to HBT interferometry in extracting fundamental nonperturbative features of QCD at high energies. In particular, we show that the spatial distributions of color singlet (pomeron) configurations in nuclei can be obtained from exclusive resonant decays of $\rho$-mesons into $\pi^\pm$-pairs in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions (UPCs) at RHIC and the LHC. The $E^2 I^2$ framework developed here is quite general. It can be employed to extract information on the spin structure of pomeron couplings as well as enhance the discovery potential for rare odderon configurations from exclusive vector meson decays into few-particle final states both in UPCs and at the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sydney Coleman's Q-ball remains a compelling instance of localised object formation within classical field theory, independently of the quantum evolution. The theoretical possibility of such objects forming and colliding in the early universe from models such as Affleck-Dine fragmentation, or from a number of mechanisms where they are produced copiously with various size and charges to be dark matter candidates, makes it important to study in detail Q-ball collision phenomenology. In this work we present results from a study of Q-ball collisions and their gravitational waves, using a new general code package for scalar fields coupled to gravity. We then comment on the possibility of future gravitational wave detectors searching for signals of Q-ball collisions.</description>

      <title>Constraints for twist-two alien operators in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parton evolution equations in QCD are controlled by the anomalous dimensions of gauge-invariant twist-two spin-$N$ quark and gluon operators. Under renormalization, these mix with gauge-variant operators of the same quantum numbers, referred to as alien operators. Our work addresses the systematic study of these alien operators at arbitrary spin $N$, using generalized BRST symmetry relations to derive their couplings and Feynman rules at all values of $N$. We observe how the all-$N$ structure of the generalized (anti-)BRST constraints relates the couplings of alien operators with $n+1$ gluons to those with $n$ gluons. Realizing a bootstrap, we present all one-loop results necessary for performing the operator renormalization up to four loops in QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarizabilities of light pseudoscalar mesons can be extracted from differential cross sections for Compton scattering near threshold. While this has been accomplished for charged pions employing Primakoff reactions, a corresponding measurement for kaons will be affected by the presence of the $K^*(892)$ resonance not too far from threshold. We propose a method to extend the energy range serviceable for this purpose by reconstructing the $K^*(892)$ contribution model-independently from its $K\pi$ intermediate state, using dispersion theory. We point out that, in contrast to the charged-pion analog, there is likely no strong hierarchy between sum and difference of electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities; we discuss the sensitivity to disentangling both by improved experimental angular coverage.</description>

      <title>Mass hierarchies in gauge theory with two index symmetric representation matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In gauge theories, the running of the anomalous dimension of a fermion bilinear operator is believed to lead to chiral symmetry breaking when gamma=1. Naively using perturbative results to judge when gamma=1 leads to the possibility of large dynamically generated mass hierarchies in models with both two index symmetric representation and fundamental representation fermions. In this paper we study a holographic model of this physics to predict the separation in scales in the meson spectrum. We study SU(Nc) theories at different Nc with one flavour of two index symmetric representation as a function of the number of fundamental fermion flavours NfF. The largest hierarchy we find is for Nc=7 and NfF=22 where the rho mesons made of the two different representations are separated in scale by a factor of 13. For general Nc the hierarchy can be made greater than 7 by tuning NfF. We display the hierarchy as a function of NfF and investigate the quark mass dependence. These predictions do depend on the extrapolation of gamma from the perturbative regime - even in a pessimistic scenario a distinct gap can be achieved.</description>

      <title>The QED nonfactorizable correction to the semileptonic charmed three-body $B$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the nonfactorizable photonic corrections to the effective four-fermion vertex for the $\overline{B}$ ${\to}$ $D^{({\ast})}$ $+$ ${\ell}^{-}$ $+$ $\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ decays are considered at the quark level within SM, where ${\ell}$ $=$ $e$, ${\mu}$ and ${\tau}$. It is found that the QED corrections are closely related with the mass of the charged lepton. The QED contributions will enhance branching ratios, which results in the slight reduction of ratios $R(D^{(\ast)})$ and the relationship $R(D^{(\ast)})_{e}$ $&lt;$ $R(D^{(\ast)})_{\mu}$.</description>

      <title>Model independent bounds on heavy sterile neutrinos from the angular distribution of $\mathbf{B\to D^*\ell\nu}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the bounds that can be inferred on New Physics couplings to heavy sterile neutrinos $N$ from the recent measurements performed by the Belle collaboration of the angular analysis of $B\to D^*\ell\bar\nu_\ell$ decays, with $\ell=e,\mu$. Indeed, a sterile neutrino $N$ may lead to competing $B\to D^*\ell\bar N$ decays and Belle might have measured an incoherent sum of these two independent channels. After reviewing the theoretical formalism required to describe this phenomenon in full generality, we first perform a bump hunt in the $M_{\rm miss}^2$ Belle distribution to search for evidences of an additional massive neutrino. We found in such a way a small hint at $M_{\rm miss}^2 \sim (350\ {\rm MeV})^2$. However, the Belle angular analysis is sensitive to $N$ masses up to $\mathcal{O}$(50 MeV), preventing us to further inspect this hint. Nevertheless, we study the potential impact of this additional channel in the allowed mass range on the measured angular distributions and extract model-independent bounds on the new-physics couplings which could mediate such an interaction. In particular, in the mass window here inspected, we obtain the most stringent bounds for vector and left-handed scalar operators to date.</description>

      <title>Constraining Jet Quenching in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jet suppression and modification is a hallmark feature of heavy-ion collisions. This can be attributed to an accumulated set of effects, including radiative and elastic energy loss and reabsorption of thermalized energy within the jet cone, which are encoded in a quenching weight, determining the probability distribution for a shift of the $p_T$ (energy loss). We perform a data-driven analysis, based on Bayesian inference, to extract information about the energy-loss distribution experienced by propagating jets using generic and flexible parametrizations. We first establish the consistency between different data-sets and, thereby, provide evidence for the universality of the quark/gluon quenching weights for different observables. Furthermore, we extract that the color dependence of energy loss is slightly bigger than what expected from Casimir scaling, pointing to the importance of multi-parton quenching within high-$p_T$ jets at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics in heavy and light-ion collisions -- I) Kinetic Theory vs. Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions exhibit collective flow, which emerges as a dynamical response of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) to the initial state geometry of the collision. Collective flow in heavy-ion collisions is usually described within multi-stage evolution models, which employ a viscous relativistic hydrodynamic description of the space-time evolution of the QGP. By comparing event-by-event simulations in kinetic theory and viscous hydrodynamics in OO, AuAu and PbPb collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, we quantify to what extent a macroscopic hydrodynamic description can accurately describe the development of collective flow and to what extent collective flow in small systems, such as OO, is sensitive to the non-equilibrium evolution of the QGP beyond hydrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Exploiting the first measurements of the same ion species in OO collisons at RHIC and LHC, we propose an observable to distinguish whether collective behavior builds up through a hydrodynamic expansion of a strongly interacting QGP or few final state re-scatterings. Our procedure allows to disentangle the effects of the initial state geometry and the dynamical response mechanism on anisotropic flow. We validate its ability to discriminate between systems with different interaction rates using results from event-by-event simulations in kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Emission from a Cosmic String Loop, I: Global Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the simultaneous decay of global string loops into scalar particles (massless and massive modes) and gravitational waves (GWs). Using field theory simulations in flat space-time of isolated loops with initial length $\sim 80-1700$ times their core width, we determine the power emitted into scalar particles, $P_{\varphi}$, and GWs, $P_{\rm GW}$, and characterize the loop decay timescale as a function of its initial length, energy and angular momentum. We quantify infrared and ultraviolet lattice dependencies of our results. For all type of loops and initial conditions considered, GW emission is always suppressed compared to particles as $P_{\rm GW}/P_{\varphi} \approx \mathcal{O}(10)(v/m_\text{p})^2\ll 1$, where $v$ is the vacuum expectation value associated with string formation. These conclusions are robust for the length-to-width ratios considered, with no indication they should change if the ratio is increased. The results suggest that the GW background from a global string network, such as in dark matter axion scenarios, will be suppressed compared to previous expectations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using fuzzy axion dark matter to test the anthropic principle. A very light axion can be directly detectable, at least by black hole superradiance effects. The idea then is that gravitational and astrophysical observations can discover a light axion in the regime where it must be all of dark matter with abundance which must be set up by the anthropic principle, due to excessive primordial misalignment induced by inflation-induced Brownian drift of fluctuations. Yet it may turn out that dark matter is something else instead of this axion. Since the de Sitter-induced axion misalignment controlled only by the de Sitter curvature cannot be evaded, this would invalidate the anthropic prediction of the dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass bounds from DESI 2024 are relaxed by Planck PR4 and cosmological supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent DESI 2024 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements combined with the CMB data from the Planck 18 PR3 dataset and the Planck PR4+ACT DR6 lensing data, with a prior on the sum of the neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu&gt;0$, leads to a strong constraint, $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.072$ eV, which would exclude the inverted neutrino hierarchy and put some tension on even the standard hierarchy. We show that actually this bound gets significantly relaxed when combining the new DESI measurements with the HiLLiPoP+LoLLiPoP likelihoods, based on the Planck 2020 PR4 dataset, and with supernovae datasets. We note that the fact that neutrino masses are pushed towards zero, and even towards negative values, is known to be correlated with the so-called $A_L$ tension, a mismatch between lensing and power spectrum measurements in the Planck PR3 data, which is reduced by HiLLiPoP+LoLLiPoP to less than 1$\sigma$. We find $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.1$ eV and $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.12$ eV, with the supernovae Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR datasets respectively. The shift caused by these datasets is more compatible with the expectations from neutrino oscillation experiments, and both the normal and inverted hierarchy scenarios remain now viable, even with the $\sum m_\nu&gt;0$ prior. Finally, we analyze neutrino mass bounds in an extension of $\Lambda$CDM that addresses the $H_0$ tension, with extra fluid Dark Radiation, finding that in such models bounds are further relaxed and the posterior probability for $\sum m_\nu$ begins to exhibit a peak at positive values.</description>

      <title>Investigation of kaonic atom optical potential by the high precision data of kaonic $^3$He and $^4$He atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate kaonic atom states based on the latest high precision data of the $2p$ states of the kaonic atoms in $^3$He and $^4$He (J-PARC E62). We consider the phenomenological form for the optical potential proportional to the nuclear density distributions and determine the potential parameters by the latest data. We find two sets of potential parameters for each of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He that reproduce the data. We then extract the potential parameters consistent with the data of $^3$He and $^4$He atoms simultaneously. Using the potential, we investigate the structure of the kaonic atoms and kaonic nuclei for various nuclei up to Sn. We also report the optical potential parameters suited for the global description of the atomic data, the possible strong isospin dependence of the potential, and the different strength of the data of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He in the restrictions on the potential parameters. In addition, we find that the study of the $1s$ states of the kaonic helium atom is very interesting as a next step, and the determination of the orbital angular momenta of the kaonic nuclear states is helpful for the unified understandings of the atomic and nuclear bound states of kaon because of the mutual influence between the atomic and the nuclear states of kaon with the same orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Inflaton Potential: Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves in Slow Roll and Ultra Slow Roll Single Field Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new single field inflationary scenarios that produce the critical abundance of primordial black holes as dark matter reconstructing the inflaton potential from an input power spectrum. The method is exact in the slow roll approximation but remains effective even when the slow roll conditions are temporarily violated such as in ultra slow roll models. With this method we construct new ultra slow roll scenarios and also models that reproduce the DM abundance within the slow roll regime. As a second application we consider a scalar power spectrum that generates a secondary gravitational wave background compatible with the one recently observed in Pulsar Timing Arrays experiments. These scenarios could be tested by future observations of $\mu-$distortions of the CMB.</description>

      <title>A universal implementation of radiative effects in neutrino event generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the similarities between electron-nucleus ($eA$) and neutrino-nucleus scattering ($\nu A$), $eA$ data can contribute key information to improve cross-section modeling in $eA$ and hence in $\nu A$ event generators. However, to compare data and generated events, either the data must be radiatively corrected or radiative effects need to be included in the event generators. We implemented a universal radiative corrections program that can be used with all reaction mechanisms and any $eA$ event generator. Our program includes real photon radiation by the incident and scattered electrons, and virtual photon exchange and photon vacuum polarization diagrams. It uses the ``extended peaking" approximation for electron radiation and neglects charged hadron radiation. This method, validated with GENIE, can also be extended to simulate $\nu A$ radiative effects. This work facilitates data-event-generator comparisons used to improve $\nu A$ event generators for the next-generation of neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Cutting rule for in-in correlators and cosmological collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a cutting rule for equal-time in-in correlators including cosmological correlators based on Keldysh $r/a$ basis, which decomposes diagrams into fully retarded functions and cut-propagators consisting of Wightman functions. Our derivation relies only on basic assumptions such as unitarity, locality, and the causal structure of the in-in formalism, and therefore holds for theories with arbitrary particle contents and local interactions at any loop order. As an application, we show that non-local cosmological collider signals arise solely from cut-propagators under the assumption of microcausality. Since the cut-propagators do not contain (anti-)time-ordering theta functions, the conformal time integrals are factorized, simplifying practical calculations.</description>

      <title>Evolution and the quasistationary state of collective fast neutrino flavor conversion in three dimensions without axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate in this work the evolution of the collective fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC) in a three dimensional (3D) cubic box with periodic boundary condition for three different neutrino angular distributions that are axially asymmetric. We find that the system evolves toward a quasistationary state where the angular distribution of the spatially averaged neutrino electron-minus-muon lepton number (ELN) does not contain any crossings. In the quasistationary state, near flavor equilibration is achieved in one angular domain enclosed by the initial ELN angular crossing contour, similar to the conclusion derived based on simplified one dimensional (1D) system with axially symmetric neutrino angular distributions. We have also performed additional simulations in coordinates where the initial first ELN angular moment has only one nonvanishing spatial component by using the original axially asymmetric ELN angular distributions as well as the corresponding axisymmetric ELN distributions, and find interesting similarity between these two sets. Finally, we propose three different analytical prescriptions generalized from earlier 1D models to 3D models, and evaluate their performances in predicting the post-FFC moments. Our findings suggest that further development of effective classical transport model in multidimensions to capture the effect of FFC is promising.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic study of the $ \Omega \alpha $ interaction in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-particle momentum correlation between the Omega-baryon ($\Omega$) and the $^{4}He (\alpha) $ in high-energy heavy ion collisions is explored.
  Such correlations as an alternative source of information can help us further understand the interaction between $ \Omega $ and nucleons (N).
  $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials in the single-folding potential approach are constructed by employing two different available $\Omega N $ interactions in $^{5}S_{2}$ channel, i.e, one is based on the (2 + 1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations near the physical point by the HAL QCD collaboration, and another is based on the meson exchanges with effective Lagrangian, where in the latter case coupled channels effect is considered.
  It is found that the correlation functions at small size source depends on the used potential model. This implicitly means that at high density nuclear medium, $ \Omega \alpha $ momentum correlation could drive the feature of $ \Omega N $ interactions.
  Moreover, by extracting the scattering length and the effective range from obtained $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials, the correlation functions are calculated within the Lednicky-Lyuboshits (LL) formalism.
  It is shown that since the $\Omega\alpha $ has large interaction range, the LL formula leads to different results at small source size.</description>

      <title>RHIC $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV hadron yields and the isospin dependent equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statistical hadronization model has been successful in extracting information at chemical freeze-out in heavy-ion collisions. At RHIC, with a collision energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, many different ion species have been used for $A$+$A$ collisions. This allows for a scan across the charge fraction $Y_Q=Z/A$, where $Z$ is the proton number and $A$ is the baryon number. We first make predictions for $A$+$A$ collisions that do not yet have published experimental data on hadron yield ratios (O+O, Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr). We then use both the experimental and predicted yield ratios to perform thermal fits across $Y_Q$, enabling us to extract $s/n_B$ and other thermodynamic information at chemical freeze-out. Using the relation between $s/n_B$ and $Y_Q$, we can calculate a new constraint on the finite temperature equation of state at finite densities. We discuss implications of this constraint and propose future runs that can help connect to the equation of state relevant for neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Spectra of magnetic fields from electroweak symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize magnetic fields produced during electroweak symmetry breaking by non-dynamical numerical simulations based on the Kibble mechanism. The generated magnetic fields were thought to have an energy spectrum $\propto k^3$ for small wavenumbers $k$, but here we show that it is actually a spectrum $\propto k^4$ along with characteristic fluctuations in the magnetic helicity. Using scaling results from MHD simulations for the evolution and assuming that the initial magnetic field is coherent on the electroweak Hubble scale, we estimate the magnetic field strength to be $\sim 10^{-13}\, {\rm G}$ on kpc scales at the present epoch for non-helical fields. For maximally helical fields we obtain $\sim 10^{-10}\, {\rm G}$ on Mpc scales. We also give scalings of these estimates for partially helical fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rods and Clock in a Gravitational Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local operators are the basic observables in quantum field theory which encode the physics observed by a local experimentalist. However, when gravity is dynamical, diffeomorphism symmetries are gauged which apparently obstructs a sensible definition of local operators, as different locations in spacetime are connected by these gauged symmetries. This consideration brings in the puzzle of reconciling our empirical world with quantum gravity. Intuitively, this puzzle can be avoided using relatively defined observables when there exists a natural reference system such as a distribution of galaxies in our universe. Nevertheless, this intuition is classical as the rods and clock defined in this way may also have quantum fluctuations so it is not a priori clear if it can be realized in the quantum regime. In this letter, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. Interestingly, we notice that the quantum fluctuations of the reference system are in fact essential for the realization of the above intuition in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Revise the Dark Matter-Phantom Scalar Field Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmological history and evolution are examined for gravitational models with interaction in the dark sector of the universe. In particular, we consider the dark energy to be described by a phantom scalar field and the dark matter $\rho _{m}$ as a pressureless ideal gas. We introduce the interacting function $Q=\beta \left( t\right) \rho_{m}$, where the function $% \beta \left( t\right) $ is considered to be proportional to $\dot{\phi}, \dot{\phi}^{2}H^{-1},~H$, or a constant parameter with dimensions of $\left[H_{0}\right] $. For the four interacting models, we study in details the phase space by calculating the stationary points. The latter are applied to reconstruct the cosmological evolution. Compactified variables are essential to understand the complete picture of the phase space and to conclude about the cosmological viability of these interacting models. The detailed analysis is performed for the exponential potential $V\left( \phi \right) =V_{0}e^{\lambda \phi }$. The effects of other scalar field potential functions on the cosmological dynamics are examined.</description>
