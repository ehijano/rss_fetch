      <title>k-Fold Gaussian Random Matrix Ensembles I: Forcing Structure into Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random Matrix Theory is a powerful tool in applied mathematics. Three canonical models of random matrix distributions are the Gaussian Orthogonal, Unitary and Symplectic Ensembles. For matrix ensembles defined on k-fold tensor products of identical vector spaces we motivate natural generalizations of the Gaussian Ensemble family. We show how the k-fold invariant constraints are satisfied in both disordered spin models and systems with gauge symmetries, specifically quantum double models. We use Schur-Weyl duality to completely characterize the form of allowed Gaussian distributions satisfying k-fold invariant constraints. The eigenvalue distribution of our proposed ensembles is computed exactly using the Harish-Chandra integral method. For the 2-fold tensor product case, we show that the derived distribution couples eigenvalue spectrum to entanglement spectrum. Guided by representation theory, our work is a natural extension of the standard Gaussian random matrix ensembles.</description>

      <title>Spectral density of complex eigenvalues and associated mean eigenvector self-overlaps at the edge of elliptic Ginibre ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the density of complex eigenvalues, $\rho(z)$, and the associated mean eigenvector self-overlaps, $\mathcal{O}(z)$, at the spectral edge of $N \times N$ real and complex elliptic Ginibre matrices, as $N \to \infty$. Two different regimes of ellipticity are studied: strong non-Hermiticity, keeping the ellipticity parameter $\tau$ fixed and weak non-Hermiticity with $\tau \rightarrow 1 $ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. At strong non-Hermiticity, we find that both $\rho(z)$ and $\mathcal{O}(z)$ have the same leading order behaviour across the elliptic Ginibre ensembles, establishing the expected universality. In the limit of weak non-Hermiticity, we find different results for $\rho(z)$ and $\mathcal{O}(z)$ across the two ensembles. This paper is the final of three papers that we have presented addressing the mean self-overlap of eigenvectors in these ensembles.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics on a noncommutative plane through the lens of deformation quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gauge invariant mathematical formalism based on deformation quantization is outlined to model an $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric system of a spin $1/2$ charged particle placed in a nocommutative plane under the influence of a vertical uniform magnetic field. The noncommutative involutive algebra $(C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{2})[[\vartheta]],*^r)$ of formal power series in $\vartheta$ with coefficients in the commutative ring $C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ was employed to construct the relevant observables, viz., SUSY Hamiltonian $H$, supercharge operator $Q$ and its adjoint $Q^{\dag}$ all belonging to the $2\times 2$ matrix algebra $\mathcal{M}_{2}(C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{2})[[\vartheta]],*^r)$ with the help of a family of gauge-equivalent star products $*^{r}$. The energy eigenvalues of the SUSY Hamiltonian all turned out to be independent of not only the gauge parameter $r$ but also the noncommutativity parameter $\vartheta$. The nontrivial Fermionic ground state was subsequently computed associated with the zero energy which indicates that supersymmetry remains unbroken in all orders of $\vartheta$. The Witten index for the noncommutative SUSY Landau problem turns out to be $-1$ corroborating the fact that there is no broken supersymmetry for the model we are considering.</description>

      <title>Gluon Mass Generation from Renormalons and Resurgence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a link between the concepts of infrared renormalons, infrared fixed point, and dynamical nonperturbative mass generation of gluons in pure Yang-Mills theories. By utilizing recent results in the resurgent analysis of renormalons through non-linear ordinary differential equations, we develop a new description for the gluon propagator, thereby realizing the Schwinger mechanism. Specifically, this approach leads to a nonperturbative, dynamic mass generation for Yang-Mills gauge bosons in the deep infrared region, a phenomenon closely associated with color confinement. Furthermore, we present arguments about the limit of applicability of the Borel-Ecalle resummation of the renormalons by comparing it with the Kallen-Lehman representation of the gluon propagator.</description>

      <title>A Walk Through $Spin(1,d+1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct unitary irreducible representation of the de Sitter group, that forms the basis for the study of $dS_{d+1}$ QFT. Using the intertwining kernel analysis, we discuss bosonic symmetric tensor, and fermionic higher-spinors. Particular care is given to the structure and construction of exceptional series and fermionic operators. We discuss the discrete series, and explain how and why the exceptional series give rise to seemingly non-invariant correlators in de Sitter. Using tools from Clifford analysis, we show that for $d&gt;3$, there are no exceptional fermionic representations, and so no unitary (higher)-gravitino fields. We also consider the structure of representations for $d=3$ and $d=2$, as relevant for the study of $dS_4$, the only space allowing for unitary gravitino and its generalisation, and of $dS_3$.</description>

      <title>Spinoptics in a curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study propagation of the high frequency electromagnetic waves in a curved spacetime. We discuss a so call spinoptics approach which generalizes a well known geometric optics approximation and allows one to take into account spin-dependent corrections. A new element proposed in this work is the use of effective action which allows one to derive spinoptics equations. This method is simpler and more transparent than the earlier proposed methods. It is explicitly covariant and can be applied to an arbitrary spacetime background. We also demonstrate how the initial value problem for the high frequency electromagnetiv wave can be soled in the developed spinoptics approximation.</description>

      <title>The atomizing pulsed jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations of the injection of a pulsed round liquid jet in a stagnant gas are performed. The Reynolds and Weber numbers and the density ratio are sufficiently large for reaching a complex high-speed atomization regime. The Weber number based on grid size is small, an indication that the simulations are very well resolved. Computations are performed using octree adaptive mesh refinement using the Basilisk free-code platform, down to a specified minimum grid size $\Delta$. Qualitative analysis of the flow and its topology reveal a complex structure of ligaments, sheets, droplets and bubbles that evolve and interact through impacts, ligament breakup, sheet rupture and engulfment of air bubbles in the liquid. A rich gallery of images of entangled structures is produced. Most processes occurring in this type of atomization are reproduced in detail, except at the instant of thin sheet perforation or breakup. We analyze drop statistics, showing that as the grid resolution is increased, the small-scale part of the distribution does not converge, and contains a large number of droplets close in order of magnitude to the minimum grid size with a significant peak at $d = 3\Delta$ . This non-convergence arises from the {\em numerical sheet breakup} effect, in which the interface becomes rough just before it breaks. The rough appearance of the interface is associated to a high-wavenumber oscillation of the curvature. To recover convergence, we apply the controlled "manifold death" numerical procedure, in which thin sheets are detected, and then pierced by fiat before they reach a set critical thickness $h_c$ that is always larger than $6 \Delta$. This allows convergence of the droplet frequency above a certain critical diameter $d_c$ above and close to $h_c$. A unimodal distribution is observed in the converged range.</description>

      <title>Simulation of stopping vortices in the flow past a mounted wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the numerical investigation of the dynamics of stopping vortex formation in the uniform flow past a wedge mounted on a wall for channel Reynolds number $Re_c=1560$. The streamfunction-vorticity ($\psi$-$\omega$) formulation of the transient Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations have been utilized for simulating the flow and has been discretized using a fourth order spatially and second order temporally accurate compact finite difference method on a nonuniform Cartesian grid developed by the author. The results are validated by comparing the simulated results of the early evolution of the flow with the experimental visualization of a well-known laboratory experiment of \cite{pullin1980} and a grid-independence study. The development of the stopping vortex and its effect on the starting vortex are discussed in details. The stopping flow is analysed in the light of the time interval through which the inlet velocity of the flow is decelerated. The criterion for the development of a clean vortex is provided in terms of the impulse associated with the deceleration. Our study revealed that the strength of the stopping vortex depends upon the rapidity of deceleration. The vorticity distribution along the diameter of the core of the stopping vortex is seen to follow a Gaussian profile.</description>

      <title>Time-of-arrival distributions for continuous quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using standard results from statistics, we show that for any continuous quantum system (Gaussian or otherwise) and any observable $A$ (position or otherwise), the distribution $ \pi _{a}\left(t\right) $ of a time measurement at a fixed state $a$ can be inferred from the distribution $ \rho _{t}\left( a\right) $ of a state measurement at a fixed time $t$ via the transformation $ \pi _{a}\left( t\right) = \left\vert \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \int_{-\infty }^{a}\rho _{t}\left( u\right) du \right\vert $. This finding suggests that the answer to the long-lasting time-of-arrival problem is in fact readily available in the standard formalism, secretly hidden within the Born rule, and therefore does not require the introduction of an ad-hoc time operator or a commitment to a specific (e.g., Bohmian) ontology. The generality and versatility of the result are illustrated by applications to the time-of-arrival at a given location for a free particle in a superposed state and to the time required to reach a given velocity for a free-falling quantum particle. Our approach also offers a potentially promising new avenue toward the design of an experimental protocol for the yet-to-be-performed observation of the phenomenon of quantum backflow.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality reduction of neuronal degeneracy reveals two interfering physiological mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuronal systems maintain stable functions despite large variability in their physiological components. Ion channel expression, in particular, is highly variable in neurons exhibiting similar electrophysiological phenotypes, which poses questions regarding how specific ion channel subsets reliably shape neuron intrinsic properties. Here, we use detailed conductance-based modeling to explore the origin of stable neuronal function from variable channel composition. Using dimensionality reduction, we uncover two principal dimensions in the channel conductance space that capture most of the variance of the observed variability. Those two dimensions correspond to two physiologically relevant sources of variability that can be explained by feedback mechanisms underlying regulation of neuronal activity, providing quantitative insights into how channel composition links to neuronal electrophysiological activity. These insights allowed us to understand and design a model-independent, reliable neuromodulation rule for variable neuronal populations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Weak measurements within the Einstein-Dirac Cosmological framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study applies the Two-State Formalism alongside weak measurements within a spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmological framework, wherein Dirac spinors are intricately coupled to classical gravity. To elucidate this, we provide detailed formulations for computing the weak values of the energy-momentum tensors, the Z component of spin, and the characterization of pure states. Weak measurements appear to be a generalization and extension of the computation already made by Finster an Hainzl, in A spatially homogeneous and isotropic Einstein-Dirac cosmology. Our analysis reveals that the acceleration of the Universe expansion can be understood as an outcome of postselection, underscoring the effectiveness of weak measurement as a discerning approach for gauging cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the normal matrix model, also known as the two-dimensional one-component plasma at a specific temperature, with merging singularity. As the number $n$ of particles tends to infinity we obtain the limiting local correlation kernel at the singularity, which is related to the parametrix of the Painlev\'e~II equation. The two main tools are Riemann-Hilbert problems and the generalized Christoffel-Darboux identity. The correlation kernel exhibits a novel anisotropic scaling behavior, where the corresponding spacing scale of particles is $n^{-1/3}$ in the direction of merging and $n^{-1/2}$ in the perpendicular direction. We also describe the correlation kernel in the vicinity of the merging singularity, using the mesoscopic scales that interpolate between the singularity and the bulk regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum particle localization observables on Cauchy surfaces of Minkowski spacetime and their causal properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13894v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a general notion of spatial localization on spacelike smooth Cauchy surfaces of quantum systems in Minkowski spacetime. The notion is constructed in terms of a coherent family of normalized POVMs, one for each said Cauchy surface. We prove that a family of POVMs of this type automatically satisfies a causality condition which generalizes Castrigiano's one and implies it when restricting to flat spacelike Cauchy surfaces. As a consequence no conflict with Hegerfeldt's theorem arises. We furthermore prove that such families of POVMs do exist for massive Klein-Gordon particles, since some of them are extensions of already known spatial localization observables. These are constructed out of positive definite kernels or are defined in terms of the stress-energy tensor operator. Some further features of these structures are investigated, in particular, the relation with the triple of Newton-Wigner selfadjoint operators and a modified form of Heisenberg inequality in the rest $3$-spaces of Minkowski reference frames</description>

Abstract: A new algebra, hitherto not encountered in the usual Lie algebraic varieties or supervarieties, is introduced. The paper explores the rich and novel structure of the algebra, and it compares it on the one hand with the Jordan-Lie Superalgebras studied by Okubo and Kamiya, and on the other, with the four usual Euclidean division rings of the reals (R), the complexes (C), the quaternions (H) and the octonions (O), key algebraic properties of which the algebra is seen to combine, alter, extend and generalise. A potential physical application of the algebra is briefly alluded to at the end.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for out of equilibrium correlations in the symmetric simple exclusion process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For finite size Markov chains, the Donsker-Varadhan theory fully describes the large deviations of the time averaged empirical measure. We are interested in the extension of the Donsker-Varadhan theory for a large size non-equilibrium system: the one-dimensional symmetric simple exclusion process connected with reservoirs at different densities. The Donsker-Varadhan functional encodes a variety of scales depending on the observable of interest. In this paper, we focus on the time-averaged two point correlations and investigate the large deviations from the steady state behaviour. To control two point correlations out of equilibrium, the key input is the construction of a simple approximation to the invariant measure. This approximation is quantitative in time and space as estimated through relative entropy bounds building on the work of Jara and Menezes arXiv:1810.09526.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01726v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional (2D) droplets of noninteracting electrons in a strong magnetic field, placed in a confining potential with arbitrary shape. Using semiclassical methods adapted to the lowest Landau level, we obtain near-Gaussian energy eigenstates that are localized on level curves of the potential and have a position-dependent height. This one-particle insight allows us to deduce explicit formulas for expectation values of local many-body observables, such as density and current, in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, correlations along the edge are long-ranged and inhomogeneous. As we show, this is consistent with the system's universal low-energy description as a free 1D chiral conformal field theory of edge modes, known from earlier works in simple geometries. A delicate interplay between radial and angular dependencies of eigenfunctions ultimately ensures that the theory is homogeneous in terms of the canonical angle variable of the potential, despite its apparent inhomogeneity in terms of more na\"ive angular coordinates. Finally, we propose a scheme to measure the anisotropy by subjecting the droplet to microwave radiation; we compute the corresponding absorption rate and show that it depends on the droplet's shape and the waves' polarization. These results, both local and global, are likely to be observable in solid-state systems or quantum simulators of 2D electron gases with a high degree of control on the confining potential.</description>

      <title>Implications of some mass-capacity inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying a family of mass-capacity related inequalities proved in \cite{M22}, we obtain sufficient conditions that imply the nonnegativity as well as positive lower bounds of the mass, on a class of manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, with or without a singularity.</description>

      <title>A Long Exact Sequence in Symmetry Breaking: order parameter constraints, defect anomaly-matching, and higher Berry phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study defects in symmetry breaking phases, such as domain walls, vortices, and hedgehogs. In particular, we focus on the localized gapless excitations which sometimes occur at the cores of these objects. These are topologically protected by an 't Hooft anomaly. We classify different symmetry breaking phases in terms of the anomalies of these defects, and relate them to the anomaly of the broken symmetry by an anomaly-matching formula. We also derive the obstruction to the existence of a symmetry breaking phase with a local defect. We obtain these results using a long exact sequence of groups of invertible field theories, which we call the "symmetry breaking long exact sequence" (SBLES). The mathematical backbone of the SBLES is studied in a companion paper. Our work further develops the theory of higher Berry phase and its bulk-boundary correspondence, and serves as a new computational tool for classifying symmetry protected topological phases.</description>

      <title>The Baker-Coon-Romans $N$-point amplitude and an exact field theory limit of the Coon amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $N$-point Coon amplitude discovered first by Baker and Coon in the 1970s and then again independently by Romans in the 1980s. This Baker-Coon-Romans (BCR) amplitude retains several properties of tree-level string amplitudes, namely duality and factorization, with a $q$-deformed version of the string spectrum. Although the formula for the $N$-point BCR amplitude is only valid for ${q &gt; 1}$, the four-point case admits a straightforward extension to all ${q \geq 0}$ which reproduces the usual expression for the four-point Coon amplitude. At five points, there are inconsistencies with factorization when pushing ${q &lt; 1}$. Despite these issues, we find a new relation between the five-point BCR amplitude and Cheung and Remmen's four-point basic hypergeometric amplitude, placing the latter within the broader family of Coon amplitudes. Finally, we compute the $q \to \infty$ limit of the $N$-point BCR amplitudes and discover an exact correspondence between these amplitudes and the field theory amplitudes of a scalar transforming in the adjoint representation of a global symmetry group with an infinite set of non-derivative single-trace interaction terms. This correspondence at $q = \infty$ is the first definitive realization of the Coon amplitude (in any limit) from a field theory described by an explicit Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>The geodesic dispersion phenomenon in random fields dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random fields are ubiquitous mathematical structures in physics, with applications ranging from thermodynamics and statistical physics to quantum field theory and cosmology. Recent works on information geometry of Gaussian random fields proposed mathematical expressions for the components of the metric tensor of the underlying parametric space, allowing the computation of the curvature in each point of the manifold. In this study, our hypothesis is that time irreversibility in Gaussian random fields dynamics is a direct consequence of intrinsic geometric properties (curvature) of their parametric space. In order to validate this hypothesis, we compute the components of the metric tensor and derive the twenty seven Christoffel symbols of the metric to define the Euler-Lagrange equations, a system of partial differential equations that are used to build geodesic curves in Riemannian manifolds. After that, by the application of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, we numerically build geodesic curves starting from an arbitrary initial point in the manifold. The obtained results show that, when the system undergoes phase transitions, the geodesic curve obtained by time reversing the computational simulation diverges from the original curve, showing a strange effect that we called the geodesic dispersion phenomenon, which suggests that time irreversibility in random fields is related to the intrinsic geometry of their parametric space.</description>
