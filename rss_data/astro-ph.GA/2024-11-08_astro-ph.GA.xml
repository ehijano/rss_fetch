      <title>Mapping reionization bubbles in the JWST era I: empirical edge detection with Lyman alpha emission from galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionized bubble sizes during reionization trace physical properties of the first galaxies. JWST's ability to spectroscopically confirm and measure Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission in sub-L* galaxies opens the door to mapping ionized bubbles in 3D. However, existing Lya-based bubble measurement strategies rely on constraints from single galaxies, which are limited by the large variability in intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ emission. As a first step, we present two bubble size estimation methods using Lya spectroscopy of ensembles of galaxies, enabling us to map ionized structures and marginalize over Ly$\alpha$ emission variability. We test our methods using Gpc-scale reionization simulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). To map bubbles in the plane of the sky, we develop an edge detection method based on the asymmetry of Ly$\alpha$ transmission as a function of spatial position. To map bubbles along the line-of-sight, we develop an algorithm using the tight relation between Ly$\alpha$ transmission and the line-of-sight distance from galaxies to the nearest neutral IGM patch. Both methods can robustly recover bubbles with radius $\gtrsim$10 comoving Mpc, sufficient for mapping bubbles even in the early phases of reionization, when the IGM is $\sim70-90\%$ neutral. These methods require $\gtrsim$0.002-0.004 galaxies/cMpc$^3$, a $5\sigma$ Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width upper limit of $\lesssim$30\r{A} for the faintest targets, and redshift precision $\Delta z \lesssim 0.015$, feasible with JWST spectroscopy. Shallower observations will provide robust lower limits on bubble sizes. Additional constraints on IGM transmission from Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions and line profiles will further refine these methods, paving the way to our first direct understanding of ionized bubble growth.</description>

      <title>The FENIKS Survey: Stellar-Halo Mass Relationship of Central and Satellite Galaxies in UDS and COSMOS at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 4.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the observed Stellar-to-Halo mass relationship (SHMR) spanning redshifts from 0.2 to 4.5. This was enabled through galaxy clustering and abundance measurements from two large (effective area ~ 1.61 deg^2) and homogeneously prepared photometric catalogs - UltraVISTA ultra-deep stripes DR3 (COSMOS) and FENIKS v1 (UDS). To translate these measurements into the SHMR, we introduce a novel halo occupation distribution (HOD) fitting approach (``smooth-$z$'') whereby HOD parameters between neighboring z-bins are connected via physically motivated continuity (smoothing) priors. As a result, the high constraining power at z &lt;~ 2, due to a much wider dynamical range in stellar mass (~ 3 dex), helps constrain the SHMR at z &gt;~ 2, where that range shrinks down to &lt;~ 1 dex. We find that the halo mass is tightly coupled to star formation: the halo mass with peak integrated star-forming efficiency (SFE), M_h^peak remains constant within ~ 10^12.2 - 10^12.4 Msolar throughout the redshifts probed. Furthermore, we show that if we had relied on COSMOS alone (as opposed to COSMOS+UDS), as has been done by many preceding studies, M_h^peak would be systematically lower by up to ~0.15 dex at z &lt; 1.5, highlighting the importance of mitigating cosmic variance. Finally, for the first time, we show how the SFE evolves with redshift as halos grow in mass along their progenitor merger trees, instead of at fixed halo masses.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas mass measurements of an active, starburst galaxy at $z\approx2.6$ using ALMA observations of the [CI], CO and dust emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new ALMA observations of a starburst galaxy at cosmic noon hosting a radio-loud active galactic nucleus: PKS 0529-549 at $z=2.57$. To investigate the conditions of its cold interstellar medium, we use ALMA observations which spatially resolve the [CI] fine-structure lines, [CI] (2-1) and [CI] (1-0), CO rotational lines, CO (7-6) and CO (4-3), and the rest-frame continuum emission at 461 and 809 GHz. The four emission lines display different morphologies, suggesting spatial variation in the gas excitation conditions. The radio jets have just broken out of the molecular gas but not through the more extended ionized gas halo. The [CI] (2-1) emission is more extended ($\approx8\,{\rm kpc}\times5\,{\rm kpc}$) than detected in previous shallower ALMA observations. The [CI] luminosity ratio implies an excitation temperature of $44\pm16$ K, similar to the dust temperature. Using the [CI] lines, CO (4-3), and 227 GHz dust continuum, we infer the mass of molecular gas $M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ using three independent approaches and typical assumptions in the literature. All approaches point to a massive molecular gas reservoir of about $10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$, but the exact values differ by up to a factor of 4. Deep observations are critical in correctly characterizing the distribution of cold gas in high-redshift galaxies, and highlight the need to improve systematic uncertainties in inferring accurate molecular gas masses.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxy (If Any) of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the host galaxy properties of eight little red dots (LRDs) selected from the JWST UNCOVER survey, applying a new technique ({\tt\string GalfitS}) to simultaneously fit the morphology and spectral energy distribution using multi-band NIRCam images covering $\sim 1-4\,\mu {\rm m}$. We detect the host galaxy in only one LRD, MSAID38108 at $z = 4.96$, which has a stellar mass of $\log (M_*/M_{\odot}) = 8.66^{+0.24}_{-0.23}$, an effective radius $R_e=0.66^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ kpc, and a S\'ersic index $n=0.71^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$. No host emission centered on the central point source is found in the other seven LRDs. We derive stringent upper limits for the stellar mass of a hypothetical host galaxy by conducting realistic mock simulations that place high-redshift galaxy images under the LRDs. Based on the black hole masses estimated from the broad H$\alpha$ emission line, the derived stellar mass limits are at least a factor of 10 lower than expected from the $z \approx 0$ scaling relation between black hole mass and host galaxy stellar mass. Intriguingly, four of the LRDs (50\% of the sample) show extended, off-centered emission, which is particularly prominent in the bluer bands. The asymmetric emission of two sources can be modeled as stellar emission, but the nature of the other two is unclear.</description>

      <title>The Role of Metallicity in the Chemical Evolution of Star-Forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interstellar chemistry in low-metallicity environments is crucial to unveil physical and chemical processes in the past Galaxy or those in high-redshift galaxies, where the metallicity was significantly lower compared to the present-day solar neighborhood. This is also important for the understanding of the diversity of the chemical evolution in various regions of our Galaxy. Nearby low-metallicity laboratories, such as the outskirts of our Galaxy, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and the other gas-rich dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, will provide important insights for this purpose. In the last decade, there has been great progress in astrochemical studies of interstellar molecules in low-metallicity star-forming regions. Do molecular abundances simply scale with the metallicity? If not, which processes govern the chemistry in the low-metallicity interstellar medium? In this proceeding, I will discuss the role of metallicity in the chemical evolution of star-forming regions based on recent observations of interstellar molecules in low-metallicity environments.</description>

      <title>Confirming the Evolution of the Dust Mass Function in Galaxies over the past 5 Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amount of evolution in the dust content of galaxies over the past five billion years of cosmic history is contested in the literature. Here we present a far-infrared census of dust based on a sample of 29,241 galaxies with redshifts ranging from 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.5 using data from the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Survey (H-ATLAS). We use the spectral energy distribution fitting tool MAGPHYS and a stacking analysis to investigate the evolution of dust mass and temperature of far-infrared-selected galaxies as a function of both luminosity and redshift. At low redshifts, we find that the mass-weighted and luminosity-weighted dust temperatures from the stacking analysis both exhibit a trend for brighter galaxies to have warmer dust. In higher redshift bins, we see some evolution in both mass-weighted and luminosity-weighted dust temperatures with redshift, but the effect is strongest for luminosity-weighted temperature. The measure of dust content in galaxies at z&lt;0.1 (the Dust Mass Function) has a different shape to that derived using optically-selected galaxies from the same region of sky. We revise the local dust mass density (z&lt;0.1) to $\rho_{\rm d} =(1.37\pm0.08)\times 10^5 {\rm\,M_{\odot}\,Mpc^{-3}}\,h_{70}^{-1}$; corresponding to an overall fraction of baryons (by mass) stored in dust of $f_{\rm mb} {(\rm dust)} = (2.22\pm 0.13) \times 10^{-5}$. We confirm evolution in both the luminosity density and dust mass density over the past few billion years ($\rho_{\rm d} \propto (1+z)^{2.6 \pm 0.6}$), with a flatter evolution than observed in previous FIR-selected studies. We attribute the evolution in $\rho_L$ and $\rho_m$ to an evolution in the dust mass.</description>

      <title>Unveiling VVV/WISE Mira variables on the far side of the Galactic disk: Distances, kinematics and a new extinction law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure and kinematics of the Milky Way disk are largely inferred from the solar vicinity. To gain a comprehensive understanding, it is essential to find reliable tracers in less-explored regions like the bulge and the far side of the disk. Mira variables, which are well-studied and bright standard candles, offer an excellent opportunity to trace intermediate and old populations in these complex regions. We aim to isolate a clean sample of Miras in the Vista Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea survey using Gaussian process algorithms. This sample will be used to study intermediate and old age populations in the Galactic bulge and far disk. Near- and mid-infrared time-series photometry were processed using Gaussian Process algorithms to identify Mira variables and model their light curves. We calibrated selection criteria with a visually inspected sample to create a high-purity sample of Miras, integrating multi-band photometry and kinematic data from proper motions. We present a catalog of 3602 Mira variables. By analyzing photometry, we classify them by O-rich or C-rich surface chemistry and derive selective-to-total extinction ratios of $A_{K_{s}}/E(J - K_{s}) = 0.471 \pm 0.01$ and $A_{K_{s}}/E(H - K_{s}) = 1.320 \pm 0.020$. Using the Mira period-age relation, we find evidence supporting the inside-out formation of the Milky Way disk. The distribution of proper motions and distances aligns with the Galactic rotation curve and disk kinematics. We extend the rotation curve up to R$_{\rm GC} \sim 17 \ \rm{kpc}$ and find no strong evidence of the nuclear stellar disk in our Mira sample. This study constitutes the largest catalog of variable stars on the far side of the Galactic disk to date.</description>

      <title>Disc distortion revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the dynamics of razor-thin, stone-cold, self-gravitating discs. By recasting the equations into standard cylindrical coordinates, the linearised vertical dynamics of an exponential disc can be followed for several gigayears on a laptop in a few minutes. An initially warped disc rapidly evolves into a flat inner region and an outward-propagating spiral corrugation wave that rapidly winds up and would quickly thicken a disc with non-zero radial velocity dispersion. The Sgr dwarf galaxy generates a similar warp in the Galactic disc as it passes through pericentre, and the warp generated by the dwarf's last pericentre ~ 35 Myr ago is remarkably similar to the warp traced by the Galaxy's HI disc. The resemblance to the observed warp is fleeting but its timing is perfect. For the adopted parameters the amplitude of the model warp is a factor 3 too small, but there are several reasons for this being so. The marked flaring of our Galaxy's low-alpha disc just outside the solar circle can be explained as a legacy of earlier pericentres.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Mergers in the Epoch of Reionization II: Major Merger-Triggered Star Formation and AGN Activities at $z = 4.5 - 8.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are a key driver of galaxy formation and evolution, including the triggering of AGN and star formation to a still unknown degree. We thus investigate the impact of galaxy mergers on star formation and AGN activity using a sample of 3,330 galaxies at $z = [4.5, 8.5]$ from eight JWST fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, and MACS-0416), collectively covering an unmasked area of 189 arcmin$^2$. We focuses on star formation rate (SFR) enhancement, AGN fraction, and AGN excess in major merger ($\mu &gt; 1/4$) close-pair samples, defined by $\Delta z &lt; 0.3$ and projected separations $r_p &lt; 100$ kpc, compared to non-merger samples. We find that SFR enhancement occurs only at $r_p &lt; 20$ kpc, with values of $0.25 \pm 0.10$ dex and $0.26 \pm 0.11$ dex above the non-merger medians for $z = [4.5, 6.5]$ and $z = [6.5, 8.5]$, respectively. No other statistically significant enhancements in galaxy sSFR or stellar mass are observed at any projected separation or redshift bin. We also compare our observational results with predictions from the SC-SAM simulation and find no evidence of star formation enhancement in the simulations at any separation range. Finally, we examine the AGN fraction and AGN excess, finding that the fraction of AGNs in AGN-galaxy pairs, relative to the total AGN population, is $3.25^{+1.50}_{-1.06}$ times greater than the fraction of galaxy pairs relative to the overall galaxy population at the same redshift. We find that nearly all AGNs have a companion within 100 kpc and observe an excess AGN fraction in close-pair samples compared to non-merger samples. This excess is found to be $1.26 \pm 0.06$ and $1.34 \pm 0.06$ for AGNs identified via the inferred BPT diagram and photometric SED selection, respectively.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE: The Continuum Survey Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration Survey (MIGHTEE) is one of the large survey projects using the MeerKAT telescope, covering four fields that have a wealth of ancillary data available. We present Data Release 1 of the MIGHTEE continuum survey, releasing total intensity images and catalogues over $\sim$20 deg$^2$, across three fields at $\sim$1.2-1.3 GHz. This includes 4.2 deg$^2$ over the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field, 14.4 deg$^2$ over the XMM Large-Scale Structure (XMM-LSS) field and deeper imaging over 1.5 deg$^2$ of the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS). We release images at both a lower resolution (7-9 arcsec) and higher resolution ($\sim 5$ arcsec). These images have central rms sensitivities of $\sim$1.3$-$2.7 $\mu $Jy beam$^{-1}$ ($\sim$1.2$-$3.6 $\mu $Jy beam$^{-1}$) in the lower (higher) resolution images respectively. We also release catalogues comprised of $\sim$144~000 ($\sim$114 000) sources using the lower (higher) resolution images. We compare the astrometry and flux-density calibration with the Early Science data in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields and previous radio observations in the CDFS field, finding broad agreement. Furthermore, we extend the source counts at the $\sim$10 $\mu$Jy level to these larger areas ($\sim 20$ deg$^2$) and, using the areal coverage of MIGHTEE we measure the sample variance for differing areas of sky. We find a typical sample variance of 10-20 per cent for 0.3 and 0.5 sq. deg. sub-regions at $S_{1.4} \leq 200$ $\mu $Jy, which increases at brighter flux densities, given the lower source density and expected higher galaxy bias for these sources.</description>

      <title>Geodesic trajectories for binary systems of supermassive black holes (SMB)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During this work, it is considered a binary system of supermassive rotating black holes; first, it is employed the concept of weak field limit to develop a metric tensor g that describes the geometry of the spacetime, it introduced an approximation in which the second black hole is coupled to the system through a perturbation tensor f, consequently , it is employed a black hole type Sagittarius A to make the numerical calculations; the negative Ricci scalar curvature states that the tensor f does not change the topological properties of Kerr solution. From the metric tensor developed and the scalar of curvature the geodesic trajectories are derived; they determine an orbit with a perigee of 116.4AU and an apogee of 969.67AU, the orbit has a precession of 77.8 seconds per year; and the precession is determined by the rotation of the black holes besides the angular momentum that is the classical parametrization; finally, the average energy is defined by the equation E, this expression parametrizes the energy per orbit in function of the rotation of the black holes, this value is one order of magnitude higher than Newtonian energy</description>

Abstract: We present the mission concept "Mission to Analyze the UltraViolet universE" (MAUVE), a wide-field spectrometer and imager conceived during the inaugural NASA Astrophysics Mission Design School. MAUVE responds to the 2023 Announcement of Opportunity for Probe-class missions, with a budget cap of \$1 billion, and would hypothetically launch in 2031. However, the formulation of MAUVE was an educational exercise and the mission is not being developed further. The Principal Investigator-led science of MAUVE aligns with the priorities outlined in the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey, enabling new characterizations of exoplanet atmospheres, the early-time light curves of some of the universe's most explosive transients, and the poorly-understood extragalactic background light. Because the Principal Investigator science occupies 30% of the observing time available during the mission's 5 yr lifespan, we provide an observing plan that would allow for 70% of the observing time to be used for General Observer programs, with community-solicited proposals. The onboard detector (THISTLE) claims significant heritage from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on Hubble, but extends its wavelength range down to the extreme UV. We note that MAUVE would be the first satellite in decades with the ability to access this regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. MAUVE has a field of view of 900" x 900"  a photometric sensitivity extending to $m_{UV}\leq 24$, and a resolving power of $R\sim1000$. This paper provides full science and mission traceability matrices for this concept, and also outlines cost and scheduling timelines aimed at enabling a within-budget mission and an on-time launch.</description>

      <title>Breaking boundaries: extending the orbit averaged Fokker-Planck equation inside the loss cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a new formulation of loss cone theory as a reaction-diffusion system, which is orbit averaged and accounts for loss cone events through a sink term. This formulation can recover the standard approach based on boundary conditions, and is derived from a simple physical model that overcomes many of the classical theoretical constraints. The relaxed distribution of disruptive orbits in phase space has a simple analytic form, and it predicts accurately the pericentre of tidal disruption events at disruption, better than other available formulas. This formulation of the problem is particularly suitable for including more physics in tidal disruptions and the analogous problem of gravitational captures, e.g. strong scatterings, gravitational waves emission, physical stellar collisions, and repeating partial disruptions - that can all act on timescale shorter than two-body relaxation. This allows to explore in a simple way dynamical effects that might affect tidal disruption events rates, tackling the expected vs observed rate tension and the over-representation of E+A galaxies.</description>

      <title>Chemical Evolution of R-process Elements in Stars (CERES) II. The impact of stellar evolution and rotation on light and heavy elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are the most abundant elements throughout the universe, after hydrogen and helium. Studying these elements in low-metallicity stars can provide crucial information on the chemical composition in the early Galaxy and possible internal mixing processes that can alter the surface composition of the stars. Aims. This work aims to investigate the chemical abundance patterns for CNO elements and Li in a homogeneously analyzed sample of 52 metal-poor halo giant stars. Methods. We used high-resolution spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to carry out a spectral synthesis to derive detailed C, N, O, and Li abundances for a sample of stars with metallicities in the range of -3.58 &lt;= [Fe/H] &lt;= -1.79 dex. Our study was based on the assumption of one-dimensional (1D) local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atmospheres. Results. Based on carbon and nitrogen abundances, we investigated the deep mixing taking place within stars along the red giant branch (RGB). The individual abundances of carbon decrease towards the upper RGB while nitrogen shows an increasing trend, indicating that carbon has been converted into nitrogen. No signatures of ON-cycle processed material were found for the stars in our sample. We computed a set of galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models, implementing different sets of massive star yields, both with and without including the effects of stellar rotation on nucleosynthesis. We confirm that stellar rotation is necessary to explain the highest [N/Fe] and [N/O] ratios observed in unmixed halo stars. The predicted level of N enhancement varies sensibly in dependence of the specific set of yields that are adopted. For stars with stellar parameters similar to those of our sample, heavy elements such as Sr, Y, and Zr appear to have unchanged abundances despite the stellar evolution mixing processes.</description>

      <title>Astronomaly Protege: Discovery Through Human-Machine Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern telescopes generate catalogs of millions of objects with the potential for new scientific discoveries, but this is beyond what can be examined visually. Here we introduce Astronomaly: Protege, an extension of the general purpose machine learning-based active anomaly detection framework Astronomaly. Protege is designed to provide well-selected recommendations for visual inspection, based on a small amount of optimized human labeling. The resulting sample contains rare or unusual sources which are simultaneously as diverse as the human trainer chooses, and of scientific interest to them. We train Protege on images from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey, leveraging the self-supervised deep learning algorithm Bootstrap Your Own Latent to find a low-dimensional representation of the radio galaxy cutouts. By operating in this feature space, Protege is able to recommend interesting sources with completely different morphologies in image space to those it has been trained on. This provides important advantages over similarity searches, which can only find more examples of known sources, or blind anomaly detection, which selects unusual, but not necessarily scientifically interesting sources. Using an evaluation subset, we show that, with minimal training, Protege provides excellent recommendations and find that it is even able to recommend sources that the authors missed. We briefly highlight some of Protege's top recommendations, which include X- and circular-shaped sources, filamentary structures and one-sided structures. These results illustrate the power of an optimized human-machine collaboration such as Protege to make unexpected discoveries in samples beyond human-accessible scales.</description>

      <title>SpectraFM: Tuning into Stellar Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models in astrophysics are often limited in scope and cannot adapt to data from new instruments or tasks. We introduce SpectraFM, a Transformer-based foundation model architecture that can be pre-trained on stellar spectra from any wavelength range and instrument. SpectraFM excels in generalization by combining flexibility with knowledge transfer from pre-training, allowing it to outperform traditional machine learning methods, especially in scenarios with limited training data. Our model is pre-trained on approximately 90k examples of synthetic spectra to predict the chemical abundances (Fe, Mg, O), temperature, and specific gravity of stars. We then fine-tune the model on real spectra to adapt it to observational data before fine-tuning it further on a restricted 100-star training set in a different wavelength range to predict iron abundance. Despite a small iron-rich training set of real spectra, transfer learning from the synthetic spectra pre-training enables the model to perform well on iron-poor stars. In contrast, a neural network trained from scratch fails at this task. We investigate the Transformer attention mechanism and find that the wavelengths receiving attention carry physical information about chemical composition. By leveraging the knowledge from pre-training and its ability to handle non-spectra inputs, SpectraFM reduces the need for large training datasets and enables cross-instrument and cross-domain research. Its adaptability makes it well-suited for tackling emerging challenges in astrophysics, like extracting insights from multi-modal datasets.</description>

Abstract: Hot stars, of spectral types O-, B-, and A-, represent a small fraction of the stars observed by the Gaia satellite. Their properties and the specifications of the on-board instruments make their identification challenging. In the Gaia DR3, 12, 104,577 targets have been assigned a temperature greater than 7500 K. It represents about 2.5 percent of the stars having an effective temperature value in the Gaia DR3 astrophysical parameters table. We review the results obtained by the Apsis modules, focusing on the effective temperature, surface gravity, interstellar extinction, and V sin i parameters.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Theory of Stellar Systems: A Tutorial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar systems - star clusters, galaxies, dark matter haloes, and so on - are ubiquitous characters in the evolutionary tale of our Universe. This tutorial article is an introduction to the collective dynamical evolution of the very large numbers of stars and/or other self-gravitating objects that comprise such systems, i.e. their kinetic theory.
  We begin by introducing the basic phenomenology of stellar systems, and explaining why and when we must develop a kinetic theory that transcends the traditional two-body relaxation picture of Chandrasekhar. We study the orbits that comprise stellar systems, how those orbits are modified by perturbations, how a system responds self-consistently to fluctuations in its gravitational potential, and how one can predict the long term fate of a stellar system in various dynamical regimes. Though our treatment is necessarily mathematical, we develop the formalism only to the extent that it facilitates real calculations. We give many examples throughout the text of the equations being applied to topics of major astrophysical importance.
  Furthermore, in the 1960s and 1970s the kinetic theory of stellar systems was a fledgling subject which developed in tandem with the kinetic theory of plasmas. However, the two fields have long since diverged. Yet once one has become fluent in both Plasmaish and Galacticese, and has a dictionary relating the two, one can pull ideas directly from one field to solve a problem in the other. Therefore, another aim of this tutorial article is to provide our plasma colleagues with a jargon-light understanding of the key properties of stellar systems, to point out the many direct analogies between stellar- and plasma-kinetic calculations, and ultimately to convince them that stellar dynamics and plasma kinetics are, in a deep and beautiful and useful sense, the same thing.</description>

      <title>Evidence for large scale compressible turbulence in the ism of CSWA13, a star-Forming Lensed Galaxy at z = 1.87 with outflowing wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Keerthi Vasan G. et al.(2024 presented spatially resolved observations of a wind outflow in CSWA13, a gravitationally lensed Star-Forming galaxy at z = 1.87. The gravitational lensing allowed for a substantially improved spatial and kinematic resolution of the wind and of the nebular gas. In this paper we take advantage of the resolved data to test for the existence of turbulence and to study its nature.We obtained the autocorrelation functions of the two velocity fields, and derived the spatial structure functions of the residual nebular and wind velocities along the major axis of the galaxy. The structure functions, of both velocity fields, reveal the existence of an underlying Burgers power spectrum scaling. This scaling suggests the existence of supersonic compressible turbulence. The autocorrelation functions exhibit correlations over scales comparable to the total extent of the velocity fields. Thus, the turbulence is a large scale one. The turbulent timescale corresponding to the largest scale is about 200 Myr, an order of magnitude larger than the estimated age of the wind and of the young stars. This implies that the turbulence in the ism formed well before the wind and the young stars. Given the large spatial scale of the turbulence, it is plausible that the source of the turbulence is a large scale one e.g. a merger or tidal event that triggered the formation of molecular clouds, in the cores of which, the young stars formed. A steepening of the structure functions on the smaller scales provides an estimate for the effective depth along the line of sight of the turbulent layer. The latter turns out to be about 2kpc</description>

      <title>Formation of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Black Holes and Red Stragglers via Hawking Stars in Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presently, primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window from $10^{-16}$ M$_\odot$ to $10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ are a popular dark matter candidate. If they exist, some stars would capture them upon formation, and they would slowly accrete the star over gigayears. Such Hawking stars -- stars with a central PBH -- provide a novel channel for the formation of both sub-Chandrasekhar mass black holes as well as red straggler stars. Here we report on stellar evolution models that extend our previous work to Hawking stars with masses between 0.5 and 1.4 M$_\odot$. We explore three accretion schemes, and find that a wide range of PBHs in the asteroid-mass window can robustly accrete stars as small as 1 M$_\odot$ within the age of the Universe. This mechanism of producing sub-solar mass black holes is highly dependent on the assumed accretion physics and stellar metallicity. Lower-metallicity stars are generally accreted more rapidly, suggesting that it may be more likely for sub-Chandrasekhar mass Hawking stars formed in the early universe, such as those in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, to transmute their star into a sub-Chandrasekhar mass black hole within a Hubble time. We present a stellar population synthesis of a Draco II-like UFD galaxy containing Hawking stars and show that the number of red stragglers they produce can qualitatively match the observed population \mb{for black hole seed masses around 10$^{-11}$ M$_\odot$ and under the assumption that they accrete with high radiative efficiency}.</description>

      <title>Velocity and acceleration fluctuations in dark matter and dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05606v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Illustris and Virgo N-body simulations, we study the velocity and acceleration fluctuations in collisionless dark matter involving long-range gravity. By contrast, in the kinetic theory of gases, molecules undergo elastic collisions involving short-range interactions, where only velocity fluctuations are relevant. Long-range gravity requires a broad size of haloes to be formed. Hierarchical structure formation proceeds through the merging of smaller haloes to form larger haloes, which facilitates a continuous energy cascade from small to large haloes at a constant rate of $\varepsilon_u\approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$. Velocity fluctuations involve a critical velocity $u_c\propto (1+z)^{-3/4}$, and acceleration fluctuations involve a critical acceleration $a_c\propto (1+z)^{3/4}$. The two quantities are related as $\varepsilon_{u}\approx -a_c u_c/(18\pi^2)$. With critical velocity $u_c$ on the order of 300km/s at $z=0$, the critical acceleration is found to be $a_{c0}\equiv a_c(z=0) \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ at $z=0$ that is higher at higher redshift. This suggests that the critical acceleration $a_c$ might explain the universal acceleration $a_0 \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ in the empirical Tully-Fisher relation and modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). The predicted redshift evolution of $a_0 \propto (1+z)^{3/4}$ can be validated by Magneticum and EAGLE simulations. High-redshift Tully-Fisher relation will provide more insight. Finally, note that dark energy density $\rho_{DE}\approx {a_{c0}^{2}/G}=10^{-10}$J/m$^3$, we postulate an entropic origin of dark energy from the acceleration fluctuations in dark matter. A $\nu_0\nu_a$CDM model was proposed for the evolution of dynamical dark energy. When compared to the $w_0w_a$CDM model with constraints from DESI (2024), this model suggests a constant density at high redshift and a slower power-law weakening density at low redshift.</description>

      <title>Testing the framework of the halo occupation distribution with assembly bias modeling and empirical extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretical systematics caused by the application of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) to the study of galaxy clustering at non-linear scales. To do this, we repeat recent cosmological analyses using extended HOD models based on both the Aemulus and Aemulus $\nu$ simulation suites, allowing for variations in the dark matter halo shape, incompleteness, baryonic effects and position bias of central galaxies. We fit to the galaxy correlation function including the projected correlation function, redshift space monopole and quadrupole, and consider how the changes in HOD affect the retrieval of cosmological information. These extensions can be understood as an evaluation of the impact of the secondary bias in the clustering analysis. In the application of BOSS galaxies, these changes do not have a significant impact on the measured linear growth rate. But, we do find weak to mild evidence for some of the effects modeled by the empirical parameterizations adopted. The modeling is able to make the HOD approach more complete in terms of cosmological constraints. We anticipate that the future and better data can provide tighter constraints on the new prescriptions of the HOD model.</description>
