      <title>Data-Augmented Resolvent Analysis of Wall-Bounded High-Pressure Transcritical Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-pressure transcritical fluid flows are central to modern energy and propulsion systems. A key challenge lies in confined configurations, where optimizing performance requires a deep understanding of the coupled hydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonlinearities that govern such flows. In this regard, low-order decomposition techniques offer an interpretable framework to quantify how nonlinear forcings drive coherent responses and amplify key flow structures. This work, thus, pursues two main objectives: establish a resolvent-based framework tailored to high-pressure transcritical fluid flows, and characterize the spatio-temporal sensitivity of the resolvent operator using data-driven turbulent base flows. These analyses identify the flow responses and forcings that optimally enhance mixing and heat transfer, along with their characteristic scales. The results of the resolvent framework reveals that amplification is dominated by streamwise-elongated structures with spanwise periodicity, associated with peak singular values near spanwise wavenumbers of order unity. Unlike ideal-gas or incompressible/isothermal flows, the dominant forcings arise from thermodynamic fluctuations in the pseudo-boiling region. Moreover, when the turbulent mean flow is used as input, this results in intensified responses manifesting as coherent counter-rotating vortex pairs. The energetic scale motions are constrained by the nature of the low-Reynolds-number regime considered, with a single dominant spectral mode reaching streamwise lengths comparable to those in the instantaneous fields. Data-driven analyses further reveal coherent structures propagating at phase speeds absent from classical incompressible wall-bounded turbulence. These structures are intensified near the pseudo-boiling region and constrained toward the hot wall, in strong agreement with resolvent-mode predictions of near-wall scale motions.</description>

      <title>Cross-Model Verification of Wall-Bounded Flows using Finite-JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of wall-bounded flows remains central to advancing both theoretical understanding and computational methods in fluid mechanics. In this study, we perform a numerical simulation of channel flow using a complementary approach: a high-performance, differentiable finite-difference solver developed in JAX (Finite-JAX) and an analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes Equations, also referred to as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The solver is applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, along with appropriate boundary conditions, to capture canonical flow features such as velocity profiles and pressure gradients. Cross-model verification is conducted by systematically comparing numerical results between Finite-JAX and the analytical solution, with a focus on velocity distributions. In addition, numerical results are benchmarked against analytical solutions for laminar regimes, allowing for the direct quantification of verification accuracy errors. Our findings demonstrate that cross-model verification not only strengthens confidence in simulation fidelity but also provides a pathway for integrating differentiable solvers with established computational fluid dynamics platforms, paving the way for future fluid flow research.</description>

      <title>Stretching water between two grooves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling water motion on surfaces is critical for applications ranging from thermal management, passive water harvesting, to self-cleaning coatings. Yet stabilising continuous water films, desirable for their high surface coverage and drainage capacity, remains challenging with pure water, due to its high surface tension. Existing strategies rely on extreme wettability achieved by coating or fine-scale patterning, which are costly, fragile, or complex to scale. A robust, purely geometric solution is still lacking. We demonstrate that a pair of laser-engraved grooves on a moderately hydrophilic vertical substrate can laterally anchor water and stretch a continuous thin film, without any other surface treatment. Once stabilised, the film extends vertically over 100 capillary lengths (&gt; 30cm), with thickness tunable via both flow rate and groove geometry. At the groove extremities, the end of anchoring triggers a cyclic instability, characterised by film rupture, retraction, and droplet release. The thickness of the film and retraction height obey predictive models, while droplet mass varies systematically with spacing and surface tension. This groove-based method offers a straightforward and scalable approach to creating, sustaining, and controlling thin water films. It opens new directions for passive liquid control in condensation, surface cleaning, and 2D millifluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Droplets sliding on single and multiple vertical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From microfluidics to fog-harvesting applications, tiny droplets are transported along various solid substrates including hairs, threads, grooves, and other light structures. Driven by gravity, a droplet sliding along a vertical fiber is a complex problem since it is losing volume and speed as it goes down. With the help of an original setup, we solve this problem by tracking in real-time droplet characteristics and dynamics. Single fibers as well as multiple fiber systems are studied to consider the presence of grooves. On both fibers and grooved threads, droplet speed and volume are seen to decay rapidly because the liquid entity is leaving a thin film behind. This film exerts a capillary force able to stop the droplet motion before it is completely drained. A model is proposed to capture the droplet dynamics. We evidence also that multiple vertical fibers are enhancing the droplet speed while simultaneously promoting increased liquid loss on grooves.</description>

      <title>High Resolution and High-Speed Live Optical Flow Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is the most widely used optical technique for measuring two-dimensional velocity fields in fluids. However, with the standard cross-correlation (CC) algorithm, improving the spatial resolution of instantaneous velocity fields and obtaining dense velocity fields in real time remains challenging. Optical Flow Velocimetry (OFV) offers a way to overcome these limitations. In this study, we demonstrate that dense velocity fields (one vector per pixel) with high spatial resolution can be obtained in real time at frequencies up to thousands of Hertz using an optical flow approach. We show that high resolution is achievable with optimized seeding, and that computational speed can be increased by choosing appropriate parameters and running on a single GPU. Using this method, 21 Mp velocity fields can be computed in real-time at 90 Hz, while 4 Mp velocity fields can be computed up to of 460 Hz. These measurements enable the computation of various flow quantities in real time, during the experiment. It makes this technique perfectly suitable for many new type of experiments, from closed-loop flow control experiments based on OFV measurements, to very low frequency measurements or monitoring of the flow to find rare events. They also greatly accelerate post-processing leading to potential large time and energy gain for post-processing.</description>

      <title>Rare-event detection in a backward-facing-step flow using live optical-flow velocimetry: observation of an upstream jet burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare and extreme events in turbulent flows play a critical role in transport, mixing and transition, yet are notoriously difficumt to capture experimentally. Here we report, to our knowledge, the first direct experimental detection of an upstream-directed jet burst in a backward-facing step (BFS) flow at $Re_h=2100$, using long-duration Live Optical Flow Velocimetry (L-OFV). Continuous monitoring over 1.5 h enabled a data-driven definition of extremes as rare velocity probes excursions deep into the observed distribution's tails; in practice, large negatice events ($u: Z &lt; -6$, $v: Z &lt; -5$ at $(x,y) = (2h,h / 2)$, where $|Z| &gt; &gt; 0$ stands for large deviations form the mean value) triggered the live capture of surrounding velocity fields. The recording is triggered when the probes surpass the defined threshold, using live analysis of the velocity fields. The detected event features a jet-like intrusino into the recirculation region initiated by the collapse of a merged Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex and sustained by counter-rotating vortices, and is accompanied with heavy-tailed probe statistics and simultaneous amplufucation of fluctuating kinetic energy and enstrophy. While a single event was recorded, underscoring its rarity, the results establish L-OFV as aviable platform for rare-event detection in separated shear layers and document a previously unreported mechanism of upstream jet bursting in BFS flow.</description>

      <title>WAN3DNS: Weak Adversarial Networks for Solving 3D Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations model essential fluid phenomena, including turbulence and aerodynamics, but are challenging to solve due to nonlinearity and limited solution regularity. Despite extensive research, the full mathematical understanding of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations continues to elude scientists, highlighting the depth and difficulty of the problem. Classical solvers are costly, and neural network-based methods typically assume strong solutions, limiting their use in underresolved regimes. We introduce WAN3DNS, a weak-form neural solver that recasts the equations as a minimax optimization problem, allowing learning directly from weak solutions. Using the weak formulation, WAN3DNS circumvents the stringent differentiability requirements of classical physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and accommodates scenarios where weak solutions exist, but strong solutions may not. We evaluated WAN3DNS's accuracy and effectiveness in three benchmark cases: the 2D Kovasznay, 3D Beltrami, and 3D lid-driven cavity flows. Furthermore, using Galerkin's theory, we conduct a rigorous error analysis and show that the $L^{2}$ training error is controllably bounded by the architectural parameters of the network and the norm of residues. This implies that for neural networks with small loss, the corresponding $L^{2}$ error will also be small. This work bridges the gap between weak solution theory and deep learning, offering a robust alternative for complex fluid flow simulations with reduced regularity constraints.

      <title>Localised Arrowheads: The building blocks of elastic turbulence in rectilinear, sheared polymer flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure-driven flow of a dilute polymer solution has been numerically observed to possess a form of elastic turbulence which is organised around the interactions of localised versions of 2-dimensional `arrowhead' travelling waves (Page et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 154501, 2020). As a step to confirming this theoretically, we identify spanwise-localised arrowhead travelling waves by tracking a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the known spanwise-invariant (2D) arrowhead to a spanwise-periodic state and then discovering a secondary modulational instability to a spanwise-localised travelling wave. Spanwise-symmetric and asymmetric localised arrowheads exist with the latter having a phase speed slightly inclined to the streamwise direction. Computations capture the flow randomly switching between spanwise local and global arrowhead states in a streamwise-restricted domain, suggesting they form the building blocks of the chaos. Splitting events are also seen, in which a single localised state spawns multiple arrowheads. However, both cross-shear and spanwise velocities are small suggesting that this elastic turbulence will not be a good mixer.</description>

      <title>Reservoir computing based predictive reduced order model for steel grade intermixing in an industrial continuous casting tundish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous casting is a widely adopted process in the steel industry, where maintaining high steel quality is paramount. Efficient prediction of grade intermixing during ladle changeover operations is critical for maintaining steel quality and minimizing material losses in the continuous casting process. Among various factors influencing grade intermixing, operating parameters play a significant role, in addition to tundish geometry and flow control devices. In this study, three-dimensional, transient, two-phase turbulent flow simulations are conducted to investigate the ladle changeover operation. During this process, the molten steel level in the tundish typically varies over time, significantly affecting the grade intermixing phenomena. The influence of ladle change time on intermixing time has been presented. However, high-fidelity full-order simulations of such complex transient phenomena are computationally expensive and are impractical for real-time monitoring or design-space exploration in industrial-scale applications. To address this issue, a reduced order modelling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reservoir computing (RC) is employed to efficiently predict intermixing time. The proposed reduced order model (ROM) demonstrates excellent predictive accuracy using limited training data while requiring significantly less computational resources and training time. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology as a fast, reliable tool for real-time process monitoring and optimization in industrial continuous casting operations.</description>

      <title>A Three-dimensional Edge-Based Interface Tracking (EBIT) Method for Multiphase-flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Edge-Based Interface Tracking (EBIT) method is a novel Front-Tracking method where the markers are located on grid edges, and their connectivity is implicitly represented by a color vertex field. This localized representation simplifies the process of topology changes and allows for almost automatic parallelization. In our previous journal articles, we have presented both the kinematic part, includes the algorithms for advection of the interface and color vertex field evolution, and the dynamic part, which couples the EBIT method with the Navier--Stokes equations for multiphase flow simulations, in the two-dimensional (2D) case.
  In this work, we propose a simplified strategy to extend the EBIT method to three dimensions (3D). The directional split scheme used for interface advection in 2D version is directly generalized to 3D. Specifically, the 3D advection within a given cubic cell along one direction is decomposed into two 2D advection problems on the two cube faces. The dimension reduction allows us to fully reused the 2D interface reconstruction algorithms, including the 2D circle fit and the evolution rules for the color vertex field.
  For coupling with the Navier--Stokes equations, we first calculate volume fractions from the position of the markers and the color vertex field using the Front2VOF geometrical method, then viscosity and density fields from the computed volume fractions, and finally surface tension stresses with the Height-Function method. The 3D EBIT method has been implemented in the free Basilisk platform and validated against five benchmark cases: translation with uniform velocity, 3D deformation test, oscillating drop, rising bubble, and bubble merging. The results are compared with those obtained using the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method already implemented in Basilisk.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically driven, environmentally adaptive, and functionally switchable hydrodynamic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials provide exceptional control over physical phenomena, enabling many disruptive technologies. However, researches in hydrodynamic meta-devices have mainly used intrusive methods to manipulate material structures, limited by material properties and specific environmental conditions. Each design serves a single function, reducing versatility. This study introduces a meta-hydrodynamics theory using applied force fields to avoid physical contact with the fluid and eliminate the need for inhomogeneous and anisotropic metamaterials, allowing continuous switching between cloaking, shielding, and Venturi amplification. The force field operates independently of the fluid's physical properties, making it adaptable to various fluids and environmental conditions. We derive volumetric force distributions for hydrodynamic devices based on fluid properties and forces equivalence, using the integral median theorem to homogenize these forces for practical applications. The effectiveness of the proposed hydrodynamic devices is validated through numerical simulations and quantitative analyses. By utilizing the electromagnetic forces produced by the interaction between a conducting fluid and an electromagnetic field, we experimentally verified the validity of our theoretical simulations. Our research offers different insights into hydrodynamic meta-devices design, enhancing practical applications and opening avenues for innovative flow manipulation.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Thermohaline Convection With a Time-Varying Shear Flow Using the Lyapunov Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work identifies instabilities and computes the growth rate of a linear time-varying system using the Lyapunov method. The linear system describes cold fresh water on top of hot salty water with a periodically time-varying background shear flow. We employ a time-dependent weighting matrix to construct a Lyapunov function candidate, and the resulting linear matrix inequalities formulation is discretized in time using the forward Euler method. As the number of temporal discretization points increases, the growth rate predicted from the Lyapunov method or the Floquet theory will converge to the same value as that obtained from numerical simulations. We also use the Lyapunov method to analyze the instantaneous principal direction of instabilities and compare the computational resources required by the Lyapunov method, numerical simulations, and the Floquet theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we propose a basic $L^2$-based approach for studying the global and local energy equalities of the incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes equations in the standard energy class on $\mathbb{T}^3 \times (0,T]$. Motivated by L. Onsager's principle of least dissipation of energy (1931), we give a new sufficient condition for the energy equalities in terms of the limit of a sequence of minimizers. In particular, we show that the equalities are attained if this limit is non-vanishing. We observe that the indeterminacy in the vanishing case is reminiscent of turbulence-driven energy transfer dominating other transport processes.</description>

      <title>Sensor optimization for urban wind estimation with cluster-based probabilistic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4) an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates. This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian statistics of concentration fluctuations in free liquid diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the three-point skewness of concentration fluctuations is non-vanishing in free liquid diffusion, even in the limit of vanishingly small mean concentration gradients. We exploit a high-Schmidt reduction of nonlinear Landau-Lifshitz hydrodynamics for a binary fluid, both analytically and by a massively parallel Lagrangian Monte Carlo simulation. Non-Gaussian statistics result from nonlinear coupling of concentration fluctuations to thermal velocity fluctuations, analogous to the turbulent advection of a passive scalar. Concentration fluctuations obey no central limit theorem, counter to the predictions of macroscopic fluctuation theory for generic diffusive systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft and frangible materials that remodel under flow can give rise to branched patterns shaped by material properties, boundary conditions, and the time scales of forcing. We present a general theoretical framework for emergent branching in these frangible (or threshold) materials that switch abruptly from resisting flow to permitting flow once local stresses exceed a threshold, relevant for ex- amples as varied as dielectric breakdown of insulators and the erosion of soft materials. Simulations in 2D and 3D show that branching is adaptive and tunable via boundary conditions and domain geometry, offering a foundation for self-organized engineering of functional transport architectures.</description>

      <title>Coupled Flow-Thermal Analysis of a Rocket Nozzle with Charring Ablative Thermal Protection System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a conjugate flow-thermal analysis of a rocket nozzle protected by a charring ablative thermal protection system (TPS). The study employs a coupled approach, integrating a CFD solver with an in-house transient material response code through the exchange of boundary conditions at the fluid-solid interface. The nozzle incorporates an AVCOAT TPS and is subjected to high-temperature compressible flow. Results identify the nozzle throat as the critical location, exhibiting the highest convective loading, early attainment of the material ablation temperature, and progressive surface recession. Temporal analysis of the coupled simulations reveals an initial peak in wall heat flux followed by a transient reduction and a subsequent resurgence as viscous dissipation and evolving surface conditions modify the near-wall thermal field. At 120 s of simulated operation, the maximum surface recession at the throat is approximately 2.5 mm. This research provides a methodology for predicting the thermal and ablative response of rocket nozzles equipped with charring TPS materials. The proposed framework offers valuable insights into the design and optimization of high-performance nozzles for extreme environments.</description>

      <title>GLONET: Mercator's end-to-end neural Global Ocean forecasting system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting is crucial in different areas ranging from science to decision making. Recent advancements in data-driven models have shown significant promise, particularly in weather forecasting community, but yet no data-driven approaches have matched the accuracy and the scalability of traditional global ocean forecasting systems that rely on physics-driven numerical models and can be very computationally expensive, depending on their spatial resolution or complexity. Here, we introduce GLONET, a global ocean neural network-based forecasting system, developed by Mercator Ocean International. GLONET is trained on the global Mercator Ocean physical reanalysis GLORYS12 to integrate physics-based principles through neural operators and networks, which dynamically capture local-global interactions within a unified, scalable framework, ensuring high small-scale accuracy and efficient dynamics. GLONET's performance is assessed and benchmarked against two other forecasting systems: the global Mercator Ocean analysis and forecasting 1/12 high-resolution physical system GLO12 and a recent neural-based system also trained from GLORYS12. A series of comprehensive validation metrics is proposed, specifically tailored for neural network-based ocean forecasting systems, which extend beyond traditional point-wise error assessments that can introduce bias towards neural networks optimized primarily to minimize such metrics. The preliminary evaluation of GLONET shows promising results, for temperature, sea surface height, salinity and ocean currents. GLONET's experimental daily forecast are accessible through the European Digital Twin Ocean platform EDITO.</description>

      <title>Transition to inverse cascade in turbulent rotating convection in absence of the large-scale vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent convection under strong rotation can develop an inverse cascade of kinetic energy from smaller to larger scales. In the absence of an effective dissipation mechanism at the large scales, this leads to the pile-up of kinetic energy at the largest available scale, yielding a system-wide large-scale vortex (LSV). Earlier works have shown that the transition into this state is abrupt and discontinuous. Here, we study the transition to the inverse cascade at Ekman number $\textrm{Ek}=10^{-4}$ and using stress-free boundary conditions, in the case where the inverse energy flux is dissipated before it reaches the system scale, suppressing the LSV formation. We demonstrate how this can be achieved in direct numerical simulations by using an adapted form of hypoviscosity on the horizontal manifold. We find that in the absence of the LSV, the transition to the inverse cascade becomes continuous. This shows that it is the interaction between the LSV and the background turbulence that is responsible for the earlier observed discontinuity. We furthermore show that the inverse cascade in absence of the LSV has a more local signature compared to the case with LSV.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 3. Bifurcations of many (additional) unstable periodic orbits and their dynamical relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertical thermal convection system exhibits weak turbulence and spatio-temporally chaotic behaviour. In this system, we report seven equilibria and 26 periodic orbits, all new and linearly unstable. These orbits, together with four previously studied in Zheng et al. (2024b) bring the number of periodic orbit branches computed so far to 30, all solutions to the fully non-linear three-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations. These new invariant solutions capture intricate spatio-temporal flow patterns including straight, oblique, wavy, skewed and distorted convection rolls, as well as bursts and defects in rolls. These interesting and important fluid mechanical processes in a small flow unit are shown to appear locally and instantaneously in a chaotic simulation in a large domain. Most of the solution branches show rich spatial and/or spatio-temporal symmetries. The bifurcation-theoretic organisation of these solutions is discussed; the bifurcation scenarios include Hopf, pitchfork, saddle--node, period-doubling, period-halving, global homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations, as well as isolas. These orbits are shown to be able to reconstruct statistically the core part of the attractor, and these results may pave the way to quantitatively describing transitional fluid turbulence using periodic orbit theory.</description>

      <title>Interpolation-supplemented lattice Boltzmann simulation of thermal convection on non-uniform meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic evaluation of an interpolation-supplemented lattice Boltzmann method (ISLBM) for simulating buoyancy-driven thermal convection on non-uniform meshes. The ISLBM extends the standard lattice Boltzmann framework by incorporating quadratic interpolation during the streaming step, enabling flexible mesh refinement near solid boundaries while maintaining algorithmic simplicity and parallel scalability. The method is implemented for a two-dimensional side-heated cavity at high Rayleigh numbers $10^6\leq Ra \leq 10^8$, and for a three-dimensional side-heated cavity at $10^5\leq Ra \leq 10^7$, with the Prandtl number fixed at $Pr=0.71$. Benchmark results show that the ISLBM accurately captures thermal and velocity boundary layers, yielding Nusselt and Reynolds numbers in close agreement with high-fidelity reference data. Grid-convergence studies demonstrate nearly third-order accuracy for global quantities and about second-order for local fields. We further assess the computational performance of the in-house LBM solver against two open-source solvers: Nek5000 based on the spectral element method, and OpenFOAM based on the finite volume method. Performance metrics, including million lattice updates per second (MLUPS) and wall-clock time per dimensionless time unit (WCTpDT), indicate that the ISLBM offers one to three orders of magnitude higher efficiency in large-scale simulations. On GPU architectures, the ISLBM retains high computational performance: throughput on non-uniform meshes reaches 60-70% of that on uniform meshes in terms of MLUPS, while the cost in WCTpDT is about three times higher. These results highlight the potential of interpolation-based LBM approaches for high-fidelity simulations of thermal convection on non-uniform meshes, providing a robust foundation for future extensions to turbulent flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the Kazantsev theory of small-scale dynamo generation at small Prandtl numbers near the generation threshold and restore the concordance between the theory and numerical simulations: the theory predicted a power-law decay below the threshold, while simulations demonstrate exponential decay. We show that the exponential decay is temporary and owes its existence to the flattening of the velocity correlator at large scales. This effect corresponds to the existence of a long-living virtual level in the corresponding Schrodinger type equation. We also find the critical Reynolds number and the increment of growth/decay above and under the threshold; we express them in terms of the quantitative characteristic properties of the velocity correlator, which makes it possible to compare the results with the data of different simulations.</description>

      <title>Super resonance: Breaking the bandwidth limit of resonant modes and its application to flow control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of super resonance--a new regime of resonant behavior in which a mode's out-of-phase response persists far beyond its classical bandwidth. This effect emerges from a coiled phononic structure composed of a locally resonant elastic metamaterial and architected to support multiple internal energy pathways. These pathways converge at a single structural location, enabling extended modal dominance and significantly broadening the frequency range over which a resonant phase is sustained. We demonstrate by direct numerical simulations the implications of this mechanism in the context of flow instability control, where current approaches are inherently constrained by the characteristically narrow spectral bandwidth of conventional resonances. Using a super-resonant phononic subsurface structure interfacing with a channel flow, we show passive simultaneous suppression of four unstable flow perturbations across a frequency range more than five times wider than that is achievable with a standard resonance in an equivalent uncoiled structure. By enabling broadband, passive control of flow instabilities, super resonance overcomes a longstanding limitation in laminar flow control strategies. More broadly, it introduces a powerful new tool for phase-engineered wave-matter interaction. The ability to preserve out-of-phase modal response across wide spectral ranges establishes a fundamental advance in the physics of resonance, with far-reaching implications for suppressing fully developed turbulent flows and beyond.</description>

      <title>Crow instability of vortex lines in dipolar superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical inviscid fluids, antiparallel vortices perturbed by Kelvin waves exhibit the Crow instability, where the mutual interaction of the Kelvin modes renders them dynamically unstable. This results in the approach and reconnection of the vortices, leading to a cascaded decay into ever-smaller vortex loops. Through mean-field simulations we study the Crow instability of quantum vortex lines in a superfluid whose atoms are subject to the anisotropic, long-ranged dipole-dipole interaction. We observe that the direction of dipole polarization plays a crucial role in determining the dynamically favored Kelvin modes. The subsequent rate of the instability is linked to the mediation of the vortex curvature by the effective dipole-dipole interaction between the vortices themselves. The vortex curvature is strongly suppressed and modes of lower wavenumber are preferred when the dipole polarization is parallel to the vortices, whereas the curvature is maximized for polarizations along the vortices' separation axis. For polarizations along the binormal axis, modes of higher wavenumber are favorable but the instability rate is considerably inhibited. This paves the way to a deeper understanding of vortex reconnections, vortex loop cascades and turbulence in dipolar superfluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose mesh-free fluid simulations that exploit a kinematic neural basis for velocity fields represented by an MLP. We design a set of losses that ensures that these neural bases approximate fundamental physical properties such as orthogonality, divergence-free, boundary alignment, and smoothness. Our neural bases can then be used to fit an input sketch of a flow, which will inherit the same fundamental properties from the bases. We then can animate such flow in real-time using standard time integrators. Our neural bases can accommodate different domains, moving boundaries, and naturally extend to three dimensions.</description>
