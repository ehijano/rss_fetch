      <title>Simulating Moving Contact Lines in Three-Phase Suspensions Using a Front Tracking Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-phase multiphase flows are found in an extraordinarily large number of applications. Often those involve a liquid phase and a gas phase in addition to a third phase that consists of either liquid drops or solid particles, suspended in the flow. Frequently the third phase is in contact with both the liquid and the gas, resulting in a contact line where all the phases meet. Here, we present an extension of a front tracking method, where the interface between two fluid phases is followed using connected marker points, to simulate the motion of triple contact lines for both three fluids systems and systems containing two fluids and suspended solid particles. We describe two related strategies, one where the contact line is tracked explicitly and one where it is captured implicitly, and show that both approaches achieve comparable accuracy. The second approach is, however, easier to implement, particularly for three-dimensional flows. For both tracked and untracked approaches for solid particles, and for the untracked three fluids case, we use a ``virtual interface,'' where the boundary of a liquid phase is extended into either another fluid or the solid. For three fluids systems the surface tension of the virtual interface is zero, but for systems with solids the surface tension of the virtual interface is the same as that of the physical interface.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of vorticity moments in shell models of turbulence: A comparison with the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shell models allow much greater scale separations than those presently achievable with direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. Consequently, they are an invaluable tool for testing new concepts and ideas in the theory of fully developed turbulence. They also successfully display energy cascades and intermittency in homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flows. Moreover, they are also of great interest to mathematical analysts because, while retaining some of the key features of the Euler and the Navier-Stokes equations, they are much more tractable. A comparison of the mathematical properties of shell models and of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations is therefore essential in understanding the correspondence between the two systems. Here we focus on the temporal evolution of the moments, or $L^{2m}$-norms, of the vorticity. Specifically, differential inequalities for the moments of the vorticity in shell models are derived. The contribution of the nonlinear term turns out to be much weaker than its equivalent for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Consequently, pointwise-in-time estimates are shown to exist for the vorticity moments for shell models of any order. This result is also recovered via a high-low frequency slaving argument that highlights the scaling relations between vorticity moments of different orders. Finally, it is shown that the estimates for shell models formally correspond to those for the Navier-Stokes equations 'on a point'.</description>

      <title>Collision Dynamics and Deformation Behaviors of Multi-Core Compound Droplet Pairs in Microchannel Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the collision dynamics and deformation behaviors of double-core compound droplet pairs within confined shear flows using free-energy-based lattice Boltzmann method. While significant research has advanced our understanding of simple droplet pair interactions, the collision behaviors of core-shell compound droplets, where each shell contains one or more core droplets, remain largely unexplored. Even the pairwise interaction of single-core compound droplets has not been extensively studied. We address how the interplay between physical parameters (i.e., density and viscosity ratios of immiscible fluids and Capillary number) and geometric parameters (i.e., initial offset distance between the shell droplets) affects the interaction time and collision outcomes of compound droplets. Our findings reveal that the presence of inner droplets significantly influences the deformation and stability of shell droplets, as well as the collision outcomes of both shell and core droplets. We identify several distinct collision outcomes, including (i) coalescence of shell droplets, with core droplets remaining separate and rotating in a planetary-like motion, (ii) pass-over of shell droplets, where core droplets maintain separation and exhibit both rotational and translational motion, (iii) coalescence of core droplets, with shell droplets passing each other, and (iv) pass-over of shell droplets, with the coalescence of core droplets. We demonstrate that the transition between these collision outcomes is governed by varying the Capillary number and initial offset. Additionally, we observed that increasing the density and viscosity ratios from unity to larger values always results in the pass-over of shell droplets, with the core droplets remain separated and experience rotational motion.</description>

      <title>Design of a variable-Mach-number waverider by the osculating-curved-cone method using a rational distribution function and incorporating the equilibrium-gas model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a waverider flies at hypersonic speed, the thermodynamic properties of the surrounding gas change because of the rapid increase in temperature, so it is reasonable to consider real-gas effects in the vehicle design. In addition, a hypersonic waverider usually travels at varying speed during flight, and deviating from the default speed designed in terms of a constant Mach number often creates difficulties in preserving the expected performance. Therefore, research on the design of variable-Mach-number waveriders considering equilibrium-gas effects is important for applications. In this paper, a design method for a variable-Mach-number osculating-curved-cone waverider (VMOCCW) considering equilibrium-gas effects is introduced, then the influences of different gas models on the waverider design are studied by taking a VMOCCW designed with a linear Mach-number distribution as an example. Furthermore, a new Mach-number distribution method is proposed by using a parameterized rational function, which is combined with different gas models to achieve VMOCCW design. For comparison, waveriders designed with quadratic concave and convex increasing functions are also selected for comparison of their layouts and aerodynamic performances under design and off-design conditions. The results show that waveriders designed with the equilibrium-gas model exhibit differences in geometric features (e.g., volume and volumetric efficiency) and aerodynamic characteristics (e.g., lift-to-drag ratio and pitching moment coefficient) compared to those designed with the ideal-gas model. Specifically, waveriders designed with a rational function for the Ma distribution have a wing-like structure, and overall they have more-balanced geometric and aerodynamic characteristics than those designed with quadratic concave and convex functions.</description>

      <title>Efficient methods for particle-resolved direct numerical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present chapter we focus on the fundamentals of non-grid-conforming numerical approaches to simulating particulate flows, implementation issues and grid convergence vs. available reference data. The main idea is to avoid adapting the mesh (and - as much as possible - the discrete operators) to the time-dependent fluid domain with the aim to maximize computational efficiency. We restrict our attention to spherical particle shapes (while deviations from sphericity are treated in a subsequent chapter). We show that similar ideas can be successfully implemented in a variety of underlying fluid flow solvers, leading to powerful tools for the direct numerical simulation of large particulate systems.</description>

      <title>Automatic extraction of wall streamlines from oil-flow visualizations using a convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oil-flow visualizations represent a simple means to reveal time-averaged wall streamline patterns. Yet, the evaluation of such images can be a time-consuming process and is subjective to human perception. In this study, we present a fast and robust method to obtain quantitative insight based on qualitative oil-flow visualizations. Using a convolutional neural network, the local flow direction is predicted based on the oil-flow texture. This was achieved with supervised training based on an extensive dataset involving approximately one million image patches that cover variations of the flow direction, the wall shear-stress magnitude and the oil-flow mixture. For a test dataset that is distinct from the training data, the mean prediction error of the flow direction is as low as three degrees. A reliable performance is also noted when the model is applied to oil-flow visualizations from the literature, demonstrating the generalizability required for an application in diverse flow configurations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing pulsed blowing parameters for active separation control in a one-sided diffuser using reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is employed to optimize the periodic forcing signal of a pulsed blowing system that controls flow separation in a fully-turbulent $Re_\theta = 1000$ diffuser flow. Based on the state of the wind tunnel experiment that is determined with wall shear-stress measurements, Proximal Policy Optimization is used to iteratively adjust the forcing signal. Out of the reward functions investigated in this study, the incremental reduction of flow reversal per action is shown to be the most sample efficient. Less than 100 episodes are required to find the parameter combination that ensures the highest control authority for a fixed mass flow consumption. Fully consistent with recent studies, the algorithm suggests that the mass flow is used most efficiently when the actuation signal is characterized by a low duty cycle where the pulse duration is small compared to the pulsation period. The results presented in this paper promote the application of reinforcement learning for optimization tasks based on turbulent, experimental data.</description>

      <title>On the shape of ice stalagmites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of ice stalagmites obtained by the solidification of impacting droplets on a cooled substrate ($-50^{\circ}$C to $-140^{\circ}$C) is investigated experimentally. It is shown that for any combination of substrate temperature and drop discharge, there is a critical height above which unfrozen water accumulates at the stalagmite's tip, drips and develops into fingers that give a star-shape to the stalagmite. Both the vertical growth and the radial growth of the stalagmite are discussed through the Stefan problem and mass scaling arguments respectively. Finally, a phase diagram that presents the stalagmite aspect ratio in function of the main control parameters is proposed.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the reattachment of flow on a stalled NACA 0025 airfoil with an array of circular synthetic jet actuators. Experimental flow visualizations are used to assess the spanwise control authority of the array and the three-dimensionality of the flow.

      <title>Bacterial liquid-bridge evaporation and deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study evaporation and precipitate formation mechanics of bacteria-laden liquid bridge using experimental and theoretical analysis. Aqueous suspension of motile and non-motile Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa typically found in contaminated food and water were used in liquid bridge configuration between hydrophilic substrates. Using inverse logarithmic evaporation flux model, we study volume regression for cylindrical/catenoid volume models with confinement distance as a parameter. For all confinement distances, the regression is linear on normalizing both volume and time as in the case of pure sessile drop. However, in normalized volume and dimensional time space, we observe non-linearities as the evaporation time scales non linearly with the confinement distance. The non-linearities were captured using the catenoid model. The catenoid model conforms to the experimental volume regression data at all confinement distances, and the transient liquid bridge interface evolution profile at high confinement distance. We also study the precipitate pattern and bacterial distribution using micro/nano characterization techniques. We show the average precipitate pattern for both sessile and higher confinement distance resembles coffee ring type deposits although the underlying bacterial distribution differs. For lower confinement, we observe pattern resulting from a combination of coffee ring effect, stick-slick motion, and thin film instability. The reduction in confinement distance causes an altered bacterial agglomeration, resulting in a multi-pattern network instead of a single circumferential edge deposition. We show the aerial size of motile bacteria increases with decreasing confinement, whereas the size for non-motile bacteria remains constant in the precipitate.</description>

Abstract: This investigation derives formulas to predict the mixed convective surface conductance of a flat isotropic surface roughness having a convex perimeter in a Newtonian fluid with a steady forced flow in the plane of that roughness.
  Heat transfer measurements of a 30.5 cm square rough plate with forced air velocities between 0.1 m/s and 2.5 m/s were made by the present apparatus in two inclined and all five orthogonal orientations. The present work's formulas are compared with 104 measurements in twelve data-sets. The twelve data-sets have root-mean-square relative error (RMSRE) values between 1.3% and 4% relative to the present theory.
  The present work's formulas are also compared with 78 measurements in 28 data-sets on five vertical rough surfaces in horizontal flow from Rowley, Algren, and Blackshaw (1930). The five stucco data-sets have RMSRE values between 2.5% and 6.5%; the other data-sets have RMSRE values between 0.2% and 5%.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient flow control via optimized synthetic jet placement using deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop flow control strategies for circular and square cylinders, enhancing energy efficiency and minimizing energy consumption while addressing the limitations of traditional methods.We find that the optimal jet placement for both square and circular cylinders is at the main flow separation point, achieving the best balance between energy efficiency and control effectiveness.For the circular cylinder, positioning the jet at approximately 105{\deg} from the stagnation point requires only 1% of the inlet flow rate and achieves an 8% reduction in drag, with energy consumption one-third of that at other positions. For the square cylinder, placing the jet near the rear corner requires only 2% of the inlet flow rate, achieving a maximum drag reduction of 14.4%, whereas energy consumption near the front corner is 27 times higher, resulting in only 12% drag reduction.In multi-action control, the convergence speed and stability are lower compared to single-action control, but activating multiple jets significantly reduces initial energy consumption and improves energy efficiency. Physically, the interaction of the synthetic jet with the flow generates new vortices that modify the local flow structure, significantly enhancing the cylinder's aerodynamic performance.Our control strategy achieves a superior balance between energy efficiency and control performance compared to previous studies, underscoring its significant potential to advance sustainable and effective flow control.</description>

      <title>A finite element method to compute the damping rate and frequency of oscillating fluids inside microfluidic nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computation of damping rates of an oscillating fluid with a free surface in which viscosity is small and surface tension high is numerically challenging. A typical application requiring such computation is drop-on-demand (DoD) microfluidic devices that eject liquid metal droplets, where accurate knowledge of damping rates for the least-damped oscillation modes following droplet ejection is paramount for assessing jetting stability at higher jetting frequencies. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often struggle to accurately predict meniscus damping unless a very fine discretization is adopted, so calculations are computationally expensive. The faster alternative we adopt is to compute damping rates directly from the eigenvalues of the linearized problem. The surface tension term in Stokes or sloshing problems requires approximation of meniscus displacements, which introduces additional complexity in their numerical solution. We consider the combined effects of viscosity and surface tension, approximate the meniscus displacements, and construct a finite element method to compute the fluid's oscillation modes. We prove that the method is free of spurious modes with zero or positive damping rates, and we implement it with Taylor-Hood elements for velocity and pressure, and with continuous piecewise quadratic elements for meniscus displacement. We verify the numerical convergence of the method by reproducing the solution to an analytical benchmark problem and two more complex examples with axisymmetric geometry. We obtain the spatial shape and temporal evolution (angular frequency and damping rate) of the set of least-damped oscillation modes in minutes, compared to days for a CFD simulation. The method's ability to quickly generate accurate estimates of fluid oscillation damping rates makes it suitable for integration into design loops for prototyping microfluidic nozzles.</description>

      <title>Vorticity and magnetic dynamo from subsonic expansion waves II: Dependence on magnetic Prandtl number, forcing scale, cooling time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amplification of astrophysical magnetic fields takes place via dynamo instability in turbulent environments. The presence of vorticity is crucial for the dynamo to happen. However, the role of vorticity is not yet fully understood. This work is an extension of previous research on the effect of an irrotational subsonic forcing on a magnetized medium in the presence of rotation or a differential velocity profile, aimed at exploring a wider parameter space in terms of Reynolds numbers, magnetic Prandtl number, forcing scale, cooling timescale in a Newtonian cooling. We study the effect of imposing either the acceleration or the velocity forcing function to be curl-free and evaluate the terms responsible for the evolution vorticity. We use Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) to solve the fully compressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations with the Pencil Code. We study both isothermal and non-isothermal regimes and address the relative importance of different vorticity source terms.We report no small-scale dynamo for the models that do not include shear. We find a hydro instability, followed by a magnetic one, when a shearing velocity profile is applied. The vorticity production is found to be numerical in the purely irrotational case. Non-isothermality, rotation, shear or forcing in the form of a velocity curl-free, when included, contribute to increasing vorticity. Consistently with our previous study, we find that turbulence driven by subsonic expansion waves can amplify vorticity and magnetic field only in the presence of a background shearing profile. The presence of a cooling function make the instability happens on a shorter timescale. We estimate critical Reynolds and Magnetic Reynolds Numbes of 40 and 20, respectively.</description>
