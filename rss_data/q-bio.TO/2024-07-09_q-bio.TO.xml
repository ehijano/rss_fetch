      <title>Ultra-low-energy defibrillation through adjoint optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates ultra-low-energy defibrillation protocols using a simple two-dimensional model of cardiac tissue. We find that, rather counter-intuitively, a single, properly timed, biphasic pulse can be more effective in defibrillating the tissue than low energy antitachycardia pacing (LEAP) which employs a sequence of such pulses, succeeding where the latter approach fails. Furthermore, we show that, with the help of adjoint optimization, it is possible to reduce the energy required for defibrillation even further, making it three orders of magnitude lower than that required by LEAP. Finally, we establish that this dramatic reduction is achieved through exploiting the sensitivity of the dynamics in vulnerable windows to promote annihilation of pairs of nearby phase singularities.</description>

      <title>Disk-stacking models are consistent with Fibonacci and non-Fibonacci structure in sunflowers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a model of plant organ placement motivated by the appearance of large Fibonacci numbers in phyllotaxis, and provides the first large-scale empirical validation of this model. Specifically it evaluates the ability of Schwendener disk-stacking models to generate parastichy patterns seen in a large dataset of sunflower seedheads. We find that features of this data that the models can account for include a predominance of Fibonacci counts, usually in a pair of left and right counts on a single seedhead, a smaller but detectable frequency of Lucas and double Fibonacci numbers, a comparable frequency of Fibonacci numbers plus or minus one, and occurrences of pairs of roughly equal but non-Fibonacci counts in a `columnar' structure. A further observation in the dataset was an occasional lack of rotational symmetry in the parastichy spirals, and this paper demonstrates those in the model for the first time.
  Schwendener disk-stacking models allow Fibonacci structure by ensuring that a parameter of the model corresponding to the speed of plant growth is kept small enough. While many other models can exhibit Fibonacci structure, usually by specifying a rotation parameter to an extremely high precision, no other model has accounted for further, non-Fibonacci, features in the observed data. The Schwendener model produces these naturally in the region of parameter space just beyond where the Fibonacci structure breaks down, without any further parameter fitting. We also introduce stochasticity into the model and show that it while it can be responsible for the appearance of columnar structure, the disordered dynamics of the deterministic system near the critical region can also generate this structure.</description>

      <title>In vivo impact on rabbit subchondral bone of viscosupplementation with a hyaluronic acid antioxidant conjugate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04807v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To assess the impact of an antioxidant-conjugated Hyaluronic Acid (HA) on articular cartilage and subchondral bone in the context of osteoarthritis (OA), we conducted a study using a hydrogel composed of HA-4-aminoresorcinol (HA4AR) and compared it to a commercially available high molecular weight HA formulation in a rabbit model of OA. Eighteen rabbits underwent unilateral anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) and were categorized into three groups of six rabbits (Saline-group, HA-group and HA4AR-group) depending on the intra-articular injection compound. Eight contralateral knees were used as non-operated reference points (Contralateral-group). Iodine-enhanced micro-computed tomography imaging was performed six weeks post-surgery to study the articular cartilage volume and thickness as well as the subchondral bone microarchitectural parameters and mineral density. In the HA and HA4AR groups, the mean cartilage thickness was found to be similar to that of the Contralateral-group. However, when we compared the HA-group to the HA4AR-group, we observed a significant reduction in subchondral bone plate tissue mineral density (p&lt;0.05). In contrast, when we compared the HA4AR-group to the Saline-group, no significant differences were noted in trabecular subchondral bone microarchitectural parameters and subchondral bone plate and trabecular bone mineral densities. Additionally, when the HA-group was compared to the Saline-group, a notable decrease in subchondral bone plate tissue mineral density was evident (p&lt;0.01). Notably, the HA4AR hydrogel, comprising HA-antioxidant conjugate, effectively preserved subchondral bone plate tissue mineral density when compared to HA alone. Nevertheless, other aspects of bone microarchitectural parameters remained unaltered, resulting in subchondral bone mineral loss six weeks after surgery in the rabbit model.</description>
