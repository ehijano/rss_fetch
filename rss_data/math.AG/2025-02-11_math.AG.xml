      <title>Formal Integration of Derived Foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frobenius' theorem in differential geometry asserts that every involutive subbundle of the tangent bundle of a manifold $M$ integrates to a decomposition of $M$ into smooth leaves. We prove an infinitesimal analogue of this result for locally coherent qcqs schemes $X$ over coherent rings. More precisely, we integrate partition Lie algebroids on $X$ to formal moduli stacks $X \rightarrow S$ where $S$ is the formal leaf space and the fibres of $X \rightarrow S$ are the formal leaves. We deduce that deformations of $X$-families of algebro-geometric objects are controlled by partition Lie algebroids on $X$. Combining our integration equivalence with a result of Fu, we deduce that To\"{e}n-Vezzosi's infinitesimal derived foliations (under suitable finiteness hypotheses) are formally integrable.</description>

      <title>Hecke transformation for orthogonal bundles over curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an orthogonal bundle $E$ over a smooth projective curve $X$ we define a Hecke transformation in the moduli space of orthogonal bundles by performing an elementary transformation with respect to a Lagrangian submodule $L \subset E_{2x}$ at some point $x \in X$. We show that the analogue of Tyurin's duality theorem holds for orthogonal bundles. Special cases of orthogonal bundles of ranks $2,3,4$ and $6$ are studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Slopes and weights of $\ell$-adic cohomology of rigid spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Frobenius eigenvalues of $\ell$-adic cohomology and $\ell$-adic intersection cohomology of rigid spaces over $p$-adic local fields are algebraic integers and we give bounds for their $p$-adic valuations. As an application, we deduce bounds for their weights, proving conjectures of Bhatt, Hansen, and Zavyalov. We also give examples of monodromy-pure perverse sheaves on projective curves with non monodromy-pure cohomology, answering a question of Hansen and Zavyalov.</description>

      <title>Tropical split Jacobians of curves of genus 2 II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of two papers which study the phenomenon of tropical split Jacobians. The first paper is a contemplative study, embedded in the broader context of exploring connections between the category of tropical abelian varieties (tav), $\mathbb{T}\mathcal{A}$, and the category of tropical curves, $\mathbb{T}\mathcal{C}$. Tropical split Jacobians take on different forms depending on whether we look at them in $\mathbb{T}\mathcal{A}$ or $\mathbb{T}\mathcal{C}$: They appear either as 2 dimensional tavs that decompose into a product of two elliptic curves, or as a pair of optimal coverings. [11] examines both and then focuses on how optimal covers give rise to split Jacobians. This paper takes a different approach. Instead of looking at the phenomenon as a whole, we analyze its building blocks, a pair of elliptic curves together with a finite subgroup of their product, and how to reassemble them into a Jacobian.</description>

      <title>What Kind of Morphisms Induces Covering Maps over a Real Closed Field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we show that a flat morphism of k-varieties (char k=0) whose fibers consist of a finite constant number of geometric points becomes finite \'etale after reduction. When k is a real closed field, we prove that such a morphism induces covering map on the rational points.</description>

      <title>A simple derived categorical generalization of Ulrich bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define special objects, Ulrich objects, on a derived category of polarized smooth projective variety as a generalization of Ulrich bundles to the derived category. These are defined by the cohomological conditions that are the same form as a cohomological criterion determining Ulrichness for sheaves. This paper gives a characterization of the Ulrich object similar to the one in [ES03]. As an application, we have provided a new approach to the Eisenbud-Schreyer question by using the notions of the generator of the derived category. We also have given an example of Ulrich objects that are not sheaf by the Yoneda extension.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a criterion for a sufficient condition of perfectoid purity and a computation method for perfectoid pure threshold of $\mathrm{div}(p)$. Furthermore, we give examples of Noetherian local $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$-algebras $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ such that $p$ is contained in $\mathfrak{m}$, $R$ is perfectoid BCM-regular, and $R/pR$ is normal Gorenstein, but $R/pR$ is not strongly $F$-regular for every prime number $p$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the Bruhat-Tits stratification of the ramified unitary Rapoport-Zink space, with the level being the stabilizer of a vertex lattice. We develop the local model theory for Bruhat-Tits strata, proving their normality and Cohen-Macaulayness, and provide precise dimension formulas. Additionally, we establish an explicit isomorphism between Bruhat-Tits strata and Deligne-Lusztig varieties, revealing new phenomena beyond the previously studied Coxeter-type cases.</description>

      <title>Quasi-homogeneous singularities of projective hypersurfaces and Jacobian syzygies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an unexpected general relation between the Jacobian syzygies of a projective hypersurface $V\subset \mathbb{P}^n$ with only isolated singularities and the nature of its singularities. This allows to establish a new method for the identification of quasi-homogeneous hypersurface isolated singularities. The result gives an insight on how the geometry is reflected in the Jacobian syzygies and extends previous results of the first, second and last author for free and nearly free plane curves [1].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A survey of special curves, special subvarieties of $\mathcal{M}_g$, and related topics. A large portion of the text discusses various possible interpretation of the word 'special' in this context by giving also concrete examples. One highlight is the bi-algebraic viewpoint for atypical intersections appearing in Hodge theory as well as, more recently, in Teichm\"{u}ller theory.</description>

      <title>The affine closure of cotangent bundles of horospherical spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a smooth quasi-affine variety $X$, the affine closure $\overline{T^*X} := \text{Spec}(k[T^*X])$ contains $T^*X$ as an open subset, and its smooth locus carries a symplectic structure. A natural question is whether $\overline{T^*X}$ itself is a symplectic variety. A notable example is the conjecture of Ginzburg and Kazhdan, which predicts that $\overline{T^*(G/U)}$ is symplectic for a maximal unipotent subgroup $U$ in a reductive linear algebraic group $G$. This conjecture was recently proved by Gannon using representation-theoretic methods.
  In this paper, we provide a new geometric approach to this conjecture. Our method allows us to prove a more general result: $\overline{T^*(G/H)}$ is symplectic for any horospherical subgroup $H$ in $G$ such that $G/H$ is quasi-affine. In particular, this implies that the affine closure $\overline{T^*(G/[P,P])}$ is a symplectic variety for any parabolic subgroup $P$ in $G$.</description>

      <title>Bi-Lipschitz triviality of function-germs on singular varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the bi-Lipschitz triviality of deformations of an analytic function germ $f$ defined on a germ of an analytic variety $(X, 0)$ in $\mathbb C^n$. We introduce the notion of strongly rational $\mathscr R_X$-bi-Lipschitz trivial families and give an infinitesimal criterion which is a sufficient condition for the bi-Lipschitz triviality of deformations of $f$ on $(X,0).$ As a corollary it follows that when $X$ and $f$ are homogeneous of the same degree, all deformation of $f$ of the same or higher degrees are bi-Lipschitz trivial. We then prove a rigidity result for deformations of $f$ on $X$ when both are weighted homogeneous with respect to the same set of weights.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we use the deformation to the normal cone and the corresponding Verdier-Saito specialization to define and study (spectral) Hirzebruch-Milnor type homology characteristic classes for local complete intersections. Our main results describe vanishing properties of these classes in relation to the minimal exponent. As applications, we show how Hirzebruch-Milnor classes of local complete intersections with a projective singular locus can be used to detect higher Du Bois and higher rational singularities.</description>

      <title>Saito's theorem revisited and application to free pencils of hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypersurface $X\subset \mathbb P^n$ is said to be free if its associated sheaf $T_X$ of vector fields tangent to $X$ is a free ${\mathcal O}_{\mathbb P^n}$-module. So far few examples of free hypersurfaces are known. In this short note, we reinterpret Saito's criterion of freeness in terms of multiple eigenschemes (ME) and as application we construct huge families of new examples of free reduced hypersurfaces in $\mathbb P^n$. All of them are union of hypersurfaces in a suitable pencil.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational complexity of polynomial ideals and Gr\"obner bases has been studied since the 1980s. In recent years the related notions of polynomial subalgebras and SAGBI bases have gained more and more attention in computational algebra, with a view towards effective algorithms. We investigate the computational complexity of the subalgebra membership problem and degree bounds. In particular, we place these problems in the complexity class EXPSPACE and prove PSPACE-completeness for homogeneous algebras. We highlight parallels and differences compared to the settings of ideals and also look at important classes of polynomials such as monomial algebras.</description>

      <title>Certified algebraic curve projections by path tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a certified algorithm that takes a smooth algebraic curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and computes an isotopic approximation for a generic projection of the curve into $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our algorithm is designed for curves given implicitly by the zeros of $n-1$ polynomials, but it can be partially extended to parametrically defined curves. The main challenge in correctly computing the projection is to guarantee the topological correctness of crossings in the projection. Our approach combines certified path tracking and interval arithmetic in a two-step procedure: first, we construct an approximation to the curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and, second, we refine the approximation until the topological correctness of the projection can be guaranteed. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation illustrating the algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper gives a systematic study of the lowering operators acting on the $K$-$k$-Schur functions, motivated by the pivotal role played by the operators in the definition and study of Katalan functions. A lowering operator formula for closed $K$-$k$-Schur functions is obtained.

      <title>Automorphism group schemes of lattice vertex operator algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a positive definite even lattice and a commutative ring, there is a standard construction of a lattice vertex algebra over the commutative ring, and this is promoted to a vertex operator algebra when the determinant of the lattice is invertible. We describe the groups of automorphisms of these vertex algebras and vertex operator algebras as affine group schemes, showing in particular that each is an extension of an explicitly described split reductive group of ADE type by the outer automorphism group of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of tangent currents for positive closed currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex manifold $X$ of dimension $k,$ and let $V\subset X$ be a K\"ahler submanifold of dimension $l,$ and let $B\subset V$ be a piecewise $\mathcal{C}^2$-smooth domain. Let $T$ be a positive closed currents of bidegree $(p,p)$ in $X$ such that $T$ satisfies a mild reasonable assumption in a neighborhood of $\partial B$ in $X$ and that the $j$-th average mean $\nu_j(T,B,r)$ for every $j$ with $\max(0,l-p)\leq j\leq\min(l,k-p)$ converges sufficiently fast to the $j$-th generalized Lelong number $\nu_j(T,B)$ as $r$ tends to $0$ so that $r^{-1}(\nu_j(T, B,r)-\nu_j( T,B))$ is locally integrable near $r=0.$ Then we show that $T$ admits a unique tangent current along $B.$ A local version where we replace the condition of $T$ near $B$ by the conditions on a finite cover of $B$ by piecewise $\mathcal{C}^2$-smooth domains in $V$ is also given. When $T$ is a current of integration over a complex analytic set, we show that $\nu_j(T,B,r)-\nu_j(T,B)=O(r^\rho)$ for some $\rho&gt;0,$ and hence this condition is satisfied. Our result may be viewed as a natural generalization of Blel-Demailly-Mouzali's criterion from the case $l=0$ to the case $l&gt;0.$ The result has applications in the intersection theory of positive closed currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.06855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bielliptic surface (or hyperelliptic surface) is a smooth surface with a numerically trivial canonical divisor such that the Albanese morphism is an elliptic fibration. In the first part of this paper, we study the structure of bielliptic surfaces over a field of characteristic different from $2$ and $3$, in order to prove the Shafarevich conjecture for bielliptic surfaces with rational points. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Shafarevich conjecture generally fails for bielliptic surfaces without rational points. In particular, this paper completes the study of the Shafarevich conjecture for minimal surfaces of Kodaira dimension $0$.
  In the second part of this paper, we study a N\'{e}ron model of a bielliptic surface. We establish the potential existence of a N\'{e}ron model for a bielliptic surface when the residual characteristic is not equal to $2$ or $3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.13882v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a normalizer of the diagonal torus $T_1\cong \mathbb{G}_m$ in $\text{SL}_2$. We prove localization theorems for $\text{SL}_2^n$ and $N^n$ for equivariant cohomology with coefficients in the (twisted) Witt sheaf, along the lines of the classical Atiyah-Bott localization theorems for equivariant cohomology for a torus action. We also have an analog of the Bott residue formula for $\text{SL}_2^n$ and $N$. In the case of an $\text{SL}_2^n$-action, there is a rather serious restriction on the orbit type. For an $N$-action, there is no restriction for the localization result, but for the Bott residue theorem, one requires a certain type of decomposition of the fixed points for the $T_1$-action.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the moduli space of 8 points on $\mathbb{P}^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moduli space of $8$ points on $\mathbb{P}^1$, a so-called ancestral Deligne-Mostow space, is, by work of Kond\={o}, also a moduli space of K3 surfaces. We prove that the Deligne-Mostow isomorphism does not lift to a morphism between the Kirwan blow-up of the GIT quotient and the unique toroidal compactification of the corresponding ball quotient. Moreover, we show that these spaces are not $K$-equivalent, even though they are natural blow-ups at the unique cusps and have the same cohomology. This is analogous to the work of Casalaina-Martin-Grushevsky-Hulek-Laza on the moduli space of cubic surfaces. The moduli spaces of ordinary stable maps, that is, the Fulton-MacPherson compactification of the configuration space of points on $\mathbb{P}^1$, play an important role in the proof. We further relate our computations to new developments in the minimal model program and recent work of Odaka. We briefly discuss other cases of moduli space of points on $\mathbb{P}^1$ where a similar behaviour can be observed, hinting at a more general, but not yet fully understood phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: We develop an equivariant version of the non-archimedean Arakelov theory of [BGS95] in the case of toric varieties. We define the equivariant analogues of the non-archimedean differential forms and currents appearing in \emph{loc.~cit.} and relate them to piecewise polynomial functions on the polyhedral complexes defining the toric models. In particular, we give combinatorial characterizations of the Green currents associated to equivariant cycles and combinatorial descriptions of the arithmetic Chow groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a sparse system of n Laurent polynomials in n variables with complex coefficients and support in a finite lattice set A. The maximal number of isolated roots of the system in the complex n-torus is known to be the normalized volume of the convex hull of A (the BKK bound). We explore the following question: if the cardinality of A equals n+m+1, what is the maximum local intersection multiplicity at one point in the torus in terms of n and m? This study was initiated by Gabrielov in the multivariate case. We give an upper bound that is always sharp when m=1 and, under a generic technical hypothesis, it is considerably smaller for any dimension n and codimension m. We also present, for any value of n and m, a particular sparse system with high local multiplicity with exponents in the vertices of a cyclic polytope and we explain the rationale of our choice. Our work raises several interesting questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12576v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study Jacobians of Hodge structures with weight greater than 1. Jacobians of weight 2 naturally come up in the context of the Brauer group and the Tate conjecture. They were previously studied in a special case by Beauville in his work on surfaces of maximal Picard number, and are related to the work of Totaro on Hodge structures with no middle pieces. Higher-weight Jacobians are complex tori, and it is generally quite difficult to tell if they are algebraic. After discussing some general theory, we compute numerous examples of Jacobians of various weights for special classes of varieties: abelian varieties of maximal Picard number, Kummer varieties, and singular K3 surfaces. It turns out that all of these Jacobians are algebraic. We compute their fields of definition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes BCOV-type genus one mirror symmetry for the intersections of two cubics in $\mathbb{P}^5$. The proof applies previous constructions of the mirror family by the second author and computations of genus one Gromov-Witten invariants by A. Popa. The approach adapts the strategy used for hypersurfaces, as developed by the first author and collaborators, but addresses the distinct geometry involved. A key feature is a systematic usage of toric techniques and related computer aided calculations to determine seemingly otherwise inaccessible invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous example of the double-Watt mechanism given by Connelly and Servatius raises some problems concerning the classical definitions of higher-order flexibility and rigidity, respectively. Recently, the author was able to give a proper redefinition of the flexion/rigidity order for bar-joint frameworks, but the question for the flexes associated with higher-order flexible structures remained open. In this paper we properly define these flexes based on the theory of algebraic curves and demonstrate their computation by means of Puiseux series. The presented algebraic approach also allows to take reality issues into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12305v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first prove a complete version of the Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem over normal varieties, including normal Kaehler varieties and projective normal varieties with multiple polarizations. In particular, this gives the polystability of reflexive sheaves under symmetric and exterior powers and tensor products. As a consequence of the singular Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem, the complete Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence over normal varieties smooth in codimension two is built by showing that an admissible Hermitian-Yang- Mills connection defines a polystable reflexive sheaf. Furthermore, it is shown that the Hermitian-Yang-Mills connection gives a lower bound for the discriminants of any Kaehler resolutions, which gives a Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality over normal varieties and a characterization of the equality using projectively flat connections. We discuss typical cases including normal surfaces and varieties smooth in codimension two where we could simplify the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality and endow it with topological meanings. We also prove the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for semistable reflexive sheaves and characterize the class of semistable sheaves that satisfy the Bogomolov-Gieseker equality. Finally, as another application, we give a new criteria for when a normal Kaehler variety with trivial first Chern class is a finite quotient of torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the analytic properties of solutions to the Vafa-Witten equation over a compact Kaehler manifold. Simple obstructions to the existence of nontrivial solutions are identified. The gauge theoretical compactness for the $\mathbb{C}^*$ invariant locus of the moduli space is shown to behave similarly as the Hermitian-Yang-Mills connections. More generally, this holds for solutions with uniformly bounded spectral covers such as nilpotent solutions. When spectral covers are unbounded, we manage to take limits of the renormalized Higgs fields which are intrinsically characterized by the convergence of the associated spectral covers. This gives a simpler proof for Taubes' results on rank two solutions over Kaehler surfaces together with a new complex geometric interpretation. The moduli space of $SU(2)$ monopoles and some related examples are also discussed in the final section.</description>

We prove that many results from henselian valued fields as well as differentially large fields can be lifted to the differentially henselian setting, for instance Ax-Kochen/Ershov principles, characterisations in terms of differential algebras, etc. We also give methods to concretely construct such fields in terms of iterated power series expansions and inductive constructions on transcendence bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent work of Aslanyan and Daw, we introduce the notion of $\Sigma$-orbits in the general framework of distinguished categories. In the setting of connected Shimura varieties, this concept contains many instances of (generalized) Hecke orbits from the literature. In the setting of semiabelian varieties, a $\Sigma$-orbit is a subgroup of finite rank. We show that our $\Sigma$-orbits have useful functorial properties and we use them to formulate two general statements of Mordell-Lang type (one of them implying the other one). We prove an analogue of a recent theorem of Aslanyan and Daw in this general setting, which we apply to deduce an unconditional result about unlikely intersections in a fibered power of the Legendre family. In an appendix, we prove an unconditional Zilber-Pink result for subvarieties of $\mathcal{A}_g$ that cannot be defined over the algebraic numbers.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we extend the arithmetic intersection theory of adelic divisors on quasiprojective varieties developed by X. Yuan and S. W. Zhang to cover certain adelic arithmetic divisors that are not nef nor integrable. The key concept used in this extension is the relative finite energy introduced by T. Darvas, E. Di Nezza, and C. H. Lu. As an application, we prove that the line bundle of Siegel--Jacobi forms on the universal abelian variety endowed with its invariant hermitian metric is not integrable but we compute its arithmetic self-intersection number using the new extension. The techniques developed in this paper can be applied in many other situations like mixed Shimura varieties or the moduli space of stable marked curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a duality between the complex Liouville string and a two-matrix integral. The complex Liouville string is defined by coupling two Liouville theories with complex central charges $c = 13 \pm i \lambda$ on the worldsheet. The matrix integral is characterized by its spectral curve which allows us to compute the perturbative string amplitudes recursively via topological recursion. This duality constitutes a controllable instance of holographic duality. The leverage on the theory is provided by the rich analytic structure of the string amplitudes that we discussed in arXiv:2409.18759 and allows us to perform numerous tests on the duality.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics and large genus asymptotics of the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten numbers</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study combinatorial and asymptotic properties of some interesting rational numbers called the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten (BGW) numbers, which can be represented as the intersection numbers of psi and Theta classes on the moduli space of stable algebraic curves. In particular, we discover and prove the uniform large genus leading asymptotics of certain normalized BGW numbers, and give a new proof of the polynomiality phenomenon for the large genus asymptotics. We also propose, with extensive numerical data, several new conjectures including monotonicity and integrality on the BGW numbers. Applications to the Painlev\'e II hierarchy and to the BGW-kappa numbers are given.</description>

      <title>Localizing invariants of inverse limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the category of nuclear modules on an affine formal scheme as defined by Clausen and Scholze \cite{CS20}. We also study related constructions in the framework of dualizable and rigid monoidal categories. We prove that the $K$-theory (in the sense of \cite{E24}) of the category of nuclear modules on $\operatorname{Spf}(R^{\wedge}_I)$ is isomorphic to the classical continuous $K$-theory, which in the noetherian case is given by the limit $\varprojlim\limits_{n} K(R/I^n).$ This isomorphism was conjectured previously by Clausen and Scholze.
  More precisely, we study two versions of the category of nuclear modules: the original one defined in \cite{CS20} and a different version, which contains the original one as a full subcategory. For our category $\operatorname{Nuc}(R^{\wedge}_I)$ we give three equivalent definitions. The first definition is by taking the internal $\operatorname{Hom}$ in the category $\operatorname{Cat}_R^{\operatorname{dual}}$ of $R$-linear dualizable categories. The second definition is by taking the rigidification of the usual $I$-complete derived category of $R.$ The third definition is by taking an inverse limit in $\operatorname{Cat}_R^{\operatorname{dual}}.$ For each of the three approaches we prove that the corresponding construction is well-behaved in a certain sense.
  Moreover, we prove that the two versions of the category of nuclear modules have the same $K$-theory, and in fact the same finitary localizing invariants.</description>
