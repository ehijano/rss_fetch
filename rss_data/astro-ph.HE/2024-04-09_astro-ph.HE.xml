      <title>Repeating partial disruptions and two-body relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-body relaxation may drive stars onto near-radial orbits around a massive black hole, resulting in a tidal disruption event (TDE). In some circumstances, stars are unlikely to undergo a single terminal disruption, but rather to have a sequence of many grazing encounters with the black hole. It has long been unclear what is the physical outcome of this sequence: each of these encounters can only liberate a small amount of stellar mass, but may significantly alter the orbit of the star. We study the phenomenon of repeating partial tidal disruptions (pTDEs) by building a semi-analytical model that accounts for mass loss and tidal excitations. In the empty loss cone regime, where two-body relaxation is weak, we estimate the number of consecutive partial disruption that a star can undergo, on average, before being significantly affected by two-body encounters. We find that in this empty loss cone regime, a star will be destroyed in a sequence of weak pTDEs, possibly explaining the tension between the low observed TDE rate and its higher theoretical estimates.</description>

      <title>Remnant masses from 1D+ core-collapse supernovae simulations: bimodal neutron star mass distribution and black holes in the low-mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosion of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is an extremely challenging problem, and there are still large uncertainties regarding which stars lead to successful explosions that leave behind a neutron star, and which ones will form a black hole instead. In this paper, we simulate 341 progenitors at three different metallicities using spherically symmetric simulations that include neutrino-driven convection via a mixing-length theory. We use these simulations to improve previously derived explosion criteria based on the density and entropy profiles of the pre-supernova progenitor. We also provide numerical fits to calculate the final mass of neutron stars based on either compactness, the location of the Si/Si-O interface, or the Chandrasekhar mass. The neutron star birth mass distribution derived from our 1D+ simulations is bimodal, contrary to what the most popular 1D CCSN simulations have shown so far. We compare the theoretically derived neutron star mass distributions with the observed ones and discuss potential implications for population synthesis studies. We also analyze the black hole mass distribution predicted by our simulations. To be consistent with current models of matter ejection in failed SNe, a large fraction of the envelope must be expelled, leading to small black holes in the low-mass gap. One black hole in this mass region has recently been observed in the GW230529 event by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Our results naturally agree with this detection, which the most popular prescriptions for explodability and remnant masses are not able to reproduce. In general, we find that the explosion outcome and mass of the remnant strongly depend on the pre-collapse structure of the progenitor. However, their dependence on the initial mass of the star and the mass of the CO core is highly uncertain and non-linear.</description>

      <title>Tests of the Kerr Hypothesis with MAXI J1803-298 Using Different RELXILL_NK Flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron line spectroscopy has been one of the leading methods not only for measuring the spins of accreting black holes but also for testing fundamental physics. Basing on such a method, we present an analysis of a dataset observed simultaneously by NuSTAR and NICER for the black hole binary candidate MAXI J1803-298, which shows prominent relativistic reflection features. Various relxill_nk flavors are utilized to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. The results obtained from our analysis provide stringent constraints on Johannsen deformation parameter $\alpha_{13}$ with the highest precise to date, namely $\alpha_{13}=0.023^{+0.071}_{-0.038}$ from relxillD_nk and $\alpha_{13}=0.006^{+0.045}_{-0.022}$ from relxillion_nk respectively in 3-$\sigma$ credible lever, where Johannsen metric reduces to Kerr metric when $\alpha_{13}$ vanishes. Furthermore, we investigate the best model-fit results using Akaike Information Criterion and assess its systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Thin Accretion disks in GR-MHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review some recent results of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GR-MHD) simulations considering the evolution of geometrically thin disks around a central black hole. Thin disk GR-MHD simulations complement the widely used MAD (Magnetically Arrested Disk) or SANE (Standard And Normal Evolution) approaches of evolving from an initial disk torus. In particular, we discuss the dynamical evolution of the disk, its role in the formation of disk winds or jets, the impact of disk resistivity, and its potential role in generating magnetic flux by an internal disk dynamo. The main characteristics of a thin disk in our approach are the Keplerian rotation of the disk material, which allows to launch disk outflows by the Blandford-Payne magneto-centrifugal effect, in addition to the Blandford-Znajek-driven spine jet from the black hole ergosphere. Thus, for this approach, we neglect disk thermodynamics and radiative effects, concentrating predominantly on the dynamical evolution of the system. Resistive MHD further allows the investigation of physical reconnection and also dynamo action. Magnetic reconnection may generate magnetic islands of plasmoids that are ejected from the disk along with the outflow. We also discussed potential applications of thin disk in explaining the decaying phase of an outburst in black hole X-ray binaries (BH-XRBs). Post-processing of radiation using the simulated dynamical data allows to derive spectra or fluxes, e.g., in the X-ray band, and to derive potential variability characteristics.</description>

      <title>Calibration of luminosity correlations of gamma-ray bursts using quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to test the efficacy of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) as cosmological probes, we the characterize the scatter in the correlations between six pairs of GRB related observables, which have previously also been studied in arXiv:2011.14040. However, some of these observables depend on the luminosity distance, for which one needs to assume an underlying cosmological model. In order to circumvent this circularity problem, we use X-ray and UV fluxes of quasars as distance anchors to calculate the luminosity distance in a model-independent manner, which in turn gets used to calculate the GRB-related quantities. We find that all the six pairs of regression relations show a high intrinsic scatter for both the low and high redshift sample. This implies that these GRB observables cannot be used as model-independent cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Alfven Wave Mode Conversion in Neutron Star Magnetospheres: A Semi-analytic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We write down the force-free electrodynamics (FFE) equations in dipole coordinates, and solve for normal modes corresponding to Alfv\'enic perturbations in the magnetosphere of a neutron star. We show that a single Alfv\'en wave propagating on dipole field lines spontaneously sources a fast magnetosonic (fms) wave at the next order in the perturbation expansion, without needing 3-wave interaction. The frequency of the sourced fms wave is twice the original Alfv\'en wave frequency, and the wave propagates spherically outwards. The properties of the outgoing fms wave can be computed exactly using the usual devices of classical electrodynamics. We extend the calculation to the closed zone of a rotating neutron star magnetosphere, and show that the Alfv\'en wave also sources a spherical fms wave but at the same frequency as the primary Alfv\'en wave.</description>

      <title>ClassiPyGRB: Machine Learning-Based Classification and Visualization of Gamma Ray Bursts using t-SNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray burst (GRBs) are the brightest events in the universe. For decades, astrophysicists have known about their cosmological nature. Every year, space missions such as Fermi and SWIFT detect hundreds of them. In spite of this large sample, GRBs show a complex taxonomy in the first seconds after their appearance, which makes it very difficult to find similarities between them using conventional techniques. It is known that GRBs originate from the death of a massive star or from the merger of two compact objects. GRB classification is typically based on the duration of the burst (Kouveliotou et al., 1993). Nevertheless, events such as GRB 211211A (Yang et al., 2022), whose duration of about 50 seconds lies in the group of long GRBs, has challenged this categorization by the evidence of features related with the short GRB population (the kilonova emission and the properties of its host galaxy). Therefore, a classification based only on their gamma-ray duration does not provide a completely reliable determination of the progenitor. Motivated by this problem, Jespersen et al. (2020) and Steinhardt et al. (2023) carried out analysis of GRB light curves by using the t-SNE algorithm, showing that Swift/BAT GRBs database, consisting of light curves in four energy bands (15-25 keV, 25-50 keV, 50-100 keV, 100-350 keV), clusters into two groups corresponding with the typical long/short classification. However, in this case, this classification is based on the information provided by their gamma-ray emission light curves. ClassiPyGRB is a Python 3 package to download, process, visualize and classify GRBs database from the Swift/BAT Instrument (up to July 2022). It is distributed over the GNU General Public License Version 2 (1991). We also included a noise-reduction and an interpolation tools for achieving a deeper analysis of the data.</description>

      <title>Black holes, multiple propagation speeds and energy extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics predicts the speed of light to be a universal speed of propagation of massless carriers. However, other possibilities exist -- including Lorentz-violating theories -- where different fundamental fields travel at different speeds. Black holes are interesting probes of such physics, as distinct fields would probe different horizons. Here, we build an exact spacetime for two interacting scalar fields which have different propagation speeds. One of these fields is able to probe the black hole interior of the other, giving rise to energy extraction from the black hole and a characteristic late-time relaxation. Our results provide further stimulus to the search for extra degrees of freedom, black hole instability, and extra ringdown modes in gravitational-wave events.</description>

      <title>Equation of State of Hot Neutron Star Matter using Finite Range Simple Effective Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state of hot neutron star matter of n+p+e+$\mu$ composition in $\beta$-equilibrium is studied for both neutrino-free isothermal and neutrino-trapped isentropic conditions, using the formalism where the thermal evolution is built upon its zero-temperature predictions in a self-consistent manner. The accuracy of the parabolic approximation, often used in the finite temperature calculation of hot neutron star matter, is verified by comparing with the results obtained from the exact evaluation in the neutrino-free neutron star matter. The equation of state of neutrino-trapped isentropic matter at low entropic condition, relevant to the core-collapsing supernovae, is formulated. In the isentropic matter, the particle fractions and equation of state have marginal variance as entropy per particle varies between 1 to 3 (in the unit of k$_B$), but the temperature profile shows marked variation. The isentropes are found to be much less sensitive to the nuclear matter incompressibility, but have a large dependence on the slope parameter L. The bulk properties of the neutron stars predicted by the isentropic equation of state for different entropy are calculated. A model calculation for the early stage evolution of the protoneutron star to neutron star configuration is also given.</description>

      <title>On Variation of Light Curves and Broad Emission Lines for Periodic QSOs from co-rotating Supermassive binary black holes in elliptical orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Periodic QSOs are considered as candidates of supermassive binary black hole (BBH) systems in galactic centers. Further confirmation of these candidates may require different lines of observational evidences. Aims. Assuming the Doopler boosting scenario, in this paper we investigate the (coherent) variations of both broad emission lines (BELs) and continuum light curves for active BBH systems surrounding by a circumbinary broad line region (cBLR) and focus on their dependence on the eccentric orbital configuration. Methods. We calculate the variation of continuum light and the Doppler enhanced/weakened photoionization of each BLR cloud according to the motion of BBHs in elliptical orbits, and finally obtain the coherent variation of the continuum and BELs. Results. We find that both the amplitude and variation pattern of the continuum light curves and the evolution of the BEL profiles sensitively depend on the eccentric orbital configuration of BBH systems. If only the secondary BH is active, both the variation amplitudes of continuum light curves and BELs increase with increasing BBH inclination angles and orbital eccentricities, but decrease with increasing BBH mass ratio. If both BHs are active, the asymmetry in the ionization of BLR clouds at different areas caused by the Doppler boosting effect of the secondary BH is weakened due to that of the primary BH at the opposite direction, which leads to systematically smaller variation amplitudes of both continuum light curves and BELs than the cases with only secondary BH activated. Conclusions. The coherent variations of the BEL profiles with the continuum light for those periodic QSOs provide an important way to confirm the existence of BBHs in their center. Future joint analysis of the light curves and multi-epoch observed BEL profiles for periodic QSOs may lead to the identification of a number of BBH systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianities in primordial black hole formation and induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most promising mechanism of generating primordial black holes (PBHs) is by the enhancement of power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation, which is usually accompanied by the the enhancement of non-Gaussianity that crucially changes the abundance of PBHs. In this review I will discuss how non-Gaussianity is generated in single field inflation as well as in the curvaton scenario, and then discuss how to calculate PBH mass function with such non-Gaussianities. I also show non-Gaussianity only has mild effects on the induced gravitational waves (GWs), which gives robust predictions in the mHz and nHz GW experiments.</description>

      <title>From chiral EFT to perturbative QCD: a Bayesian model mixing approach to symmetric nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraining the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting, dense matter is the focus of intense experimental, observational, and theoretical effort. Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) can describe the EOS between the typical densities of nuclei and those in the outer cores of neutron stars while perturbative QCD (pQCD) can be applied to properties of deconfined quark matter, both with quantified theoretical uncertainties. However, describing the complete range of densities between nuclear saturation and an almost-free quark gas with a single EOS that has well-quantified uncertainties is a challenging problem. In this work, we argue that Bayesian multi-model inference from $\chi$EFT and pQCD can help bridge the gap between the two theories: we combine the Gaussian random variables that constitute the theories' predictions for the pressure as a function of the density in symmetric nuclear matter. We do this using two Bayesian model mixing procedures: a pointwise approach, and a correlated approach implemented via a Gaussian process (GP), and present results for the pressure and speed of sound in each. The second method produces a smooth $\chi$EFT-to-pQCD EOS. Without input data in the intermediate region, the choice of prior on the EOS, encoded through the GP kernel, as the prior on the EOS function space significantly affects the result in that region. We also discuss future extensions and applications to neutron star matter guided by recent EOS constraints from nuclear theory, nuclear experiment, and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave seismology of charged strange stars in the Cowling approximation: the fluid pulsation modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study, within the framework of Cowling approximation, the effect of the electric charge on the gravitational wave frequency of fluid oscillation modes of strange quark stars. For this purpose, the dense matter of the stellar fluid is described by the MIT bag model equation of state (EoS), while for the electric charge profile, we consider that the electric charge density is proportional to the energy density. We find that the gravitational wave frequencies change with the increment of electric charge; these effects are more noticeable at higher total mass values. We obtain that the $f$-mode is very sensitive to the change in the electric charge of the star. Furthermore, in the case of the $p_1$ mode, the effect of the electric charge is not very significant. Our results reveal that the study of the fundamental pulsation mode of an electrically charged compact star is very important to distinguish whether compact stars could contain electric charge.</description>

      <title>Thermal fluctuations of matter composition and quark nucleation in compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. At the extreme densities reached in the core of neutron stars, it is possible that quark deconfined matter is produced. The formation of this new phase of strongly interacting matter is likely to occur via a first-order phase transition for the typical temperatures reached in astrophysical processes. The first seeds of quark matter would then form through a process of nucleation within the metastable hadronic phase. Aims. Here we address the role of the thermal fluctuations in the hadronic composition on the nucleation of two-flavour quark matter. Methods. At finite temperature, thermodynamic quantities in a system fluctuate around average values. Being nucleation a local process, it is possible that it occurs in a subsystem whose composition makes the nucleation easier. We will consider the total probability of the nucleation as the product between the probability that a subsystem has a certain hadronic composition different from the average in the bulk, and the nucleation probability in that subsystem. Results. We will show how those fluctuations of the hadronic composition can increase the efficiency of nucleation already for temperatures $\sim (0.1-1)$ keV. However, for temperatures $\lesssim (1-10)$ MeV, the needed overpressure exceeds the maximum pressure reached in compact stars. Finally, for even larger temperatures the process of nucleation can take place, even taking into account finite size effects.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino flavor transformation offers a window into the physics of various astrophysical environments, including our Sun and the more exotic environs of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers. Here, we apply an inference framework - specifically: statistical data assimilation (SDA) - to neutrino flavor evolution in the Sun. We take a model for solar neutrino flavor evolution, together with Earth-based neutrino measurements, to infer solar properties. Specifically, we ask what signature of the radially-varying solar electron number density $n_e(r)$ is contained within these Earth-based measurements. Currently, the best estimates of $n_e(r)$ come from the standard solar model. We seek to ascertain, through novel application of the SDA method, whether estimates of the same from neutrino data can serve as independent constraints.</description>

      <title>Horizon-penetrating form of parametrized metrics for static and stationary black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rezzolla-Zhidenko (RZ) and Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) frameworks provide an efficient approach to characterize agnostically spherically symmetric or stationary black-hole spacetimes in arbitrary metric theories. In their original construction, these metrics were defined only in the spacetime region outside of the event horizon, where they can reproduce any black-hole metric with with percent precision and a few parameters only. At the same time, numerical simulations of accreting black holes often require metric functions that are regular across the horizon, so that the inner boundary of the computational domain can be placed in a region that is causally disconnected from the exterior. We present a novel formulation of the RZ/KRZ parametrized metrics in coordinate systems that are regular at the horizon and defined everywhere in the interior. We compare the horizon-penetrating form of the KRZ and RZ metrics with the corresponding forms of the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild coordinates and of the Schwarzschild metric in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, remarking the similarities and differences. We expect the horizon-penetrating formulations of the RZ/KRZ metrics to represent new tools to study via simulations the physical processes that occur near the horizon of an arbitrary black hole.</description>

      <title>What can be learnt from UHECR anisotropies observations Paper II: intermediate-scale anisotropies</title>

Abstract: Analysing the available data relative to the anisotropies of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) at intermediate angular scales, we examine to what extent they can be used to constrain the origin of these particles, and what could be gained from a new generation of observatories with increased exposure. We simulate realistic UHECR sky maps for a wide range of scenarios, with the assumption that the distribution of UHECR sources follows that of matter in the Universe, also considering possible biases. We produce numerous datasets on which we apply similar analyses as those recently used by the Auger and TA collaborations. We find that: i) the investigated scenarios can easily account for the significance of the anisotropies reported by Auger and TA; ii) the direction in which the maximum flux excess is found in the Auger data differs from where it is found in most of our simulations; iii) for datasets simulated with the same astrophysical scenario, the significance with which the isotropy hypothesis is rejected through the Auger likelihood analysis can be largest either when "all galaxies" or when "starburst" galaxies are used to model the signal, depending on which GMF model is used; iv) the study of the energy evolution of the anisotropy patterns can provide new insight about the origin of UHECRs; v) the direction in which the most significant flux excess is found in the Auger dataset above 8 EeV appears to essentially disappear in the dataset above 32 EeV; vi) this appears to be very uncommon in our simulations, which could point to a failure of some generic assumption in the investigated scenarios, such as the predominance of a unique type of sources in the flux above the ankle, with essentially the same composition and spectrum; vii) a meaningful measurement of their energy evolution, from 10 EeV to the highest energies, will require a significant increase in statistics.</description>

      <title>MRI turbulence in vertically stratified accretion discs at large magnetic Prandtl numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the first binary neutron star merger, GW170817, has spawned a plethora of global numerical relativity simulations. These simulations are often ideal (with dissipation determined by the grid) and/or axisymmetric (invoking ad hoc mean-field dynamos). However, binary neutron star mergers (similar to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei inner discs) are characterised by large magnetic Prandtl numbers, $\rm Pm$, (the ratio of viscosity to resistivity). $\rm Pm$ is a key parameter determining dynamo action and dissipation but it is ill-defined (and likely of order unity) in ideal simulations. To bridge this gap, we investigate the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and associated dynamo at large magnetic Prandtl numbers using fully compressible, three-dimensional, vertically stratified, isothermal simulations of a local patch of a disc. We find that, within the bulk of the disc ($z\lesssim2H$, where $H$ is the scale-height), the turbulent intensity (parameterized by the stress-to-thermal-pressure ratio $\alpha$), and the saturated magnetic field energy density, $E_\text{mag}$, produced by the MRI dynamo, both scale as a power with Pm at moderate Pm ($4\lesssim \text{Pm} \lesssim 32$): $E_\text{mag} \sim \text{Pm}^{0.74}$ and $\alpha \sim \text{Pm}^{0.71}$, respectively. At larger Pm ($\gtrsim 32$) we find deviations from power-law scaling and the onset of a plateau. Compared to our recent unstratified study, this scaling with Pm becomes weaker further away from the disc mid-plane, where the Parker instability dominates. We perform a thorough spectral analysis to understand the underlying dynamics of small-scale MRI-driven turbulence in the mid-plane and of large-scale Parker-unstable structures in the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star - White Dwarf Binaries: Probing Formation Pathways and Natal Kicks with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron star-white dwarf (NS+WD) binaries offer a unique opportunity for studying NS-specific phenomena with gravitational waves. In this paper, we employ the binary population synthesis technique to study the Galactic population of NS+WDs with the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We anticipate approximately $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ detectable NS+WDs by LISA, encompassing both circular and eccentric binaries formed via different pathways. Despite the challenge of distinguishing NS+WDs from more prevalent double white dwarfs in the LISA data (especially at frequencies below 2 mHz), we show that their eccentricity and chirp mass distributions may provide avenues to explore the NS natal kicks and common envelope evolution. Additionally, we investigate the spatial distribution of detectable NS+WDs relative to the Galactic plane and discuss prospects for identifying electromagnetic counterparts at radio wavelengths. Our results emphasise LISA's capability to detect and characterise NS+WDs and to offer insights into the properties of the underlying population. Our conclusions carry significant implications for shaping LISA data analysis strategies and future data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Disk induced binary precession: Implications for dynamics and multi-messenger observations of black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many studies have recently documented the orbital response of eccentric binaries accreting from thin circumbinary disks, characterizing the change in binary semi-major axis and eccentricity. We extend these calculations to include the precession of the binary's longitude of periapse induced by the circumbinary disk, and we characterize this precession continuously with binary eccentricity $e_b$ for equal mass components. This disk-induced apsidal precession is prograde with a weak dependence on binary eccentricity when $e_b \lesssim 0.4$ and decreases approximately linearly for $e_b \gtrsim 0.4$; yet at all $e_b$ binary precession is faster than the rates of change to the semi-major axis and eccentricity by an order of magnitude. We estimate that such precession effects are likely most important for sub-parsec separated binaries with masses $\lesssim 10^7 M_\odot$, like LISA precursors. We find that accreting, equal-mass LISA binaries with $M &lt; 10^6 M_\odot$ (and the most massive $M \sim 10^7 M_\odot$ binaries out to $z \sim 3$) may acquire a detectable phase offset due to the disk-induced precession. Moreover, disk-induced precession can compete with General Relativistic precession in vacuum, making it important for observer-dependent electromagnetic searches for accreting massive binaries -- like Doppler boost and binary self-lensing models -- after potentially only a few orbital periods.</description>

      <title>A Hubble Space Telescope Search for r-Process Nucleosynthesis in Gamma-ray Burst Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of a secondary (in addition to compact object mergers) source of heavy element ($r$-process) nucleosynthesis, the core-collapse of rapidly-rotating and highly-magnetized massive stars, has been suggested by both simulations and indirect observational evidence. Here, we probe a predicted signature of $r$-process enrichment, a late-time ($\gtrsim 40$ days post-burst) distinct red color, in observations of GRB-supernovae (GRB-SNe) which are linked to these massive star progenitors. We present optical to near-IR color measurements of four GRB-SNe at $z \lesssim 0.4$, extending out to $&gt; 500$ days post-burst, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and large-aperture ground-based telescopes. Comparison of our observations to models indicates that GRBs 030329, 100316D and 130427A are consistent with both no enrichment and producing $0.01 - 0.15 M_{\odot}$ of $r$-process material if there is a low amount of mixing between the inner $r$-process ejecta and outer SN layers. GRB 190829A is not consistent with any models with $r$-process enrichment $\geq 0.01 M_{\odot}$. Taken together the sample of GRB-SNe indicates color diversity at late times. Our derived yields from GRB-SNe may be underestimated due to $r$-process material hidden in the SN ejecta (potentially due to low mixing fractions) or the limits of current models in measuring $r$-process mass. We conclude with recommendations for future search strategies to observe and probe the full distribution of $r$-process produced by GRB-SNe.</description>

      <title>Similarity to earthquakes again: periodic radio pulses of the magnetar SGR 1935+2154 are accompanied by aftershocks like fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently discovered that the time correlations of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) are similar to earthquake aftershocks. Motivated by the association between FRBs and magnetars, here we report correlation function analyses in the time-energy space for the 563 periodic radio pulses and the 579 X-ray short bursts from the magnetar SGR 1935+2154, which is known to have generated FRBs. Although radio pulses are concentrated near the fixed phase of the rotational cycle, we find that when multiple pulses occur within a single cycle, their correlation properties (aftershock production probability, aftershock rate decaying in power of time, and more) are similar to those of extragalactic FRBs and earthquakes. A possible interpretation is that the radio pulses are produced by rupture of the neutron star crust, and the first pulse within one cycle is triggered by external force periodically exerted on the crust. The periodic external force may be from the interaction of the magnetosphere with material ejected in an outburst. For X-ray bursts, we found no significant correlation signal, though correlation on the same time scale as radio pulses may be hidden due to the long event duration. The aftershock similarity between the periodic radio pulsation and FRBs is surprising, given that the two are energetically very different, and therefore the energy sources would be different. This suggests that the essence of FRB-like phenomena is starquakes, regardless of the energy source, and it is important to search for FRB-like bursts from neutron stars with various properties or environments.</description>

Abstract: Measurement of cosmic photons may reveal their propagation in the interstellar environment, thereby offering a promising way to probe axions and axion-like particles (ALPs). Numerical methods are usually used to compute the propagation of the photon-ALP beam due to the complexity of both the interstellar magnetic field and the evolution equation. However, under certain conditions, the evolution equation can be greatly simplified so that the photon-ALP propagation can be analytically solved. By using analytic methods, we find two distinct photon-ALP propagation modes, determined by the relative magnitude of the photon-ALP mixing term in comparison to the photon attenuation term. In one mode, the intensity of photons decreases with the increasing distance; in the other mode, it also exhibits oscillatory behavior. To distinguish the two propagation modes, we compute the observable quantities such as the photon survival probability and the degree of polarization.</description>

      <title>Expansion of accreting main-sequence stars during rapid mass transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting main-sequence stars expand significantly when the mass accretion timescale is much shorter than their thermal timescales. This occurs during mass transfer from an evolved giant star onto a main-sequence companion in a binary system, and is an important phase in the formation of compact binaries including X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, and gravitational-wave sources. In this study, we compute 1D stellar models of main-sequence accretors with different initial masses and accretion rates. The calculations are used to derive semi-analytical approximations to the maximum expansion radius. We assume that mass transfer remains fully conservative as long as the inflated accretor fits within its Roche lobe, leading stars to behave like hamsters, stuffing excess material behind their expanding cheeks. We suggest a physically motivated prescription for the mass growth of such "hamstars", which can be used to determine mass-transfer efficiency in rapid binary population synthesis models. With this prescription, we estimate that progenitors of high-mass X-ray binaries and gravitational-wave sources may have experienced highly non-conservative mass transfer. In contrast, for low-mass accretors, the accretion timescale can exceed the thermal timescale by a larger factor without causing significant radial expansion.</description>

      <title>Impact of Hot Inner Crust on Compact Stars at Finite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted a study on the thermal properties of stellar matter with the nuclear energy density functional BCPM. This functional is based on microscopic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations and has demonstrated success in describing cold neutron stars. To enhance its applicability in astrophysics, in this study we extend the BCPM equation of state to finite temperature for $\beta$-stable neutrino-free matter, taking into consideration the hot inner crust. Such an equation of state holds significant importance for hot compact objects, particularly those resulting from a binary neutron star merger event. Our exploration has shown that with increasing temperature there is a fast decrease of the crust-core transition density, suggesting that for hot stars it is not realistic to assume a fixed value of this density. The microscopic calculations also reveal that the presence of nuclear clusters persists up to $T=7.21$ MeV, identified as the limiting temperature of the crust. Above this threshold, the manifestation of clusters is not anticipated. Below this temperature, clusters within the inner crust are surrounded by uniform matter with varying densities, allowing for the distinction between the upper and lower transition density branches. Moreover, we computed mass--radius relations of neutron stars, assuming an isothermal profile for $\beta$-stable neutron star matter at various temperature values. Our findings highlight the significant influence of the hot inner crust on the mass--radius relationship, leading to the formation of larger and more inflated neutron stars. Consequently, under our prescription, the final outcome is a unified equation of state at finite temperature.</description>

Abstract: In the last decade, an increasing number of datasets have revealed a consistent discrepancy between the number of muons measured in ultra-high-energy extensive air showers (EAS) and the numbers predicted by simulations. This gap persists despite incorporating Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data into the tuning of current hadronic interaction models, leading to the phenomenon often termed the ''muon puzzle''. To gain a deeper understanding of the potential origins of this muon puzzle, we have developed Sibyll$^{\bigstar}$, a series of phenomenologically modified versions of Sibyll 2.3d. In these models, we have increased muon production by altering $\rho^0$, baryon-antibaryon pair, or kaon production in hadronic multiparticle production processes. These variants remain within bounds from provided by accelerator measurements, including those from the LHC and fixed-target experiments, notably NA49 and NA61, showing a level of consistency comparable to Sibyll 2.3d. Our findings show that these modifications can increase the muon count in EAS by up to 35%, while minimally affecting the depth of shower maximum ($X_{\rm max}$) and other shower variables. Additionally, we assess the impact of these modifications on various observables, including inclusive muon and neutrino fluxes and the multiplicities of muon bundles in deep underground and water/ice Cherenkov detectors. We aim for at least one of these model variants to offer a more accurate representation of EAS data at the highest energies, thereby enhancing the quality of Monte Carlo predictions used in training neural networks. This improvement is crucial for achieving more reliable data analyses and interpretations.</description>
