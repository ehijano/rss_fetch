      <title>On the Shapes of Rational Lemniscates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rational lemniscate is a level set of $|r|$ where $r: \hat{\mathbb{C}} \rightarrow \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ is rational. We prove that any planar Euler graph can be approximated, in a strong sense, by a homeomorphic rational lemniscate. This generalizes Hilbert's lemniscate theorem; he proved that any Jordan curve can be approximated (in the same strong sense) by a polynomial lemniscate that is also a Jordan curve. As consequences, we obtain a sharp quantitative version of the classical Runge's theorem on rational approximation, and we give a new result on the approximation of planar continua by Julia sets of rational maps.</description>

      <title>Sum of the exponential and a polynomial: Singular values and Baker wandering domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the singular values of entire functions of the form $E^k (z)+P(z)$ where $E^k$ denotes the $k-$times composition of $e^z$ with itself and $P$ is any non-constant polynomial. It is proved that the full preimage of each neighborhood of $\infty$ is an infinitely connected domain without having any unbounded boundary component. Following the literature, the point at $\infty$ is called a Baker omitted value for the function in such a situation. More importantly, there are infinitely many critical values and no finite asymptotic value and in fact, the set of all critical values is found to be unbounded for these functions. We also investigate the iteration of three examples of entire functions with Baker omitted value and prove that these do not have any Baker wandering domain. There is a conjecture stating that the number of completely invariant domains of a transcendental entire function is at most one. How some of these maps are right candidates to work upon in view of this conjecture is demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: Consider the family of locally univalent analytic functions $h$ in the unit disk $|z|&lt;1$ with the normalization $h(0)=0$, $h'(0)=1$ and satisfying the condition $${\real} \left( \frac{z h''(z)}{\alpha h'(z)}\right) &lt;\frac{1}{2} ~\mbox{ for $z\in \ID$,} $$ where $0&lt;\alpha\leq1$. The aim of this article is to show that this family has several elegant properties such as involving Blaschke products, Schwarzian derivative and univalent harmonic mappings.</description>

      <title>Difference of weighted composition operators on weighted Bergman spaces over the unit Ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the boundedness and compactness of differences of weighted composition operators from weighted Bergman spaces $A^p_\omega$ induced by a doubling weight $\omega$ to Lebesgue spaces $L^q_\mu$ on the unit ball for full $0&lt;p,q&lt;\infty$, which extend many results on the unit disk. As a byproduct, a new characterization of $q$-Carleson the measure for $A^p_\omega$ in terms of the Bergman metric ball is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an extensive study on the Bergman kernel expansions and the random zeros associated with the high tensor powers of a semipositive line bundle on a complete punctured Riemann surface. We prove several results for the zeros of Gaussian holomorphic sections in the semi-classical limit, including the equidistribution, large deviation estimates, central limit theorem, and number variances.</description>

      <title>Distribution of the zeros of polynomials near the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the number of zeros of a polynomial in $\mathbb{C}[z]$ within any small circular disc centered on the unit circle, which improves and comprehensively extends a result established by Borwein, Erd{\'e}lyi, and Littmann~\cite{BE1} in 2008. Furthermore, by combining this result with Euclidean geometry, we derive an upper bound on the number of zeros of such a polynomial within a region resembling a gear wheel. Additionally, we obtain a sharp upper bound on the annular discrepancy of such zeros near the unit circle. Our approach builds upon a modified version of the method described in \cite{BE1}, combined with the refined version of the best-known upper bound for angular discrepancy of zeros of polynomials.</description>

      <title>Mixing and CLT for H\'enon-Sibony maps: plurisubharmonic observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a complex H\'enon map and $\mu$ its unique measure of maximal entropy. We prove that $\mu$ is exponentially mixing of all orders for all (not necessarily bounded) plurisubharmonic observables, and that all plurisubharmonic functions satisfy the central limit theorem with respect to $\mu$. Our results hold more generally for every H\'enon-Sibony map on $\mathbb{C}^k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of the uncertainty principle in terms of the annihilation and creation operator on generalized Segal Bargmann spaces, which are used for the FBI-Bargmann transform. In addition, we compute the Berezin transform of these operators and indicate how to use spaces of entire functions in one variable to study the Szeg\H{o} kernel for hypersurfaces in $\mathbb C^2.$</description>

      <title>On the Distributions of Product and Quotient of two Independent $\hat{I}$-function variates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of probability distributions for random variables and their algebraic combinations has been a central focus driving the advancement of probability and statistics. Since the 1920s, the challenge of calculating the probability distributions of sums, differences, products, and quotients of independent random variables have drawn the attention of numerous statisticians and mathematicians who studied the algebraic properties and relationships of random variables. Statistical distributions are highly helpful in data science and machine learning, as they provide a range of possible values for the variables, aiding in the development of a deeper understanding of the underlying problem. In this paper, we have presented a new probability distribution based on the $\hat{I}$-function. Also, we have discussed the applications of the $\hat{I}$ function, particularly in deriving the distributions of product and the quotient involving two independent $\hat{I}$ function variates. Additionally, it has been shown that both the product and quotient of two independent $\hat{I}$-function variates also follow the $\hat{I}$-function distribution. Furthermore, the new distribution, known as the $\hat{I}$-function distribution, includes several well-known classical distributions such as the gamma, beta, exponential, normal H-function, and G-function distributions, among others, as special cases. Therefore, the $\hat{I}$-function distribution can be considered a characterization or generalization of the above-mentioned distributions.</description>

      <title>Mating parabolic rational maps with Hecke groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any degree $d$ rational map having a parabolic fixed point of multiplier $1$ with a fully invariant and simply connected immediate basin of attraction is mateable with the Hecke group $H_{d+1}$, with the mating realized by an algebraic correspondence. This solves the parabolic version of the Bullett-Freiberger Conjecture from 2003 on mateability between rational maps and Hecke groups. The proof is in two steps. The first is the construction of a pinched polynomial-like map which is a mating between a parabolic rational map and a parabolic circle map associated to the Hecke group. The second is lifting this pinched polynomial-like map to an algebraic correspondence via a suitable branched covering.</description>

Abstract: Recently Brownawell and the second author proved a "non-degenerate" case of the (unproved) "Zilber Nullstellensatz" in connexion with "Strong Exponential Closure". Here we treat some significant new cases. In particular these settle completely the problem of solving polynomial-exponential equations in two complex variables. The methods of proof are also new, as is the consequence, for example, that there are infinitely many complex $z$ with $e^z+e^{1/z}=1$.</description>

      <title>Tame maximal weights, relative types and valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we obtain a class of tame maximal weights (Zhou weights). Using Tian functions (the function of jumping numbers with respect to the exponents of a holomorphic function or the multiples of a plurisubharmonic function) as a main tool, we establish an expression of relative types (Zhou numbers) to these tame maximal weights in integral form, which shows that the relative types satisfy tropical multiplicativity and tropical additivity. Thus, the relative types to Zhou weights are valuations (Zhou valuations) on the ring of germs of holomorphic functions. We use Tian functions and Zhou numbers to measure the singularities of plurisubharmonic functions, involving jumping numbers and multiplier ideal sheaves. Especially, the relative types to Zhou weights characterize the division relations of the ring of germs of holomorphic functions. Finally, we consider a global version of Zhou weights on domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$, which is a generalization of the pluricomplex Green functions, and we obtain some properties of them, including continuity and some approximation results.</description>

      <title>Random Carleson Sequences for the Hardy space on the Polydisc and the Unit Ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Kolmogorov 0-1 law for a random sequence with prescribed radii so that it generates a Carleson measure almost surely, both for the Hardy space on the polydisc and the Hardy space on the unit ball, thus providing improved versions of previous results of the first two authors and of a separate result of Massaneda. In the polydisc, the geometry of such sequences is not well understood, so we proceed by studying the random Gramians generated by random sequences, using tools from the theory of random matrices. Another result we prove, and that is of its own relevance, is the 0-1 law for a random sequence to be partitioned into M separated sequences with respect to the pseudo-hyperbolic distance, which is used also to describe the random sequences that are interpolating for the Bloch space on the unit disc almost surely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Nevanlinna theory of meromorphic mappings from a geodesic ball of a general complete K\"ahler manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature into a complex projective manifold by introducing a heat kernel method. When dimension of a target manifold is not greater than one of a source manifold, we establish a second main theorem which is a generalization of the classical second main theorem for a ball of $\mathbb C^m.$ If a source manifold is non-compact and it carries a positive global Green function, then we establish a global second main theorem for the source manifold. As a result, we obtain a Picard's theorem for complete K\"ahler manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>On the classification of Inoue surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any Inoue surface admits a unique holomorphic connection. Using this result we show that two Inoue surfaces $S=H\times\mathbb{C}/G$, $S'=H\times\mathbb{C}/G'$ are biholomorphic if and only if $G$, $G'$ are conjugate in the group of affine transformations of $H\times\mathbb{C}$. This result allows us to prove explicit classification theorems for Inoue surfaces: Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the set of ${\rm SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$-matrices $M$ with a real eigenvalue $\alpha&gt;1$ and two non-real eigenvalues, and $\mathcal{N}^\pm $ the set of ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$-matrices $N$ with a real eigenvalue $\alpha&gt;1$ and $\det(N)=\pm 1$.
  We prove that:
  For any ${\rm GL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$-similarity class $\mathfrak{M}\in \mathcal{M}/\sim$, there exists exactly two biholomorphism classes of type I Inoue surfaces.
  For any ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ similarity class $\mathfrak{N}=[N]\in \mathcal{N}^+/\sim$ and positive integer $r\in\mathbb{N}^*$, we have a finite set of deformation classes of type II Inoue surfaces. This set is parameterised by the quotient of $\mathbb{Z}^2/(I_2-N)\mathbb{Z}^2+r\mathbb{Z}^2$ by an action of the "positive centraliser" $Z^+_{{\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})}(N)$ of $N$ in ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. The set of biholomorphism types corresponding to a deformation class, endowed with its natural topology, can be identified with either $\mathbb{C}^*$ or $\mathbb{C}$.
  For any ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$-similarity class $\mathfrak{N}=[N]\in \mathcal{N}^-/\sim$ and positive integer $r\in\mathbb{N}^*$, we have a finite set of biholomorphism classes of type III Inoue surfaces. This set is parameterised by the quotient of $\mathbb{Z}^2/(I_2+N)\mathbb{Z}^2+r\mathbb{Z}^2$ by an action of $Z^+_{{\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})}(N)$.
  In both cases the group $Z^+_{{\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})}(N)$ is infinite cyclic (see section 5).</description>

      <title>On Zariski multiplicity conjecture for quasihomogeneous surfaces with non-isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a finitely determined map germ $f$ from $(\mathbb{C}^2,0)$ to $(\mathbb{C}^3,0)$. In this case, the double point curve $D(f)$ plays a fundamental role in studying the topology of the image of $f$. When $f$ is quasihomogeneous and has corank $1$, we present a characterization of the fold components of the double point curve $D(f)$. In our setting, we also consider Zariski multiplicity question for a pair of germs of (parametrized) quasihomogeneous surfaces $(\textbf{X},0)$ and $(\textbf{Y},0)$ in $(\mathbb{C}^3,0)$ with one dimensional singular set. Finally, we characterize Whitney equisingularity of an unfolding $\mathcal{F} =(f_t,t)$ of $f$ through the constancy of the Milnor number of a single plane curve in the source. This gives in some sense an answer to a question by Ruas in $1994$.</description>

      <title>Completeness of systems of inner functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For two inner functions $\vartheta,\varphi\in H^\infty$, we give a simple sufficient condition for the system $\vartheta^m,\; \varphi^n$, $m,n\in\mathbb{Z}$, to be complete in the weak-$^*$ topology of $L^\infty(\mathbb{T})$. To be precise, we show that this system is complete whenever there is an arc $I$ of the unit circle $\mathbb{T}$ such that $\vartheta$ is univalent on $I$ and $\varphi$ is univalent on $\mathbb{T}\setminus I$. As an application of this result, we describe a class of analytic curves $\Gamma$ such that $(\Gamma, \mathcal{X})$ is a Heisenberg uniqueness pair, where $\mathcal{X}$ is the lattice cross $\{(m,n)\in\mathbb{Z}^2:\, mn=0\}$. Our main result extends a theorem of Hedenmalm and Montes-Rodr\'iguez for atomic inner functions with one singularity.</description>

Abstract: We provide a general framework of estimates for convergence rates of random discrete model curves approaching Schramm Loewner Evolution (SLE) curves in the lattice size scaling limit. We show that a power-law convergence rate of an interface to an SLE curve can be derived from a power-law convergence rate for an appropriate martingale observable provided the discrete curve satisfies a specific bound on crossing events, the Kempannien-Smirnov condition, along with an estimate on the growth of the derivative of the SLE curve. We apply our framework to show that the exploration process for critical site percolation on hexagonal lattice converges to the SLE$_6$ curve with a power-law convergence rate.</description>
