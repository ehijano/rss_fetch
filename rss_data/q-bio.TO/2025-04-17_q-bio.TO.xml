      <title>Prototype-Guided Diffusion for Digital Pathology: Achieving Foundation Model Performance with Minimal Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models in digital pathology use massive datasets to learn useful compact feature representations of complex histology images. However, there is limited transparency into what drives the correlation between dataset size and performance, raising the question of whether simply adding more data to increase performance is always necessary. In this study, we propose a prototype-guided diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic pathology data at scale, enabling large-scale self-supervised learning and reducing reliance on real patient samples while preserving downstream performance. Using guidance from histological prototypes during sampling, our approach ensures biologically and diagnostically meaningful variations in the generated data. We demonstrate that self-supervised features trained on our synthetic dataset achieve competitive performance despite using ~60x-760x less data than models trained on large real-world datasets. Notably, models trained using our synthetic data showed statistically comparable or better performance across multiple evaluation metrics and tasks, even when compared to models trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our hybrid approach, combining synthetic and real data, further enhanced performance, achieving top results in several evaluations. These findings underscore the potential of generative AI to create compelling training data for digital pathology, significantly reducing the reliance on extensive clinical datasets and highlighting the efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for flow-compatible reconstruction of heart motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of cardiac chamber motion from time-resolved medical imaging modalities is of growing interest in both the clinical and biomechanical fields. Despite recent advancement, the cardiac motion reconstruction process remains complex and prone to uncertainties. Moreover, traditional assessments often focus on static comparisons, lacking assurances of dynamic consistency and physical relevance. This work introduces a novel paradigm of flow-compatible motion reconstruction, integrating anatomical imaging with flow data to ensure adherence to fundamental physical principles, such as mass and momentum conservation. The approach is demonstrated in the context of right ventricular motion, utilizing diffeomorphic mappings and multi-slice MRI to achieve dynamically consistent and physically robust reconstructions. Results show that enforcing flow compatibility within the reconstruction process is feasible and enhances the physical realism of the resulting kinematics.</description>
