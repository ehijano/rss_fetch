      <title>Denotational semantics driven simplicial homology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look at the proofs of a fragment of Linear Logic as a whole: in fact, Linear Logic's coherent semantics interprets the proofs of a given formula $A$ as faces of an abstract simplicial complex, thus allowing us to see the set of the (interpretations of the) proofs of $A$ as a geometrical space, not just a set. This point of view has never been really investigated. For a ``webbed'' denotational semantics -- say the relational one --, it suffices to down-close the set of (the interpretations of the) proofs of $A$ in order to give rise to an abstract simplicial complex whose faces do correspond to proofs of $A$. Since this space comes triangulated by construction, a natural geometrical property to consider is its homology. However, we immediately stumble on a problem: if we want the homology to be invariant w.r.t. to some notion of type-isomorphism, we are naturally led to consider the homology functor acting, at the level of morphisms, on ``simplicial relations'' rather than simplicial maps as one does in topology. The task of defining the homology functor on this modified category can be achieved by considering a very simple monad, which is almost the same as the power-set monad; but, doing so, we end up considering not anymore the homology of the original space, but rather of its transformation under the action of the monad. Does this transformation keep the homology invariant ? Is this transformation meaningful from a geometrical or logical/computational point of view ?</description>

      <title>Stability Property for the Call-by-Value $\lambda$-calculus through Taylor Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Stability Property for the call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus (CbV in the following). This result states necessary conditions under which the contexts of the CbV $\lambda$-calculus commute with intersections of approximants. This is an important non-trivial result, which implies the sequentiality of the calculus. We prove it via the tool of Taylor-resource approximation, whose power has been shown in several recent papers. This technique is usually conceived for the ordinary $\lambda$-calculus, but it can be easily defined for the CbV setting. Our proof is the adaptation of the one for the ordinary calculus using the same technique, with some minimal technical modification due to the fact that in the CbV setting one linearises terms in a slightly different way than usual (cfr. $!(A\multimap B)$ vs $!A\multimap B$). The content of this article is taken from the PhD thesis of the author.</description>

      <title>Resource approximation for the $\lambda\mu$-calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\lambda\mu$-calculus plays a central role in the theory of programming languages as it extends the Curry-Howard correspondence to classical logic. A major drawback is that it does not satisfy B\"ohm's Theorem and it lacks the corresponding notion of approximation. On the contrary, we show that Ehrhard and Regnier's Taylor expansion can be easily adapted, thus providing a resource conscious approximation theory. This produces a sensible $\lambda\mu$-theory with which we prove some advanced properties of the $\lambda\mu$-calculus, such as Stability and Perpendicular Lines Property, from which the impossibility of parallel computations follows.</description>

      <title>An Imperative Language for Verified Exact Real-Number Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Clerical, a programming language for exact real-number computation that combines first-order imperative-style programming with a limit operator for computation of real numbers as limits of Cauchy sequences. We address the semidecidability of the linear ordering of the reals by incorporating nondeterministic guarded choice, through which decisions based on partial comparison operations on reals can be patched together to give total programs. The interplay between mutable state, nondeterminism, and computation of limits is controlled by the requirement that expressions computing limits and guards modify only local state. We devise a domain-theoretic denotational semantics that uses a variant of Plotkin powerdomain construction tailored to our specific version of nondeterminism. We formulate a Hoare-style specification logic, show that it is sound for the denotational semantics, and illustrate the setup by implementing and proving correct a program for computation of $\pi$ as the least positive zero of $\sin$. The modular character of Clerical allows us to compose the program from smaller parts, each of which is shown to be correct on its own. We provide a proof-of-concept OCaml implementation of Clerical, and formally verify parts of the development, notably the soundness of specification logic, in the Coq proof assistant.</description>

      <title>On Randomized Computational Models and Complexity Classes: a Historical Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since their appearance in the 1950s, computational models capable of performing probabilistic choices have received wide attention and are nowadays pervasive in almost every areas of computer science. Their development was also inextricably linked with inquiries about computation power and resource issues. Although most crucial notions in the field are well-known, the related terminology is sometimes imprecise or misleading. The present work aims to clarify the core features and main differences between machines and classes developed in relation to randomized computation. To do so, we compare the modern definitions with original ones, recalling the context in which they first appeared, and investigate the relations linking probabilistic and counting models.</description>

      <title>Biological arrow of time: Emergence of tangled information hierarchies and self-modelling dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study open-ended evolution by focusing on computational and information-processing dynamics underlying major evolutionary transitions. In doing so, we consider biological organisms as hierarchical dynamical systems that generate regularities in their phase-spaces through interactions with their environment. These emergent information patterns can then be encoded within the organism's components, leading to self-modelling "tangled hierarchies". Our main conjecture is that when macro-scale patterns are encoded within micro-scale components, it creates fundamental tensions (computational inconsistencies) between what is encodable at a particular evolutionary stage and what is potentially realisable in the environment. A resolution of these tensions triggers an evolutionary transition which expands the problem-space, at the cost of generating new tensions in the expanded space, in a continual process. We argue that biological complexification can be interpreted computation-theoretically, within the G\"odel--Turing--Post recursion-theoretic framework, as open-ended generation of computational novelty. In general, this process can be viewed as a meta-simulation performed by higher-order systems that successively simulate the computation carried out by lower-order systems. This computation-theoretic argument provides a basis for hypothesising the biological arrow of time.</description>

      <title>Interpretable classifiers for tabular data via discretization and feature selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for computing immediately human interpretable yet accurate classifiers from tabular data. The classifiers obtained are short Boolean formulas, computed via first discretizing the original data and then using feature selection coupled with a very fast algorithm for producing the best possible Boolean classifier for the setting. We demonstrate the approach via 12 experiments, obtaining results with accuracies comparable to ones obtained via random forests, XGBoost, and existing results for the same datasets in the literature. In most cases, the accuracy of our method is in fact similar to that of the reference methods, even though the main objective of our study is the immediate interpretability of our classifiers. We also prove a new result on the probability that the classifier we obtain from real-life data corresponds to the ideally best classifier with respect to the background distribution the data comes from.</description>
