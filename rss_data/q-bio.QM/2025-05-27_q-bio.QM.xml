      <title>Sequence-Only Prediction of Binding Affinity Changes: A Robust and Interpretable Model for Antibody Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pivotal area of research in antibody engineering is to find effective modifications that enhance antibody-antigen binding affinity. Traditional wet-lab experiments assess mutants in a costly and time-consuming manner. Emerging deep learning solutions offer an alternative by modeling antibody structures to predict binding affinity changes. However, they heavily depend on high-quality complex structures, which are frequently unavailable in practice. Therefore, we propose ProtAttBA, a deep learning model that predicts binding affinity changes based solely on the sequence information of antibody-antigen complexes. ProtAttBA employs a pre-training phase to learn protein sequence patterns, following a supervised training phase using labeled antibody-antigen complex data to train a cross-attention-based regressor for predicting binding affinity changes. We evaluated ProtAttBA on three open benchmarks under different conditions. Compared to both sequence- and structure-based prediction methods, our approach achieves competitive performance, demonstrating notable robustness, especially with uncertain complex structures. Notably, our method possesses interpretability from the attention mechanism. We show that the learned attention scores can identify critical residues with impacts on binding affinity. This work introduces a rapid and cost-effective computational tool for antibody engineering, with the potential to accelerate the development of novel therapeutic antibodies.</description>

      <title>ZV-Sim: Probabilistic Simulation Framework for Pre-emergent Novel Zoonose Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ZV-Sim is an open-source, modular Python framework for probabilistic simulation and analysis of pre-emergent novel zoonotic diseases using pervasive sensing data. It incorporates customizable Human and Animal Presence agents that leverage known and simulated location data, contact networks, and illness reports to assess and predict disease origins and spread. The framework supports Monte Carlo experiments to analyze outcomes with various user-defined movement and probability models. Although initial models are basic and illustrative, ZV-Sim's extensible design facilitates the integration of more sophisticated models as richer data become available, enhancing future capabilities in zoonotic disease tracking. The source code is publicly available \href{https://github.com/jmaff/zv-sim}{\underline{\textit{here}}}.</description>

      <title>Data-driven multi-agent modelling of calcium interactions in cell culture: PINN vs Regularized Least-squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven discovery of dynamics in biological systems allows for better observation and characterization of processes, such as calcium signaling in cell culture. Recent advancements in techniques allow the exploration of previously unattainable insights of dynamical systems, such as the Sparse Identification of Non-Linear Dynamics (SINDy), overcoming the limitations of more classic methodologies. The latter requires some prior knowledge of an effective library of candidate terms, which is not realistic for a real case study. Using inspiration from fields like traffic density estimation and control theory, we propose a methodology for characterization and performance analysis of calcium delivery in a family of cells. In this work, we compare the performance of the Constrained Regularized Least-Squares Method (CRLSM) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) for system identification and parameter discovery for governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The CRLSM achieves a fairly good parameter estimate and a good data fit when using the learned parameters in the Consensus problem. On the other hand, despite the initial hypothesis, PINNs fail to match the CRLSM performance and, under the current configuration, do not provide fair parameter estimation. However, we have only studied a limited number of PINN architectures, and it is expected that additional hyperparameter tuning, as well as uncertainty quantification, could significantly improve the performance in future works.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Bacterial Colonies Count from Petri Dishes Utilizing Hough Transform and Traditional Manual Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial colony enumeration is an essential stage in microbiological research, allowing susceptibility to antibiotics assessment, monitoring of the environment, and clinical diagnostics. Traditional manual counting methods are costly and susceptible to human mistakes, prompting the creation of automated detection systems. This research compares the efficacy of the Hough Circle Transform method for automated colony detection to hand counting of E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa colonies on 200 petri plates. These bacteria are among the most clinically relevant pathogens, with E. coli frequently causing urinary tract infections, S. aureus connected with skin and bloodstream infections, and P. aeruginosa a significant issue in hospital-acquired infections. When colonies were counted automatically without visual correction, the mean difference from manual counts was 59.7%, with overestimation and underestimation occurring in 29% and 45% of cases, whereas S. aureus and P. aeruginosa had higher error rates. The proposed methodology achieved an overall accuracy of 95% for E. coli, 90% for S. aureus, and 84% for P. aeruginosa, with associated recall values of 95%, 91%, and 86%. The F-measure remained continuously high, ranging between 0.85 and 0.95. Regarding efficiency, manual counting required an average of 70 seconds per plate, while automated counting without and with visual correction took 30 seconds. Despite issues with segmentation in high-density plates, automated approaches offer a potential approach to high-throughput bacterial enumeration by decreasing labor-intensive operations while retaining adequate accuracy. Future research should enhance colony algorithmic segmentation and picture preprocessing approaches to improve detection performance, especially on crowded petri plates.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modelling and Optimisation of Athletic Performance: Tapering and Periodisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a mathematical optimisation of the training load to maximise performance for two seminal athletic performance models: the Banister et al. 1975 Fitness-Fatigue Impulse Response Model and the Busso 2003 Variable Dose-Response Model. We discuss discrepancies in the general trends of the optimised training loads compared to common training practices recommended in the sports science literature, such as tapering and periodisation. We then propose a set of interpretable nonlinear modifications in the magnitude and time response to training in the fitness-fatigue model such that the optimised training load demonstrates these trends.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Machine Learning and Mathematical Modeling for Tumor Dynamics Prediction: Comparing SPIONs against mNP-FDG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a Machine Learning guided study towards zone-specific ray therapy. Combining Machine Learning (Extreme Gradient Boosting) with continuum modeling (exponential and logistic growth), we find that while fluorodeoxyglucose-coated (mNP-FDG) can control cancerous tumor progression within 2 days compared to 18 days by Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs), for complete termination of the tumor, SPIONS (20 days) are superior compared to mNP-FDG (more than 40 days). We also provide an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) developed with Tkinter/Python that allows users to input relevant data, such as treatment type and time, to receive real-time tumor volume predictions. Our ML-guided prediction indicates joint therapy as the optimum choice, with mNP-FDG ideal for taming the tumor spread, followed by SPIONs for complete eradication, facilitating personalized cancer treatment in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Spin-Waves without Spin-Waves: A Case for Soliton Propagation in Starling Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective turns in starling flocks propagate linearly with negligible attenuation, indicating the existence of an underdamped sector in the dispersion relation. Beside granting linear propagation of the phase perturbations, the real part of the frequency should also yield a spin-wave form of the unperturbed correlation function. However, new high-resolution experiments on real flocks show that underdamped traveling waves coexist with an overdamped Lorentzian correlation. Theory and experiments are reconciled once we add to the dynamics a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou term.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Artificial Intelligence of Embryo Grading and Pregnancy Prediction in Assisted Reproductive Technology: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a global disease, infertility has always affected human beings. The development of assisted reproductive technology can effectively solve this disease. However, the traditional in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer technology still faces many challenges in improving the success rate of pregnancy, such as the subjectivity of embryo grading and the inefficiency of integrating multi-modal data. Therefore, the introduction of artificial intelligence-based technologies is particularly crucial. This article reviews the application progress of multi-modal artificial intelligence in embryo grading and pregnancy prediction based on different data modalities (including static images, time-lapse videos and structured table data) from a new perspective, and discusses the main challenges in current research, such as the complexity of multi-modal information fusion and data scarcity.</description>

      <title>Reconceptualizing Smart Microscopy: From Data Collection to Knowledge Creation by Multi-Agent Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart microscopy represents a paradigm shift in biological imaging, moving from passive observation tools to active collaborators in scientific inquiry. Enabled by advances in automation, computational power, and artificial intelligence, these systems are now capable of adaptive decision-making and real-time experimental control. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes smart microscopy as a partner in scientific investigation. Central to our framework is the concept of the 'epistemic-empirical divide' in cellular investigation-the gap between what is observable (empirical domain) and what must be understood (epistemic domain). We propose six core design principles: epistemic-empirical awareness, hierarchical context integration, an evolution from detection to perception, adaptive measurement frameworks, narrative synthesis capabilities, and cross-contextual reasoning. Together, these principles guide a multi-agent architecture designed to align empirical observation with the goals of scientific understanding. Our framework provides a roadmap for building microscopy systems that go beyond automation to actively support hypothesis generation, insight discovery, and theory development, redefining the role of scientific instruments in the process of knowledge creation.</description>

      <title>Prot2Token: A Unified Framework for Protein Modeling via Next-Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diverse nature of protein prediction tasks has traditionally necessitated specialized models, hindering the development of broadly applicable and computationally efficient Protein Language Models (PLMs). In this work, we introduce Prot2Token, a unified framework that overcomes these challenges by converting a wide spectrum of protein-related predictions, from sequence-level properties and residue-specific attributes to complex inter-protein interactions, into a standardized next-token prediction format. At its core, Prot2Token employs an autoregressive decoder, conditioned on embeddings from pre-trained protein encoders and guided by learnable task tokens, to perform diverse predictions. This architecture uniquely facilitates multi-task learning, enabling a single model to master numerous tasks with improved efficiency. We present extensive experimental validation across a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating Prot2Tokens strong predictive power in different types of protein-prediction tasks. Key results include significant speedups (e.g., near 1000x over AlphaFold2 with MSA) and performance often matching or exceeding specialized approaches. Beyond that, we introduce an auxiliary self-supervised decoder pre-training approach to improve spatially sensitive task performance. Prot2Token thus offers a significant step towards a versatile, high-throughput paradigm for protein modeling, promising to accelerate biological discovery and the development of novel therapeutics. The code is available at https://github.com/mahdip72/prot2token .</description>

      <title>Developing hybrid mechanistic and data-driven personalized prediction models for platelet dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hematotoxicity, drug-induced damage to the blood-forming system, is a frequent side effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy and poses a significant challenge in clinical practice due to its high inter-patient variability and limited predictability. Current mechanistic models often struggle to accurately forecast outcomes for patients with irregular or atypical trajectories. In this study, we develop and compare hybrid mechanistic and data-driven approaches for individualized time series modeling of platelet counts during chemotherapy. We consider hybrid models that combine mechanistic models with neural networks, known as universal differential equations. As a purely data-driven alternative, we utilize a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model using gated recurrent units as the underlying architecture. These models are evaluated across a range of real patient scenarios, varying in data availability and sparsity, to assess predictive performance. Our findings demonstrate that data-driven methods, when provided with sufficient data, significantly improve prediction accuracy, particularly for high-risk patients with irregular platelet dynamics. This highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in enhancing clinical decision-making. In contrast, hybrid and mechanistic models are superior in scenarios with limited or sparse data. The proposed modeling and comparison framework is generalizable and could be extended to predict other treatment-related toxicities, offering broad applicability in personalized medicine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in adults under 55, involving a complex interplay of biological processes such as dendritic cell (DC) maturation and migration, T cell activation and proliferation, cytokine production, and T cell and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cancer cell killing. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC constitute 15% of all CRC, and 4% of metastatic CRC, and exhibit remarkable responsiveness to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab. Mathematical models of the underlying immunobiology and the interactions underpinning immune checkpoint blockade offer mechanistic insights into tumour-immune dynamics and provide avenues for treatment optimisation and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. We used our data-driven model of de novo metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC (dnmMCRC) and performed sensitivity analysis-guided model reduction using the FAST and EFAST methods. In this work, we constructed two simplified models of dnmMCRC: one that faithfully reproduces all of the original model's trajectories, and a second, minimal model that accurately replicates the original dynamics while being highly extensible for future inclusion of additional components to explore various aspects of the anti-tumour immune response.</description>

      <title>GeLLMO: Generalizing Large Language Models for Multi-property Molecule Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements, most computational methods for molecule optimization are constrained to single- or double-property optimization tasks and suffer from poor scalability and generalizability to novel optimization tasks. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable out-of-domain generalizability to novel tasks. To demonstrate LLMs' potential for molecule optimization, we introduce MuMOInstruct, the first high-quality instruction-tuning dataset specifically focused on complex multi-property molecule optimization tasks. Leveraging MuMOInstruct, we develop GeLLMOs, a series of instruction-tuned LLMs for molecule optimization. Extensive evaluations across 5 in-domain and 5 out-of-domain tasks demonstrate that GeLLMOs consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines. GeLLMOs also exhibit outstanding zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, significantly outperforming powerful closed-source LLMs. Such strong generalizability demonstrates the tremendous potential of GeLLMOs as foundational models for molecule optimization, thereby tackling novel optimization tasks without resource-intensive retraining. MuMOInstruct, models, and code are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/GeLLMO.</description>

      <title>Exact identifiability analysis for a class of partially observed near-linear stochastic differential equation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochasticity plays a key role in many biological systems, necessitating the calibration of stochastic mathematical models to interpret associated data. For model parameters to be estimated reliably, it is typically the case that they must be structurally identifiable. Yet, while theory underlying structural identifiability analysis for deterministic differential equation models is highly developed, there are currently no tools for the general assessment of stochastic models. In this work, we extend the well-established differential algebra framework for structural identifiability analysis to linear and a class of near-linear, two-dimensional, partially observed stochastic differential equation (SDE) models. Our framework is based on a deterministic recurrence relation that describes the dynamics of the statistical moments of the system of SDEs. From this relation, we iteratively form a series of necessarily satisfied equations involving only the observed moments, from which we are able to establish structurally identifiable parameter combinations. We demonstrate our framework for a suite of linear (two- and $n$-dimensional) and non-linear (two-dimensional) models. Most importantly, we define the notion of structural identifiability for SDE models and establish the effect of the initial condition on identifiability. We conclude with a discussion on the applicability and limitations of our approach, and potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>Prompting Decision Transformers for Zero-Shot Reach-Avoid Policies</title>

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning methods have shown promise for reach-avoid tasks, where an agent must reach a target state while avoiding undesirable regions of the state space. Existing approaches typically encode avoid-region information into an augmented state space and cost function, which prevents flexible, dynamic specification of novel avoid-region information at evaluation time. They also rely heavily on well-designed reward and cost functions, limiting scalability to complex or poorly structured environments. We introduce RADT, a decision transformer model for offline, reward-free, goal-conditioned, avoid region-conditioned RL. RADT encodes goals and avoid regions directly as prompt tokens, allowing any number of avoid regions of arbitrary size to be specified at evaluation time. Using only suboptimal offline trajectories from a random policy, RADT learns reach-avoid behavior through a novel combination of goal and avoid-region hindsight relabeling. We benchmark RADT against 3 existing offline goal-conditioned RL models across 11 tasks, environments, and experimental settings. RADT generalizes in a zero-shot manner to out-of-distribution avoid region sizes and counts, outperforming baselines that require retraining. In one such zero-shot setting, RADT achieves 35.7% improvement in normalized cost over the best retrained baseline while maintaining high goal-reaching success. We apply RADT to cell reprogramming in biology, where it reduces visits to undesirable intermediate gene expression states during trajectories to desired target states, despite stochastic transitions and discrete, structured state dynamics.</description>

      <title>Transformers in Protein: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As protein informatics advances rapidly, the demand for enhanced predictive accuracy, structural analysis, and functional understanding has intensified. Transformer models, as powerful deep learning architectures, have demonstrated unprecedented potential in addressing diverse challenges across protein research. However, a comprehensive review of Transformer applications in this field remains lacking. This paper bridges this gap by surveying over 100 studies, offering an in-depth analysis of practical implementations and research progress of Transformers in protein-related tasks. Our review systematically covers critical domains, including protein structure prediction, function prediction, protein-protein interaction analysis, functional annotation, and drug discovery/target identification. To contextualize these advancements across various protein domains, we adopt a domain-oriented classification system. We first introduce foundational concepts: the Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms, categorize Transformer variants tailored for protein science, and summarize essential protein knowledge. For each research domain, we outline its objectives and background, critically evaluate prior methods and their limitations, and highlight transformative contributions enabled by Transformer models. We also curate and summarize pivotal datasets and open-source code resources to facilitate reproducibility and benchmarking. Finally, we discuss persistent challenges in applying Transformers to protein informatics and propose future research directions. This review aims to provide a consolidated foundation for the synergistic integration of Transformer and protein informatics, fostering further innovation and expanded applications in the field.</description>
