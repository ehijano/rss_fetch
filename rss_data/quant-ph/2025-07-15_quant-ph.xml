      <title>Formal Verification of Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are a central component of many quantum machine learning algorithms, offering a hybrid quantum-classical framework that, under certain aspects, can be considered similar to classical deep neural networks. A shared aspect is, for instance, their vulnerability to adversarial inputs, small perturbations that can lead to incorrect predictions. While formal verification techniques have been extensively developed for classical models, no comparable framework exists for certifying the robustness of VQCs. Here, we present the first in-depth theoretical and practical study of the formal verification problem for VQCs. Inspired by abstract interpretation methods used in deep learning, we analyze the applicability and limitations of interval-based reachability techniques in the quantum setting. We show that quantum-specific aspects, such as state normalization, introduce inter-variable dependencies that challenge existing approaches. We investigate these issues by introducing a novel semantic framework based on abstract interpretation, where the verification problem for VQCs can be formally defined, and its complexity analyzed. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on standard verification benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer R\'{e}nyi Entropy Encodes Fusion Rules of Topological Defects and Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy (SRE), a computable measure of quantum magic, can serve as an information-theoretic probe for universal properties associated with conformal defects in one-dimensional quantum critical systems. Using boundary conformal field theory, we show that open boundaries manifest as a universal logarithmic correction to the SRE, whereas topological defects yield a universal size-independent term. When multiple defects are present, we find that the universal terms in the SRE faithfully reflect the defect-fusion rules that define noninvertible symmetry algebra. These analytical predictions are corroborated by numerical calculations of the Ising model, where boundaries and topological defects are described by Cardy states and Verlinde lines, respectively.</description>

      <title>Optimal Calibration of Qubit Detuning and Crosstalk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing and calibrating physical qubits is essential for maintaining the performance of quantum processors. A key challenge in this process is the presence of crosstalk that complicates the estimation of individual qubit detunings. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for estimating detuning and crosstalk parameters by optimizing Ramsey interference experiments using Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. We compare several calibration protocols, including measurements of a single quadrature at multiple times and of two quadratures at a single time, for a fixed number of total measurements. Our results predict that the latter approach yields the highest precision and robustness in both cases of isolated and coupled qubits. We validate experimentally our approach using a single NV center as well as superconducting transmons. Our approach enables accurate parameter extraction with significantly fewer measurements, resulting in up to a 50\% reduction in calibration time while maintaining estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Purity in Open Systems: A Breakdown of the Lindblad Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effectiveness of Lindblad master equation in capturing the short-time dynamics of entanglement and purity in open quantum systems. Focusing on two interacting two-level systems interacting with a larger environment, we compare the Lindbladian approach to a full microscopic treatment. While the latter shows entanglement growth and a quadratic decay of purity, the Lindbladian method predicts a linear purity decay and can entirely suppress entanglement when the dissipative coupling exceeds the interaction strength. Introducing a time-dependent Lindbladian improves some predictions but causes inconsistencies in other observables. Our results highlight the limitations of effective models and the need for caution when applying them to describe subtle quantum behaviors.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum transport on a ring via locally monitored chiral quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.</description>

      <title>Data-insenstive cooling of polar molecules with Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to sympathetically cool polar molecules with Rydberg atoms without destroying the quantum information encoded in the polar molecules. While the interactions between the two are usually state-dependent, we show how to engineer state-insensitive interactions between the hot molecules and the cold atoms with a suitable choice of internal states and the application of external fields. The resulting interactions, which may be van der Waals or dipolar, induce a phonon swap interaction between the two species, thereby coherently cooling the polar molecules without affecting the internal state, a process which can be repeated if the atoms are cooled again or new cold atoms are brought in. Our cooling schemes open the possibility of extending quantum computation and simulation times in emerging hybrid tweezer arrays of polar molecules and neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Manarat: A Scalable QICK-Based Control System for Superconducting Quantum Processors Supporting Synchronized Control of 10 Flux-Tunable Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scalable control architecture for superconducting quantum processors is essential as the number of qubits increases and coherent multi-qubit operations span beyond the capacity of a single control module. The Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit (QICK), built on AMD RFSoC platforms, offers a flexible open-source framework for pulse-level qubit control but lacks native support for multi-board synchronization, limiting its applicability to mid- and large-scale quantum devices. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Manarat, a scalable multi-board control platform based on QICK that incorporates hardware, firmware, and software enhancements to enable sub-100 ps timing alignment across multiple AMD ZCU216 RFSoC boards. Our system integrates a low-jitter clock distribution network, modifications to the tProcessor, and a synchronization scheme to ensure deterministic alignment of program execution across boards. It also includes a custom analog front-end for flux control that combines high-speed RF signals with software-programmable DC biasing voltages generated by a low-noise, high-precision DAC. These capabilities are complemented by a software stack capable of orchestrating synchronized multi-board experiments and fully integrated with the open-source Qibo framework for quantum device calibration and algorithm execution. We validate Manarat on a 10-qubit superconducting processor controlled by two RFSoC boards, demonstrating reliable execution of synchronized control sequences for cross-board CZ gate calibration. These results confirm that sub-nanosecond synchronization and coherent control is achievable across multiple RFSoC boards, enabling scalable operation of superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Magic transition in monitored free fermion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate magic and its connection to entanglement in 1+1 dimensional random free fermion circuits, with a focus on hybrid free fermion dynamics that can exhibit an entanglement phase transition. To quantify magic, we use the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), which we compute numerically via a perfect sampling algorithm. We show that although the SRE remains extensive as the system transitions from a critical phase to an area-law (disentangled) phase, the structure of magic itself undergoes a delocalization phase transition. This transition is characterized using the bipartite stabilizer mutual information, which exhibits the same scaling behavior as entanglement entropy: logarithmic scaling in the critical phase and a finite constant in the area-law phase. Additionally, we explore the dynamics of SRE. While the total SRE becomes extensive in $O(1)$ time, we find that in the critical phase, the relaxation time to the steady-state value is parameterically longer than that in generic random circuits. The relaxation follows a universal form, with a relaxation time that grows linearly with the system size, providing further evidence for the critical nature of the phase.</description>

      <title>Classifying locally distinguishable sets: No activation across bipartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of orthogonal quantum states is said to be locally indistinguishable if they cannot be perfectly distinguished by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Otherwise, the states are locally distinguishable. However, locally indistinguishable states may find applications in information processing protocols. In this sense, locally indistinguishable states are useful. On the other hand, it is usual to consider that locally distinguishable states are useless. Nevertheless, recent works suggest that locally distinguishable states should be given due consideration as in certain situations these states can be converted to locally indistinguishable states under orthogonality-preserving LOCC (OP-LOCC). Such a counterintuitive phenomenon motivates us to ask when the aforesaid conversion is possible and when it is not. In this work, we provide different structures of locally distinguishable product and entangled states which do not allow the aforesaid conversion. We also provide certain structures of locally distinguishable states which allow the aforesaid conversion. In this way, we classify the locally distinguishable sets by introducing hierarchies among them. In a multipartite system, this study becomes more involved as there exist multipartite locally distinguishable sets which cannot be converted to locally indistinguishable sets by OP-LOCC across any bipartition. We say this as ``no activation across bi-partitions".</description>

      <title>Compilation ofQCrank Encoding Algorithm for a Dynamically Programmable Qubit Array Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithm and hardware-aware compilation co-design is essential for the efficient deployment of near-term quantum programs. We present a compilation case-study implementing QCrank -- an efficient encoding protocol for storing sequenced real-valued classical data in a quantum state -- targeting neutral atom-based Dynamically Programmable Qubit Arrays (DPQAs). We show how key features of neutral-atom arrays such as high qubits count, operation parallelism, multi-zone architecture, and natively reconfigurable connectivity can be used to inform effective algorithm deployment. We identify algorithmic and circuit features that signal opportunities to implement them in a hardware-efficient manner. To evaluate projected hardware performance, we define a realistic noise model for DPQAs using parameterized Pauli channels, implement it in Qiskit circuit simulators, and assess QCrank's accuracy for writing and reading back 24-320 real numbers into 6-20 qubits. We compare DPQA results with simulated performances of Quantinuum's H1-1E and with experimental results from IBM Fez, highlighting promising accuracy scaling for DPQAs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs the first quantum algorithm for wavelet packet transforms with a tree structure, sometimes called wave atom transforms. Classically, wave atoms are used to construct sparse representations of differential operators, which enable fast numerical algorithms for partial differential equations. Compared to previous work, our quantum algorithm can implement a larger class of wavelet and wave atom transforms, by using an efficient representation for a larger class of possible tree structures. Our quantum implementation has $O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ gate complexity for the transform of dimension $2^n$, while classical implementations have $O(n 2^n)$ floating point operations. The result can be used to improve existing quantum algorithms for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to using Pauli Path Simulators for Utility-Scale Quantum Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this this paper we present an inexpensive protocol to perform runtime and memory estimation for large-scale experiments with Pauli Path simulators (PPS). Additionally, we propose a conceptually simple solution for studying whether PPS can be used as a scientific discovery tool, rather than reproducing existing answers. We start by analyzing the dynamics of the Pauli coefficients tracked in the Heisenberg picture. In addition to surprisingly generic convergence features of the Pauli coefficient distributions, we find certain regularities that allow for extrapolation of memory and runtime requirements for smaller and smaller coefficient truncation parameter $\delta$. We then introduce a framework for understanding convergence in the absence of rigorous error guarantees on PPS. Combined with runtime analysis, we propose bifurcating quantum simulation problems broadly into two classes, based on whether there is apparent convergence of expectation values as a function of $\delta$. This serves as a way for practitioners to understand where their problem falls on the frontier of classical simulability. In the case without apparent convergence, PPS may still serve useful as a Monte Carlo-like estimate. Applied to IBM's utility-scale experiments, we show parameter regimes where both behaviors are realized. Some of our key findings challenge conventional intuition: reducing $\delta$ does not always improve accuracy, and deeper quantum circuits may actually be easier to simulate than shallower ones. The BlueQubit SDK implementing these methods has been released publicly, offering researchers a comprehensive toolkit for evaluating this frontier classical simulation approach. These results establish practical guidelines for when PPS can serve as a reliable verification tool versus when it should be used as a complementary estimate alongside quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and magic on the light-front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the light-front (LF) formulation of quantum field theory (QFT), physics is formulated from the perspective of a massless observer necessarily traveling at the speed of light. The LF formulation provides an alternative computational approach to lattice gauge theory, and has recently been investigated as a future application of quantum computers. A natural question is how quantum resources such as entanglement and contextuality amongst physical qubits in the laboratory are utilized in LF simulations of QFTs. We use the (1+1)D transverse-field Ising model to explore this question. We derive the LF energy operator that generates the LF dynamics of the system, which is distinct from the instant-form (IF) Hamiltonian. We find that while the eigenstates of the IF Hamiltonian exhibit pairwise entanglement between positive and negative momenta in IF momentum-space, the eigenstates of the LF Hamiltonian are separable in LF momentum-space. We then calculate the momentum-space magic of the IF-momentum-space ground state and show that it always requires more magic to prepare than the LF-momentum-space ground state. At the quantum critical point, corresponding to a massless free fermion, both LF and IF ground states are stabilizers, but the LF ground state is separable in LF momentum-space while the IF ground state is a product of maximally entangled pairs in IF momentum-space. These results show that quantum resources such as entanglement and magic are utilized differently by quantum simulations formulated in LF and IF, and that the simplicity of the LF ground state results in fewer required quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Storage and Retrieval of Isometry Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Storage and retrieval refer to the task of encoding a quantum channel $\Lambda$ into a quantum state, known as the program state, such that the channel can later be retrieved. This task is closely related to quantum channel estimation, where multiple queries to $\Lambda$ are used to prepare a quantum state $\phi_\Lambda$ that encodes information about the channel. The channel can then be retrieved by measuring $\phi_\Lambda$, following a measure-and-prepare strategy. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic performance of the estimation-based strategy for storage and retrieval of isometry channels. We show that the optimal fidelity for isometry estimation is given by $F = 1-{d(D-d)\over n} + O(n^{-2})$, where $d$ and $D$ denote the input and output dimensions of the isometry, and $n$ is the number of queries. This result indicates that, unlike in the case of unitary channels, the estimation-based strategy is suboptimal for the storage and retrieval of isometry channels, which requires $n = \Theta(\epsilon^{-1})$ to achieve the diamond-norm error $\epsilon$. To address this limitation, we propose a more efficient protocol based on port-based teleportation, which stores the isometry channel in a program state using only $n = \Theta(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ queries. As an application, we extend our approach to general quantum channels, achieving improved program cost compared to prior results by Gschwedtner, Bluhm, and Winter [Quantum $\textbf{5}$, 488 (2021)].</description>

      <title>Facets of Non-locality and Advantage in Entanglement-Assisted Classical Communication Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal key connections between non-locality and advantage in correlation-assisted classical communication. First, using the wire-cutting technique, we provide a Bell inequality tailored to any correlation-assisted bounded classical communication task. The violation of this inequality by a quantum correlation is equivalent to its quantum-assisted advantage in the corresponding communication task. Next, we introduce wire-reading, which leverages the readability of classical messages to demonstrate advantageous assistance of non-local correlations in setups where no such advantage can be otherwise observed. Building on this, we introduce families of classical communication tasks in a Bob-without-input prepare-and-measure scenario, where non-local correlation enhances bounded classical communication while shared randomness assistance yields strictly suboptimal payoff. For the first family of tasks, assistance from any non-local facet leads to optimal payoff, while each task in the second family is tailored to a non-local facet. We reveal quantum advantage in these tasks, including qutrit over qubit entanglement advantage.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to quantum resource theories and a new class of free operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum resource theories (QRTs) certain quantum states and operations are deemed more valuable than others. While the determination of the ``free'' elements is usually guided by the constraints of some experimental setup, this can make it difficult to study similarities and differences between QRTs. In this work, we argue that QRTs follow from the choice of a preferred algebraic structure $\mathcal{E}$ to be preserved, thus setting the free operations as the automorphisms of $\mathcal{E}$. We illustrate our finding by determining $\mathcal{E}$ for the QRTs of entanglement, Clifford stabilizerness, purity, imaginarity, fermionic Gaussianity, reference frames, thermodynamics and coherence; showing instances where $\mathcal{E}$ is a Lie algebra, group, ring, or even a simple set. This unified understanding allows us to generalize the concept of stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) to identify novel resource non-increasing operations for Lie-algebra based QRTs, thus finding a new solution to an open problem in the literature. We showcase the sanity of our new set of operations by rigorously proving that they map free states to free states, as well as determine more general situations where these transformations strictly do not increase the resource of a state.</description>

      <title>Higher spin Richardson-Gaudin model with time-dependent coupling: Exact dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the exact asymptotic many-body wavefunction of a spin-$s$ Richardson-Gaudin model with a coupling inversely proportional to time, for time evolution starting from the ground state at $t = 0^+$ and for arbitrary $s$. Contrary to common belief, the resulting wavefunction cannot be derived from the spin-$1/2$ case by merging spins, but instead requires independent treatment for each spin size. The steady state is non-thermal and, in contrast to the spin-$1/2$ case, does not conform to a natural Generalized Gibbs Ensemble. We show that mean-field theory is exact for any product of a finite number of spin operators on different sites. We discuss how these findings can be probed in cavity QED and trapped ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Hawking time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the numerical observation of a time crystal in a quantum black-hole laser (BHL), where the genuine spontaneous character of the symmetry breaking stems from the self-amplification of spontaneous Hawking radiation. The resulting Hawking time crystal (HTC) is characterized by the periodic dependence of the out-of-time density-density correlation function, while equal-time correlations are time-independent because they embody averages over different realizations with a random oscillation phase. The HTC can be regarded as a nonlinear periodic version of the Andreev-Hawking effect, signaled by anticorrelation bands resulting from the spontaneous, quantum emission of pairs of dispersive waves and solitons into the upstream and downstream regions.</description>

      <title>Time-series forecasting for nonlinear high-dimensional system using hybrid method combining autoencoder and multi-parallelized quantum long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A time-series forecasting method for high-dimensional spatial data is proposed. The method involves optimal selection of sparse sensor positions to efficiently represent the spatial domain, time-series forecasting at these positions, and estimation of the entire spatial distribution from the forecasted values via a learned decoder. Sensor positions are selected using a method based on combinatorial optimization. Introducing multi-parallelized quantum long short-term memory (MP-QLSTM) and gated recurrent unit (MP-QGRU) improves time-series forecasting performance by extending QLSTM models using the same number of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) as the cell state dimensions. Unlike the original QLSTM, our method fully measures all qubits in each VQC, maximizing the representation capacity. MP-QLSTM and MP-QGRU achieve approximately 1.5% lower test loss than classical LSTM and GRU. The root mean squared percentage error of MP-QLSTM is 0.256% against the values measured independently using semiconductor pressure sensors, demonstrating the method's accuracy and effectiveness for high-dimensional forecasting tasks.</description>

      <title>Entanglement production in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model and its variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how quantum chaotic systems generate entanglement can provide insight into their microscopic chaotic dynamics and can help distinguish between different classes of chaotic behavior. Using von Neumann entanglement entropy, we study a nonentangled state evolved under three variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with a finite number of Majorana fermions $N$. All the variants exhibit linear entanglement growth at early times, which at late times saturates to a universal value consistent with random matrix theory (RMT), but their growth rates differ. We interpret this as a large-$N$ effect, arising from the enhanced non-locality of fermionic operators in SYK and binary SYK, absent in spin operators of the spin-SYK model. Numerically, we find that these differences emerge gradually with increasing $N$. Although all variants are quantum chaotic, their entanglement dynamics reflect varying degrees of chaos and indicate that the entanglement production rate serves as a fine-grained probe of chaos beyond conventional measures. To probe its effect on thermalization properties of these models, we study the two-point autocorrelation function, finding no differences between the SYK variants, but deviations from RMT predictions for $N \geq 24$, particularly near the crossover from exponential decay to saturation regime.</description>

      <title>An Optimization-Free Recursive QAOA for the Binary Paint Shop Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical outer optimisation loop of the classical-quantum hybrid Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) can be bypassed by transferring precomputed parameters to larger unseen problem instances using the parameter concentration property found in certain classes of problem instances. In this paper, parameter transfer is applied to the recursive-QAOA (RQAOA) approach of Bravyi et al. implementing the Binary Paint Shop Problem (BPSP) -- an optimisation problem found in manufacturing where a sequence of cars are to be painted under certain constraints while minimising the number of colour changes between cars. The BPSP can be conveniently formulated as an Ising ground state problem with a symmetric Hamiltonian and Ising graph structure that is well-suited for QAOA parameter-transfer techniques. Throughout our quantum simulated experiments, parameter transfer showed no noticeable reduction in solution quality over optimisation for QAOA and RQAOA while substantially improving the efficiency due to avoiding measurements required for optimisation. Additionally, RQAOA only requires measurements of $ZZ$-correlations instead of full statevectors, benefiting from the reverse-causal-cone feature that leads to circuits with significantly lower CNOT counts and depths. The performance of QAOA and RQAOA with parameter transfer is benchmarked against classical solvers and heuristics and their resilience to non-optimal parameters is explored. The entanglement entropy and bond dimensions are obtained from matrix product state simulations to provide an indication of the classical resources required to simulate the quantum algorithms. Circuit sizes and measurement counts are compared between the implementations.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for solving McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo integration, a quantum algorithm for calculating expectations that provides a quadratic speed-up compared to its classical counterpart, is now attracting increasing interest in the context of its industrial and scientific applications. In this paper, we propose the first application of QMCI to solving McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MVSDEs), a nonlinear class of SDEs whose drift and diffusion coefficients depend on the law $\mu_t$ of the solution $X_t$ -- appearing in fields such as finance and fluid mechanics. We focus on the problem setting where the coefficients depend on $\mu_t$ through expectations of some functions $\mathbb{E}[\varphi_k(X_t)]$, and the goal is to compute the expectation of a function $\mathbb{E}[\phi(X_T)]$ at a terminal time $T$. We devise a quantum algorithm that leverages QMCI to compute these expectations, combined with a high-order time discretization method for SDEs and extrapolation of the expectations in time. The proposed algorithm estimates $\mathbb{E}[\phi(X_T)]$ with accuracy $\epsilon$, making $O(1/\epsilon^{1+2/p})$ queries to the quantum circuit for time evolution over one step, where $p\in(1,2]$ is the weak order of the SDE discretization method. This demonstrates the speed-up over the well-known classical algorithm called the particle method with complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^3)$. We conduct a numerical demonstration of our quantum algorithm applied to an example of MVSDEs, with some parts emulated classically, and observe that the accuracy and complexity behave as expected.</description>

      <title>Towards a Utility-Scale Quantum Edge Detection for Real-World Medical Image Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a two-level decomposition strategy to enhance the quality and performance of Quantum Hadamard Edge Detection (QHED) for practical image analysis on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. A Data-Level Decomposition partitions an input image into P augmented sub-images, each encoded into a separate quantum circuit. Each of these circuits is then further cut via Circuit-Level Decomposition into Q smaller sub-circuits suitable for execution on near-term quantum devices. The two-level P $\times$ Q decomposition, along with optimizations we introduced, achieves over 62\% reductions in circuit depth and approximately 93\% fewer two-qubit operations, while maintaining a fidelity exceeding 95.6\% under realistic IBM noise models for 5-qubit data input sizes. These results demonstrate the feasibility of performing high-fidelity QHED on NISQ hardware and provide lessons and early evidence of distributed utility scale quantum computing, further illustrated by processing raw k-space MRI data with an Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform and a distributed simulation of the modified QHED on large 2D and 3D MRI datasets.</description>

      <title>SU(1,1) coherent states for the Dunkl- Klein-Gordon equation in its canonical form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using representation-theoretic techniques associated with the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ symmetry algebra, we construct Perelomov coherent states for the Dunkl-Klein-Gordon equation in its canonical form, which is free of first-order Dunkl derivatives. Our analysis is restricted to the even-parity sector and to the regime where the curvature constant $R$ is much smaller than the system's kinetic energy. The equation under consideration emerges from a matrix-operator framework based on Dirac gamma matrices and a universal length scale that encodes the curvature of space via the Dunkl operator, thereby circumventing the need for spin connections in the Dirac equation.</description>

      <title>Rapid mixing for Gibbs states within a logical sector: a dynamical view of self-correcting quantum memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-correcting quantum memories store logical quantum information for exponential time in thermal equilibrium at low temperatures. By definition, these systems are slow mixing. This raises the question of how the memory state, which we refer to as the Gibbs state within a logical sector, is created in the first place.
  In this paper, we show that for a broad class of self-correcting quantum memories on lattices with parity check redundancies, a quasi-local quantum Gibbs sampler rapidly converges to the corresponding low-temperature Gibbs state within a logical sector when initialized from a ground state. This illustrates a dynamical view of self-correcting quantum memories, where the "syndrome sector" rapidly converges to thermal equilibrium, while the "logical sector" remains metastable. As a key application, when initialized from a random ground state, this gives a rapid Gibbs state preparation algorithm for the 4D toric code in $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ depth. The main technical ingredients behind our approach are new, low-temperature decay-of-correlation properties for these metastable states.</description>

Abstract: This paper offers a brief reflection on H. Nikolic's response to the experimental findings of Sharoglazova et al., which challenge Bohmian mechanics. While Nikolic's revision satisfies the continuity equation, it reintroduces assumptions he seeks to avoid and overlooks key empirical and nonlocal aspects of the system. These issues underscore unresolved tensions in applying Bohmian mechanics to complex, interacting regimes.</description>

      <title>A Noise-Aware Scalable Subspace Classical Optimizer for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ANASTAARS, a noise-aware scalable classical optimizer for variational quantum algorithms such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). ANASTAARS leverages adaptive random subspace strategies to efficiently optimize the ansatz parameters of a QAOA circuit, in an effort to address challenges posed by a potentially large number of QAOA layers. ANASTAARS iteratively constructs random interpolation models within low-dimensional affine subspaces defined via Johnson--Lindenstrauss transforms. This adaptive strategy allows the selective reuse of previously acquired measurements, significantly reducing computational costs associated with shot acquisition. Furthermore, to robustly handle noisy measurements, ANASTAARS incorporates noise-aware optimization techniques by estimating noise magnitude and adjusts trust-region steps accordingly. Numerical experiments demonstrate the practical scalability of the proposed method for near-term quantum computing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the unitary variational quantum-neural hybrid eigensolver (U-VQNHE), which improves upon the original VQNHE by enforcing unitary neural transformations. The non-unitary nature of VQNHE causes normalization issues and divergence of the loss function during training, leading to exponential scaling of measurement overhead with qubit number. U-VQNHE resolves these issues, significantly reduces required measurements, and retains improved accuracy and stability over standard variational quantum eigensolvers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the light of recent advances in fabricating single layer quantum chips and a possible road toward development of multi-layer quantum chips, we review, in a detailed way, the subject of quantum state transfer with particular emphasis on perfect quantum state transfer in two and three dimensional lattices. We show how one can route an unknown quantum state from one node in a single layer of a quantum chip to another one on another layer with unit fidelity.
  Our method of presentation in this review allows the reader with a modest background in quantum mechanics to grasp the essential ideas and methods of this important branch of quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>New Localizable Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we have addressed an ambiguity in the concept of localizable entanglement (LE) introduced by Verstraete et al in 2004. By doing so, we have proposed and explored a unique form of this entanglement, called new localizable entanglement (NLE). We have shown that NLE is always less than or equal to LE. Additionally, we have demonstrated that for systems with three components, NLE does not differ significantly from LE. However, when the number of components increases to four, there is a possibility of significant differences between the two methods. Furthermore, as the number of components increases further, this difference becomes slightly more pronounced. It appears that the classical correlation, which is the lower bound for LE, is also a lower bound for NLE.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Resource for Exponential Advantage in Quantum Channel Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resources enable us to achieve an exponential advantage in learning the properties of unknown physical systems by employing quantum memory. While entanglement with quantum memory is recognized as a necessary qualitative resource, its quantitative role remains less understood. In this work, we distinguish between two fundamental resources provided by quantum memory -- entanglement and ancilla qubits -- and analyze their separate contributions to the sampling complexity of quantum learning. Focusing on the task of Pauli channel learning, a prototypical example of quantum channel learning, remarkably, we prove that vanishingly small entanglement in the input state already suffices to accomplish the learning task with only a polynomial number of channel queries in the number of qubits. In contrast, we show that without a sufficient number of ancilla qubits, even learning partial information about the channel demands an exponentially large sample complexity. Thus, our findings reveal that while a large amount of entanglement is not necessary, the dimension of the quantum memory is a crucial resource. Hence, by identifying how the two resources contribute differently, our work offers deeper insight into the nature of the quantum learning advantage.</description>

      <title>Quantum Power Iteration Unified Using Generalized Quantum Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unifying framework for quantum power-method-based algorithms through the lens of generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP): we apply GQSP to realize quantum analogues of classical power iteration, power Lanczos, inverse iteration, and folded spectrum methods, all within a single coherent framework. Our approach is efficient in terms of the number of queries to the block encoding of a Hamiltonian. Also, our approach can avoid Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. We constructed quantum circuits for GQSP-based quantum power methods, estimated the number of queries, and numerically verified that this framework works. We additionally benchmark various quantum power methods with molecular Hamiltonians and demonstrate that Quantum Power Lanczos converges faster and more reliably than standard Quantum Power Iteration, while Quantum Inverse Iteration outperforms existing inverse iteration variants based on time-evolution operators. We also show that the Quantum Folded Spectrum Method can obtain excited states without variational optimization. Overall, our results indicate that GQSP-based implementations of power methods combine scalability, flexibility, and robust convergence, paving the way for practical initial state preparations on fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Versatile Wavelength-Division Multiplexed Quantum Key Distribution Network Operating Simultaneously in the O and C Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ongoing technological progress is accelerating the commercial and global-scale deployment of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). Its ability to enable unconditionally secure communication is expected to be a key feature of future telecommunication networks, and practical demonstrations of QKD network implementations in real-world environments are crucial for ensuring reliable adoption. In this work, we demonstrate a four-node photonic QKD network that employs versatile and cost-effective wavelength-division multiplexing across three transmitters in the O and C bands to simultaneously distribute quantum-secure keys among all nodes. Specifically, the broadband central receiver node shares all optical and electronic decoding components, except for the single-photon detectors, across the three QKD links, significantly reducing system costs and enhancing compactness.</description>

      <title>Real-time preparation and verification of nonstabilizer states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement lies at the heart of quantum information science, serving as a key resource for quantum communication, computation, and metrology. Consequently, high-precision entangled state preparation and efficient verification are essential for practical quantum technologies. Quantum state verification (QSV) has recently gained much attention as an efficient and experiment-friendly approach for verifying entangled states. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a QSV protocol for verifying three-qubit nonstabilizer $W$ state via a modified homogeneous strategy. Notably, our implementation extends QSV beyond its standard role by integrating the state preparation process, thus guiding and validating the real-time generation of high-fidelity target states. Specifically, we realize the efficient verification with a favorable scaling of the required number of copies versus infidelity as $-1.39$, outperforming the standard quantum limit of $-2$. Meanwhile, a fidelity of $97.07(\pm 0.26)\%$ via direct estimation is achieved using only $9$ measurement settings and $10^4$ samples, which is independently confirmed by quantum state tomography to be $98.58(\pm 0.12)\%$ with approximately $10^6$ measurements. This work presents the first experimental demonstration of QSV actively assisted with state preparation, establishing it as a powerful and resource-efficient alternative to full tomography for real-time quantum state engineering.</description>

      <title>A Three-Party Lightweight Quantum Key Distribution Protocol in a Restricted Quantum Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a new lightweight quantum key distribution (LQKD) protocol based on the four-particle cluster state within a quantum-restricted environment. The protocol enables a quantum-capable user to simultaneously establish two separate secret keys with two "classical" users, who are limited to performing only the Hadamard operation and measurements in the $Z$ basis. By adopting a one-way qubit transmission approach, the proposed protocol addresses several limitations of existing semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) schemes that rely on two-way or circular transmission methods: (1) it eliminates the need for classical participants to be equipped with costly quantum devices to defend against quantum Trojan horse attacks; (2) it reduces the qubit transmission distance; and (3) it achieves higher qubit efficiency. Consequently, the proposed three-party LQKD protocol is both more lightweight and practical than existing SQKD protocols. Furthermore, the security analysis shows that, in the ideal case, the protocol achieves the same level of security as fully quantum protocols. Finally, the study proves the unconditional security of the protocol in the non-ideal case, demonstrating a noise tolerance close to that of the BB84 protocol.</description>

      <title>$d+1$ Measurement Bases are Sufficient for Determining $d$-Dimensional Quantum States: Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing problem in quantum physics is to determine the minimal number of measurement bases required for the complete characterization of unknown quantum states, a question of particular relevance to high-dimensional quantum information processing. Here, we propose a quantum state tomography scheme that requires only $d+1$ projective measurement bases to fully reconstruct an arbitrary $d$-dimensional quantum state. As a proof-of-principle, we experimentally verified this scheme on a silicon photonic chip by reconstructing quantum states for $d=6$, in which a complete set of mutually unbiased bases does not exist. This approach offers new perspectives for quantum state characterization and measurement design, and holds promise for future applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Adaptive Excitation Network with Variational Quantum Circuits for Channel Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Quantum Adaptive Excitation Network (QAE-Net), a hybrid quantum-classical framework designed to enhance channel attention mechanisms in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). QAE-Net replaces the classical excitation block of Squeeze-and-Excitation modules with a shallow Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC), leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to capture higher-order inter-channel dependencies that are challenging to model with purely classical approaches. We evaluate QAE-Net on benchmark image classification tasks, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10, and observe consistent performance improvements across all datasets, with particularly notable gains on tasks involving three-channel inputs. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of variational layers in the quantum circuit leads to progressively higher classification accuracy, underscoring the expressivity benefits of deeper quantum models. These findings highlight the potential of integrating VQCs into CNN architectures to improve representational capacity while maintaining compatibility with near-term quantum devices. The proposed approach is tailored for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, offering a scalable and feasible pathway for deploying quantum-enhanced attention mechanisms in practical deep learning workflows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation between different pulses is a nettlesome problem in quantum key distribution (QKD). All existing solutions for this problem need to characterize the strength of the correlation, which may reduce the security of QKD to an accurate characterization. In this article, we propose a new protocol immune to all correlations of all dimensions, with the only requirements of non-entangled and finite-ranged correlation, and bounded vacuum probability. Additionally, the new protocol is side-channel-secure and measurement-device-independent, giving high-level security in practical QKD systems. We provide the finite-key security analysis against coherent attacks and conduct numerical simulations to see the performance. The result shows that a small correlation range does not influence the performance a lot and the protocol could tolerate a large correlation range, such as correlations spanning over 500 pulses.</description>

      <title>Secure quantum key distribution against correlated leakage source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides information theoretic security based on quantum mechanics, however, its practical deployment is challenged by imperfections of source devices. Among various source loopholes, correlations between transmitted pulses pose a significant yet underexplored security risk, potentially compromising QKD's theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose a security analysis framework for QKD under correlations, enabling finite-key analysis for the first time by extending and rearranging QKD rounds and leveraging the generalized chain rule. Based on this framework, and inspired by the idea of side-channel-secure QKD, we develop a secure QKD against correlated leakage source only need the characterization of correlation range and the lower bound on the vacuum component of the prepared states. Additionally, our framework can be extended to other QKD protocols, offering a general approach to consider correlation induced security vulnerabilities. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol and its significantly superior tolerance to imperfect parameters compared to existing protocols. This work provides a crucial step toward closing security loopholes in QKD, enhancing its practicality, and ensuring long-distance,high-performance secure communication under real-world constraints.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Fluctuations and Multifractality at and across Measurement-Induced Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore statistical fluctuations over the ensemble of quantum trajectories in a model of two-dimensional free fermions subject to projective monitoring of local charge across the measurement-induced phase transition. Our observables are the particle-number covariance between spatially separated regions, $G_{AB}$, and the two-point density correlation function, $\mathcal{C}(r)$. Our results exhibit a remarkable analogy to Anderson localization, with $G_{AB}$ corresponding to two-terminal conductance and $\mathcal{C}(r)$ to two-point conductance, albeit with different replica limit and unconventional symmetry class, geometry, and boundary conditions. In the delocalized phase, $G_{AB}$ exhibits ``universal'', nearly Gaussian, fluctuations with variance of order unity. In the localized phase, we find a broad distribution of $G_{AB}$ with $\overline{-\ln G_{AB}} \sim L $ (where $L$ is the system size) and the variance $\mathrm{var}(\ln G_{AB}) \sim L^\mu$, and similarly for $\mathcal{C}(r)$, with $\mu \approx 0.5$. At the transition point, the distribution function of $G_{AB}$ becomes scale-invariant and $\mathcal{C}(r)$ exhibits multifractal statistics, $\overline{\mathcal{C}^{q}(r)}\sim r^{-q(d+1) - \Delta_{q}}$. We characterize the spectrum of multifractal dimensions $\Delta_q$. Our findings lay the groundwork for mesoscopic theory of monitored systems, paving the way for various extensions.</description>

      <title>Quantized decay charges in non-Hermitian networks characterized by directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has unveiled a realm of exotic phenomena absent in Hermitian systems, with the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) showcasing boundary-localized eigenstates driven by non-reciprocal interactions. Here, we introduce a new class of non-Hermitian systems exhibiting pure decay modes: eigenstates with pure, smooth exponential decay, devoid of the oscillatory wave patterns typical of traditional NHSE. Modeled as directed graphs with non-reciprocal hopping, these systems reveal quantized decay charges, defined as the sum of decay constants along edges at each node, offering a novel topological invariant. We derive universal conditions for these modes, enabling versatile configurations from one-dimensional rings, directed graphs with complicated connectivity, to higher-dimensional lattices. Experimental validation using microwave resonant circuits confirms the predicted pure decay profiles. This discovery paves the way for potential applications in photonics, signal processing, and beyond, harnessing the unique topological properties of non-Hermitian networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a channel-loss-independent quantum-enhanced interferometer. In our scheme, the Fisher information for phase difference of weak light from a remote star remains constant under arbitrarily large channel loss, and the angular resolution of our method is better than that of prior quantum-enhanced methods in the long-baseline regime. Moreover, our method requires only threshold detectors and tunable coherent state or two-mode squeezed state sources, both of which are matured technologies nowadays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum effects, such as entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, and Bell correlations, can enhance metrological sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit. These correlations are typically generated through interactions between atoms or molecules, or during the passage of a laser pulse through a birefringent crystal. Here, we consider an alternative method of generating scalable, many-body entangled states, and demonstrate their usability for quantum-enhanced metrology. Our setup is a one-dimensional (1D) array of double-well potentials holding independent and uncorrelated Bose-Einstein condensates. The beam-splitting transformation mixes the signal between adjacent wells and yields a strongly entangled state through a many-body equivalent of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. We demonstrate this entanglement can improve the sensitivity of quantum sensors. In our analysis, we account for the effects of atomic fluctuations and identify the optimal measurement that saturates the quantum Cramer-Rao bound.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Entanglement Configuration for Constructive Entanglement Topologies in Quantum Machine Learning with Application to Cardiac MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient entanglement strategies are essential for advancing variational quantum circuits (VQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML). However, most current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified 64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring, nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.</description>

      <title>Simulating and Sampling from Quantum Circuits with 2D Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits play a vital role in the development of quantum computers and for taking the temperature of the field. Here, we classically simulate various physically-motivated circuits using 2D tensor network ans\"atze for the many-body wavefunction which match the geometry of the underlying quantum processor. We then employ a generalized version of the boundary Matrix Product State contraction algorithm to controllably generate samples from the resultant tensor network states. Our approach allows us to systematically converge both the quality of the final state and the samples drawn from it to the true distribution defined by the circuit. With these methods, we simulate the largest local unitary Jastrow ansatz circuit taken from recent IBM experiments to numerical precision. We also study a domain-wall quench in a two-dimensional discrete-time Heisenberg model on large heavy-hex and rotated square lattices, which reflect IBM's and Google's latest quantum processors respectively. We observe a rapid buildup of complex loop correlations on the Google Willow geometry which significantly impact the local properties of the system. Meanwhile, we find loop correlations build up extremely slowly on heavy-hex processors and have almost negligible impact on the local properties of the system, even at large circuit depths. Our results underscore the role the geometry of the quantum processor plays in classical simulability.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Classification in the Graph States: The generalization to $n$-Qubits States using the Entanglement Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states represent a significant class of multi-partite entangled quantum states with applications in quantum error correction, quantum communication, and quantum computation. In this work, we introduce a novel formalism called the Entanglement Matrix for quantifying and classifying entanglement in n-qubit graph states. Leveraging concepts from graph theory and quantum information, we develop a systematic approach to analyze entanglement by identifying primary and secondary midpoints in graph representations, where midpoints correspond to controlled-Z gate operations between qubits. Using Von Neumann entropy as our measure, we derive precise mathematical relationships for maximum entanglement in graph states as a function of qubit number. Our analysis reveals that entanglement follows a quadratic relationship with the number of qubits, but with distinct behaviors for odd versus even qubit systems. For odd n-qubit graph states, maximum entanglement follows $E_{\max} = n^2 - n$, while even n-qubit states exhibit higher entanglement with varying formulae depending on specific configurations. Notably, systems with qubit counts that are multiples of 12 demonstrate enhanced entanglement properties. This comprehensive classification framework provides valuable insights into the structure of multi-qubit entanglement, establishing an analytical foundation for understanding entanglement distribution in complex quantum systems that may inform future quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Clique Local Decoder to Correct Length-2 Space Errors in the Surface Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for fault-tolerant quantum computing drives the need for efficient, scalable Quantum Error Correction (QEC) strategies. Conventional decoders designed for worst-case error scenarios incur significant overhead, prompting the development of local decoders, that leverage the sparse and often trivial nature of many quantum errors, to support the conventional decoders. The previously proposed Clique decoder addresses this by handling isolated, length-1 space and time errors within the cryogenic environment with minimal hardware costs, thereby mitigating I/O bandwidth constraints between cryogenic quantum systems and room-temperature processors. Building on this foundation, we propose Clique_L2 that extends the Clique-based approach by relaxing some original constraints and incorporating additional low-cost logic to also correct length-2 error chains in space, which become non-trivial occurrences at higher physical error rates and code distances. This enhanced capability not only further reduces out-of-the-fridge data transmission but also adapts more effectively to clustered errors observed under a variety of noise models. Specifically, under data-qubit-only errors and uniformly random noise, Clique_L2 achieves up to 8.95x decoding bandwidth reduction over the original Clique (or Clique_L1) decoder, especially beneficial at higher code distances. When clustered errors and longer error chains are more likely to occur, Clique_L2 achieves up to 18.3x decoding bandwidth reduction over Clique_L1, achieving substantial benefits across a wide range of physical qubit error rates.</description>

      <title>Spin Relaxation Mechanisms and Nuclear Spin Entanglement of the V$_B^{-1}$ Center in hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy $V_B^-$ defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$ relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$ center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework, this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B = 90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in $V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Sharp Error-Rate Transitions in Quantum QC-LDPC Codes under Joint BP Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we report that quantum quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes decoded via joint belief propagation (BP) exhibit steep error-rate curves, despite the presence of error floors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of such threshold-like behavior for quantum codes with non-vanishing coding rate, excluding those decoded with non-binary BP decoders. Moreover, we find that dominant error events contributing to the error floor typically involve only a small number of bits. These findings suggest that the error floor is caused by trapping sets -- specific subgraph structures in the Tanner graph -- and indicate that identifying and avoiding such structures may lead to further reduction of the error floor.</description>

Abstract: The classical many-body problem is reformulated as a bosonic quantum field theory. Quantum field operators evolve unitarily in the Heisenberg picture so that a quantum Vlasov equation is satisfied as an operator identity. The formalism enables the direct transfer of techniques from quantum information and quantum many-body field theory to classical nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Implications for quantum algorithms are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Baby Universe is Fine and the CFT Knows It: On Holography for Closed Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Big bang/big crunch closed universes can be realized in AdS/CFT, even though they lack asymptotically AdS boundaries. With enough bulk entanglement, the bulk Hilbert space of a closed universe can be holographically encoded in the CFT. We clarify the relation of this encoding to observer-clone proposals and refute recent arguments about the breakdown of semiclassical physics in such spaces. In the limit of no bulk entanglement, the holographic encoding breaks down. The oft-cited one-dimensional nature of the closed universe Hilbert space represents the limitation of the external (CFT) Hilbert space to access the quantum information in the closed universe, similar to the limitations imposed on observers outside a perfectly isolated quantum lab. We advocate that the CFT nevertheless continues to determine the physical properties of the closed universe in this regime, showing how to interpret this relationship in terms of a final state projection in the closed universe. We provide a dictionary between the final state wavefunction and CFT data. We propose a model of the emergence of an arrow of time in the universe with a given initial or final state projection. Finally, we show that the conventional EFT in the closed universe, without any projection, can be recovered as a maximally ignorant description of the final state. This conventional EFT is encoded in CFT data, and it can be probed by computing coarse-grained observables. We provide an example of one such observable. Taken together, these results amount to a clean bill of health for baby universes born of AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>A Black Hole Airy Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, which is dual to a random matrix ensemble, the annealed entropy differs from the quenched entropy at low temperatures and goes negative. However, computing the quenched entropy in JT gravity requires a replica limit that is poorly understood. To circumvent this, we define an intermediate quantity called the semi-quenched entropy, which has the positivity properties of the quenched entropy, while requiring a much simpler replica trick. We compute this in JT gravity in different regimes using i) a bulk calculation involving wormholes corresponding to the Airy limit of the dual matrix integral and ii) a boundary calculation involving one-eigenvalue instantons, demonstrating consistency between these two calculations in their common regime of validity. We also clarify why a recent attempt to compute the quenched entropy using one-eigenvalue instantons is unreliable due to a breakdown of the saddle-point approximation for the one-eigenvalue instanton in the replica limit.</description>

      <title>Natural super-orbitals representation of many-body operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of natural super-orbitals for many-body operators, defined as the eigenvectors of the one-body super-density matrix associated with a vectorized operator. We first analyze the general analytical properties of these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution operator of non-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then perform a numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding to both the time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing on two many-body systems: the fermionic $t\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity model, using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the $t\text{-}V$ model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity model, the occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay exponentially at all times. This indicates that only a small number of orbitals contribute significantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact matrix-product-operator representation in the natural orbital basis. Finally, we examine the spatial spread of the natural orbitals for time-evolved local operators in the impurity model and show that the complexity of this operator in the natural orbital basis saturates over time. This new framework opens the door to future research that leverages the compressed structure of operators in their natural super-orbital basis, enabling for instance the computation of out-of-time-order correlators in large interacting systems over extended time scales.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Augmented Pfaffian Wave-functions for Scalable Simulations of Interacting Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing accurate numerical methods for strongly interacting fermions is crucial for improving our understanding of various quantum many-body phenomena, especially unconventional superconductivity. Recently, neural quantum states have emerged as a promising approach for studying correlated fermions, highlighted by the hidden fermion and backflow methods, which use neural networks to model corrections to fermionic quasiparticle orbitals. In this work, we expand these ideas to the space of Pfaffians, a wave-function that naturally expresses superconducting pairings, and propose the hidden fermion Pfaffian state (HFPS), which flexibly represents both unpaired and superconducting phases and scales to large systems with favorable asymptotic complexity. In our numerical experiments, HFPS provides state-of-the-art variational accuracy in different regimes of both the attractive and repulsive Hubbard models. We show that the HFPS is able to capture both s-wave and d-wave pairing, and therefore may be a useful tool for modeling phases with unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoacoustic systems offer promising platforms for next-generation sensors and computing applications, but understanding their nonlinear dynamics remains challenging. Here, we use nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to spatially map nonlinear magnon scattering processes in FeGaB/LiNbO3 magnetoacoustic devices with sub-micron resolution. We observe highly heterogeneous magnetic noise generation under acoustic driving at 1425 MHz, with responses varying dramatically across micron length scales. Time-domain measurements reveal threshold-like nonlinear behavior where NV center spin relaxation rates increase over two orders of magnitude as drive power is increased. These findings reveal microscopic noise sources that limit magnetoacoustic sensor performance while simultaneously demonstrating how acoustic mode engineering could enable selective control of nonlinear magnon processes.</description>

      <title>Ideal Boson Particle-Antiparticle System at Finite Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic properties of an ideal bosonic system composed of particles and antiparticles at finite temperatures are examined within the framework of a scalar field model. It is assumed that particle-antiparticle pair creation occurs; however, the system is simultaneously subject to exact charge (isospin) conservation. To implement this constraint, we first consider the system within the Grand Canonical Ensemble and then transform to the Canonical Ensemble using a Legendre transformation. This procedure provides a formally consistent scheme for incorporating the chemical potential at the microscopic level into the Canonical Ensemble framework. To enforce exact conservation of charge (isospin, N_I), we further analyze the thermodynamic properties of the system within the extended Canonical Ensemble, in which the chemical potential becomes a thermodynamic function of the temperature and conserved charge. It is shown that as the temperature decreases, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate at the critical temperature T_c, but only when the conserved charge is finite, N_I=const \ne 0. In a particle-antiparticle system, the condensate forms exclusively in the component with the dominant particle number density, which determines the excess charge. We demonstrate that the symmetry breaking of the ground state at T=0 results from a first-order phase transition associated with the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate. Although the transition involves symmetry breaking, it is not spontaneous in the strict field-theoretic sense, but is instead induced by the external injection of particles. Potential experimental signals of Bose-Einstein condensation of pions produced in high-energy nuclear collisions are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the index $\mathcal{N}(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ of a pair of pure states on a unital C*-algebra, which is a generalization of the notion of the index of a pair of projections on a Hilbert space. We then show that the Hall conductance associated with an invertible state $\omega$ of a two-dimensional interacting electronic system which is symmetric under $U(1)$ charge transformation may be written as the index $\mathcal{N}(\omega,\omega_D)$, where $\omega_D$ is obtained from $\omega$ by inserting a unit of magnetic flux. This exhibits the integrality and continuity properties of the Hall conductance in the context of general topological features of $\mathcal{N}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for the design and analysis of optimization algorithms in variational quantum Monte Carlo, drawing on geometric insights into the corresponding function space. The framework translates infinite-dimensional optimization dynamics into tractable parameter-space algorithms through a Galerkin projection onto the tangent space of the variational ansatz. This perspective unifies existing methods such as stochastic reconfiguration and Rayleigh-Gauss-Newton, provides connections to classic function-space algorithms, and motivates the derivation of novel algorithms with geometrically principled hyperparameter choices. We validate our framework with numerical experiments demonstrating its practical relevance through the accurate estimation of ground-state energies for several prototypical models in condensed matter physics modeled with neural network wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic nonabelian braiding of imperfect Majoranas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demonstration of a nontrivial result of quasiparticle exchange (or braiding) is usually considered the definitive proof of a topological phase with nonabelian excitations, such as Majorana bound states (MBSs). However, in finite systems with disorder and smooth potential variations, the MBSs are imperfect in the sense that they are not fully isolated in space and can, to a varying degree, resemble conventional fermions. Here, we study the braiding properties of isolated MBSs, regular fermions, and anything in between. We find a way to compensate for the undesired splitting of the ground-state degeneracy which occurs during the protocol for imperfect MBS. This leads to a braiding outcome that depends on the degree of MBS isolation but remains robust and nonabelian except in the perfect fermion limit. Our protocol could be implemented in different platforms with nonabelian excitations, including quantum-dot-based minimal Kitaev chains.</description>

      <title>A Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Machine -- A Theory for a Novel Type of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in a Unique Dissipative System and one Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on an interesting dissipative system (DS) found in a photonics system. In this DS, robust causality is created, and as a result, it becomes possible to find behavior that can be understood as spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). Furthermore, by arranging such DSs as basic elements and building certain relationships between them through optical interference, it becomes possible to create a unique system that causes complex SSB as a whole. This unique SSB can be understood as having a duality with the model of the creation of many-body-like system (MBLS), and by using the correspondence between the MBLS and the Ising model, it can be used as an alternative computational resource for solving combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>From Bound States to Quantum Spin Models: Chiral Coherent Dynamics in Topological Photonic Rings</title>

Abstract: Topological photonic systems offer a robust platform for guiding light in the presence of disorder, but their interplay with quantum emitters remains a frontier for realizing strongly correlated quantum states. Here, we explore a ring-shaped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) photonic lattice interfaced with multiple quantum emitters to control topologically protected chiral quantum dynamics. Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad dynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the bath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters. These interactions lead to rich manybody spin phenomena, including robust coherence, directional energy transfer, and emergent double N\'eel ordering, captured by an effective spin Hamiltonian derived from the system topology. We show that topological bound states enable unidirectional emission, protect coherence against dissipation, and imprint nontrivial entanglement and mutual information patterns among the emitters. In particular, we showed that under circularly polarized excitation, the emitters not only inherit spin angular momentum from the field but also serve as transducers that coherently launch the spin-orbit-coupled topological photonic modes into the far field. Our results establish a direct bridge between topological photonic baths and emergent quantum magnetism, positioning this architecture as a promising testbed for studying chiral quantum optics, topologically protected entangled states, and long-range quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Effects of Small-Chain Superexchange Dynamics on Spin-Orbit Coupled Clock Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical lattice clocks have set records in clock precision and accuracy. Continuing to advance their performance, via probing as many atoms for the longest interrogation time affordable, requires experimentally and theoretically studying a many-body lattice system. Motivated by recent experimental results on a Fermi-degenerate three-dimensional optical lattice clock, we present a theoretical overview of Ramsey and Rabi spectroscopy in one-dimensional chains. At realistic experimental temperatures and confinement conditions, atoms are spatially localized into small chains of $\approx 1-5$ atoms. We show that in the presence of spin-orbit coupling induced by the clock laser, the spectroscopy observables are modified by superexchange interactions within each chain, and depend strongly on the length of the chain. The thermal distribution of chain lengths thus plays a key role in the spectroscopy measurements. Our results offer insight into observable many-body effects in state-of-the-art lattice clocks and suggest new directions for optimizing clock performance.</description>

      <title>Microwave spectroscopy and multi-channel quantum defect analysis of ytterbium Rydberg states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex Rydberg structure of ytterbium atoms is shaped by multiple low-lying ion-core-excited states and strong channel interactions, which presents both opportunities and challenges for quantum information processing and precision metrology. In this work, we extend high-resolution microwave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) modeling of singly excited $6sn\ell$ Rydberg states in $^{174}$Yb and $^{171}$Yb to include the $\ell = 3$ ($f$) and $\ell = 4$ ($g$) series. Our measurements reveal $p$-$f$ mixing in odd-parity Rydberg states of $^{171}$Yb, which we incorporate by combined MQDT models for $6snp$ and $6snf$ series. Additionally, we observe that for $\ell = 4$ the spin-orbit interaction dominates over the exchange interaction, such that the $6sng$ states are more accurately described in a $jj$-coupled basis. We validate our models by comparing the predicted Land\'e $g$-factors and static dipole polarizabilities with experimental measurements, finding excellent agreement. These results provide important input for designing high-fidelity entangling gates with ytterbium atoms.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Energy Relaxation Rate of Quantum States Using D-Wave Device and the Discovery of Long-Lived Multiqubit States</title>

Abstract: Quantum annealing has been demonstrated with superconducting qubits. Such a quantum annealer has been used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Moreover, it serves as a quantum simulator for investigating the properties of quantum many-body systems. However, the coherence properties of multi-qubit states provided by D-Wave Quantum Inc. have not been explored sufficiently. Here, using the D-Wave device, we measure the energy relaxation rate of superconducting qubits and find long-lived multi-qubit states. Specifically, we investigate the energy relaxation rate of the first excited states of a fully connected Ising model with a transverse field. We find that the decay rate of the excited states of such a system with four qubits is orders of magnitude smaller than that of the excited state of a single qubit, which demonstrates the existence of long-lived multi-qubit states. We elucidate the mechanism using an independent decoherence model that qualitatively describes the phenomenon. In addition, by using such a mechanism, we theoretically predict a long-lived entangled state whose energy relaxation rate is smaller than that of the separable states.</description>

      <title>QSETH strikes again: finer quantum lower bounds for lattice problem, strong simulation, hitting set problem, and more</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While seemingly undesirable, it is not a surprising fact that there are certain problems for which quantum computers offer no computational advantage over their respective classical counterparts. Moreover, there are problems for which there is no `useful' computational advantage possible with the current quantum hardware. This situation however can be beneficial if we don't want quantum computers to solve certain problems fast - say problems relevant to post-quantum cryptography. In such a situation, we would like to have evidence that it is difficult to solve those problems on quantum computers; but what is their exact complexity?
  To do so one has to prove lower bounds, but proving unconditional time lower bounds has never been easy. As a result, resorting to conditional lower bounds has been quite popular in the classical community and is gaining momentum in the quantum community. In this paper, by the use of the QSETH framework [Buhrman-Patro-Speelman 2021], we are able to understand the quantum complexity of a few natural variants of CNFSAT, such as parity-CNFSAT or counting-CNFSAT, and also are able to comment on the non-trivial complexity of approximate-#CNFSAT; both of these have interesting implications about the complexity of (variations of) lattice problems, strong simulation and hitting set problem, and more.
  In the process, we explore the QSETH framework in greater detail than was (required and) discussed in the original paper, thus also serving as a useful guide on how to effectively use the QSETH framework.</description>

      <title>Revisiting fixed-point quantum search: proof of the quasi-Chebyshev lemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The original Grover's algorithm suffers from the souffle problem, which means that the success probability of quantum search decreases dramatically if the iteration time is too small or too large from the right time. To overcome the souffle problem, the fixed-point quantum search with an optimal number of queries was proposed [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 210501 (2014)], which always finds a marked state with a high probability when a lower bound of the proportion of marked states is given. The fixed-point quantum search relies on a key lemma regarding the explicit formula of recursive quasi-Chebyshev polynomials, but its proof is not given explicitly. In this work, we give a detailed proof of this lemma, thus providing a sound foundation for the correctness of the fixed-point quantum search. This lemma may be of independent interest as well, since it expands the mathematical form of the recursive relation of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, and it also constitutes a key component in overcoming the souffle problem of quantum walk-based search algorithms, for example, robust quantum walk search on complete bipartite graphs [Phys. Rev. A 106, 052207 (2022)]. The lemma is also central to a recently proposed quantum algorithm named quantum phase discrimination, which has become a fundamental subroutine in quantum search on graphs [arxiv: 2504.15194]. Hopefully, more applications of the lemma will be found in the future.</description>

      <title>Third-order exceptional surface in a pseudo-Hermitian superconducting circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared with an isolated exceptional point, exceptional surfaces in non-Hermitian systems are more robust against environment noises, fabrication errors, and experimental uncertainties. Thanks to this, exceptional surfaces can be applied to enhance the sensitivity of sensors and develop new quantum techniques. Over the past few years, several works have been devoted to studying high-order exceptional surfaces. However, they are restricted to non-Hermitian systems without pseudo-Hermiticity. To date, research on high-order exceptional surfaces in pseudo-Hermitian systems still remains an untouched area. In this work, we propose a pseudo-Hermitian superconducting circuit, which consists of three circularly-coupled superconducting cavities with the balanced gain and loss. We then study the third-order exceptional surface in the proposed circuit. By investigating the eigenvalues, we find that in the parameter space, all third-order exceptional points of the circuit form a third-order exceptional line in the parity-time-symmetric case. When the parity-time-symmetric condition is extended to pseudo-Hermitian conditions, we find more third-order exceptional points, which constitute a third-order exceptional surface in the parameter space. The proposed scheme is universal and can be applied to explore third-order exceptional surfaces in other physical systems, such as optomechanical systems, cavity-magnon systems, and photonic micro-ring systems. This work is of fundamental interest in quantum mechanics and opens a way for studying high-order exceptional surfaces in pseudo-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>All incompatible measurements on qubits lead to multiparticle Bell nonlocality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10564v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell nonlocality is a fundamental phenomenon of quantum physics as well as an essential resource for various tasks in quantum information processing. It is known that for the observation of nonlocality the measurements on a quantum system have to be incompatible, but the question which incompatible measurements are useful, remained open. Here we prove that any set of incompatible measurements on qubits leads to a violation of a suitable Bell inequality in a multiparticle scenario, where all parties perform the same set of measurements. Since there exists incompatible measurements on qubits which do not lead to Bell nonlocality for two particles, our results demonstrate a fundamental difference between two-particle and multi-particle nonlocality, pointing at the superactivation of measurement incompatibility as a resource. In addition, our results imply that measurement incompatibility for qubits can always be certified in a device-independent manner.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the nonreciprocal quantum phase transition in a cavity magnonic system driven by a parametric field, where an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is placed in a spinning microwave resonator. The system exhibits a rich phase diagram due to both magnon Kerr nonlinearity in YIG and parametric drive on the resonator. Especially, Sagnac-Fizeau shift caused by the spinning of the resonator brings about a significant modification in the critical driving strengths for second- and first-order quantum phase transitions, which means that the highly controllable quantum phase can be realized by the spinning speed of the resonator. More importantly, based on the difference in the detunings of the counterclockwise and clockwise modes induced by spinning direction of the resonator, we show that the phase transition in this system is nonreciprocal, that is, the quantum phase transition occurs when the cavity is driven in one direction but not the other. Our work offers an alternative path to engineer and design nonreciprocal magnonic devices.</description>

Abstract: Random unitaries are an important resource for quantum information processing. While their universal properties have been thoroughly analyzed, it is not known what happens to these properties when the unitaries are sampled on the present-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We implement parameterized circuits, which have been proposed as a means to generate random unitaries, on an IBM Quantum processor and model these implementations as quantum maps. To retrieve the maps, a machine-learning assisted tomography is used. We find the spectrum of a map to be either an annulus or a disk depending on the circuit depth and detect an annulus-disk transition. By their spectral properties, the retrieved maps appear to be very similar to a recently introduced ensemble of random maps, for which spectral densities can be analytically evaluated. Our results establish, via Dissipative Quantum Chaos theory, a connection between intrinsic properties of present-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing platforms and non-Hermitian random matrix theory.</description>

Abstract: Negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC), a hallmark of nonlinear quantum thermal transport, plays a critical role in the design of quantum thermal devices such as thermal diodes and transistors. The Lindblad dynamics predicts that the heat current through two coupled atoms increases with the increasing temperature difference of two bosonic reservoirs. However, in this paper, we uncover the suppressive effect on the heat current in this nonequilibrium system using the Bloch-Redfield master equations, which indicate the emergence of NDTC. Our findings underscore the crucial role of beyond-Lindblad dynamics in accurately capturing nonlinear features in quantum thermodynamic systems.</description>

Abstract: We show, for any finite $n \geq 2$, that there exist quantum correlations obtained from performing $n$ dichotomic quantum measurements in a bipartite Bell scenario, which cannot be reproduced by mixtures of measurement devices with at most $(n-1)$ incompatible measurements across different partitions in any no-signaling theory. That is, it requires any no-signaling theory an unbounded number of measurements to reproduce the predictions of quantum theory. We prove our results by showing that there exist linear Bell inequalities that have to be obeyed by any no-signaling theory involving only $(n-1)$-wise incompatible measurements and show explicitly how these can be violated in quantum theory. Finally, we discuss the relation of our work to previous works ruling out alternatives to quantum theory with some kind of bounded degree of freedom and consider the experimental verifiability of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum physics, even simple data with a well-defined structure at the wave function level can be characterized by extremely complex correlations between its constituent elements. The inherent non-locality of the quantum correlations generally prevents one from providing their simple and transparent interpretation, which also remains a challenging problem for advanced classical techniques that approximate quantum states with neural networks. Here we show that monitoring the neural network weight space while learning quantum statistics from measurements allows to develop physical intuition about complex multipartite patterns and thus helps to construct more effective classical representations of the wave functions. Particularly, we observe the formation of distinct global convolutional structures, receptive fields in the hidden layer of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) within the neural quantum tomography of the highly-entangled Dicke states. On this basis we propose an exact two-parameter classical representation not only for a specific quantum wave function, but for the whole family of the N-qubit Dicke states of different entanglement. Our findings suggest a fresh look at constructing convolutional neural networks for processing data with non-local patterns and pave the way for developing exact learning-based representations of entangled quantum states.</description>

Abstract: Classical data can be copied and re-used for computation, with adverse consequences economically and in terms of data privacy. Motivated by this, we formulate problems in one-way communication complexity where Alice holds some data $x$ and Bob holds $m$ inputs $y_1,... , y_m$. They want to compute $m$ instances of a bipartite relation $R$ on every pair $(x, y_1),\ldots, (x, y_m)$. We call this the asymmetric direct sum question for one-way communication. We give a number of examples where the quantum communication complexity of such problems scales polynomially with $m$, while the classical communication complexity depends at most logarithmically on $m$. Thus, for such problems, data behaves like a consumable resource that is effectively destroyed upon use when the owner stores and transmits it as quantum states, but not when transmitted classically. We show an application to a strategic data-selling game, and discuss other potential economic implications.</description>

      <title>Quantifying non-Markovianity via local quantum Fisher information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing non-Markovianity in open quantum systems (OQSs) is gaining increasing attention due to its profound implications for quantum information processing. This phenomenon arises from the system's evolution being influenced by its previous interactions with the environment. To better understand these complex dynamics, various measures have been proposed, including those based on divisibility, quantum mutual information, and trace distance. Each of these measures provides a different perspective on the behavior of OQSs. Here, we introduce a novel approach to quantifying non-Markovianity by focusing on metrological non-classical correlations. This approach is based on a discord-like measure of quantum correlations for multi-component quantum systems known as local quantum Fisher information (LQFI), which was introduced in [58]. It is defined as the minimization of quantum Fisher information with respect to local observables and measurements. Thereby, we examine some examples to clarify the use of our metric by applying it to three different channels: the phase damping channel, the amplitude damping channel, and the depolarizing channel. In contrast to other approaches, this new metric focuses on correlated bipartite $2\otimes d$ systems, has a clear physical interpretation, and effectively captures the features of non-Markovianity. We demonstrate that the non-Markovian or Markovian evolution of an open correlated bipartite system corresponds to an increase or decrease, respectively, in the quantumness of the quantum state. This quantumness is quantified by the maximum of the measurement-induced Fisher information across all local von Neumann measurements. Compared to measuring non-Markovianity based on local quantum uncertainty, a measure of non-classical correlation of the discord type based on single observables, our results confirm that the ..</description>

Abstract: We investigate the challenge of classical simulation of unitary quantum dynamics with variational Monte Carlo approaches, addressing the instabilities and high computational demands of existing methods. By systematically analyzing the convergence of stochastic infidelity optimizations, examining the variance properties of key stochastic estimators, and evaluating the error scaling of multiple dynamical discretization schemes, we provide a thorough formalization and significant improvements to the projected time-dependent Variational Monte Carlo (p-tVMC) method. We benchmark our approach on a two-dimensional Ising quench, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This work establishes p-tVMC as a powerful framework for simulating the dynamics of large-scale two-dimensional quantum systems, surpassing alternative VMC strategies on the investigated benchmark problems.</description>

Abstract: We study geometric properties of trace functionals that generalize those in [Zhang, Adv. Math. 365:107053 (2020)], arising from a novel family of conditional entropies with applications in quantum information. Building on new convexity results for these functionals, we establish data-processing inequalities and additivity properties for our entropies, demonstrating their operational significance. We further prove completeness under duality, chain rules, and various monotonicity properties for this family. Our proofs draw on tools from complex interpolation theory, multivariate Araki--Lieb and Lieb--Thirring inequalities, variational characterizations of trace functionals, and spectral pinching techniques.</description>

      <title>Chasing shadows with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of performing shadow tomography of a logical subsystem defined via the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error correcting code. Our protocol does not require the input state to be a code state but is implemented by appropriate twirling of the measurement channel, such that the encoded logical tomographic information becomes encoded in the classical shadow. We showcase this protocol for measurements natural in continuous variable (CV) quantum computing. For heterodyne measurement, the protocol yields a probabilistic decomposition of any input state into Gaussian states that simulate the encoded logical information of the input relative to a fixed GKP code where we prove bounds on the Gaussian compressibility of states in this setting. For photon parity measurements, our protocol is equivalent to a Wigner sampling protocol for which we develop the appropriate sampling strategies. Finally, by randomizing over the reference GKP code, we show how Wigner samples of any input state relative to a random GKP codes can be used to estimate any sufficiently bounded observable.</description>

      <title>Linear-optical protocols for mitigating and suppressing noise in bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-information processing and computation with bosonic qubits are corruptible by noise channels. Using interferometers and photon-subtraction gadgets (PSGs) accompanied by linear amplification and attenuation, we establish linear-optical methods to mitigate and suppress bosonic noise channels. We first show that by employing amplifying and attenuating PSGs respectively at the input and output of either a thermal or random-displacement channel, probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) can be carried out to mitigate errors in expectation-value estimation. We also derive optimal physical estimators that are properly constrained to improve the sampling accuracy of PEC. Next, we prove that a purely-dephasing channel is coherently suppressible using a multimode Mach--Zehnder interferometer and conditional vacuum measurements (VMZ). In the limit of infinitely-many ancillas, with nonvanishing success rates, VMZ using either Hadamard or two-design interferometers turns any dephasing channel into a phase-space-rotated linear-attenuation channel that can subsequently be inverted with (rotated) linear amplification without Kerr nonlinearity. Moreover, for weak central-Gaussian dephasing, the suppression fidelity increases monotonically with the number of ancillas and most optimally with Hadamard interferometers. We demonstrate the performance of these linear-optical mitigation and suppression schemes on common noise channels (and their compositions) and popular bosonic codes. While the theoretical formalism pertains to idling noise channels, we also provide numerical evidence supporting mitigation and suppression capabilities with respect to noise from universal gate operations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry verification for noisy quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, explaining their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in the presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and the anti-flatness of the entanglement spectrum after a quantum quench in a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic footprints of quantum friction in nonreciprocal and chiral media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the quantum friction experienced by a polarizable atom moving with constant velocity parallel to a planar interface is modified when the latter consists of chiral or nonreciprocal media, with special focus on topological insulators. We use macroscopic quantum electrodynamics to obtain the velocity-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift and decay rate. These results are a generalization to matter with time-reversal symmetry breaking. We illustrate our findings by examining the nonretarded and retarded limits for five examples: a perfectly conducting mirror, a perfectly reflecting nonreciprocal mirror, a three-dimensional topological insulator, a perfectly reflecting chiral mirror and an isotropic chiral medium. We find different asymptotic power laws for all these materials. Interestingly, we find two bridges between chirality and nonreciprocity through the frequency shift that arise as a consequence of the magnetoelectric coupling. Namely, the position-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift for the nonreciprocal case depend on a geometric magnetic field associated with photoionization of chiral molecules, the Casimir-Polder depending on the velocities for the chiral case have the optical rotatory strength as the atomic response while those for the nonreciprocal case depend on an analog of the optical rotatory strength.</description>

Abstract: This work analyzes transfer learning of the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC). Our framework begins with a pretrained VQC configured in one domain and calculates the transition of 1-parameter unitary subgroups required for a new domain. A formalism is established to investigate the adaptability and capability of a VQC under the analysis of loss bounds. Our theory observes knowledge transfer in VQCs and provides a heuristic interpretation for the mechanism. An analytical fine-tuning method is derived to attain the optimal transition for adaptations of similar domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This experimental work demonstrates multipartite quantum correlation in bright frequency combs out of a microresonator integrated on silicon nitride operating above its oscillation threshold. Multipartite features, going beyond so far reported two-mode correlation, naturally arise due to a cascade of non-linear optical processes, making a single-color laser pump sufficient to initiate their generation. Our results show the transition from two-mode to multipartite correlation, witnessed by noise reductions as low as $-2.5$\,dB and $-2$\,dB, respectively, compared to corresponding classical levels. A constant of the movement of the non-linear interaction Hamiltonian is identified and used to asses the multipartite behavior. Reported demonstrations pave the way to next generation on-chip multipartite sources for quantum technologies applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generation of Schr{\"o}dinger cat states using a quantum measurement-induced logical gate where entanglement between the input state of the target oscillator and the Fock state of the ancillary system produced by the quantum non-demolition entangling $\hat{C}_Z$ operation is combined with the homodyne measurement. We utilize the semiclassical approach to construct both the input-output mapping of the field variables in the phase space and the wave function of the output state. This approach is found to predict that the state at the gate output can be represented by a minimally disturbed cat-like state which is a superposition of two copies of the initial state symmetrically displaced by momentum variable. For the target oscillator prepared in the coherent state, we show that the fidelity between the exact solution for the gate output state and the ``perfect'' Schr{\"o}dinger cat reconstructed from the semiclassical theory can reach high values exceeding 0.99.</description>

Abstract: Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an entangled quantum state subject to random shocks and prove that disentanglement occurs asymptotically. The system consists of two identical, two level state systems, say two entangled qubits or two entangled two state molecules, and the heat bath consists of the occurrence of state switching shocks, which happen at a Poisson rate. The time dependence of such system can be explicitly obtained and the decay rate to disentanglement happens to be twice the frequency of the occurrence of shocks.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive software stack architecture for integrating quantum computing (QC) capabilities with High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments. While quantum computers show promise as specialized accelerators for scientific computing, their effective integration with classical HPC systems presents significant technical challenges. We propose a hardware-agnostic software framework that supports both current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computers, while maintaining compatibility with existing HPC workflows. The architecture includes a quantum gateway interface, standardized APIs for resource management, and robust scheduling mechanisms to handle both simultaneous and interleaved quantum-classical workloads. Key innovations include: (1) a unified resource management system that efficiently coordinates quantum and classical resources, (2) a flexible quantum programming interface that abstracts hardware-specific details, (3) A Quantum Platform Manager API that simplifies the integration of various quantum hardware systems, and (4) a comprehensive tool chain for quantum circuit optimization and execution. We demonstrate our architecture through implementation of quantum-classical algorithms, including the variational quantum linear solver, showcasing the framework's ability to handle complex hybrid workflows while maximizing resource utilization. This work provides a foundational blueprint for integrating QC capabilities into existing HPC infrastructures, addressing critical challenges in resource management, job scheduling, and efficient data movement between classical and quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Digital Zero-Noise Extrapolation with Quantum Circuit Unoptimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuit unoptimization is an algorithm that transforms a quantum circuit into a different circuit that uses more gate operations while maintaining the same unitary transformation. We demonstrate that this method can implement digital zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a quantum error mitigation technique. By employing quantum circuit unoptimization as a form of circuit folding, noise can be systematically amplified. The key advantages of this approach are twofold. First, its ability to generate an exponentially increasing number of distinct circuit variants as the noise level is amplified, which allows noise averaging over many circuit variants with slightly different circuit structure. Averaging over these variants can mitigate the effect of biased error propagation due to the significantly altered circuit structure from quantum circuit unoptimization, or biased noise sources on a quantum processor. Second, quantum circuit unoptimization by design resists circuit simplification back to the original unmodified circuit, making it plausible to use ZNE in contexts where circuit compiler optimization is applied server-side. We evaluate the effectiveness of quantum circuit unoptimization as a noise-scaling method for ZNE in two test cases using depolarizing noise numerical simulations: random quantum volume circuits, where the observable is the heavy output probability, and QAOA circuits for the (unweighted) maximum cut problem on random 3-regular graphs, where the observable is the cut value. We show that using quantum circuit unoptimization to perform ZNE can approximately recover signal from noisy quantum simulations.</description>

Abstract: To enhance the consistency between the quantum descriptions of waves and particles, we quantise mechanical point particles in this paper in the same physically-motivated way as we previously quantised light in quantum electrodynamics [Bennett et al., Eur. J. Phys. 37, 014001 (2016)]. To identify the relevant Hilbert space, we notice that mechanical particles can occupy any position x while moving at any velocity v. Afterwards, we promote the classical states (x,v) to pairwise orthogonal quantum states |x,v&gt; and demand that these evolve according to Newton's equations of motion. The resulting quantum theory is mass-independent, when Newton's equations of motion are mass-independent, as one would expect. The basic formulation of quantum mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics in configuration space as a semi-classical approximation when a fixed mass is imposed and several other adjustments are made.</description>

      <title>Transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in monitored quantum dynamics with homogeneous unitary gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in systems evolved by quantum measurements and spatially homogeneous unitary gates. In models with temporally random and Floquet unitary gates, we find that the Lyapunov exponents typically converge to values independent of measurement outcomes and that spectral transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement transitions of ground states occur at the same measurement thresholds. Our results indicate that (i) randomness due to quantum measurements is enough, or equivalently, randomness of unitary gates is not essential, for the typical convergence of the Lyapunov spectrum and that (ii) the correspondence between the spectral transition and entanglement transition is ubiquitous in a wide range of systems. We also discuss why the typical convergence occurs, in light of the uniqueness and positive definiteness of stationary states in the completely-positive trace-preserving (CPTP) dynamics averaged over random measurement outcomes.</description>

      <title>Temperature and non-Markovian parameter estimation in quantum Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum metrological protocol operating in a non-Markovian environment by employing the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model, in which the system is linearly coupled to a reservoir of harmonic oscillators. Specifically, we use a position-momentum (PM) correlated Gaussian state as a probe to examine how memory effects influence the evolution of the system's covariance matrix in the weak coupling regime under both high- and low-temperature conditions. To confirm the presence of non-Markovian behavior, we apply two well-established non-Markovianity quantifiers. Furthermore, we estimate both the channel's sample temperature and its non-Markovianity parameter. Our results demonstrate that non-Markovianity and PM correlations can jointly be valuable resources to enhance metrological performance.</description>

      <title>CHSH Violations using Dynamic Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable quantum computing relies on high-quality, long-range entanglement, a challenge on noisy, near-term devices. The need for practical insights for near-term algorithm design calls for trade-offs exploration in implementing dynamic circuits on current hardware. In this work, we experimentally compare three CNOT implementations for generating Bell states across varying qubit separations on a 127-qubit IBM Quantum Eagle processor (ibm_quebec): a unitary (SWAP-based) approach, a dynamic approach with mid-circuit measurements and classical feedforward, and a post-processed approach. We use Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality violations to quantify entanglement quality. We observe that, beyond 10 qubits, dynamic circuits lead to higher |S| values than the unitary approach, demonstrating improved distance-dependent entanglement preservation. The post-processed approach yields the highest CHSH values, reaching |S| &gt; 2 up to 13 qubits. Our results underscore the critical need for faster classical feedforward and higher readout fidelity.</description>

      <title>Qracle: A Graph-Neural-Network-based Parameter Initializer for Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a leading class of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms with broad applications in quantum physics and quantum chemistry. However, as system size increases, VQE optimization is increasingly hindered by the barren plateau phenomenon, where gradients vanish and the loss function becomes trapped in local minima. While machine learning-based parameter initialization methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they often show limited effectiveness in complex VQE problems. This is primarily due to their inadequate ability to model the intricate correlations embedded in the Hamiltonian structure and the associated ansatz circuits. In this paper, we propose \textit{Qracle}, a graph neural network (GNN)-based parameter initializer for VQEs. \textit{Qracle} systematically encodes both the Hamiltonian and the associated ansatz circuit into a unified graph representation and leverages a GNN to learn a mapping from VQE problem graphs to optimized ansatz parameters. Compared to state-of-the-art initialization techniques, \textit{Qracle} achieves a reduction in initial loss of up to $10.86$, accelerates convergence by decreasing optimization steps by up to $64.42\%$, and improves final performance with up to a $26.43\%$ reduction in Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Geometry Meets DMRG: Uhlmann Gauge Improvements in Computational Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and systematically investigate a novel approach combining the Uhlmann gauge bundle with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and Matrix Product State (MPS) techniques to enhance the representation and preservation of quantum coherence in strongly correlated many-body systems. Conventional DMRG and MPS methods frequently encounter limitations when dealing with subtle quantum correlations and entanglement structures near critical points, avoided crossings, and topologically ordered phases. By integrating the dynamical Uhlmann gauge potential and its categorical extensions into the numerical optimization and truncation procedures, our approach substantially improves coherence stability and accuracy. Through illustrative applications in quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and quantum dynamics, we demonstrate significant enhancements in precision and reliability, underscoring the broad potential of Uhlmann gauge-enhanced computational methods.</description>

Abstract: Specific quantum algorithms exist to-in theory-break elliptic curve cryptographic protocols. Implementing these algorithms requires designing quantum circuits that perform elliptic curve arithmetic. To accurately judge a cryptographic protocol's resistance against future quantum computers, researchers figure out minimal resource-count circuits for performing these operations while still being correct. To assure the correctness of a circuit, it is integral to restore all ancilla qubits used to their original states. Failure to do so could result in decoherence of the computation's final result. Through rigorous classical simulation and unit testing, I surfaced four inconsistencies in the state-of-the-art quantum circuit for elliptic curve point addition where the circuit diagram states the qubits are returned in the original ($|0\rangle$) state, but the intermediate values are not uncomputed. I provide fixes to the circuit without increasing the leading-order gate cost.</description>

      <title>Entanglement structure for finite system under dual-unitary dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum many-body systems in the chaotic regime are of particular interest due to the associated phenomena of information scrambling and entanglement generation within the system. While these systems are typically intractable using traditional numerical methods, an effective framework can be implemented based on dual-unitary circuits which have emerged as a minimal model for maximally chaotic dynamics. In this work, we investigate how individual two-body operators influence the global dynamics of circuits composed of dual-unitaries. We study their effect on entanglement generation while examining it from both bipartite and multipartite perspectives. Here we also highlight the significant role of local unitaries in the dynamics when paired with operators from the dual-unitary class, showing that systems with identical entangling power can exhibit a range of differing entanglement growth rates. Furthermore, we present calculations establishing time-step-dependent lower bounds, which depend on both the initial state and the entangling power of the constituent operators. Finally, we find that time-evolving an initial state composed of pair products generates a state with nearly maximal multipartite entanglement content, approaching the bounds established by Absolutely Maximally Entangled (AME) states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing eigenvalues is a computationally intensive task central to numerous applications in the natural sciences. Toward this end, we investigate the quantum block Krylov subspace projector (QBKSP) algorithm - a multireference quantum Lanczos method designed to accurately compute low-lying eigenenergies, including degenerate ones, of quantum systems. We present three compact quantum circuits tailored to different problem settings for evaluating the required expectation values. To assess the impact of the number and fidelity of initial reference states, as well as time evolution duration, we perform error-free and limited-precision numerical simulations and quantum circuit simulations. Our results show that using multiple reference states significantly enhances convergence, particularly in precision-limited scenarios and in cases where a single reference state fails to capture all target eigenvalues. Additionally, the QBKSP algorithm allows for the determination of degenerate eigenstates and their multiplicities through appropriate convergence conditions.</description>

      <title>Few Single-Qubit Measurements Suffice to Certify Any Quantum State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental task in quantum information science is state certification: testing whether a lab-prepared $n$-qubit state is close to a given hypothesis state. In this work, we show that every pure hypothesis state can be certified using only $O(n^2)$ single-qubit measurements applied to $O(n)$ copies of the lab state. Prior to our work, it was not known whether even subexponentially many single-qubit measurements could suffice to certify arbitrary states. This resolves the main open question of Huang, Preskill, and Soleimanifar (FOCS 2024, QIP 2024).
  Our algorithm also showcases the power of adaptive measurements: within each copy of the lab state, previous measurement outcomes dictate how subsequent qubit measurements are made. We show that the adaptivity is necessary, by proving an exponential lower bound on the number of copies needed for any nonadaptive single-qubit measurement algorithm.</description>

Abstract: As quantum computing approaches the threshold where certain tasks demonstrably outpace their classical machines, the need for a precise, clear, consensus-driven definition of quantum advantage becomes essential. Rapid progress in the field has blurred this term across companies, architectures, and application domains. Here, we aim to articulate an operational definition for quantum advantage that is both platform-agnostic and empirically verifiable. Building on this framework, we highlight the algorithmic families most likely to achieve early advantage. Finally, we outline our vision for the near future, in which quantum computers enhance existing high-performance computing platforms, enabling new frontiers in chemistry, materials discovery, optimization, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Counter-propagating spontaneous parametric down-conversion source in lithium niobate on insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum photonic technologies rely on the ability to generate, manipulate, and interfere indistinguishable single photons on a scalable platform. Among the various approaches, spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) remains one of the most widely used methods for generating entangled or pure photon pairs. However most integrated SPDC sources relying on co-propagating geometries have a limited purity of heralded photons, or require lossy filtering. Type-2 SPDC processes can produce pure separable photons but typically suffer from lower efficiency and added complexity due to polarisation management. Here we show the first integrated counter-propagating photon-pair source on lithium niobate on insulator, where signal and idler photons are generated in opposite directions. The counter-propagating geometry leads to spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs without spectral filtering. The joint spectral intensity measurements and unheralded $g^{(2)}$ correlations, yield purities of (92$\pm$3)%. Interference between two independent sources achieves heralded visibilities of (71$\pm$3)%, confirming the scalability of the platform. These results establish a new route toward integrated, high-purity, and tunable photon sources. The demonstrated counter-propagating geometry offers a scalable solution for quantum photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Extended Non-Markovian Stochastic Schr\"odinger Equation with Complex Frequency Modes for General Basis Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an extended formulation of the non-Markovian stochastic Schr\"odinger equation with complex frequency modes (extended cNMSSE), designed for simulating open quantum system dynamics under arbitrary spectral densities. This extension employs non-exponential basis sets to expand the bath correlation functions, overcoming the reliance of the original cNMSSE on exponential decompositions of the spectral density. Consequently, the extended cNMSSE is applicable to environments beyond those characterized by Debye-type spectral densities. The flexibility to employ general basis functions is particularly advantageous for handling spectral densities with higher-order poles, for which exponential decompositions are often inaccurate or unavailable. The extended cNMSSE is implemented in a pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved efficiently via matrix product state (MPS) techniques, preserving the favorable linear-scaling and wavefunction-based nature of the original method. Benchmark simulations across four representative cases, including discrete spectral density, Ohmic spectral density with exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral density, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of forward-backward stochastic Schr\"odinger equations (HFB-SSE) and extended hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the ability to apply an unknown quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system, we develop a quantum algorithm for transforming its singular values. The spectrum of a quantum channel as a superoperator is naturally tied to its Liouville representation, which is in general non-Hermitian. Our key contribution is an approximate block-encoding scheme for this representation in a Hermitized form, given only black-box access to the channel; this immediately allows us to apply polynomial transformations to the channel's singular values by quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). We then demonstrate an $O(d^3/\delta)$ upper bound and an $\Omega(d/\delta)$ lower bound for the query complexity of constructing a quantum channel that is $\delta$-close in diamond norm to a block-encoding of the Hermitized Liouville representation. We show our method applies practically to the problem of learning the $q$-th singular value moments of unknown quantum channels for arbitrary $q&gt;2, q\in \mathbb{R}$, which has implications for testing if a quantum channel is entanglement breaking.</description>

      <title>A Resource Efficient Quantum Kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum processors may enhance machine learning by mapping high-dimensional data onto quantum systems for processing. Conventional quantum kernels, or feature maps, for encoding data features onto a quantum circuit are currently impractical, as the number of entangling gates scales quadratically with the dimension of the dataset and the number of qubits. In this work, we introduce a quantum kernel designed to handle high-dimensional data with a significantly reduced number of qubits and entangling operations. Our approach preserves essential data characteristics while promoting computational efficiency, as evidenced by extensive experiments on benchmark datasets that demonstrate a marked improvement in both accuracy and resource utilization, as compared to state-of-the-art quantum feature maps. Our noisy simulations results combined with lower resource requirements highlight our kernel's ability to function within the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Through numerical simulations and small-scale implementation on a superconducting circuit quantum computing platform, we demonstrate that our scheme performs on par or better than a set of classical algorithms for classification. Our findings herald a promising avenue for the practical implementation of quantum machine learning algorithms on near future quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Singular Value Transformation for Solving the Time-Dependent Maxwell's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations of the form $\mathbf{A}{\frac{\mathbf{\partial f}}{\mathbf{\partial x}}} = \mathbf{B}\mathbf{f}$, based on the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). The algorithm uses block-encoding of $A$ and applies an 21st-degree polynomial approximation to the inverse function $f(x) = 1/x$, enabling relatively shallow quantum circuits implemented on 9 qubits, including two ancilla qubits, corresponding to a grid size of 128 points. Phase angles for the QSVT circuit were optimized classically using the Adagrad gradient-based method over 100 iterations to minimize the solution cost. This approach was simulated in PennyLane and applied to solve a 1D benchmark case of Maxwell's equations in free space, with a Gaussian pulse as the initial condition, where the quantum-computed solution showed high fidelity of more than 99.9% when compared to the normalized classical solution. Results demonstrate the potential of QSVT-based linear solvers on simulators with full quantum state access. However, practical hardware implementations face challenges because accessing the complete quantum state is infeasible. This limitation restricts applicability to cases where only $O({poly}(n))$ observables are needed. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using quantum algorithms, such as QSVT, to solve linear systems of equations, and they point to the need for the development of measurement-efficient algorithms for near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Introduction to Hamiltonian Simulation via High-Order Product Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides a rigorous and self-contained introduction to numerical methods for Hamiltonian simulation in quantum computing, with a focus on high-order product formulas for efficiently approximating the time evolution of quantum systems. Aimed at students and researchers seeking a clear mathematical treatment, the study begins with the foundational principles of quantum mechanics and quantum computation before presenting the Lie-Trotter product formula and its higher-order generalizations. In particular, Suzuki's recursive method is explored to achieve improved error scaling. Through theoretical analysis and illustrative examples, the advantages and limitations of these techniques are discussed, with an emphasis on their application to $k$-local Hamiltonians and their role in overcoming classical computational bottlenecks. The work concludes with a brief overview of current advances and open challenges in Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a study of the complexity of quantum field theories (QFTs) by proposing a measure of information contained in a QFT and its observables. We show that from minimal assertions, one is naturally led to measure complexity by two integers, called format and degree, which characterize the information content of the functions and domains required to specify a theory or an observable. The strength of this proposal is that it applies to any physical quantity, and can therefore be used for analyzing complexities within an individual QFT, as well as studying the entire space of QFTs. We discuss the physical interpretation of our approach in the context of perturbation theory, symmetries, and the renormalization group. Key applications include the detection of complexity reductions in observables, for example due to algebraic relations, and understanding the emergence of simplicity when considering limits. The mathematical foundations of our constructions lie in the framework of sharp o-minimality, which ensures that the proposed complexity measure exhibits general properties inferred from consistency and universality.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging and self-dualities of the $XX$ model and its cousins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. These lattice models flow to the $c =1$ compact boson conformal field theory, with a twist that depends on the lattice size modulo four. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</description>

      <title>Efficient Truncations of SU($N_c$) Lattice Gauge Theory for Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly study the non-perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large $N_c$ expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum chaos and time reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate universal signatures of quantum chaos in the presence of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in generic many body quantum chaotic systems (gMBQCs). We study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through random quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS combined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) universality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At times before $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by deriving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, in the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while breaking time translation symmetry - we show that the SFF is mapped to the partition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where the Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking mechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second independent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time duality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show that many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths manifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor - quantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We establish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state Potts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size, at a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

      <title>High-Stability Single-Ion Clock with $5.5\times10^{-19}$ Systematic Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a single-ion optical atomic clock with fractional frequency uncertainty of $5.5\times10^{-19}$ and fractional frequency stability of $3.5 \times10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/\mathrm{s}}$, based on quantum logic spectroscopy of a single $^{27}$Al$^+$ ion. A co-trapped $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion provides sympathetic cooling and quantum logic readout of the $^{27}$Al$^+$ $^1$S$_0\leftrightarrow^3$P$_0$ clock transition. A Rabi probe duration of 1 s, enabled by laser stability transfer from a remote cryogenic silicon cavity across a 3.6 km fiber link, results in a threefold reduction in instability compared to previous $^{27}$Al$^+$ clocks. Systematic uncertainties are lower due to an improved ion trap electrical design, which reduces excess micromotion, and a new vacuum system, which reduces collisional shifts. We also perform a direction-sensitive measurement of the ac magnetic field due to the RF ion trap, eliminating systematic uncertainty due to field orientation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified geometric framework for modeling learning dynamics in physical, biological, and machine learning systems. The theory reveals three fundamental regimes, each emerging from the power-law relationship $g \propto \kappa^\alpha$ between the metric tensor $g$ in the space of trainable variables and the noise covariance matrix $\kappa$. The quantum regime corresponds to $\alpha = 1$ and describes Schr\"odinger-like dynamics that emerges from a discrete shift symmetry. The efficient learning regime corresponds to $\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2}$ and describes very fast machine learning algorithms. The equilibration regime corresponds to $\alpha = 0$ and describes classical models of biological evolution. We argue that the emergence of the intermediate regime $\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2}$ is a key mechanism underlying the emergence of biological complexity.</description>

      <title>Seeding neural network quantum states with tensor network states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states (MPSs) into restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions consisting of a multinomial hidden unit through a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of the MPSs. This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.</description>

      <title>Analytic toolkit for the Anderson model with arbitrary disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in various branches of physics. The literature is silent, however, on practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model: A Strongly Correlated System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model provides an analytically tractable framework for exotic strongly correlated phases where conventional paradigms like Landau's Fermi liquid theory collapse. This review offers a pedagogical introduction to the SYK physics, highlighting its unique capacity to model \textit{strange metals} -- systems exhibiting linear-in-temperature resistivity, Planckian dissipation, and quasiparticle breakdown. We systematically construct both Majorana and complex fermion variants, transforming them into training grounds for modern many-body physics techniques, for instance, (1) large-$N$ formulations via disorder averaging and replica symmetry, (2) Schwinger-Dyson and Kadanoff-Baym equations, (3) imaginary time Matsubara formulation, (4) real-time dynamics via Keldysh formalism, and the associated (5) non-perturbative Keldysh contour deformations. These tools lay the foundation for equilibrium thermodynamics, quantum chaos, quench dynamics, and transport in the thermodynamic limit, all within a solvable, chaotic quantum system. Intended as a self-contained resource, the review bridges advanced technical machinery to physical insights, with computational implementations provided. Though principally treating the SYK model as a condensed matter laboratory, we also highlight its profound connection to quantum gravity, woven throughout this work, underscoring how this solvable chaotic fermionic model serves as a lens onto black hole thermodynamics and holographic duality.</description>
