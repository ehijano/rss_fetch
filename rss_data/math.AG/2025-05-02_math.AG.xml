      <title>On the Invariance of the Real Milnor Number under Asymptotically Lipschitz Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate sufficient conditions for the invariance of the real Milnor number under $\mathcal{R}$-bi-Lipschitz equivalence for function-germs $ f, g \colon (\mathbb{R}^n, 0) \to (\mathbb{R}, 0) $. More generally, we explore its invariance within the extended framework of $\mathcal{R}$-asymptotically Lipschitz equivalence. To this end, we introduce the $\alpha$-derivative, which provides a natural setting for studying asymptotic growth. Additionally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of $C^k$ and $C^{\infty}$ equivalences, establishing sufficient conditions for the real Milnor number to remain invariant.</description>

      <title>Fourier--Mukai equivalences for formal groups and elliptic Hochschild homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a unifying framework for various forms of twisted Hochschild homology by comparing two definitions of elliptic Hochschild homology: one introduced by Moulinos--Robalo--To\"en and the other by Sibilla--Tomasini. Central to our approach is a new Fourier--Mukai duality for formal groups. We prove that when $\widehat{E}$ is the formal group associated to an elliptic curve $E$, the resulting $\widehat{E}$-Hochschild homology coincides with the mapping stack construction of Sibilla--Tomasini. This identification also recovers ordinary and Hodge Hochschild homology as degenerate limits corresponding to nodal and cuspidal cubics, respectively. Building on this, we introduce global versions of elliptic Hochschild homology over the moduli stacks of elliptic and cubic curves, which interpolate between these theories and suggest a universal form of TMF-Hochschild homology.</description>

      <title>Enumeration Algorithm for Genus-4 Superspecial Hyperelliptic Curves with Automorphism Group $Q_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an algorithm to enumerate genus-4 superspecial hyperelliptic curves whose automorphism groups isomorphic to the quaternion group. By implementing this algorithm with Magma, we successfully obtain the number of isomorphism classes of such curves in every characteristic $7 \leq p &lt; 10000$. Interestingly, the experimental results lead us to the conjecture that there exist exactly $[p/48]$ isomorphism classes of such curves if $p \equiv 1,7 \pmod{8}$, whereas such curves exist if $p \equiv 3,5 \pmod{8}$</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of one dimensional sheaves on log surfaces and Hilbert schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective rational surface, $D\subset X$ an effective anticanonical curve, $\beta$ a curve class on $X$ and $\mathfrak{d}=\sum w_iP_i$ an effective divisor on $D_{\mathrm{sm}}$. We consider the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_\beta(X, D, \mathfrak{d})$ of sheaves on $X$ which are direct images of rank-$1$ torsion-free sheaves on integral curves $C$ in $\beta$ such that $C|_D=\mathfrak{d}$, and show that each point of $\mathcal{M}_\beta(X, D, \mathfrak{d})$ is smooth over a point in the product of the Hilbert schemes of surface singularities of types $A_{w_i-1}$. Hence, $\mathcal{M}_\beta(X, D, \mathfrak{d})$ has symplectic singularities and admits a unique symplectic resolution.</description>

      <title>Stratified Interpretation for De Rham Cohomology and Non-Witt Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly build up the theory of sheaf-correspondence filtered spaces and stratified de Rham complexes for studying singular spaces. We prove the finiteness of a stratified de Rham cohomology and obtain its isomorphism to intersection cohomology through establishing a proper duality theory. Additionally, we present the stratified Poincar\'e duality, the K\"unneth decomposition theorem and develop stratified structure theory to non-Witt spaces as an application of a theory of stratified mezzoperversities. Our results connect differential forms, sheaf theory and intersection homology and pave the way for new approaches to study singular geometries, as well as topological invariants on them. Extensions to conical singularities and fibration of complex curves provide examples of the power of this method. This development will be foundational to new tools in stratified calculus and a strengthening of Hodge theory, advancing research in the Cheeger-Goresky-MacPherson conjecture.</description>

      <title>Generically trivial torsors under constant groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve the Grothendieck-Serre question over an arbitrary base field $k$: for a smooth $k$-group scheme $G$ and a smooth $k$-variety $X$, we show that every generically trivial $G$-torsor over $X$ trivializes Zariski semilocally on $X$. This was known when $G$ is reductive or when $k$ is perfect, and to settle it in general we uncover a wealth of new arithmetic phenomena over imperfect $k$. We build our arguments on new purity theorems for torsors under pseudo-complete, pseudo-proper, and pseudo-finite $k$-groups, for instance, respectively, under wound unipotent $k$-groups, under pseudo-abelian varieties, and under the kernels $\mathrm{Ker}(i_G)$ of comparison maps $i_G$ that relate pseudo-reductive groups to restrictions of scalars of reductive groups. We then deduce an Auslander-Buchsbaum extension theorem for torsors under quasi-reductive $k$-groups; for instance, we show that torsors over $\mathbb{A}^2_k \setminus \{(0,0)\}$ under wound unipotent $k$-groups extend to torsors over $\mathbb{A}^2_k$. For a quasi-reductive $k$-group $G$, this extension theorem allows us to quickly classify $G$-torsors over $\mathbb{P}^1_k$ by an argument that already simplifies the reductive case and to establish Birkhoff, Cartan, and Iwasawa decompositions for $G(k((t)))$. We combine these new results with deep inputs from recent work on the structure of pseudo-reductive and quasi-reductive $k$-groups to show an unramifiedness statement for the Whitehead group (the unstable $K_1$-group) of a quasi-reductive $k$-group, and then use it to argue that, for a smooth $k$-group $G$ and a semilocal $k$-algebra $A$, every $G$-torsor over $\mathbb{P}^1_A$ trivial at $\{t = \infty\}$ is also trivial at $\{t = 0\}$, which is known to imply the Grothendieck--Serre conclusion via geometric arguments. To achieve all this, we develop and heavily use the structure theory of $k$-group schemes locally of finite type.</description>

      <title>Routing functions for parameter space decomposition to describe stability landscapes of ecological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changes in environmental or system parameters often drive major biological transitions, including ecosystem collapse, disease outbreaks, and tumor development. Analyzing the stability of steady states in dynamical systems provides critical insight into these transitions. This paper introduces an algebraic framework for analyzing the stability landscapes of ecological models defined by systems of first-order autonomous ordinary differential equations with polynomial or rational rate functions. Using tools from real algebraic geometry, we characterize parameter regions associated with steady-state feasibility and stability via three key boundaries: singular, stability (Routh-Hurwitz), and coordinate boundaries. With these boundaries in mind, we employ routing functions to compute the connected components of parameter space in which the number and type of stable steady states remain constant, revealing the stability landscape of these ecological models. As case studies, we revisit the classical Levins-Culver competition-colonization model and a recent model of coral-bacteria symbioses. In the latter, our method uncovers complex stability regimes, including regions supporting limit cycles, that are inaccessible via traditional techniques. These results demonstrate the potential of our approach to inform ecological theory and intervention strategies in systems with nonlinear interactions and multiple stable states.</description>

      <title>Beyond Affine Loops: A Geometric Approach to Program Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring software correctness remains a fundamental challenge in formal program verification. One promising approach relies on finding polynomial invariants for loops. Polynomial invariants are properties of a program loop that hold before and after each iteration. Generating polynomial invariants is a crucial task for loops, but it is an undecidable problem in the general case. Recently, an alternative approach to this problem has emerged, focusing on synthesizing loops from invariants. However, existing methods only synthesize affine loops without guard conditions from polynomial invariants. In this paper, we address a more general problem, allowing loops to have polynomial update maps with a given structure, inequations in the guard condition, and polynomial invariants of arbitrary form.
  In this paper, we use algebraic geometry tools to design and implement an algorithm that computes a finite set of polynomial equations whose solutions correspond to all loops satisfying the given polynomial invariants. In other words, we reduce the problem of synthesizing loops to finding solutions of polynomial systems within a specified subset of the complex numbers. The latter is handled in our software using an SMT solver.</description>

      <title>Rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ when $N$ is non-squarefree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a non-squarefree integer such that the quotient $X_0(N)^*$ of the modular curve $X_0(N)$ by the full group of Atkin-Lehner involutions has positive genus. We establish an integrality result for the $j$-invariants of non-cuspidal rational points on $X_0(N)^*$, representing a significant step toward resolving a key subcase of Elkies' conjecture. To this end, we prove the existence of rank-zero quotients of certain modular Jacobians $J_0(pq)$. Furthermore, we provide a conjecturally complete classification of the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ of genus $1 \leq g \leq 5$. In the process we identify exceptional rational points on $X_0(147)^*$ and $X_0(75)^*$ which were not known before.</description>

      <title>On the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let k be a field and X a smooth projective variety over k. When k is a number field, the Beilinson--Bloch conjecture relates the ranks of the Chow groups of X to the order of vanishing of certain L-functions. We consider the same conjecture when k is a global function field, and give a criterion for the conjecture to hold for X, extending an earlier result of Jannsen. As an application, we provide a new proof of a theorem of Geisser connecting the Tate conjecture over finite fields and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture over function fields. We then prove the Tate conjecture for a product of a smooth projective curve with a power of a CM elliptic curve over any finitely generated field, and thus deduce special cases of the Beilinson--Bloch conjecture. In the process we obtain a conditional answer to a question of Moonen on the Chow groups of powers of ordinary CM elliptic curves over arbitrary fields.</description>

Abstract: We give a classification of rank $r$ torus equivariant vector bundles $\mathcal{E}$ on a toric scheme $\mathfrak{X}$ over a discrete valuation ring $\mathcal{O}$, in terms of graded piecewise linear maps $\Phi$ from the fan of $\mathfrak{X}$ to the (extended) building of $GL(r)$. This is an extension of Klyachko's classification of torus equivariant vector bundles on toric varieties over a field on one hand, and Mumford's classification of equivariant line bundles on toric schemes over $\mathcal{O}$ on the other hand. We also give a simple criterion for equivariant splitting of $\mathcal{E}$ into a sum of toric line bundles in terms of its piecewise linear map. Among other things, this work lays the foundations for study of arithmetic geometry of toric vector bundles.</description>

      <title>Variations of GIT quotients and dimer combinatorics for toric compound Du Val singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dimer model is a bipartite graph described on the real two-torus, and it gives the quiver as the dual graph. It is known that for any three-dimensional Gorenstein toric singularity, there exists a dimer model such that a GIT quotient parametrizing stable representations of the associated quiver is a projective crepant resolution of this singularity for some stability parameter. It is also known that the space of stability parameters has the wall-and-chamber structure, and for any projective crepant resolution of a three-dimensional Gorenstein toric singularity can be realized as the GIT quotient associated to a stability parameter contained in some chamber. In this paper, we consider dimer models giving rise to projective crepant resolutions of a toric compound Du Val singularity. We show that sequences of zigzag paths, which are special paths on a dimer model, determine the wall-and-chamber structure of the space of stability parameters. Moreover, we can track the variations of stable representations under wall-crossing using the sequences of zigzag paths.</description>

      <title>The section conjecture for the toric fundamental group over $p$-adic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07923v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The toric fundamental group is the Tannaka dual of a category of vector bundles which become direct sums of line bundles on a finite \'etale cover. It is an extension of the \'etale fundamental group scheme by a projective limit of tori.
  Grothendieck's section conjecture for the \'etale fundamental group implies the analogous statement for the toric fundamental group. We call this the toric section conjecture. We prove that a resolution of the toric section conjecture would reduce the original one to particular cases about which more is known, mainly due to J. Stix.
  We prove that abelian varieties over $p$-adic fields satisfy the toric section conjecture, and give strong evidence that it holds for hyperbolic curves over $p$-adic fields, too.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2016, Buryak and Rossi introduced the quantum Double Ramification (DR) hierarchies which associate a quantum integrable hierarchy to any Cohomological Field Theory (CohFT). Shortly after, they introduced, in collaboration with Dubrovin and Gu\'er\'e, the quantum tau functions of these hierarchies. In this work, we study quantum tau functions associated to a specific solution called the topological solution. We provide two cohomological representations for the correlators of these tau functions. The first representation involves an analog in the quantum setting of the $A$-class of the DR-DZ equivalence. The second representation, valid for CohFT of low degree, involves the so-called $\Omega$-classes. Furthermore, we establish the string and dilaton equations for these tau functions, and present certain vanishing of their correlators.</description>

Abstract: We prove an elegant structure theorem for log de Rham-Witt sheaves with vanishing along an effective Cartier divisor $D$ defined in arXiv:2403.18763, answering a question of Shuji Saito during the Mainz conference and a question of Yigeng Zhao during a short visit of the author last summer. Our structural result for the log forms also lays the foundation for the study of Milnor $K$-theory with vanishing along $D$ in the paper to come.</description>

      <title>On strong Euler-homogeneity and Saito-holonomicity for complex hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on previous work on linear free divisors by Granger et al., we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for a general divisor to be strongly Euler-homogeneous in terms of some Fitting ideals.
  We also define the notions of weak and strong Saito-holonomicity for a general divisor in such a way that they extend the definitions of Saito-holonomicity and weak and strong Koszul-freeness. Then, we characterize these properties using the Fitting ideals previously defined. Finally, we generalize some results regarding Koszul-freeness and strong Euler-homogeneity to the non-free case.</description>

      <title>Advances on a conjecture about free divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2002, it was conjectured that a free divisor satisfying the so-called Logarithmic Comparison Theorem (LCT) must be strongly Euler-homogeneous. Today, it is known to be true only in ambient dimension less or equal than three or assuming Koszul-freeness. Thanks to our advances in the comprehension of strong Euler-homogeneity, we are able to prove the conjecture in the following new cases: assuming strong Euler-homogeneity on a punctured neighbourhood of a point; assuming the divisor is weakly Koszul-free; for ambient dimension $n=4$; for linear free divisors in ambient dimension $n=5$. We also refute a conjecture that states that all linear free divisors satisfy LCT and are strongly Euler-homogeneous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the existence of a $Z$-positive and $Z$-critical Hermitian metric on a rank 2 holomorphic vector bundle over a compact K\"ahler surface implies that the bundle is $Z$-stable. As particular cases, we obtain stability results for the deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills equation and the almost Hermite-Einstein equation for rank 2 bundles over surfaces. We show examples of $Z$-unstable bundles and $Z$-critical metrics away from the large volume limit.</description>

      <title>Finding all solutions to the KZ equations in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KZ equations are differential equations satisfied by the correlation functions (on the Riemann sphere) of two-dimensional conformal field theories associated with an affine Lie algebra at a fixed level. They form a system of complex partial differential equations with regular singular points satisfied by the $n$-point functions of affine primary fields. In [SV1] the KZ equations were identified with equations for flat sections of suitable Gauss-Manin connections, and solutions of the KZ equations were constructed in the form of multidimensional hypergeometric integrals. In [SV2] the KZ equations were considered modulo a prime number $p$, and, for rational levels, polynomial solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p$ were constructed by an elementary procedure as suitable $p$-approximations of the hypergeometric integrals. In this paper we study in detail the first nontrivial example of the KZ equations in characteristic $p$. In particular, if the level is irrational, we prove a version of the steepest descent result that relates the KZ local system to the space of functions on the critical locus of the master function. We use this result to prove the generic irreducibility of the KZ local system at any irrational level. If the level is rational, we describe all solutions of the KZ equations in characteristic $p$ by demonstrating that they all stem from the $p$-hypergeometric solutions. Finally, we prove a Lagrangian property of the subbundle of the KZ bundle spanned by the $p$-hypergeometric sections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review $\mathrm{Hom}$-infinite Frobenius categorification of cluster algebras with coefficients and use it to give two applications of Jensen--King--Su's Frobenius categorification of the Grassmannian: 1) we determine the $g$-vectors of the Pl\"ucker coordinates with respect to the triangular initial seed and 2) we express the $F$-polynomials associated with the Donaldson--Thomas transformation in terms of $3$-dimensional Young diagrams thus providing a new proof for a theorem of Daping Weng.</description>

      <title>On Gromov--Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^1$-orbifolds and topological difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(m_1, m_2)$ be a pair of positive integers. Denote by $\mathbb{P}^1$ the complex projective line, and by $\mathbb{P}^1_{m_1,m_2}$ the orbifold complex projective line obtained from $\mathbb{P}^1$ by adding $\mathbb{Z}_{m_1}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{m_2}$ orbifold points. In this paper we introduce a matrix linear difference equation, prove existence and uniqueness of its formal Puiseux-series solutions, and use them to give conjectural formulas for $k$-point ($k\ge2$) functions of Gromov--Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^1_{m_1,m_2}$. Explicit expressions of the unique solutions are also obtained. We carry out concrete computations of the first few invariants by using the conjectural formulas. For the case when one of $m_1, m_2$ equals 1, we prove validity of the conjectural formulas.</description>

      <title>A decomposition lemma in convex integration via classical algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a decomposition lemma that allows error terms to be expressed using fewer rank-one symmetric matrices than $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ within the convex integration scheme of constructing flexible $C^{1,\alpha}$ solutions to a system of nonlinear PDEs in dimension $n\geq 2$, which can be viewed as a kind of truncation of the codimension one local isometric embedding equation in Nash-Kuiper Theorem. This leads to flexible solutions with higher H\"older regularity, and consequently, improved very weak solutions to certain induced equations for any $n$, including Monge-Amp\`ere systems and $2$-Hessian systems. The H\"older exponent of the solutions can be taken as any $\alpha &lt;(n^2+1)^{-1}$ for $n=2,4,8,16$, and any $\alpha&lt;(n^2+n-2\rho(\frac{n}{2})-1)^{-1}$ for other $n$, thereby improving the previously known bound $\alpha&lt;(n^2+n+1)^{-1}$ for $n\geq 3$. Here, $\rho(n)$ is the Radon-Hurwitz number, which exhibits an $8$-fold periodicity on $n$ that is related to Bott periodicity.
  Our arguments involve novel applications of several results from algebraic geometry and topology, including Adams' theorem on maximum linearly independent vector fields on spheres, the intersection of projective varieties, and projective duality. We also use an elliptic method ingeniously that avoids loss of differentiability.</description>
