      <title>A unified approach for domination and packing problems in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce new concepts of domination and packing functions in graphs, which generalize, respectively, the labelled dominating and packing functions defined by Lee and Chang in 2008, and Hinrichsen et al. in 2019. These generalized functions offer a unified and simpler framework for addressing many of the variations of domination and packing concepts in graphs explored in the literature. Interestingly, their associated optimization problems turn out to be equivalent, providing insight to explain the observed coincidences in computational complexity results for graph classes where both problems, the domination one and its corresponding packing variation, have been analyzed. This equivalence also allows us to solve some computational complexity open questions, for some graph classes.
  Furthermore, we prove that the generalized problems remain solvable in polynomial time for graphs with bounded clique-width and strongly chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>Cyclic relative difference sets and circulant weighing matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $(m,n,k,\lambda)$-relative difference set is a lifting of a $(m,k,n\lambda)$-difference set. Lam gave a table of cyclic relative difference sets with $k \leq 50$ in 1977, all of which were liftings of $( \frac{q^d-1}{q-1},q^{d-1},q^{d-2}(q-1))$-difference sets, the parameters of complements of classical Singer difference sets. Pott found all cyclic liftings of these difference sets with $n$ odd and $k \leq 64$ in 1995. No other nontrivial difference sets are known with liftings to relative difference sets, and Pott ended his survey on relative difference sets asking whether there are any others.
  In this paper we extend these searches, and apply the results to the existence of circulant weighing matrices.</description>

      <title>The Cloud and Flock Polynomials of q-Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Whitney function of a q-matroid can be determined from the cloud and flock polynomials associated to the cyclic flats. These polynomials capture information about the corank (resp., nullity) of certain spaces whose cyclic core (resp., closure) is the given cyclic flat. Going one step further, we prove that the Whitney function, and in fact all cloud and flock polynomials, are determined by the configuration of the q-matroid, that is the abstract lattice of cyclic flats together with the corank-nullity data. Examples illustrate that the converses of the above statements are not true. This has the consequence that the Whitney function of a direct sum is not determined by the Whitney functions of the summands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lattice point in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a point $(x,y)$ with $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$, and a lattice triangle is a triangle whose three vertices are all lattice points. We investigate the integers $k$ with the property that if $T$ is a lattice triangle with $3$ boundary points and $k$ points in the interior, then all $k$ boundary points must be collinear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, a set is $\Delta$-convex if there is no vertex $u\in V(G)\setminus S$ forming a triangle with two vertices of $S$. The $\Delta$-convex hull of $S$ is the minimum $\Delta$-convex set containing $S$. This article is an attempt to discuss the Carath\'eodory number and exchange number on various graph families and standard graph products namely Cartesian, strong and, lexicographic products of graphs.</description>

      <title>Maximum degree and connectivity on claw-free $1$-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of claw-free planar graphs dates back to Plummer's work in 1989. Plummer showed that the maximum degree of every 3-connected claw-free planar graph is at most 6. In this paper, we first show that the bound holds for all, not necessarily 3-connected, claw-free planar graphs. We then establish an analogous result for claw-free 1-planar graphs. Specifically, we show that the maximum degree of claw-free 1-planar graphs is at most 10, and the bound is tight. In addition, we show that the maximum degree of claw-free optimal 1-planar graphs is at most 8. Finally, we determine the upper bound on the vertex-connectivity of claw-free 1-planar graphs, which implies that every 7-connected 1-planar graph contains induced claws.</description>

      <title>A note on symmetries of rich sequences with minimum critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using three examples of sequences over a finite alphabet, we want to draw attention to the fact that these sequences having the minimum critical exponent in a given class of sequences show a large degree of symmetry, i.e., they are G-rich with respect to a group G generated by more than one antimorphism. The notion of G-richness generalizes the notion of richness in palindromes which is based on one antimorphism, namely the reversal mapping. The three examples are: 1) the Thue-Morse sequence which has the minimum critical exponent among all binary sequences; 2) the sequence which has the minimum critical exponent among all binary rich sequences; 3) the sequence which has the minimum critical exponent among all ternary rich sequences.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Lovasz theta function via walk generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new characterization of the Lovasz theta function is provided by relating it to the (weighted) walk-generating function, thus establishing a relationship between two seemingly quite distinct concepts in algebraic graph theory. An application of this new characterization is given by showing how it straightforwardly entails multiple natural generalizations of the Hoffman upper bound (on both the independence number and Lovasz number) to arbitrary non-regular graphs. Lastly, the derivation of the new characterization involves proving a certain analysis result which may in itself be of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate unbiased weighing matrices of weight $9$ and provide a construction method using mutually suitable Latin squares. For $n \le 16$, we determine the maximum size among sets of mutually unbiased weighing matrices of order $n$ and weight $9$. Notably, our findings reveal that $13$ is the smallest order where such pairs exist, and $16$ is the first order for which a maximum class of unbiased weighing matrices is found.</description>

      <title>A note on the minimum size of Tur\'{a}n systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For positive integers $n \ge s &gt; r$, a \emph{Tur\'{a}n $(n,s,r)$-system} is an $n$-vertex $r$-graph in which every set of $s$ vertices contains at least one edge. Let $T(n,s,r)$ denote the the minimum size of a Tur\'{a}n $(n,s,r)$-system.
  Upper bounds on $T(n,s,r)$ were established by Sidorenko~\cite{Sid97} for the case $s-r = \Omega(r/\ln r)$ (based on a construction of Frankl--R\"{o}dl~\cite{FR85}) and by a number of authors in the case $s-r = O(1)$. In this note, we establish upper bounds in the remaining range $O(1)&lt;s-r = O(r/\ln r)$.</description>

      <title>Degree Realization by Bipartite Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of realizing a given degree sequence by a multigraph can be thought of as a relaxation of the classical degree realization problem (where the realizing graph is simple). This paper concerns the case where the realizing multigraph is required to be bipartite.
  The problem of characterizing degree sequences that can be realized by a bipartite (simple) graph has two variants. In the simpler one, termed BDR$^P$, the partition of the degree sequence into two sides is given as part of the input. A complete characterization for realizability in this variant was given by Gale and Ryser over sixty years ago. However, the variant where the partition is not given, termed BDR, is still open.
  For bipartite multigraph realizations, there are also two variants. For BDR$^P$, where the partition is given as part of the input, a complete characterization was known for determining whether there is a multigraph realization whose underlying graph is bipartite, such that the maximum number of copies of an edge is at most $r$. We present a complete characterization for determining if there is a bipartite multigraph realization such that the total number of excess edges is at most $t$. We show that optimizing these two measures may lead to different realizations, and that optimizing by one measure may increase the other substantially. As for the variant BDR, where the partition is not given, we show that determining whether a given (single) sequence admits a bipartite multigraph realization is NP-hard. On the positive side, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal realizations for the case where the number of balanced partitions is polynomial, and present sufficient conditions for the existence of bipartite multigraph realizations that depend only on the largest degree of the sequence.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the outer-weakly convex domination number in graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a simple undirected graph. A set $C \subseteq V(G)$ is weakly convex of graph $G$ if for every two vertices $u,v\in G$, there exists a $u-v$ geodesic whose vertices are in $C$. A set $C \subseteq V$ is an outer-weakly convex dominating set if it is dominating set and every vertex not in $C$ is adjacent to some vertex in $C$ and a set $V(G)\setminus C$ is weakly convex. The outer-weakly convex domination number of graph $G$, denoted by $\widetilde{ \gamma}_{wcon}(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of an outer-weakly convex dominating vertex set of graph $G$. In this paper, we determined the outer-weakly convex domination number of two graphs under the cartesian, strong and lexicographic products, and discuss some important combinatorial findings.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ and $N$ be matroids such that $N$ is the image of $M$ under a rank-preserving weak map. Generalizing results of Lucas, we prove that, for $x$ and $y$ positive, $T(M;x,y)\geq T(N;x,y)$ if and only if $x+y\geq xy$ or $M\cong N$. We give a number of consequences of this result.</description>

      <title>Quasi-immanants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an integer partition $ \lambda$ of $n$ and an $n \times n$ matrix $A$, consider the expansion of the immanant $\text{Imm}^{\lambda}(A)$ as a sum indexed by permutations $\sigma$ of order $n$, with coefficients given by the irreducible characters $\chi^{\lambda}(\text{ctype}(\sigma))$ of the symmetric group $S_{n}$, for the cycle type $\text{ctype}(\sigma) \vdash n$ of $\sigma$. Skandera et al. have introduced combinatorial interpretations of a generalization of immanants given by replacing the coefficient $\chi^{\lambda}(\text{ctype}(\sigma))$ with preimages with respect to the Frobenius morphism of elements among the distinguished bases of the algebra $\textsf{Sym}$ of symmetric functions. Since $ \textsf{Sym}$ is contained in the algebra $\textsf{QSym}$ of quasisymmetric functions, this leads us to further generalize immanants with the use of quasisymmetric functions. Since bases of $ \textsf{QSym}$ are indexed by integer compositions, we make use of cycle compositions in place of cycle types to define the family of quasi-immanants introduced in this paper. This is achieved through the use of the quasisymmetric power sum bases due to Ballantine et al., and we prove a combinatorial formula for the coefficients arising in an analogue, given by a special case of quasi-immanants associated with quasisymmetric Schur functions, of second immanants.</description>

      <title>Rational values of the weak saturation limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $F$, a graph $G$ is weakly $F$-saturated if all non-edges of $G$ can be added in some order so that each new edge introduces a copy of $F$. The weak saturation number $\operatorname{wsat}(n, F)$ is the minimum number of edges in a weakly $F$-saturated graph on $n$ vertices. Bollob\'as initiated the study of weak saturation in 1968 to study percolation processes, which originated in biology and have applications in physics and computer science. It was shown by Alon that for each $F$, there is a constant $w_F$ such that $\operatorname{wsat}(n, F) = w_Fn + o(n)$. We characterize all possible rational values of $w_F$, proving in particular that $w_F$ can equal any rational number at least $\frac 32$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by very large-scale communication networks, we newly introduce exponentiation of graphs. Using the exponential operation on graphs, we can construct various graphs of multi-exponential order with logarithmic diameter. We show that every connected exponential graph is maximally connected. For exponential graphs, we also present a necessary and sufficient condition to be super edge-connected and sufficient conditions to be Hamiltonian and to have edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles and completely independent spanning trees. Applying our results to previously known networks, we have maximally connected and super edge-connected Hamiltonian graphs of doubly exponential order with logarithmic diameter. We furthermore define iterated exponential graphs which may be of not only practical but also theoretical interest.</description>

      <title>Chocolate Games with a Pass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The authors present their research on chocolate games with a pass-move. Chocolate games are generalizations of Nim. In this work, we modify the standard rules of the game to allow a one-time pass; that is, a pass-move may be used at most once in the game, but not from a terminal position. Once the pass has been used by either player, it is no longer available. In the case of the classical three-pile nim with $x,y,z$ for the number of stones of each pile, the previous player wins when the ``exclusive or'' of $x,y,z$ is $0$, and its Grundy number is calculated as ``exclusive or'' of $x,y,z$. However, no mathematical formula is known for the previous player's winning position when a pass-move is allowed. In this study, we show a theorem to determine the Grundy number of a position with a pass where the position can be considered as a disjunctive sum of two positions which have a special property. By using the theorem, we show closed formulas for positions which have Grundy numbers $0, 1,$ and $2$ for some chocolate games with a pass.</description>

      <title>Many pentagons in triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every $n$ vertex linear triple system with $m$ edges has at least $m^6/n^7$
  copies of a pentagon, provided $m&gt;100 \, n^{3/2}$. This provides the first nontrivial bound for a question posed by Jiang and Yepremyan.
  More generally, for each $ \ell \ge 2$, we prove that there is a constant $c$ such that if an $n$-vertex graph is $\varepsilon$-far from being triangle-free, with $\varepsilon \gg n^{-1/3\ell}$, then it has at least $c \, \varepsilon^{3\ell} n^{2\ell+1}$ copies of $C_{2\ell+1}$. This improves the previous best bound of $c \, \varepsilon^{4\ell+2} n^{2\ell+1}$ due to Gishboliner, Shapira and Wigderson.
  Our result also yields some geometric theorems, including the following. For $n$ large, every $n$-point set in the plane with at least $60\, n^{11/6}$ triangles similar to a given triangle $T$, contains two triangles sharing a special point, called the harmonic point. In the other direction, we give a construction showing that the exponent $11/6\approx 1.83$ cannot be reduced to anything smaller than $\log_3 6 \approx 1.63$.</description>

      <title>Iteration of the mincut graph operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph operator is a mapping $\phi$ which maps every graph $G$ from some class of graphs to a new graph $\phi(G)$. In this paper, we introduce and study the properties of the mincut operator, specifically the effects of iteration of the operator. We show that the property of being super edge-connected and regular is both necessary and sufficient for a graph to remain fixed under the mincut operator. Furthermore, we show that no graph diverges under iteration of this operator. We conclude by stating further research questions on the mincut operator.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration of square-tiled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a combinatorial reconfiguration problem on a subclass of quadrangulations of surfaces called square-tiled surfaces. Our elementary move is a shear in a cylinder that corresponds to a well-chosen sequence of diagonal flips that preserves the square-tiled properties. We conjecture that the connected components of this reconfiguration problem are in bijection with the connected components of the moduli space of quadratic differentials. We prove that the conjecture holds in the so-called hyperelliptic components of Abelian square-tiled surfaces. More precisely, we show that any two such square-tiled surfaces of genus $g$ can be connected by $O(g)$ powers of cylinder shears.</description>

      <title>Tropical cycles of discrete admissible covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article applies the technical framework developed in previous work by the author to discrete admissible covers and their moduli spaces. More precisely, we construct a poic-space that parameterizes the discrete admissible covers after fixing the genus of the target, the number of marked legs, and prescribing the ramification profiles above these marked legs. We then construct a linear poic-fibration over this poic-space and show that the usual weight assignment of covers produces an equivariant cycle of this poic-fibration. This poic-fibration comes naturally with source and target maps, and after taking the weak pushforward in top dimension through the source map and subsequently forgetting the marking, this gives rise to an equivariant tropical cycle of the corresponding spanning tree fibration. Through this framework we obtain a generalization of previously known results on these cycles pertaining to the gonality of tropical curves. Special cases of these tropical cycles yield the following result: \emph{A generic genus-$g$ $r$-marked tropical curve $\Gamma$ (with $g+r$ even) has $C_{\frac{g+r}{2}}$ many $r$-marked discrete admissible covers of degree $\frac{g+r}{2}+1$ of a tree (counted with multiplicity) that have a tropical modification of $\Gamma$ as a source, where $C_{\frac{g+r}{2}}$ is the $(\frac{g+r}{2})$th Catalan number}.</description>

      <title>Strongly self-dual polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims to study the class of strongly self-dual polytopes (ssd-polytopes for short), defined in a paper by Lov\'asz \cite{lovasz}. He described a series of such polytopes (called $L$-type polytopes), which he used to solve a combinatorial problem. From a geometrical point of view, there are interesting questions: what additional elements of this class exist, and are there any with a different structure from the $L$-type ones? We show that in dimension three, one of their faces defines $L$-type polyhedra. Illustrating the algorithm of the proof, we present an ssd-polytope of 23 vertices whose combinatorial structure differ from those of $L$-type ones. Finally, with an elementary discussion, we prove that for fewer than nine vertices, there are only fifth one ssd-polyhedra, four of them can be constructed by Lov\'asz's method, and we can find the fifth one with "the diameter gradient flow algorithm" of Katz, Memoli and Wang \cite{katz-memoli-wang}.</description>

      <title>A Survey of the Holroyd-Talbot Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of sets is {\it intersecting} if every pair of its members has an element in common. Such a family of sets is called a {\it star} if some element is in every set of the family. Given a graph $G$, let $\mu(G)$ denote the size of the smallest maximal independent set of $G$. In 2005, Holroyd and Talbot conjectured the following generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem: if $1\le r\le \mu(G)/2$ then there is an intersecting family of independent $r$-sets of maximum size that is a star. In this paper we present the history of this conjecture and survey the results that have supported it over the last 20 years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every finite graph $G$ can be decomposed in a canonical way that displays its local connectivity-structure [DJKK22]. For this, they consider a suitable covering of $G$, an inherently infinite concept from Topology, and project its tangle-tree structure to $G$.
  We present a construction of these decompositions via a finite combinatorial theory of local separations, which we introduce here and which is compatible with the covering-perspective.</description>

      <title>Boxicity and Cubicity of Divisor Graphs and Power Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textit{boxicity} (\textit{cubicity}) of an undirected graph $\Gamma$ is the smallest non-negative integer $k$ such that $\Gamma$ can be represented as the intersection graph of axis-parallel rectangular boxes (unit cubes) in $\mathbb{R}^k$. An undirected graph is classified as a \textit{comparability graph} if it is isomorphic to the comparability graph of some partial order. This paper studies boxicity and cubicity for subclasses of comparability graphs.
  We initiate the study of boxicity and cubicity of a special class of algebraically defined comparability graphs, namely the \textit{power graphs}. The power graph of a group is an undirected graph whose vertex set is the group itself, with two elements being adjacent if one is a power of the other. We analyse the case when the underlying groups of power graphs are cyclic. Another important family of comparability graphs is \textit{divisor graphs}, which arises from a number-theoretically defined poset, namely the \textit{divisibility poset}. We consider a subclass of divisor graphs, denoted by $D(n)$, where the vertex set is the set of positive divisors of a natural number $n$.
  We first show that to study the boxicity (cubicity) of the power graph of the cyclic group of order $n$, it is sufficient to study the boxicity (cubicity) of $D(n)$. We derive estimates, tight up to a factor of $2$, for the boxicity and cubicity of $D(n)$. The exact estimates hold good for power graphs of cyclic groups.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of affine cactus groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the study of affine cactus groups from a combinatorial point of view. Those groups are extensions of cactus groups, which are related to braid and diagram groups and have gained an important place in many mathematics topics. We first show that affine cactus groups may be described as cactus groups on Coxeter groups of type eAn. Then, we prove that these groups embed into a semi-direct product of Coxeter groups, which allows us to obtain a number of combinatorial properties of affine cactus groups, such as the solubility of the world problem or the fact that their centre is trivial.</description>

      <title>Small gaps in the Ulam sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ulam sequence, described by Stanislaw Ulam in the 1960s, starts $1,2$ and then iteratively adds the smallest integer that can be uniquely written as the sum of two distinct earlier terms: this gives $1,2,3,4,6,8,11,\dots$. Already in 1972 the great French poet Raymond Queneau wrote that it `gives an impression of great irregularity'. This irregularity appears to have a lot of structure which has inspired a great deal of work; nonetheless, very little is rigorously proven. We improve the best upper bound on its growth and show that at least some small gaps have to exist: for some $c&gt;0$ and all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ $$ \min_{1 \leq k \leq n} \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \leq 1 + c\frac{\log{n}}{n}.$$</description>

      <title>The Integrable Snake Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A pure snake configuration is a bijection $\sigma:\mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{Z}^2$ containing no two-cycles and such that for each $x \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ we have $\sigma(x) \in \{ x , x+ \mathbf{e}^1, x+\mathbf{e}^2 , x- \mathbf{e}^2 \}.$ The non-trivial cycles of a pure snake configuration may be regarded as a collection of non-intersecting paths in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ that may travel right, up, or down (but not left) from a given vertex. Pure snake configurations are a generalisation of lozenge tilings, which are in natural correspondence with paths that only travel right or up. We introduce a natural partition function on a finite version of this model, and study the probabilistic properties of random pure snake configurations chosen according to their contribution to this partition function. Under a suitable weighting, the model is integrable in the sense that we have access to explicit formulas for its partition and correlation functions. We utilise the integrable structure of this model in various applications, such as to prove a traffic representation of ASEP on the ring, generalising the analogous result for TASEP by the first author.</description>

Abstract: Let $K_4$ be the complete graph on four vertices. Let $f$ be a continuous map of $K_4$ to the plane such that $f$-images of non-adjacent edges are disjoint. For any vertex $v \in K_4$ take the winding number of the $f$-image of the cycle $K_4 - v$ around $f(v)$. It is known that the sum of these four integers is odd. We construct examples showing that this is the only relation between these four numbers.</description>

      <title>$F_\sigma$-ideals, colorings, and representation in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent works by L. Drewnowski and I. Labuda and J. Mart\'inez et al., non-pathological analytic \( P \)-ideals and non-pathological \( F_\sigma \)-ideals have been characterized and studied in terms of their representations by a sequence \( (x_n)_n \) in a Banach space, as \( \mathcal{C}((x_n)_n) \) and \( \mathcal{B}((x_n)_n) \). The ideal \( \mathcal{C}((x_n)_n) \) consists of sets where the series \( \sum_{n \in A} x_n \) is unconditionally convergent, while \( \mathcal{B}((x_n)_n) \) involves weak unconditional convergence.
  In this paper, we further study these representations and provide effective descriptions of \( \mathcal{B} \)- and \( \mathcal{C} \)-ideals in the universal spaces \( C([0,1]) \) and \( C(2^{\mathbb{N}}) \), addressing a question posed by Borodulin-Nadzieja et al. A key aspect of our study is the role of the space \( c_0 \) in these representations. We focus particularly on \( \mathcal{B} \)-representations in spaces containing many copies of \( c_0 \), such as \( c_0 \)-saturated spaces of continuous functions.
  A central tool in our analysis is the concept of \( c \)-coloring ideals, which arise from homogeneous sets of continuous colorings. These ideals, generated by homogeneous sets of 2-colorings, exhibit a rich combinatorial structure. Among our results, we prove that for \( d \geq 3 \), the random \( d \)-homogeneous ideal is pathological,
  we construct hereditarily non-pathological universal \( c \)-coloring ideals, and we show that every \( \mathcal{B} \)-ideal represented in \( C(K) \), for \( K \) countable, contains a \( c \)-coloring ideal. Furthermore, by leveraging \( c \)-coloring ideals, we provide examples of \( \mathcal{B} \)-ideals that are not \( \mathcal{B} \)-representable in \( c_0 \). These findings highlight the interplay between combinatorial properties of ideals and their representations in Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>A divisor generating $q$-series and cumulants arising from random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uchimura, in 1987, introduced a probability generating function for a random variable $X$ and using properties of this function he discovered an interesting $q$-series identity. He further showed that the $m$-th cumulant with respect to the random variable $X$ is nothing but the generating function for the generalized divisor function $\sigma_{m-1}(n)$. Simon, Crippa, and Collenberg, in 1993, explored the $G_{n,p}$-model of a random acyclic digraph and defined a random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$. Quite interestingly, they found links between limit of its mean and the generating function for the divisor function $d(n)$. Later in 1997, Andrews, Crippa, and Simon extended these results using $q$-series techniques. They calculated limit of the mean and variance of the random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$ which correspond to the first and second cumulants. In this paper, we calculate limit of the third, fourth, and fifth cumulants. Observing a pattern among cumulants, we propose a conjecture for the limit of the $t$-th cumulant in terms of the generalized divisor function. Furthermore, we also discover limit forms for identities of Uchimura and Dilcher. This provides a fourth side to the Uchimura-Ramanujan-divisor type three way partition identities expounded by the authors recently.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Seshadri stratifications on normal toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the theory of Seshadri stratifications to embedded toric varieties $X_P\subseteq \mathbb P(V)$ associated with a normal lattice polytope $P$. The approach presented here is purely combinatorial and completely independent of \cite{CFL}. In particular, we get a close connection between a certain class of triangulations of the polytope $P$, Seshadri stratifications of $X_P$ arising from torus orbit closures, and the associated degenerate semi-toric varieties. In the last section we show that the approach here and the one in \cite{CFL} produce the same quasi-valuations and hence the same degenerations of $X_P$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open projected Richardson varieties form a stratification for the partial flag variety $G/P$. We compare the Segre--MacPherson classes of open projected Richardson varieties with those of the corresponding affine Schubert cells by pushing or pulling these classes to the affine Grassmannian. In the case of the Grassmannian $G/P=\operatorname{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^n)$, the open projected Richardson varieties are known as open positroid varieties. We obtain symmetric functions that represent the Segre--MacPherson classes of these open positroid varieties, constructed explicitly in terms of pipe dreams for affine permutations.</description>

      <title>Big Ramsey degrees using parameter spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.00967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the universal homogeneous partial order has finite big Ramsey degrees and discuss several corollaries. Our proof relies on parameter spaces and the Carlson-Simpson theorem rather than on (a strengthening of) the Halpern-L\"auchli theorem and the Milliken tree theorem, which are typically used to bound big Ramsey degrees in the existing literature (originating from the work of Laver and Milliken).
  This new technique has many additional applications. We show that the homogeneous universal triangle-free graph has finite big Ramsey degrees, providing a short proof of a recent result by Dobrinen. Moreover, generalizing an indivisibility (vertex partition) result of Nguyen van Th\'e and Sauer, we give an upper bound on big Ramsey degrees of metric spaces with finitely many distances. This leads to a new combinatorial argument for the oscillation stability of the Urysohn Sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M\circ N$ denote the Schur product of two matrices $M$ and $N$. A graph $X$ with adjacency matrix $A$ is walk regular if $A^k\circ I$ is a constant times $I$ for each $k\ge0$, and $X$ is 1-walk-regular if it is walk regular and $A^k\circ A$ is a constant times $A$ for each $k\ge0$. Assume $X$ is 1-walk regular. Here we show that by deleting an edge in $X$, or deleting edges of a graph inside a clique of $X$, we obtain families of graphs that are not necessarily isomorphic, but are cospectral with respect to four types of matrices: the adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix, unsigned Laplacian matrix, and normalized Laplacian matrix. Furthermore, we show that removing edges of Laplacian cospectral graphs in cliques of a 1-walk regular graph results in Laplacian cospectral graphs; removing edges of unsigned Laplacian cospectral graphs whose complements are also cospectral with respect to the unsigned Laplacian in cliques of a 1-walk regular graph results in unsigned Laplacian cospectral graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10088v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a result of 33 intercontinental Zoom calls, we characterise big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order. This is an infinitary extension of the well known fact that finite partial orders endowed with linear extensions form a Ramsey class (this result was announced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\"odl in 1984 with first published proof by Paoli, Trotter and Walker in 1985). Towards this, we refine earlier upper bounds obtained by Hubi\v{c}ka based on a new connection of big Ramsey degrees to the Carlson-Simpson theorem and we also introduce a new technique of giving lower bounds using an iterated application of the upper-bound theorem.</description>

Abstract: We introduce two common divisor graphs associated with a finite skew brace, based on its $\lambda$- and $\theta$-orbits. We prove that the number of connected components is at most two and the diameter of a connected component is at most four. Furthermore, we investigate their relationship with isoclinism. Similarly to its group theoretic inspiration, the skew braces with a graph with two disconnected vertices are very restricted and are determined. Finally, we classify all finite skew braces with a graph with one vertex, where four infinite families arise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the Macdonald intersection polynomials $\operatorname{I}_{\mu^{(1)},\dots,\mu^{(k)}}[X;q,t]$, which are indexed by $k$-tuples of partitions $\mu^{(1)},\dots,\mu^{(k)}$. These polynomials are conjectured to be equal to the bigraded Frobenius characteristic of the intersection of Garsia-Haiman modules, as proposed by the science fiction conjecture of Bergeron and Garsia. In this work, we establish the vanishing identity and the shape independence of the Macdonald intersection polynomials. Additionally, we unveil a remarkable connection between $\operatorname{I}_{\mu^{(1)},\dots,\mu^{(k)}}$ and the character $\nabla e_{k-1}$ of diagonal coinvariant algebra by employing the plethystic formula for the Macdonald polynomials of Garsia--Haiman--Tesler. Furthermore, we establish a connection between $\operatorname{I}_{\mu^{(1)},\dots,\mu^{(k)}}$ and the shuffle formula $D_{k-1}[X;q,t]$, utilizing novel combinatorial tools such as the column exchange rule, a new fermionic formula for the shuffle formula, and the lightning bolt formula for Macdonald intersection polynomials. Notably, our findings provide a new proof for the shuffle theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1962 Ore initiated the study of geodetic graphs. A graph is called geodetic if the shortest path between every pair of vertices is unique. In the subsequent years a wide range of papers appeared investigating their peculiar properties. Yet, a complete classification of geodetic graphs is out of reach.
  In this work we present a program enumerating all geodetic graphs of a given size. Using our program, we succeed to find all geodetic graphs with up to 25 vertices and all regular geodetic graphs with up to 32 vertices. This leads to the discovery of two new infinite families of geodetic graphs.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions XII. Grid theorem for pinched graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an integer $c\in \mathbb{N}$, we say a graph $G$ is $c$-pinched if $G$ does not contain an induced subgraph consisting of $c$ cycles, all going through a single common vertex and otherwise pairwise disjoint and with no edges between them. What can be said about the structure of $c$-pinched graphs?
  For instance, $1$-pinched graphs are exactly graphs of treewidth $1$. However, bounded treewidth for $c&gt;1$ is immediately seen to be a false hope because complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, subdivided walls and line graphs of subdivided walls are all examples of $2$-pinched graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth. There is even a fifth obstruction for larger values of $c$, discovered by Pohoata and later independently by Davies, consisting of $3$-pinched graphs with unbounded treewidth and no large induced subgraph isomorphic to any of the first four obstructions.
  We fuse the above five examples into a grid-type theorem fully describing the unavoidable induced subgraphs of pinched graphs with large treewidth. More precisely, we prove that for every integer $c\in \mathbb{N}$, a $c$-pinched graph $G$ has large treewidth if and only if $G$ contains one of the following as an induced subgraph: a large complete graph, a large complete bipartite graph, a subdivision of a large wall, the line-graph of a subdivision of a large wall, or a large graph from the Pohoata-Davies construction. Our main result also generalizes to an extension of pinched graphs where the lengths of excluded cycles are lower-bounded.</description>

      <title>The differential properties of certain permutation polynomials over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding functions, particularly permutations, with good differential properties has received a lot of attention due to their varied applications. For instance, in combinatorial design theory, a correspondence of perfect $c$-nonlinear functions and difference sets in some quasigroups was recently shown by Anbar et al. (J. Comb. Des. 31(12):1-24, 2023). Additionally, in a recent manuscript by Pal et al. (Adv. Math. Communications, to appear), a very interesting connection between the $c$-differential uniformity and boomerang uniformity, when $c=-1$, was pointed out, showing that they are the same for an odd APN permutation, sparking yet more interest in the construction of functions with low $c$-differential uniformity. We investigate the $c$-differential uniformity of some classes of permutation polynomials. As a result, we add four more classes of permutation polynomials to the family of functions that only contains a few (non-trivial) perfect $c$-nonlinear functions over finite fields of even characteristic. Moreover, we include a class of permutation polynomials with low $c$-differential uniformity over the field of characteristic~$3$. To solve the involved equations over finite fields, we use various number theoretical techniques, in particular, we find explicitly many Walsh transform coefficients and Weil sums that may be of an independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We provide a construction for the kromatic symmetric function $\overline{X}_G$ of a graph introduced by Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl using combinatorial (linearly compact) Hopf algebras. As an application, we show that $\overline{X}_G$ has a positive expansion into multifundamental quasisymmetric functions. We also study two related quasisymmetric $q$-analogues of $\overline{X}_G$, which are $K$-theoretic generalizations of the quasisymmetric chromatic function of Shareshian and Wachs. We classify exactly when one of these analogues is symmetric. For the other, we derive a positive expansion into symmetric Grothendieck functions when $G$ is the incomparability graph of a natural unit interval order.</description>

  Confirming a conjecture of Linial and Peled, we also prove the analogous statement for the $1$-out $2$-complex.

      <title>A central limit theorem for the matching number of a sparse random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1981, Karp and Sipser proved a law of large numbers for the matching number of a sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, in an influential paper pioneering the so-called differential equation method for analysis of random graph processes. Strengthening this classical result, and answering a question of Aronson, Frieze and Pittel, we prove a central limit theorem in the same setting: the fluctuations in the matching number of a sparse random graph are asymptotically Gaussian.
  Our new contribution is to prove this central limit theorem in the subcritical and critical regimes, according to a celebrated algorithmic phase transition first observed by Karp and Sipser. Indeed, in the supercritical regime, a central limit theorem has recently been proved in the PhD thesis of Krea\v{c}i\'c, using a stochastic generalisation of the differential equation method (comparing the so-called Karp-Sipser process to a system of stochastic differential equations). Our proof builds on these methods, and introduces new techniques to handle certain degeneracies present in the subcritical and critical cases. Curiously, our new techniques lead to a non-constructive result: we are able to characterise the fluctuations of the matching number around its mean, despite these fluctuations being much smaller than the error terms in our best estimates of the mean.
  We also prove a central limit theorem for the rank of the adjacency matrix of a sparse random graph.</description>

Abstract: Positroids are matroids realizable by real matrices with all nonnegative maximal minors. They partition the ordered matroids into equivalence classes, called positroid envelope classes, by their Grassmann necklaces. We give an explicit graph construction that shows that every positroid envelope class contains a graphic matroid. We prove that a graphic positroid is the unique matroid in its positroid envelope class. Finally, we show that every graphic positroid has an oriented graph representable by a signed incidence matrix with all nonnegative minors.</description>

      <title>Sphere packing proper colorings of an expander graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce graphical error-correcting codes, a new notion of error-correcting codes on $[q]^n$, where a code is a set of proper $q$-colorings of some fixed $n$-vertex graph $G$. We then say that a set of $M$ proper $q$-colorings of $G$ form a $(G, M, d)$ code if any pair of colorings in the set have Hamming distance at least $d$. This directly generalizes typical $(n, M, d)$ codes of $q$-ary strings of length $n$ since we can take $G$ as the empty graph on $n$ vertices.
  We investigate how one-sided spectral expansion relates to the largest possible set of error-correcting colorings on a graph. For fixed $(\delta, \lambda) \in [0, 1] \times [-1, 1]$ and positive integer $d$, let $f_{\delta, \lambda, d}(n)$ denote the maximum $M$ such that there exists some $d$-regular graph $G$ on at most $n$ vertices with normalized second eigenvalue at most $\lambda$ that has a $(G, M, d)$ code. We study the growth of $f$ as $n$ goes to infinity. We partially characterize the regimes of $(\delta, \lambda)$ where $f$ grows exponentially or is bounded by a constant, respectively. We also prove several sharp phase transitions between these regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of stable edge sets (``matchings'') in a bipartite graph $G=(V,E)$ in which the preferences for vertices of one side (``firms'') are given via choice functions subject to standard axioms of consistency, substitutability and cardinal monotonicity, whereas the preferences for the vertices of the other side (``workers'') via linear orders. For such a model, we present a combinatorial description of the structure of rotations and develop an algorithm to construct the poset of rotations, in time $O(|E|^2)$ (including oracle calls). As consequences, one can obtain a ``compact'' affine representation of stable matchings and efficiently solve some related problems.

      <description>arXiv:2412.20757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lusztig $q$-weight multiplicities extend the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials to a broader range of Lie types. In this work, we investigate these multiplicities through the framework of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals. Specifically, for type $C$ with dominant weights and type $B$ with dominant spin weights, we present a combinatorial formula for Lusztig $q$-weight multiplicities in terms of energy functions of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals, generalizing the charge statistic on semistandard Young tableaux for type $A$. Additionally, we introduce level-restricted $q$-weight multiplicities for nonexceptional types, and prove positivity by providing their combinatorial formulas.</description>

Abstract: The study of spectral graph determination is a fascinating area of research in spectral graph theory and algebraic combinatorics. This field focuses on examining the spectral characterization of various classes of graphs, developing methods to construct or distinguish cospectral nonisomorphic graphs, and analyzing the conditions under which a graph's spectrum uniquely determines its structure. This paper presents an overview of both classical and recent advancements in these topics, along with newly obtained proofs of some existing results, which offer additional insights.</description>

      <title>Strong Ramsey game on two boards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong Ramsey game $R(\mathcal{B}, H)$ is a two-player game played on a graph $\mathcal{B}$, referred to as the board, with a target graph $H$. In this game, two players, $P_1$ and $P_2$, alternately claim unclaimed edges of $\mathcal{B}$, starting with $P_1$. The goal is to claim a subgraph isomorphic to $H$, with the first player achieving this declared the winner. A fundamental open question, persisting for over three decades, asks whether there exists a graph $H$ such that in the game $R(K_n, H)$, $P_1$ does not have a winning strategy in a bounded number of moves as $n \to \infty$.
  In this paper, we shift the focus to the variant $R(K_n \sqcup K_n, H)$, introduced by David, Hartarsky, and Tiba, where the board $K_n \sqcup K_n$ consists of two disjoint copies of $K_n$. We prove that there exist infinitely many graphs $H$ such that $P_1$ cannot win in $R(K_n \sqcup K_n, H)$ within a bounded number of moves through a concise proof. This perhaps provides evidence for the existence of examples to the above longstanding open problem.</description>

Abstract: Let $\iota_{k}(m,l)$ denote the total number of intervals of length $m$ across all Dyck paths of semilength $k$ such that each interval contains precisely $l$ falls. We give the formula for $\iota_{k}(m,l)$ and show that $\iota_{k}(k,l)=\binom{k}{l}^2$. Motivated by this, we propose two stronger variants of the wreath conjecture due to Baranyai for $n=2k+1$.</description>

      <title>Covering half-grids with lines and planes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study hyperplane covering problems for finite grid-like structures in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We call a set $\mathcal{C}$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ a conical grid if the line $y = a_i$ intersects $\mathcal{C}$ in exactly $i$ points, for some $a_1 &gt; \cdots &gt; a_n \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that the number of lines required to cover every point of such a grid at least $k$ times is at least $nk\left(1-\frac{1}{e}-O(\frac{1}{n}) \right)$. If the grid $\mathcal{C}$ is obtained by cutting an $m \times n$ grid of points into a half along one of the diagonals, then we prove the lower bound of $mk\left(1-e^{-\frac{n}{m}}-O(\frac{n}{m^2})\right)$.
  Motivated by the Alon-F\"uredi theorem on hyperplane coverings of grids that miss a point and its multiplicity variations, we study the problem of finding the minimum number of hyperplanes required to cover every point of an $n \times \cdots \times n$ half-grid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at least $k$ times while missing a point $P$. For almost all such half-grids, with $P$ being the corner point, we prove asymptotically sharp upper and lower bounds for the covering number in dimensions $2$ and $3$. For $k = 1$, $d = 2$, and an arbitrary $P$, we determine this number exactly by using the polynomial method bound for grids.</description>

Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be $m$-minor-universal if every graph with at most $m$ edges (and no isolated vertices) is a minor of $G$. We prove that the $d$-dimensional hypercube, $Q_d$, is $\Omega\left(\frac{2^d}{d}\right)$-minor-universal, and that there exists an absolute constant $C$ such that $Q_d$ is not $\frac{C2^d}{\sqrt{d}}$-minor-universal. Similar results are obtained in a more generalized setting, where we bound the size of minors in a product of finite connected graphs. We discuss future directions and pose open problems.</description>

      <title>On Ordinal Invariants in Well Quasi Orders and Finite Antichain Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.00428v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ordinal invariants height, length, and width of well quasi orders (WQO), with particular emphasis on width, an invariant of interest for the larger class of orders with finite antichain condition (FAC). We show that the width in the class of FAC orders is completely determined by the width in the class of WQOs, in the sense that if we know how to calculate the width of any WQO then we have a procedure to calculate the width of any given FAC order. We show how the width of WQO orders obtained via some classical constructions can sometimes be computed in a compositional way. In particular, this allows proving that every ordinal can be obtained as the width of some WQO poset. One of the difficult questions is to give a complete formula for the width of Cartesian products of WQOs. Even the width of the product of two ordinals is only known through a complex recursive formula. Although we have not given a complete answer to this question we have advanced the state of knowledge by considering some more complex special cases and in particular by calculating the width of certain products containing three factors. In the course of writing the paper we have discovered that some of the relevant literature was written on cross-purposes and some of the notions re-discovered several times. Therefore we also use the occasion to give a unified presentation of the known results.
  ERRATUM:We incorrectly claimed in Lemma 4.4(1) that the formula $o(P\cdot Q)=o(P)\cdot o(Q)$ for wpos $P$ and $Q$ was due to Abraham and Bonnet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10672v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hailperin (1965) introduced a linear programming formulation to a difficult family of problems, originally proposed by Boole (1854,1868). Hailperin's model is computationally still difficult and involves an exponential number of variables (in terms of a typical input size for Boole's problem). Numerous papers provided efficiently computable bounds for the minimum and maximum values of Hailperin's model by using aggregation that is a monotone linear mapping to a lower dimensional space. In many cases the image of the positive orthant is a subcone of the positive orthant in the lower dimensional space, and thus including some of the defining inequalities of this subcone can tighten up such an aggregation model, and lead to better bounds. Improving on some recent results, we propose a hierarchy of aggregations for Hailperin's model and a generic approach for the analysis of these aggregations. We obtain complete polyhedral descriptions of the above mentioned subcones and obtain significant improvements in the quality of the bounds.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Analytic Combinatorics for Cost Constrained Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06105v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics in several variables is a branch of mathematics that deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of combinatorial quantities by analyzing multivariate generating functions. We study information-theoretic questions about sequences in a discrete noiseless channel under cost constraints. Our main contributions involve the relationship between the graph structure of the channel and the singularities of the bivariate generating function whose coefficients are the number of sequences satisfying the constraints. We use these new results to invoke theorems from multivariate analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the number of cost-limited strings that are admissible by the channel. This builds a new bridge between analytic combinatorics in several variables and labeled weighted graphs, bringing a new perspective and a set of powerful results to the literature of cost-constrained channels. Along the way, we show that the cost-constrained channel capacity is determined by a cost-dependent singularity of the bivariate generating function, generalizing Shannon's classical result for unconstrained capacity, and provide a new proof of the equivalence of the combinatorial and probabilistic definitions of the cost-constrained capacity.</description>

      <title>Universality of global asymptotics of Jack-deformed random Young diagrams at varying temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes universal formulas describing the global asymptotics of two distinct discrete versions of $\beta$-ensembles in the high, low and fixed temperature regimes. Our results affirmatively answer a question posed by the second author and \'Sniady.
  We first introduce a special class of Jack measures on Young diagrams of arbitrary size, called the ``Jack--Thoma measures'', and prove the LLN and CLT in the three aforementioned limit regimes. In each case, we provide explicit formulas for polynomial observables of the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations around the limit shape. These formulas have surprising positivity properties and are expressed as sums of weighted lattice paths. Second, we show that the previous formulas are universal: they also describe the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations for the model of random Young diagrams of a fixed size derived from Jack characters with the approximate factorization property. Finally, in stark contrast with continuous $\beta$-ensembles, we show that the limit shapes at high and low temperatures of our random Young diagrams are one-sided infinite staircase shapes. For the Jack--Plancherel measure, we describe this shape explicitly by relating its local minima with the zeroes of Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>M\"obius Homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and develops M\"obius homology, a homology theory for representations of finite posets into abelian categories. Although the connection between poset topology and M\"obius functions is classical, we go further by establishing a direct connection between poset topology and M\"obius inversions. In particular, we show that M\"obius homology categorifies the M\"obius inversion, as its Euler characteristic coincides with the M\"obius inversion applied to the dimension function of the representation. We also present a homological version of Rota's Galois Connection Theorem, relating the M\"obius homologies of two posets connected by a Galois connection.
  Our main application concerns persistent homology over general posets. We prove that, under a suitable definition, the persistence diagram arises as an Euler characteristic over a poset of intervals, and thus M\"obius homology provides a categorification of the persistence diagram. This furnishes a new invariant for persistent homology over arbitrary finite posets. Finally, leveraging our homological variant of Rota's Galois Connection Theorem, we establish several results about the persistence diagram.</description>

Abstract: We show that the maximal non-central hyperplane sections of the regular n-simplex of side-length sqrt 2 at a fixed distance t to the centroid are those parallel to a face of the simplex, if $\sqrt{(n-2)/(3(n+1))} &lt; t &lt; \sqrt{(n-1)/(2(n+1))}$ and $n&gt;4$. For $n=4$, the same is true in a slightly smaller range for t. This adds to a previous result for $\sqrt{(n-1)/(2(n+1))} &lt; t &lt; \sqrt{n/(n+1)}$. For $n=2,3$, we determine the maximal and the minimal sections for all distances t to the centroid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary search trees (BST) are a popular type of data structure when dealing with ordered data. Indeed, they enable one to access and modify data efficiently, with their height corresponding to the worst retrieval time. From a probabilistic point of view, binary search trees associated with data arriving in a uniform random order are well understood, but less is known when the input is a non-uniform random permutation. We consider here the case where the input comes from i.i.d. random points in the plane with law $\mu$, a model which we refer to as a permuton sample. Our results show that the asymptotic proportion of nodes in each subtree depends on the behavior of the measure $\mu$ at its left boundary, while the height of the BST has a universal asymptotic behavior for a large family of measures $\mu$. Our approach involves a mix of combinatorial and probabilistic tools, namely combinatorial properties of binary search trees, coupling arguments, and deviation estimates.</description>

Abstract: We develop new and precise geometric descriptions of the conjugacy class $[x]$ and coconjugation set $\operatorname{C}(x,x') = \{ y \in \overline{W} \mid yxy^{-1} = x' \}$ for all elements $x,x'$ of any affine Coxeter group $\overline{W}$. The centralizer of $x$ in $\overline{W}$ is the special case $\operatorname{C}(x,x)$. The key structure in our description of the conjugacy class $[x]$ is the mod-set ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w) = (w-\operatorname{I})R^\vee$, where~$w$ is the finite part of $x$ and $R^\vee$ is the coroot lattice. The coconjugation set $\operatorname{C}(x,x')$ is then described by ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w')$ together with the fix-set of $w'$, where $w'$ is the finite part of $x'$. For any element $w$ of the associated finite Weyl group $W$, the mod-set of $w$ is contained in the classical move-set ${Mov}(w) = \operatorname{Im}(w - \operatorname{I})$. We prove that the rank of ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w)$ equals the dimension of ${Mov}(w)$, and then further investigate type-by-type the surprisingly subtle structure of the $\mathbb{Z}$-module ${Mod}_\overline{W}(w)$. As corollaries, we determine exactly when ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w) = {Mov}(w) \cap R^\vee$, in which case our closed-form descriptions of conjugacy classes and coconjugation sets are as simple as possible.</description>

      <title>Boundedly finite-to-one functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10183v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A function is boundedly finite-to-one if there is a natural number $k$ such that each point has at most $k$ inverse images. In this paper, we prove in $\mathsf{ZF}$ (i.e., the Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice) several results concerning this notion, among which are the following:
  (1) For each infinite set $A$ and natural number $n$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{S}(A)$ to $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$, where $\mathcal{S}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ and $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ moving at most $n$ points.
  (2) For each infinite set $A$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{B}(A)$ to $\mathrm{fin}(A)$, where $\mathcal{B}(A)$ is the set of all partitions of $A$ such that every block is finite and $\mathrm{fin}(A)$ is the set of all finite subsets of $A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Col is PSPACE-complete on triangular grid graphs via a reduction from Bounded Two-Player Constraint Logic. This is the most structured graph family that Col is known to be computationally hard for.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Permutation Iteration Using a Singly Linked List</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10102v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for iterating over all permutations of a sequence. The algorithm leverages elementary $O(1)$ operations on recursive lists. As a result, no new nodes are allocated during the computation. Instead, all elements are rearranged within the original nodes of the singly linked list throughout the process. While permutations are generated in an unusual order, the transitions between consecutive permutations remain smooth. A proof of concept written in the Lisp programming language is proposed and discussed.</description>
