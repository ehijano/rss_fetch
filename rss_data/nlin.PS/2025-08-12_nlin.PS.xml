      <title>Anti-localization of non-stationary quasi-waves in a strongly nonlinear $\beta$-FPUT chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a new general wave phenomenon, namely "the anti-localization of non-stationary linear waves", has been introduced and discussed (Shishkina et al., J. Sound. Vib. 553, 2023, 117673). This is zeroing of the propagating component for a non-stationary wave-field near a defect in infinitely long wave-guides. The phenomenon is known to be observed in both continuum and discrete mechanical systems with a defect, provided that the frequency spectrum for the corresponding homogeneous system possesses a stop-band. In this paper, we show that the anti-localization is also quite common for nonlinear systems. To demonstrate this, we numerically solve several non-stationary problems for an infinite strongly nonlinear $\beta$-FPUT chain with a defect. In our opinion, the anti-localization essentially influences the processes of heat transfer in linear and nonlinear lattices.</description>

      <title>Breather-to-soliton transitions and nonlinear wave interactions for the higher-order generalized Gerdjikov-Ivanov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the intricate dynamics of the breather-to-soliton transitions and nonlinear wave interactions for the higher-order generalized Gerdjikov-Ivanov equation. The transition conditions of the breather-to-soliton are established and the novel nonlinear converted waves, including the W-shaped soliton, M-shaped soliton, multi-peak soliton, anti-dark soliton and periodic wave solution are discussed. Meanwhile, the interactions among the above nonlinear converted waves are explored by choosing appropriate parameters. Furthermore, we derive the double-pole solutions exhibiting breather-to-soliton transitions and employ the asymptotic analysis method to analyze the dynamics of the asymptotic solitons for the double-pole anti-dark soliton. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of nonlinear wave metamorphosis induced by higher-order terms in integrable systems.</description>

      <title>External charged debris in a flowing plasma : charge fluctuation induced complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the response of a flowing e-i plasma to embedded external charged debris, focusing on the periodic debris charge fluctuations that can trigger complex phenomena such as chaos and nonlinear Landau damping. We employ both kinetic and fluid simulations to analyse the plasma response to the time-dependent debris charge. Our findings indicate that the nature of the nonlinear response can be considerably different for fluctuating positively charged external debris from negatively charged debris. The simulations show that the debris charge fluctuation causes damping of the ion-acoustic wave as the debris velocity nears the ion-acoustic speed through nonlinear Landau damping and wave-wave interactions. We also present a theoretical framework to support the simulation findings. Our findings provide critical insights into debris-plasma interactions, which may be useful in applications involving space debris management.</description>
