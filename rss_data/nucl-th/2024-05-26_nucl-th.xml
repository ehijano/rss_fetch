      <title>Static and dynamic properties of atomic nuclei with high-resolution potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute ground-state and dynamical properties of $^4$He and $^{16}$O nuclei using as input high-resolution, phenomenological nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces that are local in coordinate space. The nuclear Schr\"odinger equation for both nuclei is accurately solved employing the auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo approach. For the $^4$He nucleus, detailed benchmarks are carried out with the hyperspherical harmonics method. In addition to presenting results for the binding energies and radii, we also analyze the momentum distributions of these nuclei and their Euclidean response function corresponding to the isoscalar density transition. The latter quantity is particularly relevant for lepton-nucleus scattering experiments, as it paves the way to quantum Monte Carlo calculations of electroweak response functions of $^{16}$O.</description>

      <title>Investigation of spectral properties of ^{11}Be in breakup reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the breakup of the ^{11}Be halo nuclei on a light target ^{12}C within quantum-quasiclassical approach in a wide range of the beam energy (5-67 MeV/nucleon) including bound states and low-lying resonances in different partial and spin states of ^{11}Be. The obtained results are in good agreement with existing experimental data at 67 MeV/nucleon. We also demonstrate that the developed computational scheme can be used for investigation of nuclei spectral properties in low-energy breakup experiments on different targets.</description>

      <title>Principal components of nuclear mass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principal component analysis approach is employed to extract the principal components contained in nuclear mass models for the first time. The effects coming from different nuclear mass models are reintegrated and reorganized in the extracted principal components. These extracted principal components are recombined to build new mass models, which achieve better accuracy than the original theoretical mass models. This indicates that the effects contained in different mass models can work together to improve the nuclear mass predictions with the help of the principal component analysis approach.</description>

      <title>$K^-d\rightarrow\pi\Lambda N$ reaction with in-flight kaons for studying the $\Lambda N$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Lambda N$ invariant mass spectra for the reactions $K^-d\rightarrow\pi^-\Lambda p$ and $K^-d\rightarrow\pi^0\Lambda n$ are calculated for experimental study of isospin symmetry breaking in the $\Lambda N$ scattering at low energies, the difference in the scattering lengths and effective ranges of $\Lambda p$ and $\Lambda n$ systems. The calculations are performed for in-flight kaons with a momentum of 1000 MeV/c, employing partial wave analysis up to the p-wave for meson-baryon amplitudes and the spin-flip term for baryon-baryon amplitudes. Kinematic selection is utilized to suppress the background processes, involving the angular selection of pions to the forward direction and selecting nucleons with higher momentum. It is worth noting that isospin symmetry breaking in the $\Lambda N$ system can be extracted from the observed deviations in that breaking in the $\Lambda N$ invariant mass spectra for the $K^-d\rightarrow\pi\Lambda N$ reaction.</description>

      <title>Constraints for electron-capture decays mimicking production of axion-like particles in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give for the first time, theoretical estimates of ground-state-to-ground-state (GS-to-GS) electron-capture (EC) branch decay rates of $^{44}$Ti, $^{57}$Co, and $^{139}$Ce. The nuclear-structure calculations have been done exploiting the nuclear shell model (NSM) with well-established Hamiltonians and an advanced theory of $\beta$ decay. In the absence of experimental measurements of these GS-to-GS branches, these estimates are of utmost importance for terrestrial searches of axion-like particles (ALPs). Predictions are made for EC-decay rates of 2$^{nd}$-forbidden unique (FU) and 2$^{nd}$-forbidden non-unique (FNU) EC transitions that can potentially mimic nuclear axion production in experiments designed to detect ALPs in nuclear environments.</description>

      <title>The story around the first 4n signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GANIL campaign around the first 4n signal was very peculiar. The beginning and end were both dictated by unexpected events that, unfortunately, do not fit within the streamlined format of standard scientific publications. However, they illustrate many aspects of how basic research should work, or at least does work. Therefore, I take this opportunity to share them with those not involved in the campaign, hoping that they will offer a better perspective of that research in particular and of basic research in general. As a disclaimer, this is only a personal recollection of those events.</description>

      <title>First detection of X-ray pulsations and spectrum of the high Galactic latitude pulsar PSR J0837-2454 and direct Urca cooling implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PSR J0837-2454 is a young 629 ms radio pulsar whose uncertain distance has important implications. A large distance would place the pulsar far out of the Galactic plane and suggest it is the result of a runaway star, while a short distance would mean the pulsar is extraordinarily cold. Here we present further radio observations and the first deep X-ray observation of PSR J0837-2454. Data from the Parkes Murriyang telescope show flux variations over short and long timescales and also yield an updated timing model, while the position and proper motion (and, less strongly, parallax) of the pulsar are constrained by a number of low-significance detections with the Very Long Baseline Array. XMM-Newton data enable detection of X-ray pulsations for the first time from this pulsar and yield a spectrum that is thermal and blackbody-like, with a cool blackbody temperature ~70 eV or atmosphere temperature ~50 eV, as well as a small hotspot. The spectrum also indicates the pulsar is at a small distance of &lt;~1 kpc, which is compatible with the marginal VLBA parallax constraint that favours a distance of &gt;~330 pc. The low implied X-ray luminosity (~3x10^31 erg s^-1 at 0.9 kpc) suggests PSR J0837-2454 has a mass high enough that fast neutrino emission from direct Urca reactions operates in this young star and points to a nuclear equation of state that allows for direct Urca reactions at the highest densities present in neutron star cores.</description>

      <title>Transverse Momentum Dependent PDFs in Chiral Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to match transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMD PDFs) onto chiral effective theory operators. In this framework the TMD PDF is expressed as a convolution of TMD hadronic distribution functions, which describe fluctuations of initial states into intermediate hadrons in chiral perturbation theory, and short distance matching coefficients, which are the TMD PDFs of intermediate hadrons in the chiral limit. The various limits of the matching condition are explored and an operator product expansion is applied to the high energy TMD matching coefficients, allowing them to be written in terms of the collinear valence PDFs of intermediate hadrons. As an example, we calculate the isovector TMD hadronic distribution functions for the proton at leading order in the chiral expansion.</description>

      <title>Beta decay and related processes from an angular momentum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We ask the question of how angular momentum is conserved in weak interaction processes, beginning with inverse beta decay for massless neutrinos and electrons, in which both the incident neutrino and final electron are in helicity eigenstates with respect, however, to {\em different} directions. To elucidate the problem we recast the final electron state in terms of a spherical Dirac wave. We then generalize these results to massive neutrinos and electrons, and finally examine electron-positron annihilation processes through the same lens. In all these processes, the apparent non-conservation of angular momentum is a result of the quantum measurement process in which the measuring apparatus is not in an initially well-defined quantum state, but is coupled to the outside world; the measuring process, being outside the rules of elementary quantum mechanics, does not allow a satisfactory accounting of the angular momentum transfer.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Deuteron Induced Reactions on Molybdenum at Low Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The activities of the EUROfusion consortium on the development of high quality nuclear data for fusion applications include evaluations of deuteron induced reactions and related data libraries for needs of the DEMO fusion power plant and IFMIF-DONES neutron--source nuclear analyses. Molybdenum is one of the major constituents of the reference stainless steels used in critical components of these projects. While the TENDL deuteron data library was the current reference used by EUROfusion, need of its further improvement has already been pointed out. The weak binding energy of the deuteron is responsible for the high complexity of its interaction with nuclei, involving also a variety of reactions initiated by the nucleons following the deuteron breakup. Their analysis completed that of the deuteron interactions with Mo and its stable isotopes, from elastic scattering to pre-equilibrium and compound--nucleus reactions, up to 50 MeV. A particular attention has been paid to the breakup, stripping, and pick-up direct interactions which amount to around half of the deuteron total--reaction cross section. The due account of most experimental data has validated the present approach, highlighted some prevalent features, and emphasized weak points and consequently the need for modeling/evaluation upgrade.</description>

      <title>Exploring Baryon Resonances with Transition Generalized Parton Distributions: Status and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCD gives rise to a rich spectrum of excited baryon states. Understanding their internal structure is important for many areas of nuclear physics, such as nuclear forces, dense matter, and neutrino-nucleus interactions. Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) are an established tool for characterizing the QCD structure of the ground-state nucleon. They are used to create 3D tomographic images of the quark/gluon structure and quantify the mechanical properties such as the distribution of mass, angular momentum and forces in the system. Transition GPDs extend these concepts to $N \rightarrow N^\ast$ transitions and can be used to characterize the 3D structure and mechanical properties of baryon resonances. They can be probed in high-momentum-transfer exclusive electroproduction processes with resonance transitions $e + N \rightarrow e' + M + N^\ast$, such as deeply-virtual Compton scattering ($M = \gamma$) or meson production ($M = \pi, K$, $etc.$), and in related photon/hadron-induced processes. This White Paper describes a research program aiming to explore baryon resonance structure with transition GPDs. This includes the properties and interpretation of the transition GPDs, theoretical methods for structures and processes, first experimental results from JLab 12 GeV, future measurements with existing and planned facilities (JLab detector and energy upgrades, COMPASS/AMBER, EIC, EicC, J-PARC, LHC ultraperihperal collisions), and the theoretical and experimental developments needed to realize this program.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spectroscopy of neutron-rich Br isotopes and signatures for a prolate-to-oblate shape transition at N=56</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first systematic experimental study of the neutron-rich Br isotopes with two complementary state-of-the-art techniques is presented. These isotopes have been populated in the fission process at two different facilities, GANIL and ILL. New spectroscopic information has been obtained for odd-even $^{87-93}$Br isotopes and the experimental results have been compared with state-of-the-art Large-Scale Shell-Model and DNO Shell-Model calculations. As a result of such theoretical approaches, a transition from prolate ($^{87,89}$Br) to oblate ($^{91,93}$Br) shapes is obtained from the subtle balance between proton and neutron quadrupole deformations, as a clear signature of pseudo-SU3 quadrupole regime.</description>

      <title>Spin-down of a pulsar with a yielding crust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of the discovery of the long-period radio pulsar PSR J0901-4046, it is interesting to revisit a question about how the magnetized neutron star slows down its rotation. In the case of a weak or liquid outer crust, the mechanism of spin-down becomes unclear because the braking stress cannot then be transmitted from the surface to the main bulk of the star. We show that even if the outer crust does not withstand the surface electromagnetic forces creating the braking torque, the stellar spin-down does not stop, and the matter rearranges so that the necessary electromagnetic forces form in more deep and rigid layers capable of withstanding these forces. The spin-down rate remains the same and corresponds to the transformation of the rotational energy of the neutron star into the energy of the generated relativistic electron-positron plasma. The solid iron surface of ultrastrongly magnetized PSR J0901-4046 appears not to be yielding and withstands the braking stress without breaking.</description>

      <title>Jet Quenching of the Heavy Quarks in the Quark-Gluon Plasma and the Nonadditive Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Plastino-Plastino (PP) equation, we calculate transport coefficients of the heavy-quarks traversing inside the quark-gluon plasma, and generalize their relationship with differential energy loss. The PP equation indicates anomalous diffusion of the probe particles and yields a quasi-exponential stationary distribution obtained also from the nonadditive statistics proposed by C. Tsallis. We estimate energy loss in a nonadditive quark-gluon medium, and calculate the jet-quenching parameter ($\hat{q}$) for the PP dynamics. With the help of the estimate of $\hat{q}$, we calculate the nuclear suppression factor ($R_{\text{AA}}$) of the heavy-quarks passing through a nonadditive quark-gluon plasma using the model proposed by Dokshitzer and Kharzeev. In many a case, the parameters in the analysis are fixed from the experimental results to minimize arbitrariness. There is a good agreement between the theoretical calculation and experimental $R_{\text{AA}}$ data, indicating that fast heavy-quarks may be subjected to anomalous diffusion inside the QGP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the modeling of the hadronic phase of QCD at finite magnetic field in the framework of hadron resonance gas (HRG). We focus on the statistical description of particle yields that include contribution from resonance decays. We demonstrate that the swift increase in the number of protons with magnetic field predicted in the HRG is due to the ill-defined description of higher-spin states. We discuss fluctuations of conserved charges and show that at present the qualitative comparison of the model predictions with the Lattice QCD data should be treated with care. We also discuss the principle of detailed balance which allows to study the magnetic field dependence of neutral resonances.</description>

Abstract: I investigate whether it is possible to generate bound-states from resonances or virtual states through first-order perturbation theory. Using contact-type potentials as those appeared in pionless effective field theory, I show that it is possible to obtain negative-energy states by sandwiching a next-to-leading order (NLO) interaction with the leading-order (LO) wavefunctions, under the presence of LO resonances or virtual states. However, at least under the framework of time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and Hermitian Hamiltonian, there is an inability to create bound-states with structure similar to those formed by the non-perturbative treatments.</description>

      <title>Production of light nuclei in isobaric Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ =7.7-200 GeV from a multiphase transport model</title>

Abstract: The production of light nuclei in isobaric $^{96}_{44}$Ru + $^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr + $^{96}_{40}$Zr collisions, ranging from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV, are studied using the string melting version of A Multi Phase Transport (AMPT) model in combination with a coalescence approach to light nuclei production. From the calculated yields, transverse momentum $p_{T}$ spectra, and rapidity dependences of light nuclei $p$, $n$, $d$, $t$, ${}^{3}$He, we find that the Ru+Ru/Zr+Zr ratios for the yields of these particles exceed unity with the inclusion of a quadrupole deformation $\beta_{ 2 }$ and octupole deformation $\beta_{ 3 }$ as well as the neutron skins. We also find that heavier particles have a larger deviation from unity. Furthermore, we find that as the collision energy increases, the influence of isospin effects on the production of light nuclei in isobar collisions gradually decreases, while the influence of nuclear structure becomes more significant, particularly evident from the energy dependence of the deuteron ratio, which is unaffected by isospin effects.</description>

      <title>An alternative to perturbative renormalization in 3+1 dimensional field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06847v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbative renormalization provides the bedrock of understanding quantum field theories. In this work, I point out an alternative way of renormalizing quantum field theories, which is naturally encountered and well known for the case of large N scalar field theories. In terms of bare parameters, this non-perturbative alternative renormalization differs qualitatively from its perturbative cousin: in the continuum limit, the bare coupling constant goes to zero instead of infinity, and there is no wave-function counterterm. Despite these differences, the resulting n-point functions of the theory are finite. I provide explicit results for alternative renormalization for the O(N) model and QCD with $N_f=12$ flavors in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Equation-of-State Constraints on the Color-Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that astrophysical constraints on the dense-matter equation of state place an upper bound on the color-superconducting gap in dense matter above the transition from nuclear matter to quark matter. Pairing effects in the color-flavor locked (CFL) quark matter phase increase the pressure at high density, and if this effect is sufficiently large then the requirements of causality and mechanical stability make it impossible to reach such a pressure in a way that is consistent with what is known at lower densities. The intermediate-density equation of state is inferred by considering extensions of chiral effective field theory (CEFT) to neutron star densities, and conditioning these using current astrophysical observations of neutron star radius, maximum mass, and tidal deformability (PSR J0348+0432, PSR J1624-2230, PSR J0740+6620, GW170817). At baryon number chemical potential $\mu = 2.6~\text{GeV}$ we find a 95% upper limit on the CFL pairing gap $\Delta$ of $457~\text{MeV}$ using overly conservative assumptions and $216~\text{MeV}$ with more reasonable assumptions. This constraint may be strengthened by future astrophysical measurements as well as by future advances in high density QCD calculations.</description>
