      <title>On a distinctive property of Fourier bases associated with $N$- Bernoulli Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distinctive problem of harmonic analysis on $\R$ with respect to a Borel probability measure $\mu$ is identifying all $t\in\R$ such that both \[\left\{e^{-2\pi i\lambda x}: \lambda\in\Lambda\right\}\quad\text{and}\quad \left\{e^{-2\pi i\lambda x}: \lambda\in t\Lambda\right\}\] form orthonormal bases of the space $L^2(\mu)$. Currently, this phenomenon has been observed only in certain singular measures. It is deeply connected to the convergence of Mock Fourier series with respect to the aforementioned bases. In this paper, we apply classical number theory to solve the general conjecture and basic problems in this field within the setting of $N$-Bernoulli convolutions, which extend almost all known results and give some new ones.</description>

      <title>Triangles in the Plane and arithmetic progressions in thick compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on the occurrence of three-point configurations in subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d\geq 1$ of sufficient thickness. We prove that compact sets $A\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ contain a similar copy of any linear $3$ point configuration provided $A$ satisfies a mild Yavicoli-thickness condition and an $r$-uniformity condition for $d\geq 2$; or, when $d=1$, the result holds provided the Newhouse thickness of $A$ is at least $1$.
  Moreover, we prove that compact sets $A\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ contain the vertices of an equilateral triangle (and more generally, the vertices of a similar copy of any given triangle) provided $A$ satisfies a mild Yavicoli-thickness condition and an $r$-uniformity condition. Further, $C\times C$ contains the vertices of an equilateral triangle (and more generally the vertices of a similar copy of any given three-point configuration) provided the Newhouse thickness of $C$ is at least $1$. These are among the first results in the literature to give explicit criteria for the occurrence of three-point configurations in the plane.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction techniques for inverse Sturm-Liouville problems with complex coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of inverse Sturm-Liouville problems is considered, including the two-spectrum inverse problem, the problem of recovering the potential from the Weyl function, as well as the recovery from the spectral function. In all cases the potential in the Sturm-Liouville equation is assumed to be complex valued. A unified approach for the approximate solution of the inverse Sturm-Liouville problems is developed, based on Neumann series of Bessel functions (NSBF) representations for solutions and their derivatives. Unlike most existing approaches, it allows one to recover not only the complex-valued potential but also the boundary conditions of the Sturm-Liouville problem. Efficient accuracy control is implemented. The numerical method is direct. It involves only solving linear systems of algebraic equations for the coefficients of the NSBF representations, while eventually the knowledge only of the first NSBF coefficients leads to the recovery of the Sturm-Liouville problem. Numerical efficiency is illustrated by several test examples.</description>

      <title>Fourier Frames on Salem Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every $0&lt;s\leq 1$ we construct $s$-dimensional Salem measures in the unit interval that do not admit any Fourier frame. Our examples are generic for each $s$, including all existing types of Salem measures in the literature: random Cantor sets (convolutions, non-convolutions), random images, and deterministic constructions on Diophantine approximations. They even appear almost surely as Brownian images. We also develop different approaches to prove the nonexistence of Fourier frames on different constructions. Both the criteria and ideas behind the constructions are expected to work in higher dimensions.
  On the other hand, we observe that a weighted arc in the plane can be a $1$-dimensional Salem measure with orthonormal basis of exponentials. This leaves whether there exist Salem measures in the real line with Fourier frames or even orthonormal basis of exponentials a subtle problem.</description>

      <title>Critical scattering for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on waveguide manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the small data scattering problem in critical spaces for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on waveguide manifolds. Our work is primarily inspired by the recent paper of Kwak and Kwon \cite{KwakKwon} that established the local well-posedness of the periodic NLS with possibly non-algebraic nonlinearity. While we adopt a framework similar to \cite{KwakKwon} for our problem, two main obstacles prevent its direct adaptation to the waveguide setting. First, the classical Strichartz estimates for NLS in critical product spaces, introduced by Hani and Pausader, possess limited endpoints and are thus inapplicable to high-dimensional waveguides. Second, the crucial fractional arguments used in \cite{KwakKwon} rely on a well-known fractional derivative formula due to Strichartz, which admits only a Hilbert space-valued extension and is therefore incompatible with our model setting.
  To overcome these difficulties, we develop an anisotropic generalization of the framework in \cite{KwakKwon} using the anisotropic Strichartz estimates established by Tzvetkov and Visciglia, which allow for nearly unlimited endpoints. We also resolve several new challenges arising from the vector-valued and anisotropic nature of the model by employing novel interpolation techniques within Besov spaces. As a further novelty, we provide a new proof of the main result based on classical fixed point arguments, differing from the approximation methods used in \cite{KwakKwon}. Consequently, we settle the small data scattering problem in critical spaces for the NLS with arbitrary mass-supercritical nonlinearity on waveguide manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On page 206 in his lost notebook, Ramanujan recorded a seventh degree identity for his theta function $\varphi(q)$. We give an analogous ninth degree identity. We also provide an application of an entry from his second notebook on a cubic equation and an interpretation with theta functions for some of his trigonometric identities. Lastly, we calculate five examples for $\varphi(e^{-\pi\sqrt{n}})$.</description>

      <title>Invariant Probability Measures under $p$-adic Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the Lebesgue measure is the unique absolutely continuous invariant probability measure under the $p$-adic transformation. The purpose of this paper is to characterize the family of all invariant probability measures under the $p$-adic transformation and to provide some description of them. In particular, we describe the subfamily of all atomic invariant measures under the $p$-adic transformation as well as the subfamily of all continuous and singular invariant probability measures under the $p$-adic transformation. Iterative functional equations play the base role in our considerations.</description>

      <title>Sophomore's dream function: asymptotics, complex plane behavior and relation to the error function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10936v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sophomore's dream sum $S=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-n}$ is extended to the function $f(t,a)=t\int_{0}^{1}(ax)^{-tx}dx$ with $f(1,1)=S$. Asymptotic behavior for a large $|t|$ is obtained, which is exponential for $t&gt;0$ and $t&lt;0,a&gt;1$, and inverse-logarithmic for $t&lt;0,a&lt;1$. An advanced approximation includes a half-derivative of the exponent and is expressed in terms of the error function. This approach provides excellent interpolation description in the complex plane. The function $f(t,a)$ demonstrates for $a&gt;1$ oscillating behavior along the imaginary axis with slowly increasing amplitude and the period of $2\pi iea$, modulation by high-frequency oscillations being present. Also, $f(t,a)$ has non-trivial zeros in the left complex half-plane with Im$t_n \simeq 2(n-1/8)\pi e/a$ for $a&gt;1$. The results obtained describe analytical integration of the function $x^{tx}$.</description>

      <title>On a specific family of orthogonal polynomials of Bernstein-Szeg\"o type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of weight functions on $[-1,1]$ which are special cases of the broader family studied by Bernstein and Szeg{\"o}. These weights are parametrized by two positive integers. As these integers tend to infinity, these weights approximate certain weight functions on $\mathbb{R}$ considered by Ismail and Valent. We also study modifications of these weight functions by a continuous parameter $a&gt;0$. These ideas are then used to find finite analogs of some improper integrals first studied by Glaisher and Ramanujan. We also show that some of the functions used in this work are in fact generating functions of certain finite trigonometric sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate summable analogues of the classical Ivashev-Musatov Theorem and threshold phenomenons alike. In the setting of weighted $\ell^1$ and Orlicz sequence spaces, we exhibit elements with critically pathological support and range, both topologically and in the sense of measure theory. Our results complement earlier works of J. P. Kahane, Y. Katznelson and T. W. K\"orner.</description>

      <title>On the properties of alternating invariant functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functions satisfying the functional equation
  \begin{align*}
  \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} (-1)^r f(x+ry, ny) = f(x,y), \quad \text{for any positive odd integer $n$},
  \end{align*} are named the alternating invariant functions. Examples of such functions include Euler polynomials, alternating Hurwitz zeta functions and their associated Gamma functions. In this paper, we systematically investigate the fundamental properties of alternating invariant functions. We prove that the set of such functions is closed under translation, reflection, and differentiation. In addition, we define a convolution operation on alternating invariant functions and derive explicit convolution formulas for Euler polynomials and alternating Hurwitz zeta functions, respectively. Furthermore, using distributional relations, we construct new examples of alternating invariant functions, including suitable combinations of trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, among others.</description>
