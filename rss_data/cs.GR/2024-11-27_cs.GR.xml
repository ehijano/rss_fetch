      <title>Single Edge Collapse Quad-Dominant Mesh Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesh reduction using quadric error metrics is the industry standard for producing level-of-detail (LOD) geometry for meshes. Although industry tools produce visually excellent LODs, mesh topology is often ruined during decimation. This is because tools focus on triangle simplification and preserving rendered appearance, whereas artists often produce quad dominant meshes with clean edge topology. Artist created manual LODs preserve both appearance and quad topology. Furthermore, most existing tools for quad decimation only accept pure quad meshes and cannot handle any triangles. The gap between quad and triangular mesh decimation is because they are built on fundamentally different operations, triangle simplification uses single edge collapses, whereas quad decimation requires that entire sets of edges be collapsed atomically. In this work, we demonstrate that single edge collapse can be used to preserve most input quads without degrading geometric quality. Single edge collapse quad preservation is made possible by introducing dihedral-angle weighted quadrics for every edges, allowing optimization to evenly space edges while preserving features. It is further enabled by explicitly ordering edge collapses with nearly equivalent quadric error that preserves quad topology. In addition to quad preservation, we demonstrate that by introducing weights for quadrics on certain edges, our framework can be used to preserve symmetry and joint influences. To demonstrate our approach is suitable for skinned mesh decimation (a key use case of quad meshes), we show that QEM with attributes can preserve joint influences better than prior work. On both static and animated meshes, our approach consistently outperforms prior work with lower Chamfer and Hausdorff distance, while preserving more quad topology.</description>

      <title>DiM-Gestor: Co-Speech Gesture Generation with Adaptive Layer Normalization Mamba-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-driven gesture generation using transformer-based generative models represents a rapidly advancing area within virtual human creation. However, existing models face significant challenges due to their quadratic time and space complexities, limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce DiM-Gestor, an innovative end-to-end generative model leveraging the Mamba-2 architecture. DiM-Gestor features a dual-component framework: (1) a fuzzy feature extractor and (2) a speech-to-gesture mapping module, both built on the Mamba-2. The fuzzy feature extractor, integrated with a Chinese Pre-trained Model and Mamba-2, autonomously extracts implicit, continuous speech features. These features are synthesized into a unified latent representation and then processed by the speech-to-gesture mapping module. This module employs an Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN)-enhanced Mamba-2 mechanism to uniformly apply transformations across all sequence tokens. This enables precise modeling of the nuanced interplay between speech features and gesture dynamics. We utilize a diffusion model to train and infer diverse gesture outputs. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations conducted on the newly released Chinese Co-Speech Gestures dataset corroborate the efficacy of our proposed model. Compared with Transformer-based architecture, the assessments reveal that our approach delivers competitive results and significantly reduces memory usage, approximately 2.4 times, and enhances inference speeds by 2 to 4 times. Additionally, we released the CCG dataset, a Chinese Co-Speech Gestures dataset, comprising 15.97 hours (six styles across five scenarios) of 3D full-body skeleton gesture motion performed by professional Chinese TV broadcasters.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Foundation Models To learn the shape of semi-fluid deformable objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the difficulties imposed on the manipulation of deformable objects is their characterization and the detection of representative keypoints for the purpose of manipulation. A keen interest was manifested by researchers in the last decade to characterize and manipulate deformable objects of non-fluid nature, such as clothes and ropes. Even though several propositions were made in the regard of object characterization, however researchers were always confronted with the need of pixel-level information of the object through images to extract relevant information. This usually is accomplished by means of segmentation networks trained on manually labeled data for this purpose. In this paper, we address the subject of characterizing weld pool to define stable features that serve as information for further motion control objectives. We achieve this by employing different pipelines. The first one consists of characterizing fluid deformable objects through the use of a generative model that is trained using a teacher-student framework. And in the second one we leverage foundation models by using them as teachers to characterize the object in the image, without the need of any pre-training and any dataset. The performance of knowledge distillation from foundation models into a smaller generative model shows prominent results in the characterization of deformable objects. The student network was capable of learning to retrieve the keypoitns of the object with an error of 13.4 pixels. And the teacher was evaluated based on its capacities to retrieve pixel level information represented by the object mask, with a mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of 75.26%.</description>

      <title>SplatAD: Real-Time Lidar and Camera Rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, requires extensive testing across diverse driving scenarios. Simulation is a key ingredient for conducting such testing in a cost-effective and scalable way. Neural rendering methods have gained popularity, as they can build simulation environments from collected logs in a data-driven manner. However, existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for sensor-realistic rendering of camera and lidar data suffer from low rendering speeds, limiting their applicability for large-scale testing. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering, current methods are limited to camera data and are unable to render lidar data essential for autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose SplatAD, the first 3DGS-based method for realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic scenes for both camera and lidar data. SplatAD accurately models key sensor-specific phenomena such as rolling shutter effects, lidar intensity, and lidar ray dropouts, using purpose-built algorithms to optimize rendering efficiency. Evaluation across three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that SplatAD achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with up to +2 PSNR for NVS and +3 PSNR for reconstruction while increasing rendering speed over NeRF-based methods by an order of magnitude.

      <title>DetailGen3D: Generative 3D Geometry Enhancement via Data-Dependent Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models. We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches, from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while maintaining efficiency in training.</description>

      <title>Lens Distortion Encoding System Version 1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lens Distortion Encoding System (LDES) allows for a distortion-accurate workflow, with a seamless interchange of high quality motion picture images regardless of the lens source. This system is similar in a concept to the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES), but for distortion. Presented solution is fully compatible with existing software/plug-in tools for STMapping found in popular production software like Adobe After Effects or DaVinci Resolve. LDES utilizes common distortion space and produces single high-quality, animatable STMap used for direct transformation of one view to another, neglecting the need of lens-swapping for each shoot. The LDES profile of a lens consist of two elements; View Map texture, and Footage Map texture, each labeled with the FOV value. Direct distortion mapping is produced by sampling of the Footage Map through the View Map. The result; animatable mapping texture, is then used to sample the footage to a desired distortion. While the Footage Map is specific to a footage, View Maps can be freely combined/transitioned and animated, allowing for effects like smooth shift from anamorphic to spherical distortion, previously impossible to achieve in practice. Presented LDES Version 1.0 uses common 32-bit STMap format for encoding, supported by most compositing software, directly or via plug-ins. The difference between standard STMap workflow and LDES is that it encodes absolute pixel position in the spherical image model. The main benefit of this approach is the ability to achieve a similar look of a highly expensive lens using some less expensive equipment in terms of distortion. It also provides greater artistic control and never seen before manipulation of footage.</description>

      <title>MotionWavelet: Human Motion Prediction via Wavelet Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling temporal characteristics and the non-stationary dynamics of body movement plays a significant role in predicting human future motions. However, it is challenging to capture these features due to the subtle transitions involved in the complex human motions. This paper introduces MotionWavelet, a human motion prediction framework that utilizes Wavelet Transformation and studies human motion patterns in the spatial-frequency domain. In MotionWavelet, a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) learns a Wavelet Manifold by applying Wavelet Transformation on the motion data therefore encoding the intricate spatial and temporal motion patterns. Once the Wavelet Manifold is built, WDM trains a diffusion model to generate human motions from Wavelet latent vectors. In addition to the WDM, MotionWavelet also presents a Wavelet Space Shaping Guidance mechanism to refine the denoising process to improve conformity with the manifold structure. WDM also develops Temporal Attention-Based Guidance to enhance prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MotionWavelet, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy and enhanced generalization across various benchmarks. Our code and models will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>4D Scaffold Gaussian Splatting for Memory Efficient Dynamic Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian methods for dynamic scene reconstruction offer high visual fidelity and fast rendering. However, these methods suffer from excessive memory and storage demands, which limits their practical deployment. This paper proposes a 4D anchor-based framework that retains visual quality and rendering speed of 4D Gaussians while significantly reducing storage costs. Our method extends 3D scaffolding to 4D space, and leverages sparse 4D grid-aligned anchors with compressed feature vectors. Each anchor models a set of neural 4D Gaussians, each of which represent a local spatiotemporal region. In addition, we introduce a temporal coverage-aware anchor growing strategy to effectively assign additional anchors to under-reconstructed dynamic regions. Our method adjusts the accumulated gradients based on Gaussians' temporal coverage, improving reconstruction quality in dynamic regions. To reduce the number of anchors, we further present enhanced formulations of neural 4D Gaussians. These include the neural velocity, and the temporal opacity derived from a generalized Gaussian distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and 97.8% storage reduction over 4DGS.</description>

      <title>Geometry Field Splatting with Gaussian Surfels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric reconstruction of opaque surfaces from images is a longstanding challenge in computer vision, with renewed interest from volumetric view synthesis algorithms using radiance fields. We leverage the geometry field proposed in recent work for stochastic opaque surfaces, which can then be converted to volume densities. We adapt Gaussian kernels or surfels to splat the geometry field rather than the volume, enabling precise reconstruction of opaque solids. Our first contribution is to derive an efficient and almost exact differentiable rendering algorithm for geometry fields parameterized by Gaussian surfels, while removing current approximations involving Taylor series and no self-attenuation. Next, we address the discontinuous loss landscape when surfels cluster near geometry, showing how to guarantee that the rendered color is a continuous function of the colors of the kernels, irrespective of ordering. Finally, we use latent representations with spherical harmonics encoded reflection vectors rather than spherical harmonics encoded colors to better address specular surfaces. We demonstrate significant improvement in the quality of reconstructed 3D surfaces on widely-used datasets.</description>

      <title>Puzzle Similarity: A Perceptually-guided No-Reference Metric for Artifact Detection in 3D Scene Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern reconstruction techniques can effectively model complex 3D scenes from sparse 2D views. However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting detailed artifact maps. The absence of such quality metrics hinders accurate predictions of the quality of generated views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a new no-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution that is later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. We test and evaluate our method in the context of 3D reconstruction; to this end, we collected a novel dataset of human quality assessment in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method can not only successfully localize artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, but do so without direct references. Surprisingly, our metric outperforms both no-reference metrics and popular full-reference image metrics. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.</description>

      <title>Perceptually Optimized Super Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern deep-learning based super-resolution techniques process images and videos independently of the underlying content and viewing conditions. However, the sensitivity of the human visual system to image details changes depending on the underlying content characteristics, such as spatial frequency, luminance, color, contrast, or motion. This observation hints that computational resources spent on up-sampling visual content may be wasted whenever a viewer cannot resolve the results. Motivated by this observation, we propose a perceptually inspired and architecture-agnostic approach for controlling the visual quality and efficiency of super-resolution techniques. The core is a perceptual model that dynamically guides super-resolution methods according to the human's sensitivity to image details. Our technique leverages the limitations of the human visual system to improve the efficiency of super-resolution techniques by focusing computational resources on perceptually important regions; judged on the basis of factors such as adapting luminance, contrast, spatial frequency, motion, and viewing conditions. We demonstrate the application of our proposed model in combination with network branching, and network complexity reduction to improve the computational efficiency of super-resolution methods without visible quality loss. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including user studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing FLOPS by factors of 2$\mathbf{x}$ and greater, without sacrificing perceived quality.</description>

      <title>Baking Gaussian Splatting into Diffusion Denoiser for Fast and Scalable Single-stage Image-to-3D Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing feed-forward image-to-3D methods mainly rely on 2D multi-view diffusion models that cannot guarantee 3D consistency. These methods easily collapse when changing the prompt view direction and mainly handle object-centric prompt images. In this paper, we propose a novel single-stage 3D diffusion model, DiffusionGS, for object and scene generation from a single view. DiffusionGS directly outputs 3D Gaussian point clouds at each timestep to enforce view consistency and allow the model to generate robustly given prompt views of any directions, beyond object-centric inputs. Plus, to improve the capability and generalization ability of DiffusionGS, we scale up 3D training data by developing a scene-object mixed training strategy. Experiments show that our method enjoys better generation quality (2.20 dB higher in PSNR and 23.25 lower in FID) and over 5x faster speed (~6s on an A100 GPU) than SOTA methods. The user study and text-to-3D applications also reveals the practical values of our method. Our Project page at https://caiyuanhao1998.github.io/project/DiffusionGS/ shows the video and interactive generation results.</description>
