      <title>AsyMov: Integrated Sensing and Communications with Asynchronous Moving Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the Doppler frequency shift caused by moving targets is one of the key objectives of Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) systems. In the case of Wi-Fi sensing, a reliable estimation of the Doppler enables applications such as target classification, human activity recognition, and gait analysis. However, in practical scenarios, Doppler estimation is hindered by the movement of transmitter and receiver devices, and by the phase offsets caused by their clock asynchrony. Existing approaches have separately addressed these two aspects, either assuming clock-synchronous moving devices or asynchronous static ones. Jointly tackling device motion and clock asynchrony is extremely challenging, as the Doppler shift from device movement differs for each propagation path and the phase offsets are time-varying. In this paper, we present AsyMov, a method to estimate the bistatic Doppler frequency of a target and the device velocity in ISAC setups featuring mobile and asynchronous devices. Our method leverages the channel impulse response at the receiver, by originally exploiting the invariance of phase offsets across propagation paths and the bistatic geometry. Moreover, AsyMov handles irregular channel sampling in the time domain and can be seamlessly integrated with device velocity measurements obtained from onboard sensors (if available), to enhance its reliability. AsyMov is thoroughly characterized from a theoretical perspective, via numerical simulation, and experimentally, implementing it on an IEEE 802.11ay testbed. Numerical and experimental results show superior performance against traditional methods based on the discrete Fourier transform and are on par with scenarios featuring static ISAC devices.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Division ISAC: A Practical Waveform Design Strategy via Null-Space Superimposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a key enabler of new applications, such as precision agriculture, extended reality (XR), and digital twins, for 6G wireless systems. However, the implementation of ISAC technology is very challenging due to practical constraints such as high complexity. In this paper, we introduce a novel ISAC waveform design strategy, called the spatial-division ISAC (SD-ISAC) waveform, which simplifies the ISAC waveform design problem by decoupling it into separate communication and radar waveform design tasks. Specifically, the proposed strategy leverages the null-space of the communication channel to superimpose sensing signals onto communication signals without interference. This approach offers multiple benefits, including reduced complexity and the reuse of existing communication and radar waveforms. We then address the problem of optimizing the spatial and temporal properties of the proposed waveform. We develop a low-complexity beampattern matching algorithm, leveraging a majorization-minimization (MM) technique. Furthermore, we develop a range sidelobe suppression algorithm based on manifold optimization. We provide comprehensive discussions on the practical advantages and potential challenges of the proposed method, including null-space feedback. We evaluate the performance of the proposed waveform design algorithm through extensive simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed method can provide similar or even superior performance to existing ISAC algorithms while reducing computation time significantly.</description>

      <title>Model-driven deep neural network for enhanced direction finding with commodity 5G gNodeB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pervasive and high-accuracy positioning has become increasingly important as a fundamental enabler for intelligent connected devices in mobile networks. Nevertheless, current wireless networks heavily rely on pure model-driven techniques to achieve positioning functionality, often succumbing to performance deterioration due to hardware impairments in practical scenarios. Here we reformulate the direction finding or angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation problem as an image recovery task of the spatial spectrum and propose a new model-driven deep neural network (MoD-DNN) framework. The proposed MoD-DNN scheme comprises three modules: a multi-task autoencoder-based beamformer, a coarray spectrum generation module, and a model-driven deep learning-based spatial spectrum reconstruction module. Our technique enables automatic calibration of angular-dependent phase error thereby enhancing the resilience of direction-finding precision against realistic system non-idealities. We validate the proposed scheme both using numerical simulations and field tests. The results show that the proposed MoD-DNN framework enables effective spectrum calibration and accurate AoA estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this study marks the first successful demonstration of hybrid data-and-model-driven direction finding utilizing readily available commodity 5G gNodeB.</description>

      <title>6D Movable Antenna Enhanced Multi-Access Point Coordination via Position and Orientation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective utilization of unlicensed spectrum is regarded as an important direction to enable the massive access and broad coverage for next-generation wireless local area network (WLAN). Due to the crowded spectrum occupancy and dense user terminals (UTs), the conventional fixed antenna (FA)-based access points (APs) face huge challenges in realizing massive access and interference cancellation. To address this issue, in this paper we develop a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) enhanced multi-AP coordination system for coverage enhancement and interference mitigation. First, we model the wireless channels between the APs and UTs to characterize their variation with respect to 6DMA movement, in terms of both the three-dimensional (3D) position and 3D orientation of each distributed AP's antenna. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the weighted sum rate of multiple UTs for their uplink transmissions by jointly optimizing the antenna position vector (APV), the antenna orientation matrix (AOM), and the receive combining matrix over all coordinated APs, subject to the constraints on local antenna movement regions. To solve this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we first transform it into a more tractable Lagrangian dual problem. Then, an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is developed by iteratively optimizing the APV and AOM, which are designed by applying the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and Riemannian manifold optimization-based algorithm, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed 6DMA-enhanced multi-AP coordination system can significantly enhance network capacity, and both of the online and offline 6DMA schemes can attain considerable performance improvement compared to the conventional FA-based schemes.</description>

      <title>Martian Dust Storm Detection with THz Opportunistic Integrated Sensing and Communication in the Internet of Space (IoS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Mars Dust Storm Detector (MDSD), a system that leverages the THz Opportunistic Integrated Sensing and Communications (OISAC) signals between Mars surface assets (rovers and landers) to extract environmental information, particularly dust storm properties. The MDSD system utilizes the multi-parameter sensitivity of THz signal attenuation between Martian communication devices to provide rich, real-time data on storm intensity, particle characteristics, and potentially even electrification state. This approach, incorporating HITRAN spectroscopic data and Martian-specific atmospheric parameters, allows for accurate modeling and analysis. The system's ability to repurpose THz ISAC signals for environmental sensing demonstrates an efficient use of resources in the challenging Martian environment, utilizing communication infrastructure to enhance our understanding of Mars' atmospheric dynamics. The system's performance is evaluated through extensive simulations under various Node Density Factors (NDFs), comparing different interpolation algorithms for dust storm intensity mapping. Results demonstrate that linear interpolation achieves superior accuracy (correlation &gt;0.90) at high NDFs, while nearest-neighbor and IDW algorithms maintain complete spatial coverage in sparse networks. Error analysis identifies dust particle size uncertainty as the primary contributor to estimation errors, though the system shows resilience to Martian atmospheric variations. This work extends the opportunistic use of ISAC technology to planetary exploration, contributing to both Mars atmospheric monitoring capabilities and ISAC applications in the Internet of Space (IoS).</description>

      <title>Enhancing Off-Grid One-Bit DOA Estimation with Learning-Based Sparse Bayesian Approach for Non-Uniform Sparse Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of one-bit off-grid direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in a single snapshot scenario based on a learning-based Bayesian approach. Firstly, we formulate the off-grid DOA estimation model, utilizing the first-order off-grid approximation, incorporating one-bit data quantization. Subsequently, we address this problem using the Sparse Bayesian based framework and solve iteratively. However, traditional Sparse Bayesian methods often face challenges such as high computational complexity and the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning. To balance estimation accuracy and computational efficiency, we propose a novel Learning-based Sparse Bayesian framework, which leverages an unrolled neural network architecture. This framework autonomously learns hyperparameters through supervised learning, offering more accurate off-grid DOA estimates and improved computational efficiency compared to some state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed approach is applicable to both uniform linear arrays and non-uniform sparse arrays. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Communications over Unlicensed sub-8 GHz Spectrum: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilization of unlicensed spectrum presents a promising solution to the issue of spectrum scarcity in densely populated areas, while also offering a cost-effective means to connect underserved regions. In response to this potential, both academia and industry are actively exploring innovative applications of unlicensed spectrum. This work offers a thorough overview of unlicensed spectrum bands below 8 GHz, including TV White Spaces, Civil Broadband Radio Services, Industrial Scientific Medical bands, and the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure. The paper focuses on three key aspects: regulations, existing technologies, and applications. It is essential to recognize that "unlicensed" does not equate to "unregulated"; therefore, a clear understanding of permissible and prohibited activities is crucial. From a technological perspective, we examine the current technologies, their capabilities, and relevant applications. Additionally, the shared nature of this spectrum introduces challenges related to interference among users. These collisions can be managed through two primary strategies, that we described: a database-driven approach and coexistence mechanisms at the MAC and PHY layers. This work may serve as a starting point for those who are interested in the unlicensed spectrum, both in academia and industry.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Secure Integrated Radar and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the enhanced spectral efficiency brought by the integrated radar and communication technique, it poses significant risks to communication security when confronted with malicious radar targets. To address this issue, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided transmission scheme is proposed to improve secure communication in two systems, i.e., the radar and communication co-existing (RCCE) system, where a single transmitter is utilized for both radar sensing and communication, and the dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) system. At the design stage, optimization problems are formulated to maximize the secrecy rate while satisfying the radar detection constraint via joint active beamforming at the base station and passive beamforming of RIS in both systems. Particularly, a zero-forcing-based block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is developed for the RCCE system. Besides, the Dinkelbach method combined with semidefinite relaxation is employed for the DFRC system, and to further reduce the computational complexity, a Riemannian conjugate gradient-based alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Moreover, the RIS-aided robust secure communication in the DFRC system is investigated by considering the eavesdropper's imperfect channel state information (CSI), where a bounded uncertainty model is adopted to capture the angle error and fading channel error of the eavesdropper, and a tractable bound for their joint uncertainty is derived. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the developed RIS-aided transmission scheme to improve the secrecy rate even with the eavesdropper's imperfect CSI, and comparisons between both systems reveal that the RCCE system can provide a higher secrecy rate than the DFRC system.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study on the Effect of Synchronization Accuracy for Near-Field RF Wireless Power Transfer in Multi-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless power transfer (WPT) technologies hold promise for enhancing device autonomy, particularly for energy-limited IoT systems. This paper presents experimental results on coherent and non-coherent transmit diversity approaches for WPT, tested in the near field using the Techtile testbed. We demonstrate that a fully synchronized beamfocusing system achieves a 14 dB gain over non-coherent transmission, consistent with the theoretical 14.9 dB gain for a 31-element array. Additionally, phase alignment errors below 20{\deg} result in less than 1 dB of gain loss, while errors exceeding 40{\deg} lead to losses over 3 dB. These findings suggest that phase coherency requirements for WPT can be relaxed, and that scaling the number of antennas is a promising strategy for improving power transfer efficiency.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Passive 6D Movable Antennas: Joint Deployment and Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is composed of numerous passive reflecting elements and can be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to achieve six-dimensional (6D) movement by adjusting the UAV's three-dimensional (3D) location and 3D orientation simultaneously. Hence, in this paper, we investigate a new UAV-enabled passive 6D movable antenna (6DMA) architecture by mounting an IRS on a UAV and address the associated joint deployment and beamforming optimization problem. In particular, we consider a passive 6DMA-aided multicast system with a multi-antenna base station (BS) and multiple remote users, aiming to jointly optimize the IRS's location and 3D orientation, as well as its passive beamforming to maximize the minimum received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among all users under the practical angle-dependent signal reflection model. However, this optimization problem is challenging to be optimally solved due to the intricate relationship between the users' SNRs and the IRS's location and orientation. To tackle this challenge, we first focus on a simplified case with a single user, showing that one-dimensional (1D) orientation suffices to achieve the optimal performance. Next, we show that for any given IRS's location, the optimal 1D orientation can be derived in closed form, based on which several useful insights are drawn. To solve the max-min SNR problem in the general multi-user case, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm by alternately optimizing the IRS's beamforming and location/orientation via successive convex approximation (SCA) and hybrid coarse- and fine-grained search, respectively. To avoid undesirable local sub-optimal solutions, a Gibbs sampling (GS) method is proposed to generate new IRS locations and orientations for exploration in each AO iteration. Numerical results validate our theoretical analyses.</description>

      <title>Practical IMT and EESS Spectrum Sharing in the 7 to 8 GHz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 7.3 GHz (350 MHz bandwidth) Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) band, while not protected, is used for Passive Sea Surface Temperature (P-SST) measurements that provide important data for weather forecasts, coastal disaster prevention, climate modeling, and oceanographic research. The full 7 GHz band (7.125 to 8.4 GHz), which encompasses these EOS frequencies, is the largest contiguous block of potentially available mid-band spectrum and will play a significant role in meeting the anticipated demand for wireless services. A Real Time Geofenced Spectrum Sharing (RGSS) system is shown to be a practical and near term solution to spectrum sharing between P-SST measurements and 5G or 6G networks in the 7GHz band. RGSS enables IMT networks and EOS radiometers to share 350MHz of overlapping spectrum centered at 7.3 GHz. It prevents interference to P-SST measurements while simultaneously allowing IMT systems un-constrained access to the shared spectrum greater than 99.9% of the time. Subscriber impact during the less than 0.1 percent paused access time can be prevented by using 3GPP defined capabilities and O-RAN APIs to move subscribers to other frequencies. Paused access time data from a proof-of-concept RGSS system is available to academic, government, and industry researchers through a web or programmatic interface.</description>

      <title>Latency Minimization for Movable Antennas-Enabled Relay-aided D2D Mobile Edge Computing Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-to-device (D2D)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is one of the critical technologies of future sixth generation (6G) networks. The core of D2D-assisted MEC is to reduce system latency for network edge UEs by supporting cloud computing services, thereby achieving high-speed transmission. Due to the sensitivity of communication signals to obstacles, relaying is adopted to enhance the D2D-assisted MEC system's performance and its coverage area. However, relay nodes and the base station (BS) are typically equipped with large-scale antenna arrays. This increases the cost of relay-assisted D2D MEC systems and limits their deployment. Movable antenna (MA) technology is used to work around this limitation without compromising performance. Specifically, the core of MA technology lies in optimizing the antenna positions to increase system capacity. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel resource allocation scheme for MA-enhanced relay-assisted D2D MEC systems. Specifically, the MA positions and beamforming of user equipments (UEs), relay, and BS as well as the allocation of resources and the computation task offloading rate at the MEC server, all are optimized herein with the objective of minimizing the maximum latency while satisfying computation and communication rate constraints. Since this is a multivariable non-convex problem, a parallel and distributed penalty dual decomposition (PDD) based algorithm is developed and combined with successive convex approximation (SCA) to solve this non-convex problem. The results of extensive numerical analyses show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the performance of the MA-enhanced relay-assisted D2D communication system compared to a counterpart where relays and the BS are equiped with traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA).</description>

      <title>Probabilistic GOSPA: A Metric for Performance Evaluation of Multi-Object Filters with Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic generalization of the generalized optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric, termed P-GOSPA metric. GOSPA is a popular metric for evaluating the distance between finite sets, typically in multi-object estimation applications. P-GOSPA extends GOSPA to the space of multi-Bernoulli set densities, incorporating the inherent uncertainty in probabilistic multi-object representations. In addition, P-GOSPA retains the interpretability of GOSPA, such as decomposability into localization, missed and false detection errors, in a sound manner. Examples and simulations are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of P-GOSPA.</description>

Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) technology enhances the spectrum and energy efficiency of wireless communications by enabling multiplexing over different OAM modes. However, classical information theory, which relies on scalar models and far-field approximations, cannot fully capture the unique characteristics of OAM-based systems, such as their complex electromagnetic field distributions and near-field behaviors. To address these limitations, this paper analyzes OAM-based wireless communications from an electromagnetic information theory (EIT) perspective, integrating electromagnetic theory with classical information theory. EIT accounts for the physical properties of electromagnetic waves, offering advantages such as improved signal manipulation and better performance in real-world conditions. Given these benefits, EIT is more suitable for analyzing OAM-based wireless communication systems. Presenting a typical OAM model utilizing uniform circular arrays (UCAs), this paper derives the channel capacity based on the induced electric fields by using Green's function. Numerical and simulation results validate the channel capacity enhancement via exploration under EIT framework. Additionally, this paper evaluates the impact of various parameters on the channel capacity. These findings provide new insights for understanding and optimizing OAM-based wireless communications systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper a new method based on the fusion of optical and radar data is proposed to detect and remotely interrogate mobile and passive sensors. The sensors are detected in real time by using an optical camera, while their remote reading is carried out on the fly using a Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave radar. The proof-of-concept is established from the interrogation of a microfluidic temperature sensor placed on a conveyer belt.</description>

      <title>Acceleration and Parallelization Methods for ISRS EGN Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhanced Gaussian noise (EGN) model, which accounts for inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS), has been extensively utilized for evaluating nonlinear interference (NLI) within the C+L band. Compared to closed-form expressions and machine learning-based NLI evaluation models, it demonstrates broader applicability and its accuracy is not dependent on the support of large-scale datasets. However, its high computational complexity often results in lengthy computation times. Through analysis, the high-frequency oscillations of the four-wave mixing (FWM) efficiency factor integrand were identified as a primary factor limiting the computational speed of the ISRS EGN model. To address this issue, we propose an accurate approximation method that enables the derivation of a closed-form expression for the FWM efficiency factor without imposing restrictive conditions. Thereby, the scheme proposed in this paper could significantly accelerate the computational speed. Numerical results demonstrate that method in this work could achieve low error levels under high ISRS influence levels, with an MAE of less than 0.001 dB, and no cumulative error over increasing transmission distances, while reducing computation time by over 97%. Furthermore, a parallel computation strategy targeting independent regions within the integration domain is proposed, which could further improve computational efficiency by nearly 11 times.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Efficacy of Vectocardiographic and ECG Parameters for Efficient Tertiary Cardiology Care Allocation Using Decision Tree Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11839</link>

Abstract: Use real word data to evaluate the performance of the electrocardiographic markers of GEH as features in a machine learning model with Standard ECG features and Risk Factors in Predicting Outcome of patients in a population referred to a tertiary cardiology hospital.
  Patients forwarded to specific evaluation in a cardiology specialized hospital performed an ECG and a risk factor anamnesis. A series of follow up attendances occurred in periods of 6 months, 12 months and 15 months to check for cardiovascular related events (mortality or new nonfatal cardiovascular events (Stroke, MI, PCI, CS), as identified during 1-year phone follow-ups.
  The first attendance ECG was measured by a specialist and processed in order to obtain the global electric heterogeneity (GEH) using the Kors Matriz. The ECG measurements, GEH parameters and risk factors were combined for training multiple instances of XGBoost decision trees models. Each instance were optmized for the AUCPR and the instance with higher AUC is chosen as representative to the model. The importance of each parameter for the winner tree model was compared to better understand the improvement from using GEH parameters.
  The GEH parameters turned out to have statistical significance for this population specially the QRST angle and the SVG. The combined model with the tree parameters class had the best performance. The findings suggest that using VCG features can facilitate more accurate identification of patients who require tertiary care, thereby optimizing resource allocation and improving patient outcomes. Moreover, the decision tree model's transparency and ability to pinpoint critical features make it a valuable tool for clinical decision-making and align well with existing clinical practices.</description>

      <title>Scalable Data Transmission Framework for Earth Observation Satellites with Channel Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The immense volume of data generated by Earth observation (EO) satellites presents significant challenges in transmitting it to Earth over rate-limited satellite-to-ground communication links. This paper presents an efficient downlink framework for multi-spectral satellite images, leveraging adaptive transmission techniques based on pixel importance and link capacity. By integrating semantic communication principles, the framework prioritizes critical information, such as changed multi-spectral pixels, to optimize data transmission. The process involves preprocessing, assessing pixel importance to encode only significant changes, and dynamically adjusting transmissions to match channel conditions. Experimental results on the real dataset and simulated link demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures high-quality data delivery while significantly reducing number of transmitted data, making it highly suitable for satellite-based EO applications.</description>

      <title>Soil moisture estimation of bare and vegetation-covered areas using a P/L/C-band SAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces a novel approach for estimating soil moisture in vegetated surfaces, specifically focusing on sugarcane crops throughout various growth stages in agriculture applications. While existing models typically address bare soil scenarios, this model utilizes data from P-, L-, and C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to estimate soil moisture. The semi-empirical Dubois model forms the basis of the proposed model, which has been adapted to accommodate multiband operation and crop height variations. Synthetic datasets are generated using the adjusted model to train two neural networks incorporated into the overall model. Additionally, a linear expression for estimating crop height is integrated into the model. The model is validated in an Experimental Site at the School of Agricultural Engineering, UNICAMP, and an independent area at the Sugarcane Technology Center in Piracicaba, Brazil. The model utilizes a multiband drone-borne SAR system with a 3-meter image resolution and radiometric accuracy of 0.5 dB. The results indicate that the model can estimate soil moisture with root-mean-square errors of 0.05 cm3.cm-3 (5 vol. %) across crop heights ranging from zero to 2.5 meters.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Integrated Sensing and Communications: A First Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A canonical use case of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems involves a multi-antenna transmitter communicating with $K$ users and sensing targets in its vicinity. For this setup, precoder and multiple access designs are of utmost importance, as the limited transmit power budget must be efficiently directed towards the desired directions (users and targets) to maximize both communications and sensing performance. This problem has been widely investigated analytically under various design choices, in particular (a) whether or not a dedicated sensing signal is needed, and (b) for different MIMO multiple access techniques, such as Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) and Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA). However, a conclusive answer on which design choice achieves the best ISAC performance, backed by experimental results, remains elusive. We address this vacuum by experimentally evaluating and comparing RSMA and SDMA for communicating with two users $(K = 2)$ and sensing (ranging) one target. Over three scenarios that are representative of \emph{vehicular} ISAC, covering different levels of inter-user interference and separation/integration between sensing and communications, we show that RSMA without a dedicated sensing signal achieves better ISAC performance -- i.e., higher sum throughput (upto $50\%$ peak throughput gain) for similar radar SNR (between $20$ to $24{\rm dB}$) -- than SDMA with a dedicated sensing signal. This first-ever experimental study of RSMA ISAC demonstrates the feasibility and the superiority of RSMA for future multi-functional wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural Compression of Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point clouds have gained prominence in numerous applications due to their ability to accurately depict 3D objects and scenes. However, compressing unstructured, high-precision point cloud data effectively remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose NeRC$^{\textbf{3}}$, a novel point cloud compression framework leveraging implicit neural representations to handle both geometry and attributes. Our approach employs two coordinate-based neural networks to implicitly represent a voxelized point cloud: the first determines the occupancy status of a voxel, while the second predicts the attributes of occupied voxels. By feeding voxel coordinates into these networks, the receiver can efficiently reconstructs the original point cloud's geometry and attributes. The neural network parameters are quantized and compressed alongside auxiliary information required for reconstruction. Additionally, we extend our method to dynamic point cloud compression with techniques to reduce temporal redundancy, including a 4D spatial-temporal representation termed 4D-NeRC$^{\textbf{3}}$. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach: for static point clouds, NeRC$^{\textbf{3}}$ outperforms octree-based methods in the latest G-PCC standard. For dynamic point clouds, 4D-NeRC$^{\textbf{3}}$ demonstrates superior geometry compression compared to state-of-the-art G-PCC and V-PCC standards and achieves competitive results for joint geometry and attribute compression.</description>

      <title>CognitionCapturer: Decoding Visual Stimuli From Human EEG Signal With Multimodal Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have attracted significant attention from researchers due to their non-invasive nature and high temporal sensitivity in decoding visual stimuli. However, most recent studies have focused solely on the relationship between EEG and image data pairs, neglecting the valuable ``beyond-image-modality" information embedded in EEG signals. This results in the loss of critical multimodal information in EEG. To address this limitation, we propose CognitionCapturer, a unified framework that fully leverages multimodal data to represent EEG signals. Specifically, CognitionCapturer trains Modality Expert Encoders for each modality to extract cross-modal information from the EEG modality. Then, it introduces a diffusion prior to map the EEG embedding space to the CLIP embedding space, followed by using a pretrained generative model, the proposed framework can reconstruct visual stimuli with high semantic and structural fidelity. Notably, the framework does not require any fine-tuning of the generative models and can be extended to incorporate more modalities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CognitionCapturer outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

      <title>Edge AI-based Radio Frequency Fingerprinting for IoT Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart cities and critical infrastructure has enhanced connectivity and real-time data exchange but introduced significant security challenges. While effective, cryptography can often be resource-intensive for small-footprint resource-constrained (i.e., IoT) devices. Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) offers a promising authentication alternative by using unique RF signal characteristics for device identification at the Physical (PHY)-layer, without resorting to cryptographic solutions. The challenge is two-fold: how to deploy such RFF in a large scale and for resource-constrained environments. Edge computing, processing data closer to its source, i.e., the wireless device, enables faster decision-making, reducing reliance on centralized cloud servers. Considering a modest edge device, we introduce two truly lightweight Edge AI-based RFF schemes tailored for resource-constrained devices. We implement two Deep Learning models, namely a Convolution Neural Network and a Transformer-Encoder, to extract complex features from the IQ samples, forming device-specific RF fingerprints. We convert the models to TensorFlow Lite and evaluate them on a Raspberry Pi, demonstrating the practicality of Edge deployment. Evaluations demonstrate the Transformer-Encoder outperforms the CNN in identifying unique transmitter features, achieving high accuracy (&gt; 0.95) and ROC-AUC scores (&gt; 0.90) while maintaining a compact model size of 73KB, appropriate for resource-constrained devices.</description>

Abstract: An iterative detection and decoding (IDD) scheme is proposed for multiuser multiple-antenna systems assisted by an active or a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS). The proposed approach features an IDD strategy that incorporates Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, RIS processing with refinements of soft information in the form of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) and truncation. Specifically, a minimum mean square error (MMSE) receive filter is used for refinement of LLRs and truncation at the RIS, and for soft interference cancellation at the receiver. An analysis of the proposed MMSE refinement is also devised along with a study of the computational complexity of the proposed and existing schemes. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in system capacity and bit error rate in the presence of block-fading channels</description>

      <title>Adaptive Quantization Resolution and Power Control for Federated Learning over Cell-free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning framework where users train a global model by exchanging local model updates with a server instead of raw datasets, preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead. However, the latency grows with the number of users and the model size, impeding the successful FL over traditional wireless networks with orthogonal access. Cell-free massive multiple-input multipleoutput (CFmMIMO) is a promising solution to serve numerous users on the same time/frequency resource with similar rates. This architecture greatly reduces uplink latency through spatial multiplexing but does not take application characteristics into account. In this paper, we co-optimize the physical layer with the FL application to mitigate the straggler effect. We introduce a novel adaptive mixed-resolution quantization scheme of the local gradient vector updates, where only the most essential entries are given high resolution. Thereafter, we propose a dynamic uplink power control scheme to manage the varying user rates and mitigate the straggler effect. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves test accuracy comparable to classic FL while reducing communication overhead by at least 93% on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We compare our methods against AQUILA, Top-q, and LAQ, using the max-sum rate and Dinkelbach power control schemes. Our approach reduces the communication overhead by 75% and achieves 10% higher test accuracy than these benchmarks within a constrained total latency budget.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we propose an iterative soft interference cancellation scheme for intra-cluster (ICL) and out-of-cluster (OCL) interference mitigation in user-centric clustered cell-free massive multiple-antenna networks. We propose a minimum mean-square error receive filter with a novel modified parallel interference cancellation scheme to mitigate ICL and OCL interference. Unlike prior work, we model the OCL interference and devise a least squares estimator to perform OCL interference estimation. An iterative detection and decoding scheme that adopts low-density parity check codes and incorporates the OCL interference estimate is developed. Simulations assess the proposed scheme against existing techniques in terms of bit error rate performance.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bidirectional Transition Dispersion Entropy-based Lempel-Ziv Complexity and Its Application in Fault-Bearing Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) is a key measure for detecting the irregularity and complexity of nonlinear time series and has seen various improvements in recent decades. However, existing LZC-based metrics, such as Permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC) and Dispersion-Entropy based Lempel-Ziv complexity (DELZC), focus mainly on patterns of independent embedding vectors, often overlooking the transition patterns within the time series. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel LZC-based method called Bidirectional Transition Dispersion Entropy-based Lempel-Ziv complexity (BT-DELZC). Leveraging Markov chain theory, this method integrates a bidirectional transition network framework with DELZC to better capture dynamic signal information. Additionally, an improved hierarchical decomposition algorithm is used to extract features from various frequency components of the time series. The proposed BT-DELZC method is first evaluated through four simulated experiments, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in characterizing nonlinear time series. Additionally, two fault-bearing diagnosis experiments are conducted by combining the hierarchical BT-DELZC method with various classifiers from the machine learning domain. The results indicate that BT-DELZC achieves the highest accuracy across both datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods such as LZC, PLZC, and DELZC in extracting features related to fault bearings.</description>

Abstract: Nowadays, electric robots play big role in many fields as they can replace humans and/or decrease the amount of load on humans. There are several types of robots that are present in the daily life, some of them are fully controlled by humans while others are programmed to be self-controlled. In addition there are self-control robots with partial human control. Robots can be classified into three major kinds: industry robots, autonomous robots and mobile robots. Industry robots are used in industries and factories to perform mankind tasks in the easier and faster way which will help in developing products. Typically industrial robots perform difficult and dangerous tasks, as they lift heavy objects, handle chemicals, paint and assembly work and so on. They are working all the time hour after hour, day by day with the same precision and they do not get tired which means that they do not make errors due to fatigue. Indeed, they are ideally suited to complete repetitive tasks.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Bearing Fault Detection using Temporal Decomposition Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bearing fault detection is a critical task in predictive maintenance, where accurate and timely fault identification can prevent costly downtime and equipment damage. Traditional attention mechanisms in Transformer neural networks often struggle to capture the complex temporal patterns in bearing vibration data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel attention mechanism, Temporal Decomposition Attention (TDA), which combines temporal bias encoding with seasonal-trend decomposition to capture both long-term dependencies and periodic fluctuations in time series data. Additionally, we incorporate the Hull Exponential Moving Average (HEMA) for feature extraction, enabling the model to effectively capture meaningful characteristics from the data while reducing noise. Our approach integrates TDA into the Transformer architecture, allowing the model to focus separately on the trend and seasonal components of the data. Experimental results on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing fault detection dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional attention mechanisms and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and interpretability. The HEMA-Transformer-TDA model achieves an accuracy of 98.1%, with exceptional precision, recall, and F1-scores, demonstrating its effectiveness in bearing fault detection and its potential for application in other time series tasks with seasonal patterns or trends.</description>

      <title>Wearable Accelerometer Foundation Models for Health via Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern wearable devices can conveniently and continuously record various biosignals in the many different environments of daily living, ultimately enabling a rich view of individual health. However, not all biosignals are the same: high-fidelity measurements, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), contain more physiological information, but require optical sensors with a high power footprint. In a resource-constrained setting, such biosignals may be unavailable. Alternatively, a lower-fidelity biosignal, such as accelerometry that captures minute cardiovascular information during low-motion periods, has a significantly smaller power footprint and is available in almost any wearable device. Here, we demonstrate that we can distill representational knowledge across biosignals, i.e., from PPG to accelerometry, using 20 million minutes of unlabeled data, collected from ~172K participants in the Apple Heart and Movement Study under informed consent. We first pre-train PPG encoders via self-supervised learning, and then distill their representational knowledge to accelerometry encoders. We demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment on unseen data, e.g., 99.2% top-1 accuracy for retrieving PPG embeddings from accelerometry embeddings. We show that distilled accelerometry encoders have significantly more informative representations compared to self-supervised or supervised encoders trained directly on accelerometry data, observed by at least 23%-49% improved performance for predicting heart rate and heart rate variability. We also show that distilled accelerometry encoders are readily predictive of a wide array of downstream health targets, i.e., they are generalist foundation models. We believe accelerometry foundation models for health may unlock new opportunities for developing digital biomarkers from any wearable device, and help individuals track their health more frequently and conveniently.</description>

      <title>Accurate, Robust and Privacy-Preserving Brain-Computer Interface Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the brain and external devices. However, EEG-based BCIs face at least three major challenges in real-world applications: data scarcity and individual differences, adversarial vulnerability, and data privacy. While previous studies have addressed one or two of these issues, simultaneous accommodation of all three challenges remains challenging and unexplored. This paper fills this gap, by proposing an Augmented Robustness Ensemble (ARE) algorithm and integrating it into three privacy protection scenarios (centralized source-free transfer, federated source-free transfer, and source data perturbation), achieving simultaneously accurate decoding, adversarial robustness, and privacy protection of EEG-based BCIs. Experiments on three public EEG datasets demonstrated that our proposed approach outperformed over 10 classic and state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and robustness in all three privacy-preserving scenarios, even outperforming state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. This is the first time that three major challenges in EEG-based BCIs can be addressed simultaneously, significantly improving the practicalness of EEG decoding in real-world BCIs.</description>

      <title>STDHL: Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Hypergraph Learning for Wind Power Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging spatio-temporal correlations among wind farms can significantly enhance the accuracy of ultra-short-term wind power forecasting. However, the complex and dynamic nature of these correlations presents significant modeling challenges. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal dynamic hypergraph learning (STDHL) model. This model uses a hypergraph structure to represent spatial features among wind farms. Unlike traditional graph structures, which only capture pair-wise node features, hypergraphs create hyperedges connecting multiple nodes, enabling the representation and transmission of higher-order spatial features. The STDHL model incorporates a novel dynamic hypergraph convolutional layer to model dynamic spatial correlations and a grouped temporal convolutional layer for channel-independent temporal modeling. The model uses spatio-temporal encoders to extract features from multi-source covariates, which are mapped to quantile results through a forecast decoder. Experimental results using the GEFCom dataset show that the STDHL model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis highlights the critical role of spatio-temporal covariates in improving ultra-short-term forecasting accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Climate Change Impacts on Renewable Energy Generation Capacity: A Super-Resolution Recurrent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by global climate change and the ongoing energy transition, the coupling between power supply capabilities and meteorological factors has become increasingly significant. Over the long term, accurately quantifying the power generation capacity of renewable energy under the influence of climate change is essential for the development of sustainable power systems. However, due to interdisciplinary differences in data requirements, climate data often lacks the necessary hourly resolution to capture the short-term variability and uncertainties of renewable energy resources. To address this limitation, a super-resolution recurrent diffusion model (SRDM) has been developed to enhance the temporal resolution of climate data and model the short-term uncertainty. The SRDM incorporates a pre-trained decoder and a denoising network, that generates long-term, high-resolution climate data through a recurrent coupling mechanism. The high-resolution climate data is then converted into power value using the mechanism model, enabling the simulation of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation capacity on future long-term scales. Case studies were conducted in the Ejina region of Inner Mongolia, China, using fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) and coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) data under two climate pathways: SSP126 and SSP585. The results demonstrate that the SRDM outperforms existing generative models in generating super-resolution climate data. For the Ejina region, under a high-emission pathway, the annual utilization hours of wind power are projected to decrease by 2.82 hours/year, while those for PV power are projected to decrease by 0.26 hours/year. Furthermore, the research highlights the estimation biases introduced when low-resolution climate data is used for power conversion.</description>

      <title>Wireless Environmental Information Theory: A New Paradigm towards 6G Online and Proactive Environment Intelligence Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The channel is one of the five critical components of a communication system, and its ergodic capacity is based on all realizations of statistic channel model. This statistical paradigm has successfully guided the design of mobile communication systems from 1G to 5G. However, this approach relies on offline channel measurements in specific environments, and the system passively adapts to new environments, resulting in deviation from the optimal performance. With the pursuit of higher capacity and data rate of 6G, especially facing the ubiquitous environments, there is an urgent need for a new paradigm to combat the randomness of channel, i.e., more proactive and online manner. Motivated by this, we propose an environment intelligence communication (EIC) based on wireless environmental information theory (WEIT) for 6G. The proposed EIC architecture is composed of three steps: Firstly, wireless environmental information (WEI) is acquired using sensing techniques. Then, leveraging WEI and channel data, AI techniques are employed to predict channel fading, thereby mitigating channel uncertainty. Thirdly, the communication system autonomously determines the optimal air-interface transmission strategy based on real-time channel predictions, enabling intelligent interaction with the physical environment. To make this attractive paradigm shift from theory to practice, we answer three key problems to establish WEIT for the first time. How should WEI be defined? Can it be quantified? Does it hold the same properties as statistical communication information? Furthermore, EIC aided by WEI (EIC-WEI) is validated across multiple air-interface tasks, including CSI prediction, beam prediction, and radio resource management. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EIC-WEI significantly outperforms the statistical paradigm in decreasing overhead and performance optimization.</description>

      <title>Sonar-based Deep Learning in Underwater Robotics: Overview, Robustness and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing interest in underwater exploration and monitoring, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have become essential. The recent interest in onboard Deep Learning (DL) has advanced real-time environmental interaction capabilities relying on efficient and accurate vision-based DL models. However, the predominant use of sonar in underwater environments, characterized by limited training data and inherent noise, poses challenges to model robustness. This autonomy improvement raises safety concerns for deploying such models during underwater operations, potentially leading to hazardous situations. This paper aims to provide the first comprehensive overview of sonar-based DL under the scope of robustness. It studies sonar-based DL perception task models, such as classification, object detection, segmentation, and SLAM. Furthermore, the paper systematizes sonar-based state-of-the-art datasets, simulators, and robustness methods such as neural network verification, out-of-distribution, and adversarial attacks. This paper highlights the lack of robustness in sonar-based DL research and suggests future research pathways, notably establishing a baseline sonar-based dataset and bridging the simulation-to-reality gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leaf-cutting ants, notorious for causing defoliation in commercial forest plantations, significantly contribute to biomass and productivity losses, impacting forest producers in Brazil. These ants construct complex underground nests, highlighting the need for advanced monitoring tools to extract subsurface information across large areas. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems provide a powerful solution for this challenge. This study presents the results of electromagnetic simulations designed to detect leaf-cutting ant nests in industrial forests. The simulations modeled nests with 6 to 100 underground chambers, offering insights into their radar signatures. Following these simulations, a field study was conducted using a drone-borne SAR operating in the P-band. A helical flight pattern was employed to generate high-resolution ground tomography of a commercial eucalyptus forest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was implemented to detect ant nests and estimate their sizes from tomographic data, delivering remarkable results. The method achieved an ant nest detection accuracy of 100%, a false alarm rate of 0%, and an average error of 21% in size estimation. These outcomes highlight the transformative potential of integrating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems with machine learning to enhance monitoring and management practices in commercial forestry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.08718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Mixture (PMBM) density is a conjugate multi-target density for the standard point target model with Poisson point process birth. This means that both the filtering and predicted densities for the set of targets are PMBM. In this paper, we first show that the PMBM density is also conjugate for sets of trajectories with the standard point target measurement model. Second, based on this theoretical foundation, we develop two trajectory PMBM filters that provide recursions to calculate the posterior density for the set of all trajectories that have ever been present in the surveillance area, and the posterior density of the set of trajectories present at the current time step in the surveillance area. These two filters therefore provide complete probabilistic information on the considered trajectories enabling optimal trajectory estimation. Third, we establish that the density of the set of trajectories in any time window, given the measurements in a possibly different time window, is also a PMBM. Finally, the trajectory PMBM filters are evaluated via simulations, and are shown to yield state-of-the-art performance compared to other multi-target tracking algorithms based on random finite sets and multiple hypothesis tracking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual perception is an effective way to obtain the spatial characteristics of wireless channels and to reduce the overhead for communications system. A critical problem for the visual assistance is that the communications system needs to match the radio signal with the visual information of the corresponding user, i.e., to identify the visual user that corresponds to the target radio signal from all the environmental objects. In this paper, we propose a user matching method for environment with a variable number of objects. Specifically, we apply 3D detection to extract all the environmental objects from the images taken by multiple cameras. Then, we design a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate the location distribution of users by the images and beam pairs at multiple moments, and thereby identify the users from all the extracted environmental objects. Moreover, we present a resource allocation method based on the taken images to reduce the time and spectrum overhead compared to traditional resource allocation methods. Simulation results show that the proposed user matching method outperforms the existing methods, and the proposed resource allocation method can achieve $92\%$ transmission rate of the traditional resource allocation method but with the time and spectrum overhead significantly reduced.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing Modulation with Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orthogonal delay-Doppler (DD) division multiplexing(ODDM) modulation has been recently proposed as a promising modulation scheme for next-generation communication systems with high mobility. Despite its benefits, ODDM modulation and other DD domain modulation schemes face the challenge of excessive equalization complexity. To address this challenge, we propose time domain Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) for the ODDM transmitter, to make the DD domain single-tap equalizer feasible, thereby reducing the equalization complexity. In our design, we first pre-cancel the inter-symbolinterference (ISI) using the linear time-varying (LTV) channel information. Second, different from classical THP designs, we introduce a modified modulo operation with an adaptive modulus, by which the joint DD domain data multiplexing and timedomain ISI pre-cancellation can be realized without excessively increasing the bit errors. We then analytically study the losses encountered in this design, namely the power loss, the modulo noise loss, and the modulo signal loss. Based on this analysis, BER lower bounds of the ODDM system with time domain THP are derived when 4-QAM or 16-QAM modulations are adopted for symbol mapping in the DD domain. Finally, through numerical results, we validate our analysis and then demonstrate that the ODDM system with time domain THP is a promising solution to realize better BER performance over LTV channels compared to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems with single-tap equalizer and ODDM systems with maximum ratio combining.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Spot Beamfocusing: A Correlation-Aware Transfer Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) spot beamfocusing (SBF), in contrast to conventional angular-domain beamforming, concentrates radiating power within a very small volume in both radial and angular domains in the near-field zone. Recently the implementation of channel-state-information (CSI)-independent machine learning (ML)-based approaches have been developed for effective SBF using extremely large-scale programmable metasurface (ELPMs). These methods involve dividing the ELPMs into subarrays and independently training them with Deep Reinforcement Learning to jointly focus the beam at the desired focal point (DFP).
  This paper explores near-field SBF using ELPMs, addressing challenges associated with lengthy training times resulting from independent training of subarrays. To achieve a faster CSI-independent solution, inspired by the correlation between the beamfocusing matrices of the subarrays, we leverage transfer learning techniques. First, we introduce a novel similarity criterion based on the phase distribution image (PDI) of subarray apertures. Then we devise a subarray policy propagation scheme that transfers the knowledge from trained to untrained subarrays. We further enhance learning by introducing quasi-liquid layers as a revised version of the adaptive policy reuse technique. We show through simulations that the proposed scheme improves the training speed about 5 times. Furthermore, for dynamic DFP management, we devised a DFP policy blending process, which augments the convergence rate up to 8-fold.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-Channel Optimization for UAV Video Coding and Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06667v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video coding and transmission in scenarios such as emergency rescue and environmental monitoring. Unlike existing methods of modeling UAV video source coding and channel transmission separately, we investigate the joint source-channel optimization issue for video coding and transmission. Particularly, we design eight-dimensional delay-power-rate-distortion models in terms of source coding and channel transmission and characterize the correlation between video coding and transmission, with which a joint source-channel optimization problem is formulated. Its objective is to minimize end-to-end distortion and UAV power consumption by optimizing fine-grained parameters related to UAV video coding and transmission. This problem is confirmed to be a challenging sequential-decision and non-convex optimization problem. We therefore decompose it into a family of repeated optimization problems by Lyapunov optimization and design an approximate convex optimization scheme with provable performance guarantees to tackle these problems. Based on the theoretical transformation, we propose a Lyapunov repeated iteration (LyaRI) algorithm. Both objective and subjective experiments are conducted to comprehensively evaluate the performance of LyaRI. The results indicate that, compared to its counterparts, LyaRI achieves better video quality and stability performance, with a 47.74% reduction in the variance of the obtained encoding bitrate.</description>

      <title>Improved Estimation Accuracy in OFDM-based Joint Communication and Sensing through Kalman Tracking and Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a monostatic orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based joint communication and sensing (JCAS) system for object tracking. Our setup consists of a transmitter and receiver equipped with an antenna array for fully digital beamforming. The native resolution of all radar-like sensing, including OFDM radar sensing, is limited by the observation time and bandwidth. In this work, we improve the parameter estimates through interpolation methods and tracking algorithms. We verify our method by comparing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the estimated range, velocity and angle and by comparing the mean Euclidean distance between the estimated and true position. We demonstrate how both a Kalman filter for tracking, and interpolation methods using zero-padding and the chirp Z-transform (CZT) improve the estimation error. We discuss the computational complexity of the different methods. We propose the KalmanCZT approach that combines tracking via Kalman filtering and interpolation via the CZT, resulting in a solution with flexible resolution that significantly improves the range RMSE.</description>

      <title>A New Statistical Model for Waveguide Invariant-Based Range Estimation in Shallow Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigation and source localization in the undersea environment are challenged by the absence of a ubiquitous positioning system. Passive acoustic ranging offers a valuable means of obtaining location information underwater. We present a range estimation method based on waveguide invariant (WI) theory, using ship noise recorded by a hydrophone as an acoustic source. The WI is a scalar parameter that describes the interference patterns in spectrograms caused by the interaction of acoustic wave modes propagating in a waveguide, such as shallow water. WI theory enables ranging using a single receiver without detailed knowledge of the environment. In this paper, underwater acoustic signals radiated by a moving large ship, which include broadband and tonal components, are employed for WI-based ranging in a range-independent shallow water environment. In particular, we develop a likelihood function for WI-based range estimation by introducing a statistical model for high signal-to-noise ratio scenarios. Here, the broadband component is assumed to dominate the background noise. The effectiveness of the proposed range estimation method is demonstrated using real acoustic measurements of a moving container ship recorded during the Seabed Characterization Experiment 2017 (SBCEX17).</description>

      <title>Towards High-Quality and Efficient Speech Bandwidth Extension with Parallel Amplitude and Phase Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech bandwidth extension (BWE) refers to widening the frequency bandwidth range of speech signals, enhancing the speech quality towards brighter and fuller. This paper proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN) based BWE model with parallel prediction of Amplitude and Phase spectra, named AP-BWE, which achieves both high-quality and efficient wideband speech waveform generation. The proposed AP-BWE generator is entirely based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It features a dual-stream architecture with mutual interaction, where the amplitude stream and the phase stream communicate with each other and respectively extend the high-frequency components from the input narrowband amplitude and phase spectra. To improve the naturalness of the extended speech signals, we employ a multi-period discriminator at the waveform level and design a pair of multi-resolution amplitude and phase discriminators at the spectral level, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed AP-BWE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of speech quality for BWE tasks targeting sampling rates of both 16 kHz and 48 kHz. In terms of generation efficiency, due to the all-convolutional architecture and all-frame-level operations, the proposed AP-BWE can generate 48 kHz waveform samples 292.3 times faster than real-time on a single RTX 4090 GPU and 18.1 times faster than real-time on a single CPU. Notably, to our knowledge, AP-BWE is the first to achieve the direct extension of the high-frequency phase spectrum, which is beneficial for improving the effectiveness of existing BWE methods.</description>

      <title>OmniCount: Multi-label Object Counting with Semantic-Geometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05435v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object counting is pivotal for understanding the composition of scenes. Previously, this task was dominated by class-specific methods, which have gradually evolved into more adaptable class-agnostic strategies. However, these strategies come with their own set of limitations, such as the need for manual exemplar input and multiple passes for multiple categories, resulting in significant inefficiencies. This paper introduces a more practical approach enabling simultaneous counting of multiple object categories using an open-vocabulary framework. Our solution, OmniCount, stands out by using semantic and geometric insights (priors) from pre-trained models to count multiple categories of objects as specified by users, all without additional training. OmniCount distinguishes itself by generating precise object masks and leveraging varied interactive prompts via the Segment Anything Model for efficient counting. To evaluate OmniCount, we created the OmniCount-191 benchmark, a first-of-its-kind dataset with multi-label object counts, including points, bounding boxes, and VQA annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation in OmniCount-191, alongside other leading benchmarks, demonstrates OmniCount's exceptional performance, significantly outpacing existing solutions.

      <title>Communication-Efficient Federated Learning via Clipped Uniform Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhance communication efficiency in federated learning through clipped uniform quantization. By leveraging optimal clipping thresholds and client-specific adaptive quantization schemes, the proposed method significantly reduces bandwidth and memory requirements for model weight transmission between clients and the server while maintaining competitive accuracy. We investigate the effects of symmetric clipping and uniform quantization on model performance, emphasizing the role of stochastic quantization in mitigating artifacts and improving robustness. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the method achieves near-full-precision performance with substantial communication savings. Moreover, the proposed approach facilitates efficient weight averaging based on the inverse of the mean squared quantization errors, effectively balancing the trade-off between communication efficiency and model accuracy. Moreover, in contrast to federated averaging, this design obviates the need to disclose client-specific data volumes to the server, thereby enhancing client privacy. Comparative analysis with conventional quantization methods further confirms the efficacy of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>What Roles can Spatial Modulation and Space Shift Keying Play in LEO Satellite-Assisted Communication?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17553v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of satellite communications play a pivotal role in addressing the ever-increasing demand for global connectivity, among which the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites attract a great amount of attention due to their low latency and high data throughput capabilities. Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE. This analysis underscores the potential of both schemes as viable candidates for future 6G LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>EEG-based AI-BCI Wheelchair Advancement: A Brain-Computer Interfacing Wheelchair System Using Machine Learning Mechanism with Right and Left Voluntary Hand Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrated novel approach to Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)-based wheelchair development, utilizing a voluntary Right Left Hand Movement mechanism for control. The system is designed to simulate wheelchair navigation based on voluntary right and left-hand movements using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. A pre-filtered dataset, obtained from an open-source EEG repository, was segmented into arrays of 19x200 to capture the onset of hand movements. The data was acquired at a sampling frequency 200Hz in the laboratory experiment. The system integrates a Tkinter-based interface for simulating wheelchair movements, offering users a functional and intuitive control system. Various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, random forest, and a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) attention-based model, were developed. The random forest model obtained 79% accuracy. Great performance was seen on the Logistic Regression model which outperforms other models with 92% accuracy and 91% accuracy on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. The Bi-LSTM attention-based model achieved a mean accuracy of 86% through cross-validation, showcasing the potential of attention mechanisms in BCI applications.</description>

      <title>A Visual-inertial Localization Algorithm using Opportunistic Visual Beacons and Dead-Reckoning for GNSS-Denied Large-scale Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of smart cities, the demand for continuous pedestrian navigation in large-scale urban environments has significantly increased. While global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provide low-cost and reliable positioning services, they are often hindered in complex urban canyon environments. Thus, exploring opportunistic signals for positioning in urban areas has become a key solution. Augmented reality (AR) allows pedestrians to acquire real-time visual information. Accordingly, we propose a low-cost visual-inertial positioning solution. This method comprises a lightweight multi-scale group convolution (MSGC)-based visual place recognition (VPR) neural network, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, and a visual/inertial fusion approach based on a Kalman filter with gross error suppression. The VPR serves as a conditional observation to the Kalman filter, effectively correcting the errors accumulated through the PDR method. This enables the entire algorithm to ensure the reliability of long-term positioning in GNSS-denied areas. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains stable positioning during large-scale movements. Compared to the lightweight MobileNetV3-based VPR method, our proposed VPR solution improves Recall@1 by at least 3\% on two public datasets while reducing the number of parameters by 63.37\%. It also achieves performance that is comparable to the VGG16-based method. The VPR-PDR algorithm improves localization accuracy by more than 40\% compared to the original PDR.</description>
