      <title>Treewidth 2 in the Planar Graph Product Structure Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every planar graph is contained in $H_1\boxtimes H_2\boxtimes K_2$ for some graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$ both with treewidth 2. This resolves a question of Liu, Norin and Wood [arXiv:2410.20333]. We also show this result is best possible: for any $c \in \mathbb{N}$, there is a planar graph $G$ such that for any tree $T$ and graph $H$ with $\text{tw}(H) \leq 2$, $G$ is not contained in $H \boxtimes T \boxtimes K_c$.</description>

      <title>Simplifying and Characterizing DAGs and Phylogenetic Networks via Least Common Ancestor Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rooted phylogenetic networks, or more generally, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), are widely used to model species or gene relationships that traditional rooted trees cannot fully capture, especially in the presence of reticulate processes or horizontal gene transfers. Such networks or DAGs are typically inferred from genomic data of extant taxa, providing only an estimate of the true evolutionary history. However, these inferred DAGs are often complex and difficult to interpret. In particular, many contain vertices that do not serve as least common ancestors (LCAs) for any subset of the underlying genes or species, thus lacking direct support from the observed data. In contrast, LCA vertices represent ancestral states substantiated by the data, offering important insights into evolutionary relationships among subsets of taxa. To reduce unnecessary complexity and eliminate unsupported vertices, we aim to simplify a DAG to retain only LCA vertices while preserving essential evolutionary information.
  In this paper, we characterize $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant and $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant DAGs, defined as those in which every vertex serves as an LCA (or unique LCA) for some subset of taxa. We introduce methods to identify LCAs in DAGs and efficiently transform any DAG into an $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant or $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant one while preserving key structural properties of the original DAG or network. This transformation is achieved using a simple operator ``$\ominus$'' that mimics vertex suppression.</description>

      <title>New classes of reversible cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Boolean function $f$ on $k$~bits induces a shift-invariant vectorial Boolean function $F$ from $n$ bits to $n$ bits for every $n\geq k$. If $F$ is bijective for every $n$, we say that $f$ is a proper lifting, and it is known that proper liftings are exactly those functions that arise as local rules of reversible cellular automata. We construct new families of such liftings for arbitrary large $k$ and discuss whether all have been identified for $k\leq 6$.</description>

      <title>On the integrality gap of the Complete Metric Steiner Tree Problem via a novel formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the metric Steiner Tree problem on graphs focusing on computing lower bounds for the integrality gap of the bi-directed cut (DCUT) formulation and introducing a novel formulation, the Complete Metric (CM) model, specifically designed to address the weakness of the DCUT formulation on metric instances. A key contribution of our work is extending of the Gap problem, previously explored in the context of the Traveling Salesman problems, to the metric Steiner Tree problem. To tackle the Gap problem for Steiner Tree instances, we first establish several structural properties of the CM formulation. We then classify the isomorphism classes of the vertices within the CM polytope, revealing a correspondence between the vertices of the DCUT and CM polytopes. Computationally, we exploit these structural properties to design two complementary heuristics for finding nontrivial small metric Steiner instances with a large integrality gap. We present several vertices for graphs with a number of nodes $\leq 10$, which realize the best-known lower bounds on the integrality gap for the CM and the DCUT formulations. We conclude the paper by presenting three new conjectures on the integrality gap of the DCUT and CM formulations for small graphs.</description>
