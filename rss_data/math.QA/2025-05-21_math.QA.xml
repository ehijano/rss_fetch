      <title>Noncommutative effective field theories and the large $N$ correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We integrate the notion of an effective field theory, as described by Costello, with the framework of noncommutative symplectic geometry introduced by Kontsevich; providing a definition for the renormalization group flow in noncommutative geometry that is defined through the use of ribbon graphs. As in the commutative case, the resulting noncommutative effective field theories are in one-to-one correspondence with local interaction functionals. We explain how in this setting, the large $N$ correspondence discovered by 't Hooft appears as a relation between noncommutative and commutative effective field theories. As an example, we apply this framework to study a noncommutative analogue of Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>On the existence of noncommutative Levi-Civita connections in derivation based calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of Levi-Civita connections, i.e torsion free connections compatible with a hermitian form, in the setting of derivation based noncommutative differential calculi over $\ast$-algebras. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of Levi-Civita connections in terms of the image of an operator derived from the hermitian form. Moreover, we identify a necessary symmetry condition on the hermitian form that extends the classical notion of metric symmetry in Riemannian geometry. The theory is illustrated with explicit computations for free modules of rank three, including noncommutative 3-tori. We note that our approach is algebraic and does not rely on analytic tools such as $C^\ast$-algebra norms.</description>

      <title>Parabolic quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximal parabolic subalgebras of untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebras were studied in the context of Borel-de Siebenthal theory in [13], where they were realized as certain equivariant map algebras with a non-free abelian group action. In this paper, we show that this perspective naturally extends to non-maximal parabolic subalgebras and introduce their quantum analogues - called parabolic quantum affine algebras - in analogy with ordinary quantum affine algebras and their classical counterpart, the loop algebra. While the definition in the Drinfeld-Jimbo presentation is straightforward, the realization in Drinfeld's second presentation requires quantum root vectors associated not only to simple roots but also to certain non-simple roots. A distinguished positive root $\gamma_0$ plays a central role in all constructions. Along the way, we construct a PBW-type basis, establish a second triangular decomposition, and determine the action of the braid group on the Cartan part of the algebra via Lusztig's automorphisms. Finally, we classify the finite-dimensional irreducible representations under a technical condition on $\gamma_0$, referred to as repetition-free, in terms of Drinfeld polynomials with some additional data. The key difference from the ordinary quantum affine case is that the degrees of the polynomials are only bounded by a certain highest weight, rather than being uniquely determined by it. In the maximal parabolic case, the classification can alternatively be phrased in terms of Drinfeld polynomials satisfying certain divisibility conditions.</description>

      <title>The Last Three T-degrees in Triply-Graded Link Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of reduced triply graded link homology $\overline{\mathrm{HHH}}$ in the top/bottom three $T-$degrees for links arising as closures of positive/negative braids. Using a diagrammatic approach to the Hochschild cohomology of Soergel bimodules, we provide explicit computations of $\overline{\mathrm{HHH}}$ as $R-$modules in these degrees. Our results reveal that the homology here is often zero, especially in the negative braid case, and display striking uniformity.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Hochschild complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ be a monoidal dg-category. We construct a complex controlling the deformation of the monoidal structure on $\mathcal{C}$ together with the deformation of the underlying dg-category itself. We show that in the case of a semisimple category $\mathcal{C}$ it reduces to the Davydov-Yetter complex. Furthermore, we study this complex in several special cases, in particular, in the case of the category of $A$-modules over a commutative algebra $A$ we obtain a complex computing operadic $E_2$-cohomology of $A$. And in the case of the category of representations of an associative bialgebra we recover the Gerstenhaber-Schack complex. In the latter case our construction can be considered as a generalization of the Gerstenhaber-Schack complex to quasi-bialgebras.</description>

      <title>Functoriality of Quantum Principal Bundles and Quantum Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.04015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of Category Theory, we study the association between finite--dimensional representations of a compact quantum group and quantum vector bundles with linear connections for a given quantum principal bundle with a principal connection. In particular, we present a categorical equivalence between this kind of {\it quantum association functors} and quantum principal bundles with principal connections.</description>

      <title>Heptagon relations from a simplicial 3-cocycle, and their cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce new algebraic structures associated with heptagon relations -- higher analogue of the well-known pentagon. The main points we deal with are: (i) polygon relations as algebraic imitations of Pachner moves, on the example of heptagon, (ii) parameterization of heptagon relations by simplicial 3-cocycles, (iii) applications to invariants of pairs "piecewise linear 5-manifold, a 3rd cohomology class on it".</description>

      <title>On dynamical skew braces and skew bracoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical skew braces are known to produce solutions to the quiver-theoretic Yang--Baxter equation. Under a technical hypothesis, we prove that these solutions are braided groupoids (and hence skew bracoids in the sense of Sheng, Tang and Zhu). Conversely, every connected braided groupoid can be parallelised, making it isomorphic to a dynamical skew brace. We study the combinatorics of these objects, depending on some strings of integer invariants.</description>

      <title>Some Constructions on Quantum Principal Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19702v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper works as an appendix of the paper titled Geometry of Associated Quantum Vector Bundles and the Quantum Gauge Group. Here, we are going to prove four statements in the theory of quantum principal bundles:: 1) The universal differential envelope $\ast$--calculus of a matrix (compact) Lie group, for the classical bicovariant $\ast$--First Order Differential Calculus, is the algebra of differential forms. 2) An example of a quantum principal bundle in which the space of base forms is not generated by the base space. 3) The group isomorphism between convolution-invertible maps and covariant left module isomorphisms at the level of differential calculus 4) The way the maps $\{T^V_k \}$ from Remark 3.1 look in differential geometry.</description>

      <title>Computing colored Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare eight versions of finite-dimensional categorifications of the colored Jones polynomial and show that they yield isomorphic results over a field of characteristic zero. As an application, we verify a physics-motivated conjectural formula for colored superpolynomials based on Poincar\'e polynomials of the Khovanov homology of cables. We also obtain a conjectural closed formula for the Poincar\'e series of the skein lasagna module of $\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$. Accompanying this note is an online database of colored superpolynomials.</description>
