      <title>Expected and minimal values of a universal tree balance index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the analysis of rooted tree shape has wide-ranging applications, notions of tree balance have developed independently in different domains. In computer science, a balanced tree is one that enables efficient updating and retrieval of data, whereas in biology tree balance quantifies bias in evolutionary processes. The lack of a precise connection between these concepts has stymied the development of universal indices and general results. We recently introduced a new tree balance index, $J^1$, that, unlike prior indices popular among biologists, permits meaningful comparison of trees with arbitrary degree distributions and node sizes. Here we explain how our new index generalizes a concept that underlies the definition of the weight-balanced tree, an important type of self-balancing binary search tree. Our index thus unifies the tree balance concepts of biology and computer science. We provide new analytical results to support applications of this universal index. First, we quantify the accuracy of approximations to the expected values of $J^1$ under two important null models: the Yule process and the uniform model. Second, we investigate minimal values of our index. These results help establish $J^1$ as a universal, cross-disciplinary index of tree balance that generalizes and supersedes prior approaches.</description>

      <title>Distinct neurodynamics of functional brain networks in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia as revealed by EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective While Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) show some common memory deficits, these two disorders show partially overlapping complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics. The objective of this study is to characterize these patterns to better understand the general principles of neurodynamics in these conditions.
  Methods A comprehensive array of methods to study brain rhythms and functional brain networks are used in the study, from spectral power measures to Lyapunov exponent, phase synchronization, temporal synchrony patterns, and measures of the functional brain connectivity. Furthermore, machine learning techniques for classification are used to augment the methodology.
  Results Multiple measures (spectral, synchrony, functional network organization) indicate an array of differences between neurodynamics between AD and FTD, and control subjects across different frequency bands.
  Conclusions These differences taken together in an integrative way suggest that AD neural activity may be less coordinated and less connected across areas, and more random, while FTD shows more coordinated neural activity (except slow frontal activity).
  Significance AD and FTD may represent opposite changes from normal brain function in terms of the spatiotemporal coordination of neural activity. Deviations from normal in both directions may lead to neurological deficits, which are specific to each of the disorders.</description>

      <title>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity, which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures, a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths, to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and can be used to compute the lead matrix, which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto Stochastic Block Model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. We also explored the performance of our community detection on a stochastic variant of the KSBM as well as on real neuropixels of cortical recordings to demonstrate applicability on real-world data. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</description>

      <title>Attribution assignment for deep-generative sequence models enables interpretability analysis using positive-only data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models offer a powerful framework for therapeutic design by efficiently exploring large spaces of biological sequences enriched for desirable properties. Unlike supervised learning methods, which require both positive and negative labeled data, generative models such as LSTMs can be trained solely on positively labeled sequences, for example, high-affinity antibodies. This is particularly advantageous in biological settings where negative data are scarce, unreliable, or biologically ill-defined. However, the lack of attribution methods for generative models has hindered the ability to extract interpretable biological insights from such models. To address this gap, we developed Generative Attribution Metric Analysis (GAMA), an attribution method for autoregressive generative models based on Integrated Gradients. We assessed GAMA using synthetic datasets with known ground truths to characterize its statistical behavior and validate its ability to recover biologically relevant features. We further demonstrated the utility of GAMA by applying it to experimental antibody-antigen binding data. GAMA enables model interpretability and the validation of generative sequence design strategies without the need for negative training data.</description>
