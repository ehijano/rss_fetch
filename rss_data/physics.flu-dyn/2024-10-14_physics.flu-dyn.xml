      <title>Large Airfoil Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the way people are learning and understanding complex topics. Their capability to be fine-tuned to answer questions on specialized topics suggests the viability of a ``large airfoil model (LAM),'' which can answer complex technical questions on airfoil aerodynamics. Such a model requires a rich historical dataset it can easily access. For gaps within the database, the model must be able to generate physic-based responses. We present the main components of the LAM: (1) an airfoil surface pressure information repository of experiments (ASPIRE), a database of digitized pressure measurements sourced from publicly available experimental reports, and (2) a deep airfoil prediction tool (ADAPT), capable of predicting airfoil $C_p$ distributions and integrated force and moment coefficients, including their uncertainties. ADAPT employs deep kernel learning, which performs Gaussian Process Regression in a ten-dimensional latent space learned by a neural network; crucially, it incorporates the reported experimental uncertainties for inference. Exemplary results for three airfoils are shown. The model accurately predicts the $C_p$ distribution and the aerodynamic coefficients under varied flow conditions. The predicted $C_p$ on the test data yields a mean absolute error in enclosed area ($\text{MAE}_\text{enclosed}$) of 0.029.</description>

      <title>Steady Motions of Single Spherical Microswimmers in Non-Newtonian Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biological systems, microswimmers often propel themselves through complex media. However, many aspects of swimming mechanisms in non-Newtonian fluids remain unclear. This study considers the propulsion of two types of single spherical microswimmers (squirmers) in shear-thickening and shear-thinning fluids. The slip-driven squirmer propels faster/slower in shear-thickening/thinning fluids than in Newtonian fluids [C. Datt et al., ''Squirming through shear-thinning fluids,'' J. Fluid Mech. 784, R1 (2015)]. In contrast, we discovered that a traction-driven squirmer exhibits the opposite trend, moving slower/faster in shear-thickening/thinning fluids than in Newtonian fluids. In addition, we have shown theoretically that Purcell's scallop theorem does not hold in non-Newtonian fluids when a squirmer with reciprocal surface motions is used. The present findings open up possibilities for the design of new types of microswimmers that can achieve translational motion from a single reciprocal motion in non-Newtonian fluids.</description>

      <title>Numerical studies on steady interaction of low enthalpy hypersonic double wedge flows using different gas models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical investigations and analyses are carried out particularly on the steady interactions of low enthalpy hypersonic 30-55-deg double wedge configuration at conditions similar to the experimental setup by Swantek &amp; Austin. To achieve a steady solution, Re lower than those in the experiment are used. Three gas models, i.e., the perfect, equilibrium, and non-equilibrium gas models, are used to analyze the difference potentials that arise from the physical model. Grid convergence studies are first conducted at Ma=7 and Re=2.5e5/m. Subsequently, comprehensive numerical studies are carried out on the steady interactions and their evolution at Ma=7 and h0=2.1MJ/kg. Specifically: (a) The upper limits of Re are identified where the flows remain steady, and the corresponding interaction characteristics as well as differences in the three gas models are investigated. Notably, a quasi-normal shock wave is observed within the slip line passage in the case of the perfect gas model. (b) The flow characteristics of the three models, including the interaction pattern, geometric features of triple points, impingements, and separation zone, are studied and compared for Re=(4,3,2)e4/m. Differences primarily emerge between the results of the perfect gas model and the real gas model. Specifically, a transmitted shock reflecting above the separation zone is observed in the case of the perfect gas model. The effect of the gas model on temperature and specific heat ratio distributions, as well as the heat transfer and pressure coefficients over the wedge surface are investigated. The shock polar method is applied for comparison with computational results, while a 1D flow model is proposed to explain the occurrence of the quasi-normal shock wave. Finally, the effects of variations in Mach number and enthalpy are determined, by alternatively varying the two parameters around Ma=7 and h0=2.1MJ/kg at Re=4e4/m.</description>

      <title>Changes in Fluctuation Waves in Coherent Airflow Structures with Input Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the development and propagation of the fluctuations in a perturbed ideally-expanded air jet. A non-propagating harmonic perturbation in the density, axial velocity, and pressure is introduced at the inflow with different frequencies to produce coherent structures in the airflow, which are synchronized with the applied frequency. Then, the fluctuations and acoustic fields are predicted for each frequency by integrating the axisymmetric linearized Euler equations. We investigate the effect of the perturbation frequency on different characteristics of the pressure and velocity waves. The perturbation frequency can be used to alter the propagation pattern and intensity of the waves and mitigate the noise levels at certain zones.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions for SPH through energy conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dealing with boundary conditions in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) poses significant difficulties, indeed being one of the SPHERIC Grand Challenges. In particular, wall boundary conditions have been pivotal in SPH model development since it evolved from astrophysics to more generic fluid dynamics simulations. Despite considerable attention from researchers and numerous publications dedicated to formulating and assessing wall boundary conditions, few of them have addressed the crucial aspect of energy conservation. This work introduces a novel boundary condition designed with energy conservation as a primary consideration, effectively extending the unconditional stability of SPH to problems involving wall boundary conditions. The result is formulated within the framework of the Boundary Integrals technique. The proposal is tested on a number of cases: normal impact against a wall, adiabatic oscillations of a piston, dam break, and the water landing of a spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Cyclic jetting enables microbubble-mediated drug delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of targeted therapies capable of overcoming biological barriers, including the tenacious blood-brain barrier, has spurred the investigation into stimuli-responsive microagents. This approach could improve therapeutic efficacy, reduce undesirable side effects, and open avenues for treating previously incurable diseases. Intravenously-administered ultrasound-responsive microbubbles are one of the most promising agents, having demonstrated potential in several clinical trials. However, the mechanism by which microbubbles enhance drug absorption remains unclear. Here, we reveal through unprecedented time-resolved side-view visualisations that single microbubbles, upon microsecond-long ultrasound driving, puncture the cell membrane and induce drug uptake via stable cyclic microjets. Our theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed bubble and cell dynamic responses. We find that cyclic jets arise from shape instabilities, warranting recognition as a novel class of jets in bubbles, distinct from classical inertial jets driven by pressure gradients. We also establish a threshold for bubble radial expansion beyond which microjets form and facilitate cellular permeation. Remarkably, these microjets occur at ultrasound pressures below 100 kPa due to their unique formation mechanism. We show that the stress generated by microjetting surpasses all previously suggested mechanisms by at least an order of magnitude. In summary, this work elucidates the physics behind microbubble-mediated targeted drug delivery and provides criteria for its effective yet safe application.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for the Advection-Diffusion Equation with Optimal Success Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum algorithm for simulating multidimensional scalar transport problems using a time-marching strategy is presented. After discretization, the explicit time-marching operator is separated into an advection-like component and a corrective shift operator. The advection-like component is mapped to a Hamiltonian simulation problem and is combined with the shift operator through the linear combination of unitaries algorithm. The result is an unscaled block encoding of the time-marching operator with an optimal success probability without the need for amplitude amplification, thereby retaining a linear dependence on the simulation time. State-vector simulations of a scalar transported in a steady two-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Foundation and challenges in modelling Dilute Active Suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active suspensions, which consist of suspended self-propelling particles such as swimming microorganisms, often exhibit non-trivial transport properties. Continuum models are frequently employed to elucidate phenomena in active suspensions, such as shear trapping of bacteria, bacterial turbulence, and bioconvection patterns in suspensions of algae. Yet, these models are often empirically derived and may not always agree with the individual-based description of active particles. Here we establish a more rigorous foundation to fully develop a continuum model based on the respective microscopic dynamics through coarse-graining. All the assumptions needed to reach popular continuum models from a multi-particle Fokker-Planck equation, which governs the probability of the full configuration space, are explicitly presented. In the dilute limit, this approach leads to the mean-field model (a.k.a. Doi-Saintillan-Shelley model), which can be further reduced to a continuum equation for particle density. Moreover, we review the limitations and highlight the challenges related to continuum descriptions, including significant issues in implementing physical boundary conditions and the possible emergence of singular solutions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear perturbations and weak shock waves in isentropic atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic perturbations to stellar envelopes can lead to the formation of weak shock waves via nonlinear wave-steepening. Close to the stellar surface, the weak shock wave increases in strength and can potentially lead to the expulsion of part of the stellar envelope. While accurate analytic solutions to the fluid equations exist in the limits of low amplitude waves or strong shocks, connecting these phases generally requires simulations. We address this problem using the fact that the plane parallel Euler equations, in the presence of a constant gravitational field, admit exact Riemann invariants when the flow is isentropic. We obtain exact solutions for acoustic perturbations and show that after they steepen into shock waves, Whitham's approximation can be used to solve for the shock's dynamics in the weak to moderately strong regimes, using a simple ordinary differential equation. Numerical simulations show that our analytic shock approximation is accurate up to moderate ($\sim$ few--15) Mach numbers, where the accuracy increases with the adiabatic index.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic interactions between a sedimenting squirmer and a planar wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions between a sedimenting microswimmer and a solid wall have ubiquitous biological and technological applications. A plethora of gravity-induced swimming dynamics near a planar no-slip wall provides a platform for designing artificial microswimmers that can generate directed propulsion through their translation-rotation coupling near a wall. In this work we provide exact solutions for a squirmer (a model swimmer of spherical shape with a prescribed slip velocity) facing either towards or away from a planar wall perpendicular to gravity. These exact solutions are used to validate a numerical code based on the boundary integral method with an adaptive mesh for distances from the wall down to 0.1% of the squirmer radius. This boundary integral code is then used to investigate the rich gravity-induced dynamics near a wall, mapping out the detailed bifurcation structures of the swimming dynamics in terms of orientation and distance to the wall. Simulation results show that a squirmer may transverse along the wall, move to a fixed point at a given height with a fixed orientation in a monotonic way or in an oscillatory fashion, or oscillate in a limit cycle in the presence of wall repulsion.</description>

      <title>Tracing the nonlinear formation of an interfacial wave spectral cascade from one to few to many</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium phenomena unveil the intricate principles of complex systems, including snowflake growth and fluid turbulence, with broad applications ranging from foreign exchange trading to climate modeling. A recurring feature across these systems is the emergence of a spectral cascade, where energy is transferred across the system's length scales, following a simple power law. The statistical theory of weak wave turbulence, in which only leading order interactions are considered, successfully predicts scaling laws for stationary states in idealised scenarios. Realistic conditions, such as finite size and amplitude effects, and strong dissipation, remain beyond our current understanding. Lacking comprehensive theoretical insight, we experimentally trace the formation of a spectral cascade under these conditions. Using an externally driven fluid-fluid interface, we successfully resolve individual wave modes and track their real-time evolution from one to few to many. This process culminates in a steady state whose power spectral density is fully characterised by a power-law scaling. We further quantify specific interactions through statistical correlations to reveal a hierarchy in the wave-mixing order, thus confirming a key assumption of weak-wave turbulence. We present a comprehensive time-evolution analysis that is crucial in identifying critical points where the interface undergoes significant changes. Our findings validate that the interfacial dynamics can be effectively modelled using a weakly nonlinear Lagrangian theory, enabling us to explore its applicability to other out-of-equilibrium systems. Notably, we uncover intriguing connections to reheating scenarios following cosmic inflation in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally and numerically characterize rapidly rotating radiatively driven thermal convection, beyond the sole heat transport measurements reported in Bouillaut et al. (2021). Based on a suite of direct numerical simulations (DNS) and additional processing of the experimental data collected by Bouillaut et al. (2021), we report the simultaneous validation of the scaling predictions of the `geostrophic turbulence' regime -- the diffusivity-free or `ultimate' regime of rapidly rotating convection -- for the heat transport, the temperature fluctuations, the flow speed and the flow structure. Radiatively driven convection thus appears as a versatile setup for the laboratory observation of the diffusivity-free regimes of various convective flows of geophysical and/or astrophysical interest.</description>

      <title>Many wrong models approach to localize an odor source in turbulence with static sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of locating an odor source in turbulent flows is central to key applications such as environmental monitoring and disaster response. We address this challenge by designing an algorithm based on Bayesian inference, which uses odor measurements from an ensemble of static sensors to estimate the source position through a stochastic model of the environment. The problem is hard because of the multi-scale and out-of-equilibrium properties of turbulent transport, which lacks accurate analytical and phenomenological modeling, thus preventing a guaranteed convergence for Bayesian approaches. To overcome the risk of relying on a single unavoidably wrong model approximation, we propose a method to rank "many wrong models" and to blend their predictions. We evaluate our weighted Bayesian update algorithm by its ability to estimate the source location with predefined accuracy and/or within a specified time frame, and compare it to standard Monte Carlo sampling methods. To demonstrate the robustness and potential applications of both approaches under realistic environmental conditions, we use high-quality direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to mimic the transport of odors in the atmospheric boundary layer. Despite minimal prior information about the source and environmental conditions, our proposed approach consistently proves to be more accurate, reliable, and robust than Monte Carlo methods, thus showing promise as a new tool for addressing the odor source localization problem in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bounds on buoyancy driven flows with Navier-slip conditions on rough boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection with Navier-slip and fixed temperature boundary conditions at the two horizontal rough walls described by the height function $h$. We prove rigorous upper bounds on the Nusselt number $\text{Nu}$ which capture the dependence on the curvature of the boundary $\kappa$ and the (non-constant) friction coefficient $\alpha$ explicitly. If $h\in W^{2,\infty}$ and $\kappa$ satisfies a smallness condition with respect to $\alpha$, we find $$ \text{Nu}\lesssim \text{Ra}^{\frac{1}{2}}+\|\kappa\|_{\infty}\,,$$ where $\text{Ra}$ is the Rayleigh number, which agrees with the predicted Spiegel-Kraichnan scaling when $\kappa=0$. This bound is obtained via local regularity estimates in a small strip at the boundary. When $h\in W^{3,\infty}$, the functions $\kappa$ and $\alpha$ are sufficiently small in $L^{\infty}$ and the Prandtl number $\Pr$ is sufficiently large, we prove upper bounds using the background field method, which interpolate between $\text{Ra}^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\text{Ra}^{\frac{5}{12}}$ with non-trivial dependence on $\alpha$ and $\kappa$. These bounds agree with the result in Drivas et al (2022 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 380 20210025) for flat boundaries and constant friction coefficient. Furthermore, in the regime $\Pr\geq \text{Ra}^{\frac 57}$, we improve the $\text{Ra}^{\frac 12}$-upper bound, showing $$\text{Nu}\lesssim_{\alpha,\kappa}\text{Ra}^{\frac{3}{7}}\,,$$ where $\lesssim_{\alpha,\kappa}$ hides an additional dependency of the implicit constant on $\alpha$ and $\kappa$.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the large-time behavior of a buoyancy-driven fluid without thermal diffusion under Navier-slip boundary conditions in a bounded domain with Lipschitz-continuous second derivatives. After establishing improved regularity for classical solutions, we analyze their large-time asymptotics. Specifically, we show that the solutions converge to a state where, as $t \rightarrow \infty$, $\|u\|_{W^{1,p}} \rightarrow 0$, and hydrostatic balance is achieved in the weak topology of $L^2$. Additionally, we determine the necessary conditions for the hydrostatic balance to be attained in the strong topology in the large-time limit. We then analyze a particular steady state, the hydrostatic equilibrium, characterized by $ u = 0 $, $ \theta = \beta x_2 + \gamma $, and $ p = \frac{\beta}{2}x_2^2 + \gamma x_2 + \delta $. In a periodic strip, we establish the linear stability of this state for $\beta &gt; 0$, indicating that the temperature is vertically stably stratified. This work builds upon the results in [Doering et al.], which focus on free-slip boundary conditions, as well as recent studies [Ayd{\i}n, Kukavica, Ziane; Ayd{\i}n, Jayanti] that address no-slip boundary conditions. Notably, the novelty of this study lies in the ability to directly bound the pressure term, made possible by the Navier-slip boundary conditions.</description>
