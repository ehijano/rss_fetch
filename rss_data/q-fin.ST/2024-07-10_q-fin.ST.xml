      <title>Stochastic Approaches to Asset Price Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this project, we propose to explore the Kalman filter's performance for estimating asset prices. We begin by introducing a stochastic mean-reverting processes, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model. After this we discuss the Kalman filter in detail, and its application with this model. After a demonstration of the Kalman filter on a simulated OU process and a discussion of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for estimating model parameters, we apply the Kalman filter with the OU process and trailing parameter estimation to real stock market data. We finish by proposing a simple day-trading algorithm using the Kalman filter with the OU process and backtest its performance using Apple's stock price. We then move to the Heston model, a combination of Geometric Brownian Motion and the OU process. Maximum likelihood estimation is commonly used for Heston model parameter estimation, which results in very complex forms. Here we propose an alternative but easier way of parameter estimation, called the method of moments (MOM). After the derivation of these estimators, we again apply this method to real stock data to assess its performance.</description>

      <title>Advanced Financial Fraud Detection Using GNN-CL Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The innovative GNN-CL model proposed in this paper marks a breakthrough in the field of financial fraud detection by synergistically combining the advantages of graph neural networks (gnn), convolutional neural networks (cnn) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. This convergence enables multifaceted analysis of complex transaction patterns, improving detection accuracy and resilience against complex fraudulent activities. A key novelty of this paper is the use of multilayer perceptrons (MLPS) to estimate node similarity, effectively filtering out neighborhood noise that can lead to false positives. This intelligent purification mechanism ensures that only the most relevant information is considered, thereby improving the model's understanding of the network structure. Feature weakening often plagues graph-based models due to the dilution of key signals. In order to further address the challenge of feature weakening, GNN-CL adopts reinforcement learning strategies. By dynamically adjusting the weights assigned to central nodes, it reinforces the importance of these influential entities to retain important clues of fraud even in less informative data. Experimental evaluations on Yelp datasets show that the results highlight the superior performance of GNN-CL compared to existing methods.</description>
