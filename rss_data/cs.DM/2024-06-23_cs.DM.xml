      <title>Proceedings of the 13th edition of the conference on Random Generation of Combinatorial Structures. Polyominoes and Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conference GASCom brings together researchers in combinatorics, algorithms, probabilities, and more generally mathematical computer science, around the theme of random and exhaustive generation of combinatorial structures, mostly considered from a theoretical point of view. In connection with this main theme, the conference is also interested in contributions in enumerative or analytic combinatorics, and interactions with other areas of mathematics, computer science, physics or biology. The conference is both interested in methods for random or exhaustive generation and in original results on combinatorial or algorithmic questions, whose solution has been made possible by an approach involving random or exhaustive generation. The present edition of the conference includes a specific bunch of talks dedicated to polyominoes and tilings.
  A (not exhaustive) list of topics of the conference is: random and exhaustive generation of combinatorial objects; tilings and polyominoes; bijective, enumerative, algebraic and analytic combinatorics; algorithmic aspects: analysis of algorithms, probabilistic algorithms; interactions: bio-informatics, combinatorics on words, number theory.</description>

      <title>Algebraic characterization of dendricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dendric shift spaces simultaneously generalize codings of regular interval exchanges and episturmian shift spaces, themselves both generalizations of Sturmian words. One of the key properties enforced by dendricity is the Return Theorem. In this paper, we prove its converse, providing the following natural algebraic perspective on dendricity: A minimal shift space is dendric if and only if every set of return words is a basis of the free group over the alphabet.</description>

      <title>Theory of Stochastic Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In studying randomized search heuristics, a frequent quantity of interest is the first time a (real-valued) stochastic process obtains (or passes) a certain value. The processes under investigation commonly show a bias towards this goal, the \emph{stochastic drift}. Turning an iteration-wise expected bias into a first time of obtaining a value is the main result of \emph{drift theorems}. This thesis introduces the theory of stochastic drift, providing examples and reviewing the main drift theorems available. Furthermore, the thesis explains how these methods can be applied in various contexts, including those where drift theorems seem a counterintuitive choice. Later sections examine related methods and approaches.</description>

      <title>NP-Completeness of the Combinatorial Distance Matrix Realisation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $k$-CombDMR problem is that of determining whether an $n \times n$ distance matrix can be realised by $n$ vertices in some undirected graph with $n + k$ vertices. This problem has a simple solution in the case $k=0$. In this paper we show that this problem is polynomial time solvable for $k=1$ and $k=2$. Moreover, we provide algorithms to construct such graph realisations by solving appropriate 2-SAT instances. In the case where $k \geq 3$, this problem is NP-complete. We show this by a reduction of the $k$-colourability problem to the $k$-CombDMR problem. Finally, we discuss the simpler polynomial time solvable problem of tree realisability for a given distance matrix.</description>

      <title>Partition strategies for the Maker-Breaker domination game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Maker-Breaker domination game is a positional game played on a graph by two players called Dominator and Staller. The players alternately select a vertex of the graph that has not yet been chosen. Dominator wins if at some point the vertices she has chosen form a dominating set of the graph. Staller wins if Dominator cannot form a dominating set. Deciding if Dominator has a winning strategy has been shown to be a PSPACE-complete problem even when restricted to chordal or bipartite graphs. In this paper, we consider strategies for Dominator based on partitions of the graph into basic subgraphs where Dominator wins as the second player. Using partitions into cycles and edges (also called perfect [1,2]-factors), we show that Dominator always wins in regular graphs and that deciding whether Dominator has a winning strategy as a second player can be computed in polynomial time for outerplanar and block graphs. We then study partitions into subgraphs with two universal vertices, which is equivalent to considering the existence of pairing dominating sets with adjacent pairs. We show that in interval graphs, Dominator wins if and only if such a partition exists. In particular, this implies that deciding whether Dominator has a winning strategy playing second is in NP for interval graphs. We finally provide an algorithm in $n^{k+3}$ for $k$-nested interval graphs (i.e. interval graphs with at most $k$ intervals included one in each other).</description>

      <title>Diverse beam search to find densest-known planar unit distance graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of determining the maximum number of edges in a unit distance graph (UDG) of $n$ vertices using computer search. An unsolved problem of Paul Erd\H{o}s asks the maximum number of edges $u(n)$ a UDG of $n$ vertices can have. Those UDGs that attain $u(n)$ are called "maximally dense." In this paper, we seek to demonstrate a computer algorithm to generate dense UDGs for vertex counts up to at least 100. Via beam search with an added visitation metric, our algorithm finds all known maximally dense UDGs up to isomorphism at the push of a button. In addition, for $15 &lt; n$, where $u(n)$ is unknown, i) the algorithm finds all previously published densest UDGs up to isomorphism for $15 &lt; n \le 30$, and ii) the rate of growth of $u(n)/n$ remains similar for $30 &lt; n$. The code and database of over 60 million UDGs found by our algorithm will be open-sourced at time of publication.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Vertices/Edges whose Deletion Preserves the Konig-Egervary Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The graph G=(V,E) is called Konig-Egervary if the sum of its independence number and its matching number equals its order. Let RV(G) denote the number of vertices v such that G-v is Konig-Egervary, and let RE(G) denote the number of edges e such that G-e is Konig-Egervary. Clearly, RV(G) = |V| and RE(G) = |E| for bipartite graphs. Unlike the bipartiteness, the property of being a Konig-Egervary graph is not hereditary. In this paper, we present an equality expressing RV(G) in terms of some graph parameters, and a tight inequality bounding RE(G) in terms of the same parameters, when G is Konig-Egervary.</description>
