      <title>Exploring Scintillators and Cherenkov Radiators for MIP Timing Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the timing performance of materials with fast light emission, tested as Minimum Ionizing Particle detectors using 150 GeV hadron beams in Monte Carlo simulations and at the CERN SPS North Area. Pixels of cross-section 2 x 2 mm2 or 3 x 3 mm2 and length of 3 or 10 mm were coupled to Hamamatsu SiPM and read out by fast high-frequency electronics. Materials whose timing performance relies on Cherenkov emission, namely BGSO, PWO, and PbF2, achieved time resolutions in the range 24-36ps. Scintillators as L(Y)SO:Ce, GAGG, and BaF2 reached below 15 ps, the best topping at 12.1 +/- 0.4 ps. These fast materials are compared to LYSO and their additional benefit is discussed. Given the promising results of BaF2, the study is completed with measurements of the scintillation properties of a set doped with yttrium to quench the slow light emission.</description>

      <title>MEOP based 3He polarization and injection system for experiments below 1 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastability exchange optical pumping (MEOP) is a widely used technique for producing polarized $^{3}$He. In connection with an experiment to search for the electric dipole moment of the neutron (nEDM) we have built a MEOP based $^{3}$He polarization and injection system to prepare 80 % polarized $^{3}$He at room temperature which will be injected into a ~400 mK measurement cell filled with superfluid $^{4}$He. We describe the polarization and injection system, which is designed to allow for final concentrations of $10^{-8}-10^{-10}$ of 80 % polarized $^{3}$He in the superfluid filled measurement cell. Only $\approx0.72\%$ polarization loss due to gradients is expected during injection</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

      <title>Remote picometric acoustic sensing via ultrastable laser interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic detection has many applications across science and technology, from medical to imaging and communications. However, most acoustic sensors have a common limitation in that the detection must be near the acoustic source. Alternatively laser interferometry with picometer-scale motional displacement detection can rapidly and precisely measure sound induced minute vibrations on remote surfaces. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of sound detection up to 100 kHz at remote sites with ~ 60 m of optical path length via laser homodyne interferometry. Based on our ultrastable Hz-linewidth laser with 10-15 fractional stability, our laser interferometer achieves 0.5 pm/Hz1/2 displacement sensitivity near 10 kHz, bounded only by laser frequency noise over 10 kHz. Between 140 Hz to 15 kHz, we achieve a homodyne acoustic sensing sensitivity of sub-nm/Pa across our conversational frequency overtones. The minimal sound pressure detectable over 60 m of optical path length is ~ 2 mPa, with dynamic ranges over 100 dB. With the demonstrated standoff picometric distance metrology, we successfully detected and reconstructed musical scores of normal conversational volumes with high fidelity. The acoustic detection via this precision laser interferometer could be applied to selective area sound sensing for remote acoustic metrology, optomechanical vibrational motion sensing and ultrasensitive optical microphones at the laser frequency noise limits.</description>

      <title>Demonstrator System Testing and Performance for the ATLAS ITk Pixel Detector for HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A demonstrator for each slice of the ATLAS pixel detector was built to replicate the real detector and provide early solutions for operating and maintaining its components. This system-level testing of the all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk) pixel detector for the ATLAS experiment at CERN's HL LHC encompasses a wide array of system components, which is essential for managing the increased luminosity and radiation levels expected at HL LHC, thereby enhancing tracking performance. Utilizing advanced silicon sensor technologies, serial powering, and lightweight carbon fiber structures, the demonstrator and assembled components on the support structure will undergo several studies for verification and commissioning. Extensive tests on serial powering, monitoring, and data acquisition were conducted, ensuring the system's robustness and reliability for future high-energy physics experiments. Additionally, three different sub-components will be introduced for the novel ITk pixel detector, specifically designed for the outer barrel (OB), outer end caps (OEC), and inner system (IS) sections.</description>

      <title>Automatic Contact-Based 3D Scanning Using Articulated Robotic Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an open-loop articulated 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic system for three-dimensional (3D) scanning of objects by contact-based method. A digitizer probe was used to detect contact with the object. Inverse kinematics (IK) was used to determine the joint angles of the robot corresponding to the probe position and orientation, and straight-line trajectory planning was implemented for motion. The system can take single-point measurements and 3D scans of freeform surfaces. Specifying the scanning area's size, position, and density, the system automatically scans the designated volume. The system produces 3D scans in Standard Triangle Language (STL) format, ensuring compatibility with commonly used 3D software. Tests based on ASME B89.4.22 standards were conducted to quantify accuracy and repeatability. The point cloud from the scans was compared to the original 3D model of the object.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Low Energy Nuclear Recoil Events with the phonon-mediated Voltage-Assisted Hybrid Detector for Rare Event Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phonon-mediated hybrid detector is made out of a monolithic silicon crystal characterized by two interconnected regions linked through a narrow neck. Operating solely on phonon signal measurements, the hybrid design facilitates the differentiation between electron recoil and nuclear recoil events, effectively discerning two types of interaction down to low energy levels. With a newly implemented software triggering technique (SWT), low-energy nuclear recoil events of approximately $500~eV_{ee}$ have been measured. In addition to this, an electron recoil background reduction of up to $95\%$ has been successfully demonstrated.</description>

      <title>First mechanical realization of a tunable dielectric haloscope for the MADMAX axion search experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MADMAX, a future experiment to search for axion dark matter, is based on a novel detection concept called the dielectric haloscope. It consists of a booster composed of several dielectric disks positioned with $\mu$m precision. A prototype composed of one movable disk was built to demonstrate the mechanical feasibility of such a booster in the challenging environment of the experiment: high magnetic field to convert the axions into photons and cryogenic temperature to reduce the thermal noise. It was tested both inside a strong magnetic field up to 1.6 T and at cryogenic temperatures down to 35K. The measurements of the velocity and positioning accuracy of the disk are shown and are found to match the MADMAX requirements.</description>

      <title>High-density gas target at the LHCb experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently installed internal gas target at LHCb presents exceptional opportunities for an extensive physics program for heavy-ion, hadron, spin, and astroparticle physics. A storage cell placed in the LHC primary vacuum, an advanced Gas Feed System, the availability of multi-TeV proton and ion beams and the recent upgrade of the LHCb detector make this project unique worldwide. In this paper, we outline the main components of the system, the physics prospects it offers and the hardware challenges encountered during its implementation. The commissioning phase has yielded promising results, demonstrating that fixed-target collisions can occur concurrently with the collider mode without compromising efficient data acquisition and high-quality reconstruction of beam-gas and beam-beam interactions.</description>

      <title>Suppressing data anomalies of gravitational reference sensors with time delay interferometry combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the LISA and Taiji missions, both transient and continuous data anomalies would pose significant challenges to the detection, estimation, and subsequent scientific interpretation of gravitational wave signals. As is indicated by the experiences of LISA PathFinder and Taiji-1, these anomalies may originate from the disturbances of the gravitational reference sensors due to routine maintenances and unexpected environmental or instrumental issues. To effectively mitigate such anomalies and thereby enhance the robustness and reliability of the scientific outputs, we suggest to employ the ``position noise suppressing'' time delay interferometry channels. Through analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that these time delay interferometry channels can suppress data anomalies by more than 2 orders of magnitude within the sensitive band of 0.1 mHz - 0.05 Hz, while still remaining sensitive to most of the target signals. Compared with existing researches that focus on reconstructing and subtracting data anomalies, our method does not rely on the prior knowledge about the models of anomalies. Furthermore, the potential application scenarios of these channels have also been explored.</description>
