      <title>General Lotto Games with Scouts: Information versus Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce General Lotto games with Scouts: a General Lotto game with asymmetric information. There are two players, Red and Blue, who both allocate resources to a field. However, scouting capabilities afford Blue to gain information, with some probability, on the number of Red's resources before allocating his own. We derive optimal strategies for this game in the case of a single field. In addition we provide upper and lower bounds of the value of the game in a multi-stage case with multiple battlefields. We devise several ways to characterise the influence of information versus strength. We conclude by drawing qualitative insights from these characterisations and the game values, and draw parallels with military practice.</description>

      <title>Design and Characterization of Strategy-Proof Mechanisms for Two-Facility Game on a Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the problem of placing two facilities along a linear space to serve a group of agents. Each agent is committed to minimizing the distance between her location and the closest facility. A mechanism is an algorithm that maps the reported agent locations to the facility locations. We are interested in mechanisms without money that are deterministic, strategy-proof, and provide a bounded approximation ratio for social cost.
  It is a fundamental problem to characterize the family of strategy-proof mechanisms with a bounded approximation ratio. Fotakis and Tzamos already demonstrated that the deterministic strategy-proof mechanisms for the 2-facility game problem are mechanisms with a unique dictator and the leftmost-rightmost mechanism. In this paper, we first present a more refined characterization of the first family.
  We then reveal three new classes of strategy-proof mechanisms that show the intricacy of structure within this family. This helps us get a more complete picture of the characterization of the 2-facility game problem, and may also have value in understanding and solving more general facility allocation game problems.
  Besides, based on our refined characterization, we surprisingly find that prediction cannot effectively improve the performance of the mechanism in the two-facility game problem, while this methodology to overcome bad approximation ratio works in many other mechanism design problems. We show that if we require that the mechanism admits a bounded approximation ratio when the prediction is arbitrarily bad, then at the same time, the mechanism can never achieve sublinear approximation ratios even with perfect prediction.</description>

      <title>Optimal Stopping with Interdependent Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online selection problems in both the prophet and secretary settings, when arriving agents have interdependent values. In the interdependent values model, introduced in the seminal work of Milgrom and Weber [1982], each agent has a private signal and the value of an agent is a function of the signals held by all agents. Results in online selection crucially rely on some degree of independence of values, which is conceptually at odds with the interdependent values model. For prophet and secretary models under the standard independent values assumption, prior works provide constant factor approximations to the welfare. On the other hand, when agents have interdependent values, prior works in Economics and Computer Science provide truthful mechanisms that obtain optimal and approximately optimal welfare under certain assumptions on the valuation functions.
  We bring together these two important lines of work and provide the first constant factor approximations for prophet and secretary problems with interdependent values. We consider both the algorithmic setting, where agents are non-strategic (but have interdependent values), and the mechanism design setting with strategic agents. All our results are constructive and use simple stopping rules.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design for ZK-Rollup Prover Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ZK-Rollups, provers spend significant computational resources to generate validity proofs. Their costs should be compensated properly, so a sustainable prover market can form over time. Existing transaction fee mechanisms (TFMs) such as EIP-1559, however, do not work in this setting, as EIP-1559 only generates negligible revenue because of burning, while provers often create or purchase specialized hardware in hopes of creating long-term revenue from proving, somewhat reminiscent of proof-of-work miners in the case of chains like Bitcoin. In this paper, we explore the design of transaction fee mechanisms for prover markets. The desiderata for such mechanisms include efficiency (social welfare is maximized), incentive compatibility (dominant bidding strategy exists), collusion resistance (no profitable collusion among provers exists), and off-chain agreement proofness (no profitable collusion between users and provers exists). This paper presents a prover market mechanism called Proo{\phi} (pronounced proo-fee), and show the conditions under which it can satisfy these desired properties. In our mechanism, the users bid their fee for transaction inclusion, and the user transactions are selected through a first-price auction; the provers bid their proof generation capacity and cost, and the lowest-cost provers are selected. We add an upper bound of the total capacity of the included transactions each round to forestall off-chain agreements. Proo{\phi} is Bayesian incentive compatible for users and off-chain agreement proof, and is also incentive-compatible for provers, when assuming the latter cannot employ Sybil attacks. We present a preliminary analysis of the Proo{\phi} mechanism and its limitations, and raise open questions about the feasibility of an ideal mechanism for prover markets. This work is in progress, and this manuscript will be updated.</description>

      <title>Permissible extensions of classical to quantum games combining three strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the extension of classical games to the quantum domain, generated by the addition of one unitary strategy to two classical strategies of each player. The conditions that need to be met by unitary operations to ensure that the extended game is invariant with respect to the isomorphic transformations of the input game are determined. It has been shown that there are three types of these extensions, two of them are purely quantum. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that the extensions of two versions of the same classical game by a unitary operator that does not meet these conditions may result in quantum games that are non-equivalent, e.g. having different Nash equilibria. We use the obtained results to extend the classical Prisoner's Dilemma game to a quantum game that has a unique Nash equilibrium closer to Pareto-optimal solutions than the original one.</description>

      <title>Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problems with Mixed-Integer Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.13298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider generalized Nash equilibrium problems (GNEPs) with non-convex strategy spaces and non-convex cost functions. This general class of games includes the important case of games with mixed-integer variables for which only a few results are known in the literature. We present a new approach to characterize equilibria via a convexification technique using the Nikaido-Isoda function. To any given instance of the GNEP, we construct a set of convexified instances and show that a feasible strategy profile is an equilibrium for the original instance if and only if it is an equilibrium for any convexified instance and the convexified cost functions coincide with the initial ones. We develop this convexification approach along three dimensions: We first show that for quasi-linear models, where a convexified instance exists in which for fixed strategies of the opponent players, the cost function of every player is linear and the respective strategy space is polyhedral, the convexification reduces the GNEP to a standard (non-linear) optimization problem. Secondly, we derive two complete characterizations of those GNEPs for which the convexification leads to a jointly constrained or a jointly convex GNEP, respectively. These characterizations require new concepts related to the interplay of the convex hull operator applied to restricted subsets of feasible strategies and may be interesting on their own. Note that this characterization is also computationally relevant as jointly convex GNEPs have been extensively studied in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our results by presenting a numerical study regarding the computation of equilibria for three classes of GNEPs related to integral network flows and discrete market equilibria.</description>

      <title>Fair integer programming under dichotomous and cardinal preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One cannot make truly fair decisions using integer linear programs unless one controls the selection probabilities of the (possibly many) optimal solutions. For this purpose, we propose a unified framework when binary decision variables represent agents with dichotomous preferences, who only care about whether they are selected in the final solution. We develop several general-purpose algorithms to fairly select optimal solutions, for example, by maximizing the Nash product or the minimum selection probability, or by using a random ordering of the agents as a selection criterion (Random Serial Dictatorship). We also discuss in detail how to extend the proposed methods when agents have cardinal preferences. As such, we embed the black-box procedure of solving an integer linear program into a framework that is explainable from start to finish. Lastly, we evaluate the proposed methods on two specific applications, namely kidney exchange (dichotomous preferences), and the scheduling problem of minimizing total tardiness on a single machine (cardinal preferences). We find that while the methods maximizing the Nash product or the minimum selection probability outperform the other methods on the evaluated welfare criteria, methods such as Random Serial Dictatorship perform reasonably well in computation times that are similar to those of finding a single optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Leadership Inference for Multi-Agent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effectively predicting intent and behavior requires inferring leadership in multi-agent interactions. Dynamic games provide an expressive theoretical framework for modeling these interactions. Employing this framework, we propose a novel method to infer the leader in a two-agent game by observing the agents' behavior in complex, long-horizon interactions. We make two contributions. First, we introduce an iterative algorithm that solves dynamic two-agent Stackelberg games with nonlinear dynamics and nonquadratic costs, and demonstrate that it consistently converges. Second, we propose the Stackelberg Leadership Filter (SLF), an online method for identifying the leading agent in interactive scenarios based on observations of the game interactions. We validate the leadership filter's efficacy on simulated driving scenarios to demonstrate that the SLF can draw conclusions about leadership that match right-of-way expectations.</description>
