      <title>Low Cost, Fair, and Representative Committees in a Metric Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a representative committee of $k$ agents from a collection of $n$ agents in a common metric space. This problem is related to choosing $k$ facilities in facility location and $k$-median problems. However, unlike in more traditional facility location where each agent only cares about the closest selected facility, in the settings we consider each agent desires that all selected committee members are close to them. More precisely, we look at the sum objective, in which the goal is to minimize the total distance from all agents to all members of the chosen committee. We show that it is always possible to find a committee which is both low-cost according to this objective, and also fair according to many existing notions of fairness and proportionality defined for clustering settings. Moreover, we introduce a new desirable axiom for representative committees we call NORP, which prevents over-representation of any subset of agents. While all existing algorithms for fair committee selection do not satisfy this intuitive property, we provide new algorithms which form simultaneously low-cost, fair, and NORP solutions, thus showing that it is always possible to form low-cost, fair, and representative committees for our settings.</description>

      <title>Instance-Adaptive Hypothesis Tests with Heterogeneous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study hypothesis testing over a heterogeneous population of strategic agents with private information. Any single test applied uniformly across the population yields statistical error that is sub-optimal relative to the performance of an oracle given access to the private information. We show how it is possible to design menus of statistical contracts that pair type-optimal tests with payoff structures, inducing agents to self-select according to their private information. This separating menu elicits agent types and enables the principal to match the oracle performance even without a priori knowledge of the agent type. Our main result fully characterizes the collection of all separating menus that are instance-adaptive, matching oracle performance for an arbitrary population of heterogeneous agents. We identify designs where information elicitation is essentially costless, requiring negligible additional expense relative to a single-test benchmark, while improving statistical performance. Our work establishes a connection between proper scoring rules and menu design, showing how the structure of the hypothesis test constrains the elicitable information. Numerical examples illustrate the geometry of separating menus and the improvements they deliver in error trade-offs. Overall, our results connect statistical decision theory with mechanism design, demonstrating how heterogeneity and strategic participation can be harnessed to improve efficiency in hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Shift Bribery over Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In shift bribery, a briber seeks to promote his preferred candidate by paying voters to raise their ranking. Classical models of shift bribery assume voters act independently, overlooking the role of social influence. However, in reality, individuals are social beings and are often represented as part of a social network, where bribed voters may influence their neighbors, thereby amplifying the effect of persuasion. We study Shift bribery over Networks, where voters are modeled as nodes in a directed weighted graph, and arcs represent social influence between them. In this setting, bribery is not confined to directly targeted voters its effects can propagate through the network, influencing neighbors and amplifying persuasion. Given a budget and individual cost functions for shifting each voter's preference toward a designated candidate, the goal is to determine whether a shift strategy exists within budget that ensures the preferred candidate wins after both direct and network-propagated influence takes effect. We show that the problem is NP-Complete even with two candidates and unit costs, and W[2]-hard when parameterized by budget or maximum degree. On the positive side, we design polynomial-time algorithms for complete graphs under plurality and majority rules and path graphs for uniform edge weights, linear-time algorithms for transitive tournaments for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights, and pseudo-polynomial algorithms for cluster graphs. We further prove the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with treewidth as parameter for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights and pseudo-FPT with cluster vertex deletion number for two candidates and uniform arc weights. Together, these results give a detailed complexity landscape for shift bribery in social networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study auctions that are robust at any scale, i.e., they can be applied to sell both expensive and cheap items and achieve the best multiplicative approximations of the optimal revenue in the worst case. We show that the optimal mechanism is scale invariant, which randomizes between selling at the second-price and a 2.45 multiple of the second-price.</description>

      <title>Scalable Neural Incentive Design with Parameterized Mean-Field Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing incentives for a multi-agent system to induce a desirable Nash equilibrium is both a crucial and challenging problem appearing in many decision-making domains, especially for a large number of agents $N$. Under the exchangeability assumption, we formalize this incentive design (ID) problem as a parameterized mean-field game (PMFG), aiming to reduce complexity via an infinite-population limit. We first show that when dynamics and rewards are Lipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate $\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous setting, we prove the same $\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the important special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in dynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel approximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive Design (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated equilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting approximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful, scalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID. Across diverse auction settings, the proposed AMID method substantially increases revenue over first-price formats and outperforms existing benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Privacy Guarantee for Nash Equilibrium Computation of Aggregative Games Based on Pointwise Maximal Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy preservation has served as a key metric in designing Nash equilibrium (NE) computation algorithms. Although differential privacy (DP) has been widely employed for privacy guarantees, it does not exploit prior distributional knowledge of datasets and is ineffective in assessing information leakage for correlated datasets. To address these concerns, we establish a pointwise maximal leakage (PML) framework when computing NE in aggregative games. By incorporating prior knowledge of players' cost function datasets, we obtain a precise and computable upper bound of privacy leakage with PML guarantees. In the entire view, we show PML refines DP by offering a tighter privacy guarantee, enabling flexibility in designing NE computation. Also, in the individual view, we reveal that the lower bound of PML can exceed the upper bound of DP by constructing specific correlated datasets. The results emphasize that PML is a more proper privacy measure than DP since the latter fails to adequately capture privacy leakage in correlated datasets. Moreover, we conduct experiments with adversaries who attempt to infer players' private information to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Rationalizable Screening and Disclosure under Unawareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a principal-agent procurement problem in which the principal (she) is unaware some of the marginal cost types of the agent (he). Communication arises naturally as some types of the agent may have an incentive to raise the principal's awareness (totally or partially) before a contract menu is offered. The resulting menu must not only reflect the principal's change in awareness, but also her learning about types from the agent's decision to raise her awareness in the first place. We capture this reasoning in a discrete concave model via a rationalizability procedure in which marginal beliefs over types are restricted to log-concavity, ``reverse'' Bayesianism, and mild assumptions of caution.
  We show that if the principal is ex ante only unaware of high-cost types, all of these types have an incentive raise her awareness of them -- otherwise, they would not be served. With three types, the two lower-cost types that the principal is initially aware of also want to raise her awareness of the high-cost type: Their quantities suffer no additional distortions and they both earn an extra information rent. Intuitively, the presence of an even higher cost type makes the original two look better. With more than three types, we show that this intuition may break down for types of whom the principal is initially aware of so that raising the principal's awareness could cease to be profitable for those types. When the principal is ex ante only unaware of more efficient (low-cost) types, then \textit{no type} raises her awareness, leaving her none the wiser.</description>

      <title>Discrete Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a principal who wishes to screen an agent with \emph{discrete} types by offering a menu of \emph{discrete} quantities and \emph{discrete} transfers. We assume that the principal's valuation is discrete strictly concave and use a discrete first-order approach. We model the agent's cost types as non-integer, with integer types as a limit case. Our modeling of cost types allows us to replicate the typical constraint-simplification results and thus to emulate the well-treaded steps of screening under a continuum of contracts.
  We show that the solutions to the discrete F.O.C.s need not be unique \textit{even under discrete strict concavity}, but we also show that there cannot be more than two optimal contract quantities for each type, and that -- if there are two -- they must be adjacent. Moreover, we can only ensure weak monotonicity of the quantities \textit{even if virtual costs are strictly monotone}, unless we limit the ``degree of concavity'' of the principal's utility. Our discrete screening approach facilitates the use of rationalizability to solve the screening problem. We introduce a rationalizability notion featuring robustness with respect to an open set of beliefs over types called \textit{$\Delta$-O Rationalizability}, and show that the set of $\Delta$-O rationalizable menus coincides with the set of usual optimal contracts -- possibly augmented to include irrelevant contracts.</description>

      <title>Online Learning for Dynamic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves Mechanism in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon average-reward Markov decision process (MDP). In each round, the seller determines an allocation and sets a payment for each bidder, while each bidder receives a private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition kernel and the seller's allocation policy without episodic resets. We first extend the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to sequential auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic counterpart that preserves the desired properties: efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality. We then focus on the online setting and develop a reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying MDP and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG mechanism. We show that the learned mechanism approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality and achieves guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Economic Impacts of AI Openness Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, encourage openness of general-purpose AI models by offering legal exemptions for "open-source" models. Despite this legislative attention on openness, the definition of open-source foundation models remains ambiguous. This paper models the strategic interactions among the creator of a general-purpose model (the generalist) and the entity that fine-tunes the general-purpose model to a specialized domain or task (the specialist), in response to regulatory requirements on model openness. We present a stylized model of the regulator's choice of an open-source definition to evaluate which AI openness standards will establish appropriate economic incentives for developers. Our results characterize market equilibria -- specifically, upstream model release decisions and downstream fine-tuning efforts -- under various openness regulations and present a range of effective regulatory penalties and open-source thresholds. Overall, we find the model's baseline performance determines when increasing the regulatory penalty vs. the open-source threshold will significantly alter the generalist's release strategy. Our model provides a theoretical foundation for AI governance decisions around openness and enables evaluation and refinement of practical open-source policies.</description>

      <title>Fair Combinatorial Auction for Blockchain Trade Intents: Being Fair without Knowing What is Fair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study blockchain trade-intent auctions, which currently intermediate about USD 10 billion in trades each month. These auctions are combinatorial because executing multiple trade intents jointly generates additional efficiencies. However, the auctioneer cannot observe what each trader would have received had its order been auctioned individually and hence cannot determine how these efficiencies should be shared. We compare the two dominant mechanisms - batch auctions and simultaneous individual auctions - and introduce a novel definition of fairness applicable to combinatorial auctions. We then propose a fair combinatorial auction that endogenously constructs a fairness benchmark from individual bids and a counterfactual mechanism. Whether fairness guarantees arise in equilibrium depends on the counterfactual: all traders receive more in the equilibrium of the fair combinatorial auction than in the equilibrium of the counterfactual mechanism when the counterfactual is simultaneous first-price auctions, but that may not be the case if the counterfactual is simultaneous second-price auctions.</description>

      <title>Improved Regret and Contextual Linear Extension for Pandora's Box and Prophet Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Pandora's Box problem in an online learning setting with semi-bandit feedback. In each round, the learner sequentially pays to open up to $n$ boxes with unknown reward distributions, observes rewards upon opening, and decides when to stop. The utility of the learner is the maximum observed reward minus the cumulative cost of opened boxes, and the goal is to minimize regret defined as the gap between the cumulative expected utility and that of the optimal policy. We propose a new algorithm that achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{nT})$ regret after $T$ rounds, which improves the $\widetilde{O}(n\sqrt{T})$ bound of Agarwal et al. [2024] and matches the known lower bound up to logarithmic factors. To better capture real-life applications, we then extend our results to a natural but challenging contextual linear setting, where each box's expected reward is linear in some known but time-varying $d$-dimensional context and the noise distribution is fixed over time. We design an algorithm that learns both the linear function and the noise distributions, achieving $\widetilde{O}(nd\sqrt{T})$ regret. Finally, we show that our techniques also apply to the online Prophet Inequality problem, where the learner must decide immediately whether or not to accept a revealed reward. In both non-contextual and contextual settings, our approach achieves similar improvements and regret bounds.</description>

      <title>On the Universal Near Optimality of Hedge in Combinatorial Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the classical Hedge algorithm in combinatorial settings. In each round, the learner selects a vector $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a set $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\boldsymbol{y}_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\langle \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_t \rangle \in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems, including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\big(\sqrt{T \log |X|}\big)$ after $T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\sqrt{\log d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\Omega\big(\sqrt{T \log(|X|)/\log d}\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of combinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\log d \leq m \leq \sqrt{d}$--for which this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by a factor of exactly $\sqrt{\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical $K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD) algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret guarantees for DAGs.</description>
