      <title>Expanding the parameter space of 2002es-like type Ia supernovae: on the underluminous ASASSN-20jq / SN 2020qxp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the peculiar Type Ia supernova ASASSN-20jq/SN 2020qxp. It is a low-luminosity object with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B=-17.1\pm0.5$ mag. Despite its low luminosity, its post-peak light-curve decline rate ($\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.35\pm0.09$ mag) and color-stretch parameter (sBV&gt;0.82) are similar to normal SNe Ia, making it an outlier in the luminosity-width and luminosity-color-stretch relations. Early light curves suggest a "bump" during the first 1.4 days of explosion. ASASSN-20jq synthesized a low radioactive $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.09\pm0.01M_\odot$. Near-maximum light spectra reveal strong Si II absorption lines, indicating a cooler photosphere than normal SNe Ia, but lack Ti II absorption lines. Unusually strong O I $\lambda$7773 and Ca II near-infrared triplet absorption features are present. Nebular spectra show a strong, narrow forbidden [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291,7324 doublet emission, rarely seen in SNe Ia except in some Type Iax events. Marginal detection of [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300,6364 doublet emission, which is extremely rare, is observed. Both [Ca II] and [O I] lines are redshifted by $\sim2000$ km/s. A strong [Fe II] $\lambda$7155 emission line with a tilted-top profile, identical to the [Fe II] $\lambda$16433 profile, is also observed. These asymmetric [Fe II] profiles and redshifted [Ca II] and [O I] emissions suggest a high central density white dwarf progenitor undergoing an off-center delayed-detonation explosion mechanism, producing roughly equal amounts of $^{56}$Ni in deflagration and detonation phases. This distinguishes ASASSN-20jq from normal and subluminous SNe Ia. ASASSN-20jq's light curve and spectra do not align with any single SNe Ia subclass but show similarities to 2002es-like objects. Thus, we add it as an extreme candidate within the heterogeneous parameter space of 2002es-like SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Accretion disc winds imprint distinct signatures in the optical variability spectrum of black hole transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the variability, measured as the root mean square (rms), of accreting systems as a function of energy is a powerful tool for constraining the physical properties of these objects. Here, we present the first application of this method to optical spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries. We use high-time-resolution data of the black hole transient V404 Cygni, obtained with the \textit{Gran Telescopio Canarias} during its 2015 outburst. During this event, conspicuous wind-related features, such as P-Cygni profiles, were detected in the flux spectra. We find that rms spectra are rich in spectral features, although they are typically morphologically different from their flux counterparts. Specifically, we typically observe absorption components in correspondence to the presence of emission lines in the flux spectra. Similarly, when analysing segments with significant variability in the optical flux, P-Cygni line profiles appear inverted in the rms spectra (i.e., enhanced variability in the blue-shifted region, accompanied by a decrease in that associated with the red component). We discuss the possible origin of these features, which resemble those found in other objects, such as active galactic nuclei. Finally, we highlight the potential of this technique for future searches for wind-type outflows in accreting compact objects.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and particle acceleration in astrophysical jets with velocity and magnetic shear: Interaction of Kelvin-Helmholtz and Drift-Kink Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 2D particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized, collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical for astrophysical black-hole jet-wind boundaries. We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and Drift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden. We find that DKI can effectively disrupt the cats-eye vortices generated by KHI, creating a turbulent shear layer on the DK timescale. This interplay leads to a significant enhancement of dissipation over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we observe efficient nonthermal particle acceleration caused by the alignment of the instability-driven electric fields with Speiser-like motion of particles close to the shear interface. This study highlights the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple simultaneous instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Classics: On the Statistics of Dust Formation in Novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While nova eruptions produce some of the most common and dramatic dust formation episodes among astrophysical transients, the demographics of dust-forming novae remain poorly understood. Here, we present a statistical study of dust formation in 40 novae with high-quality optical/IR light curves, quantitatively distinguishing dust-forming from non-dust-forming novae while exploring the properties of the dust events. We find that 50-70% of novae produce dust, significantly higher than previous estimates. Dust-forming novae can be separated from those that do not show dust formation by using the largest redward ($V-K$) colour change from peak visible brightness; ($V-J$) or ($V-H$) offer useful but less sensitive constraints. This makes optical+IR photometry a powerful tool to quantify dust formation in novae. We find that novae detected in GeV $\gamma$-rays by \emph{Fermi}-LAT appear to form dust more often than novae not detected by \emph{Fermi}, implying a possible connection between $\gamma$-ray producing shocks and dust production. We also find that novae that evolve very quickly ($t_2 &lt; 10$ days) are much less likely to form dust, in agreement with previous findings. We confirm a correlation between $t_2$ and the time of the onset of dust formation (which occurs $\sim$1 week--3 months after maximum light), but conclude that it is primarily an observational artifact driven by dust formation determining when a nova drops 2 mag below peak. The significant fraction of novae that form dust make them ideal laboratories in our Galactic backyard to tackle the puzzle of dust formation around explosive transients.</description>

      <title>eRO-ExTra: eROSITA extragalactic non-AGN X-ray transients and variables in eRASS1 and eRASS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) While previous X-ray studies showed the dominance of regular active galactic nuclei (AGN) variability, a small fraction of sources arise from more exotic phenomena such as tidal disruption events (TDEs), quasi-periodic eruptions, or other short-lived events associated with supermassive black hole accretion. This paper describes the systematic selection of X-ray extragalactic transients found in the first two eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS) that are not associated with known AGN prior to eROSITA observations. We generated a variability sample from eRASS1 and eRASS2 (Dec. 2019-Dec. 2020), which includes sources with a variability significance and a fractional amplitude larger than four, located in the Legacy Survey DR10 (LS10) footprint. The properties of LS10 counterparts were used to exclude stars and known AGN. The sample was additionally cleaned using pre-eROSITA classifications, archival optical spectra, and archival X-ray data. The final catalog eRO-ExTra includes 304 extragalactic eROSITA transients and variables not associated with known AGN. More than 90% of sources have reliable LS10 optical counterparts. For each source, we provide archival X-ray data from Swift, ROSAT, and XMM-Newton; the eROSITA long-term light curve (2-2.5 years) with a light curve classification; as well as the best power law fit spectral results at the peak eROSITA epoch. Reliable spectroscopic and photometric redshifts are provided for more than 80% of the sample. Several sources in the catalog are known TDE candidates discovered by eROSITA. In addition, 31 sources are radio detected. The eRO-ExTra transients constitute a relatively clean parent sample of non-AGN variability phenomena associated with massive black holes. More than 95% of eRO-ExTra sources were discovered in X-rays with eROSITA for the first time, which makes it a valuable resource for studying unique nuclear transients.</description>

      <title>Constrain the GRB jet opening angle based on the very steep decay phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the rapid follow-up observations by \textit{Swift}/XRT, a good part of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) high latitude emission have been observed in X-ray band. Some of them even show a dropdown decay after this period, which strongly indicates the edge of the jet is corresponding to the breaking time. This study constrains the jet opening angles of GRBs by analyzing the very steep decay phase in the early X-ray afterglow. Using data from \textit{Swift}/XRT, we identified GRBs with significant breaks in their light curves and applied a broken power-law model to describe the decay phases. Assuming a spherical and isotropic emitting surface, we set constraints on the radiation radius ($R_{\gamma}$) to estimate jet opening angles ($\theta_{\rm jet}$) from the breaking time. Our results indicate that jet opening angles can be constrained, although they are sensitive to the assumed radiation radius. This approach provides yet another method for estimating GRB jet opening angles.</description>

      <title>Searching the non-accreting white dwarf population in eROSITA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: eROSITA is the soft X-ray instrument aboard the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) satellite that is most sensitive in the energy range between 0.2 and 2.3 keV. Between December 2019 and December 2021, eROSITA completed four all-sky surveys producing all-sky X-ray source lists and sky maps of unprecedented depth. In the energy range between 0.2 keV and 1 keV, we detected about 38,000 sources with a hardness ratio below -0.94, covering a small sample of known white dwarfs found with eROSITA in the dataset to which the German eROSITA consortium has rights (half sky). 264 of these soft sources have a probability of more than 90 % to be a white dwarf. This is more than the 175 white dwarfs ROSAT found in the whole sky. Here we present the results of a pilot study to increase the sensitivity of eROSITA for soft sources by extending the detection threshold down to 0.1 keV. First tests with dedicated sky regions are promising.</description>

      <title>Spectral Study of Aql~X-1 during \textit{Pulse-on} and \textit{Pulse-off} Stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed spectral study of an intermittent-AMXP Aql X-1 during the \textit{pulse-on} and \textit{pulse-off} stages by using the archival RXTE data. We first perform temporal analysis by using Z$_n^2$ technique in three different energy bands, 3.0 -- 13.0~keV, 13.0 -- 23.0~keV and 23.0 -- 33.0~keV, for the last 128~s time segment of the RXTE data including \textit{pulse-on} region. We show that the pulse is the most significant in the softest band. We, then, show that the spectrum is represented the best via combination of absorbed blackbody, disk blackbody and a gaussian line. We modeled the last four segments of the data 30188-03-05-00 to better compare \textit{pulse-on} and \textit{pulse-off} stages. We found a vague residual in the spectral fit of the \textit{pulse-on} segment between $\sim$3.0 -- 13.0~keV which agrees with the result of temporal analysis. We show that the residual may be represented with an extra blackbody component with the temperature of 1.75~keV and the radius of 0.75$\pm$0.49 km. For deeper analysis, we performed phase-resolved spectroscopy to the last 128~s, \textit{pulse-on}, segment. We obtain two separate spectra for the spin phase range of 0.75 -- 0.25, \textit{pulse-high} and 0.25 -- 0.75, \textit{pulse-low} and followed the same procedure. We display that the residual becomes more clear for \textit{pulse-high} compared to the \textit{pulse-low}. We report that the additional blackbody component, which models the residual, indicates a hotspot from the surface of the neutron star with the radius of 1.65$\pm$0.74 km whose temperature is 1.65 keV.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear coupling between magnetar QPOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the tails of magnetar giant $\gamma$-ray flares have long been interpreted as normal oscillation modes of these stars. However, most studies modelling QPOs have neglected some key features in the analyses of the signals, namely that QPOs appear to be detectable only intermittently and exhibit drifts in their frequencies. These are typical characteristics of nonlinear mode coupling, where, at leading order, the modes couple and evolve collectively as triplets. Using a representative triplet of modes we solve the system's nonlinear equations of motion analytically and argue that the coupling is likely axial-axial-polar in nature, with the observed intermittence and frequency drifts providing a way to infer details of the magnetar's internal magnetic-field geometry.</description>

      <title>Resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics without Amperes Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive magnetohydrodynamics is thought to play a key role in transient astrophysical phenomena such as black hole flares and neutron star magnetospheres. When performing numerical simulations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics, one is faced with the issue that Amperes law becomes stiff in the high conductivity limit which poses challenges to the numerical evolution. We show that using a description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics based on higher form symmetry, one can perform simulations with a generalized dual Faraday tensor without having to use Amperes Law, thereby avoiding the stiffness problem. We also explain the relation of this dual model to a traditional description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics and how causality is guaranteed by introducing second order corrections.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark matter annihilating into light-long-lived mediators from stars inside dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several astrophysical and cosmological observations suggest the existence of dark matter (DM) through its gravitational effects, yet its nature remains elusive. Despite the lack of DM signals from direct detection experiments, efforts continue to focus on the indirect detection of DM from DM-rich astrophysical objects. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are among the most promising targets for such searches. In this work, we aim to investigate the expected DM capture rate from the stellar component of 10 nearby DM-rich dSphs, assuming that the accumulated DM eventually annihilates into light, long-lived mediators (LLLMs) which decay into gamma rays outside the dSphs. We analyze nearly 16 years of {\it Fermi}-LAT data to search for DM annihilation through LLLMs, and, from the observed stacked flux upper limits, set limits on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section using model-independent methods. Additionally, we incorporate the Sommerfeld Enhancement (SE) effect into the DM annihilation process, obtaining bounds on the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section of $\sim~10^{-36} {\rm cm}^2$ for DM masses around 100 GeV. This allows us to explore an alternative avenue for exploring DM phenomena from dSphs and compare our results with the bounds reported by direct DM detection experiments and other celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>Generally relativistic description of fast magnetic reconnection induced by thermal electromotive force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many theoretical models were come up with to figure out the properties of magnetic reconnection process, among which the Sweet-Parker model is the most famous since it describes the magnetic reconnection in a concise way. However, the low reconnection rate expected by this model is generally not available in most astrophysical systems, which motivates people to seek fast reconnection models. Under the scheme of generalized magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for pair plasma, a fast magnetic reconnection model was established, in which the thermal electromotive force plays a key role to remarkably increase the reconnection rate. In this work, I would like to extend the discussions in my previous work, about the generally relativistic description of Sweet-Parker model, to the description of fast magnetic reconnection induced by thermal electromotive force. I will revisit the fast reconnection model briefly to initialize my discussions and show how the thermal electromotive force impacts the reconnection rate. Next, some basic setups will be exhibited before discussing specific examples about how the properties of fast magnetic reconnection are modified by gravitational effect or in observations. Results in this work consolidate my opinion reiterated in my previous work that properties of magnetic reconnection would never be modified by gravitational effect significantly if the magnetic reconnection process occurs in a local scale while the modifications of properties could not be neglected when the process is detected by an observer who is moving with respect to the laboratory, in the rest frame of which the magnetic reconnection occurs.</description>

      <title>The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey: Deep Fields Data Release 2. I. The ELAIS-N1 field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the final 6'' resolution data release of the ELAIS-N1 field from the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields project (LoTSS Deep). The 144MHz images are the most sensitive achieved to date at this frequency and were created from 290 TB of data obtained from 505 hrs on-source observations taken over 7.5 years. The data were processed following the strategies developed for previous LoTSS and LoTSS Deep data releases. The resulting images span 24.53 square degrees and, using a refined source detection approach, we identified 154,952 radio sources formed from 182,184 Gaussian components within this area. The maps reach a noise level of 10.7 $\mu$Jy/beam at 6'' resolution where approximately half of the noise is due to source confusion. In about 7.4% of the image our limited dynamic range around bright sources results in a further &gt; 5% increase in the noise. The images have a flux density scale accuracy of about 9% and the standard deviation of offsets between our source positions and those from Pan-STARRS is 0.2'' in RA and Dec for high significance detections. We searched individual epoch images for variable sources, identifying 39 objects with considerable variation. We also searched for circularly polarised sources achieving three detections of previously known emitters (two stars and one pulsar) whilst constraining the typical polarisation fraction plus leakage to be less than 0.045%.</description>

      <title>Scalable Discovery of Fundamental Physical Laws: Learning Magnetohydrodynamics from 3D Turbulence Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of dynamical models from data represents a crucial step in advancing our understanding of physical systems. Library-based sparse regression has emerged as a powerful method for inferring governing equations directly from spatiotemporal data, but current model-agnostic implementations remain computationally expensive, limiting their applicability to data that lack substantial complexity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a scalable framework that enables efficient discovery of complex dynamical models across a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, by ``discovering'' the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) from synthetic data generated by high-resolution simulations of turbulent MHD flows with viscous and Ohmic dissipation. Using a library of candidate terms that is $\gtrsim 10$ times larger than those in previous studies, we accurately recover the full set of MHD equations, including the subtle dissipative terms that are critical to the dynamics of the system. Our results establish sparse regression as a practical tool for uncovering fundamental physical laws from complex, high-dimensional data without assumptions on the underlying symmetry or the form of any governing equation.</description>

      <title>Non-stop Variability of Sgr A* using JWST at 2.1 and 4.8 micron Wavelengths: Evidence for Distinct Populations of Faint and Bright Variable Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present first results of JWST Cycle 1 and 2 observations of Sgr A* using NIRCam taken simultaneously at 2.1 and 4.8 micron for a total of ~48 hours over seven different epochs in 2023 and 2024. We find correlated variability at 2.1 and 4.8 micron in all epochs, continual short-time scale (a few seconds) variability and epoch-to-epoch variable emission implying long-term ( ~days to months) variability of Sgr A*. A highlight of this analysis is the evidence for sub-minute, horizon-scale time variability of Sgr A*, probing inner accretion disk size scales. The power spectra of the light curves in each observing epoch also indicate long-term variable emission. With continuous observations, JWST data suggest that the flux of Sgr A* is fluctuating constantly. The flux density correlation exhibits a distinct break in the slope at ~3 mJy at 2.1 micron. The analysis indicates two different processes contributing to the variability of Sgr A*. Brighter emission trends towards shallower spectral indices than the fainter emission. Cross correlation of the light curves indicates for the first time, a time delay of 3 - 40 sec in the 4.8 micron variability with respect to 2.1 micron. This phase shift leads to loops in plots of flux density vs spectral index as the emission rises and falls. Modeling suggests that the synchrotron emission from the evolving, age-stratified electron population reproduces the shape of the observed light curves with a direct estimate of the magnetic field strengths in the range between 40-90 G, and upper cutoff energy, E_c, between 420 and 720 MeV.</description>

      <title>TransientVerse: A Comprehensive Real-Time Alert and Multi-Wavelength Analysis System for Transient Astronomical Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transient astrophysical events are characterized by short timescales, high energy, and multi-wavelength radiation, often accompanied by violent energy releases. These phenomena are a major focus of modern astronomical research. To reveal their underlying physical mechanisms, near-real-time, multi-wavelength, and multi-messenger follow-up observations are essential. However, current transient alert systems face multiple challenges, including fragmented messages, inconsistent formats, and difficulties in retrospective analysis, all of which hinder the efficiency of triggering observations. This paper presents \textbf{TransientVerse}, an innovative real-time database platform to integrate and disseminate transient alerts. The platform uses an automated pipeline to integrate real-time alerts from multiple sources (e.g., ATel, VOEvent, and GCN). It structures unstructured text data into a dual-format database for transient alerts by using open-source large language models. TransientVerse offers retrospective searches, data visualization, literature reviews, and customized subscriptions for efficient event tracking and analysis. Additionally, for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), the platform provides real-time statistics on repeat burst rates across different time intervals and alerts astronomers about high-frequency burst sources, enabling rapid follow-up observations and optimizing the use of limited observation windows. TransientVerse improves the efficiency of acquiring transient events in real time, lowers the technical barriers for simultaneous observations, and provides robust technical support for multi-wavelength, multi-messenger time-domain astronomy and astrophysics studies.</description>

      <title>Corrections to the Black hole entropy from a Bose Einstein condensate: a semi-classical phenomenological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain logarithmic corrections to the black hole entropy. Motivated by our recent proposal concerning the nature of the degrees of freedom leading to the black hole entropy in terms of a Bose Einstein (BEC) condensate of gravitons, we study how to introduce logarithmic corrections. In fact we show that, after modifying the internal energy by means of simple by physically sound arguments dictated by ordinary quantum mechanics and possible non-commutative effects at Planckian scales, a logarithmic term does appear in the Bekenstein Hawking entropy law. We also obtain that the entropy $S_{BH}$ of a ball of Planckian areal radius is $2\pi K_B$, i.e. $S_{BH}(R=L_P)=2\pi K_B$. Our approach show that the possibility that the interior of a black hole is composed with a BEC of gravitons is a viable physically motivated possibility.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity Effects on Modeling Dynamic Quantities and Their Correlations in Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we begin by revisiting the oscillatory behavior of radiative quantities-energy, angular momentum, and linear momentum-linked with initial eccentricities in binary black hole (BBH) mergers. By varying the mean anomaly $l_0$ across the parameter range $[0,2\pi]$ from a post-Newtonian perspective, we establish an envelope that encapsulates the oscillations of these radiative quantities. Our analysis reveals that while the oscillations are influenced by the specific initial condition $l_0$, the effect of eccentricity contributes to the formation of this envelope. Subsequently, we model dynamical quantities such as peak luminosity $L_{\text{peak}}$, remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$, spin $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$, and recoil velocity $V_{\text{rem}}$ in circular orbits. Through polynomial modeling, we explore their relationships with mass ratios and correlations. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these polynomials in capturing the intricate relationships and correlations among these quantities in circular orbits. Furthermore, we synthesize and analyze dynamical quantities for both circular and eccentric orbits, revealing continuous variations within specific ranges corresponding to distinct mass ratios. These variations are influenced by continuous changes in initial eccentricity and the associated envelope, which can be extrapolated to encompass other mass ratios. By interpolating the maximum and minimum values of these dynamical quantities, we unveil considerably broad domains relative to circular orbits in both orbital and non-orbital BBH mergers. These domains provide robust constraints on the relationships between dynamical quantities, mass ratios, and their correlations. Finally, we discuss the extension of this eccentricity effect to spin alignment and spin precession configurations of BBHs.</description>

Abstract: The public release of data from the LIGO and Virgo detectors has enabled the identification of potential gravitational wave signals by independent teams using alternative methodologies. In addition to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration's GWTC-3 catalogue there have been several additional works claiming the detection of signals in the data from the first three observing runs. In this paper we present an analysis of these new signals using the same analysis workflow which was used to generate the GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 catalogues published by the LVK, matching the analysis configuration as closely as possible, and we provide our parameter estimation results in a format comparable to those of the GWTC-3 data release. We also include a discussion of the workflow developed for this analysis.</description>

      <title>GRB Redshift Classifier to Follow-up High-Redshift GRBs Using Supervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are intense, short-lived bursts of gamma-ray radiation observed up to a high redshift ($z \sim 10$) due to their luminosities. Thus, they can serve as cosmological tools to probe the early Universe. However, we need a large sample of high$-z$ GRBs, currently limited due to the difficulty in securing time at the large aperture Telescopes. Thus, it is painstaking to determine quickly whether a GRB is high$z$ or low$-z$, which hampers the possibility of performing rapid follow-up observations. Previous efforts to distinguish between high$-$ and low$-z$ GRBs using GRB properties and machine learning (ML) have resulted in limited sensitivity. In this study, we aim to improve this classification by employing an ensemble ML method on 251 GRBs with measured redshifts and plateaus observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Incorporating the plateau phase with the prompt emission, we have employed an ensemble of classification methods to enhance the sensitivity unprecedentedly. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of various classification methods using different redshift thresholds, $z_{threshold}$=$z_t$ at $z_{t}=$ 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5. We achieve a sensitivity of 87\% and 89\% with a balanced sampling for both $z_{t}=3.0$ and $z_{t}=3.5$, respectively, representing a 9\% and 11\% increase in the sensitivity over Random Forest used alone. Overall, the best results are at $z_{t} = 3.5$, where the difference between the sensitivity of the training set and the test set is the smallest. This enhancement of the proposed method paves the way for new and intriguing follow-up observations of high$-z$ GRBs.</description>

      <title>On the Gravitational Wave Counterpart to a Gamma-ray Galactic Center Signal from Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The new tools of gravitational wave and multi-messenger astronomy allow for the study of astrophysical phenomenon in new ways and enables light to be shed on some of the longest-enduring mysteries of high-energy astrophysics. Among the latter stands the Galactic center gamma-ray excess, associated with a source whose nature could be annihilating dark matter or a yet-unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). MSPs are most likely asymmetric about their axis of rotation, and are thus thought to also source quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves, that dark matter processes would not emit. Using statistical methods, we simulate realistic MSP population samples with differing morphology and moment of inertia, that could give rise to the gamma-ray excess, and we compute the corresponding gravitational wave signal amplitude and frequency. We find that the gravitational wave signal frequency likely ranges between $\sim$200 and 1400 Hz, and that the collective dimensionless strain from the center of the Galaxy has an amplitude between $10^{-26}$ and $10^{-24}$, thus most likely beyond current and near-term detectors, unless the unresolved MSPs are extraordinarily gamma-ray dim.</description>

Abstract: We report on the NuSTAR observations of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Swift J174805.3-244637 (hereafter Swift~J17480) and the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR~J17511-3057 performed on March 4, 2023, and April 8, 2015, respectively. We describe the continuum emission of Swift~J17480 with a combination of two soft thermal components and an additional hard X-ray emission described by a power-law. We suggest that the spectral properties of Swift~J17480 are consistent with a soft spectral state. The source IGR~J17511-3057 exhibits a hard spectrum characterized by a Comptonized emission from the corona. The X-ray spectrum of both sources shows evidence of disc reflection. For the first time, we employ the self-consistent reflection models ({\tt relxill} and {\tt relxillNS}) to fit the reflection features in the \nustar{} spectrum. From the best-fit spectral model, we find an inner disc radius ($R_{in}$) is precisely constrained to $(1.99-2.68)\:R_{ISCO}$ and inclination to $30\pm 1\degree$ for Swift~J17480. We determine an inner disc radius of $\lesssim 1.3\;R_{ISCO}$ and inclination of $44\pm 3\degree$ for IGR~J17511-3057. A low inclination angle of the system is required for both sources. For the source IGR~J17511-3057, spinning at $4.1$ ms, the value of co-rotation radius ($R_{co}$) is estimated to be $\sim 42$ km ($3.6\:R_{ISCO})$, consistent with the position of inner disc radius as $R_{in}\lesssim R_{co}$. We further place an upper limit on the magnetic field strength of the sources, considering the disc is truncated at the magnetospheric radius.</description>

      <title>Incidence of afterglow plateaus in gamma-ray bursts associated with binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most surprising gamma-ray burst (GRB) features discovered with the Swift-X ray telescope (XRT) is a plateau phase in the early X-ray afterglow light curves. These plateaus are observed in the majority of long GRBs, while their incidence in short GRBs (SGRBs) is still uncertain due to their fainter X-ray afterglow luminosity with respect to long GRBs. An accurate estimate of the fraction of SGRBs with plateaus is of utmost relevance given the implications that the plateau may have for our understanding of the jet structure and possibly of the nature of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnant. This work presents the results of an extensive data analysis of the largest and most up-to-date sample of short GRBs observed with the XRT, and for which the redshift has been measured. We find a plateau incidence of 18-37% in short GRBs, which is a significantly lower fraction than that measured in long GRBs (&gt;50%). Although still debated, the plateau phase could be explained as energy injection from the spin-down power of a newly born magnetized neutron star (NS; magnetar). We show that this scenario can nicely reproduce the observed short GRB plateaus, while at the same time providing a natural explanation for the different plateau fractions between short and long GRBs. In particular, our findings may imply that only a minority of BNS mergers generating short GRBs leave behind a sufficiently stable or long-lived neutron star (NS) to form a plateau. From the probability distribution of the BNS remnant mass, a fraction 18-37% of short GRB plateaus implies a maximum NS mass in the range $\sim$ 2.3 - 2.35 M$_{\odot}$.</description>

Abstract: The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion model is widely used to describe how a compact object accretes material from a companion's stellar wind in binary systems. However, its standard implementation becomes inaccurate when the wind velocity ($v_\mathrm{w}$) is comparable to or less than the orbital velocity ($v_\mathrm{o}$), predicting non-physical accretion efficiencies above unity. This limits its applicability to systems with low wind-to-orbital velocity ratios ($w= v_\mathrm{w} / v_\mathrm{o} \leq 1$), such as symbiotic systems. We revisit the implementation of the BHL model and introduce a geometric correction factor that accounts for the varying orientation of the accretion cylinder relative to the wind direction. This correction ensures physically plausible accretion efficiencies ($\eta \leq 1$) for all $w$ in circular orbits. Our new implementation naturally predicts the flattening of the accretion efficiency observed in numerical simulations for $w &lt; 1$, without the need for ad hoc adjustments. We also peer into the implications of our prescription for the less-explored case of eccentric orbits, highlighting the key role of the geometric correction factor in shaping the accretion process. We compare our predictions with numerical simulations, finding good agreement for a wide range of parameters. Applications to the symbiotic star R~Aqr and the X-ray binary LS 5039 are presented. This improved implementation offers a more accurate description of wind accretion in binary systems, with implications for stellar evolution, population synthesis, and observational data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions -- III: Long term evolution</title>

Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. More and more analyses show that QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. QPEs have shown to be invaluable in probing the orbits of SMOs in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In this paper, we extend previous orbital analyses in Refs. arXiv:2401.11190, arXiv:2405.06429 by including extra effects, the SMO orbital decay due to collisions with the disk and the disk precession. We find clear Bayes evidence for orbital decay in GSN 069 and for disk precession in eRO-QPE2, the two most stable QPE sources. The detection of these effects provides informative constraints on the SMBH mass, the radiation efficiency of QPEs, the SMO nature, the accretion disk surface density and the accretion disk viscosity. With tighter constraints on the SMO orbital parameters, we further confirm that these two QPE EMRIs are nearly circular orbiters which are consistent with the wet EMRI formation channel prediction, but are incompatible with either the dry loss-cone channel or the Hills mechanism. Combining all the QPE sources available, we find the QPE EMRIs can be divided into two populations according to their orbital eccentricities, where the orbital periods and the SMBH masses in the low-eccentricity population follow a scaling relation $T_{\rm obt}\propto M_{\bullet}^n$ with $n\approx 0.8$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and observational constraints on black holes with primary hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity: Stability and shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we find that unlike in General Relativity, the shift-symmetric subclass of Beyond Horndeski theories permits black holes with primary hair that are thermodynamically stable and align with current Event Horizon Telescope observations of the M87* and Sgr A* black holes. This work begins by investigating thermodynamic properties, analyzing how primary hair influences thermodynamic quantities and local stability, which imposes strict constraints on the allowed range of primary hair values. The null geodesics near this black hole are then examined, demonstrating how scalar hair affects the shadow diameter. Specifically, when the parameter of the Beyond Horndeski function $F_4$ is negative, increasing scalar hair enlarges the shadow; in contrast, when this parameter is positive, greater scalar hair reduces the shadow size. Further constraints on the scalar hair are derived using observational data, highlighting its sensitivity to other black hole parameters. To explore additional observational features, face-on two-dimensional images of spherically infalling accretion disks are simulated, revealing how primary scalar hair shapes the black hole's shadow. Finally, all relevant constraints are combined to identify black holes that are both stable and consistent with observational data.</description>
