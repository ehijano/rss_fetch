      <title>Photonics detection of molecular-specific spatial structural alterations in cell nuclei due to chronic alcoholism and probiotics treatments on colon cancer via a light localization method using confocal imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonics/light localization techniques are important in understanding the structural changes in biological tissues at the nano- to sub-micron scale. It is now known that structural alteration starts at the nanoscale at the beginning of cancer progression. This study examines the molecular-specific nano-structural alterations of chronic alcoholism and probiotic effects on colon cancer using a mouse model of colon cancer. Confocal microscopy and mesoscopic light-scattering analysis are applied to quantify structural changes in DNA (chromatin), cytoskeleton, and ki-67 protein cells with appropriate staining dyes. We assessed alcohol-treated and azoxymethane (AOM) with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis models, including ethanol (EtOH) and probiotic (L.Casei) treatments separately and together. The inverse participation ratio (IPR) technique was employed to quantify the degree of light localization to access the molecular-specific spatial structural disorder as a biomarker for cancer progression detection. Significant enhancement of cancer progression was observed in the alcohol-treated group, and probiotics treatment with alcohol showed partial reversal of these changes in colon cancer. The results underscore the potential of the IPR technique in detecting early structural changes in colon cancer, offering insights into the mitigating effects of probiotics on alcohol-induced enhancement of colon cancer.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous imaging of bidirectional guided waves enables synchronous probing of mechanical anisotropy, local blood pressure, and stress in arteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arterial biomechanical indicators have long been recognized as fundamental contributors to the physiology and pathology of cardiovascular systems. Probing the multiple biomechanical parameters of arteries simultaneously at different time points within one cardiac cycle is of great importance but remains challenging. Here we report an ultrasound elastography method to quantify arterial anisotropic stiffness, mechanical stresses in arterial wall, and local blood pressure in a single measurement. With programmed acoustic radiation force, arterial axial and circumferential guided elastic waves were induced simultaneously and recorded at multiple time points within one cardiac cycle. Then a mechanical model incorporating acoustoelasticity and viscoelasticity of arteries was proposed to quantitatively predict the correlation of arterial guided elastic waves with arterial biomechanical parameters. Our experimental design and biomechanical model lead to an elastography method to interrogate the variation of blood pressure, arterial bidirectional stiffnesses and mechanical stresses in arterial walls with time. In vivo experiments were performed on healthy young, normotensive older and hypertensive older volunteers. The results demonstrate that the reported method can find applications in understanding aging of cardiovascular system and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>A wireless bilateral transceiver coil based on volume decoupled resonators for a clinical MR mammography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless radio frequency coils provide a promising solution for clinical MR applications due to several benefits, such as cable-free connection and compatibility with MR platforms of different vendors. Namely, for the purpose of clinical high-field human breast imaging several wireless transceiver coils are known to the date, those operational principle is based on inductive coupling with a body coil. These coils are commonly consist of a several volume resonators to perform bilateral breast imaging. Due to the electrically close location of volume resonators, strong inductive coupling is observed, resulting in the occurrence of hybrid modes. In principle, MR imaging using one of the hybrid modes is possible provided by the homogeneity of a B+ distribution. However, the question of influence of volume resonators coupling on wireless coil transmit efficiency and receive sensitivity was not previously studied. By this work, we performed study to understand this issue. The first wireless coil with decoupled resonators is developed, evaluated numerically and experimentally including in vivo study on healthy volunteers. According to the obtained results, transmit efficiency and receive sensitivity of a pair of decoupled Helmholtz resonators is at least 24% higher than for a pair of coupled resonators.</description>

      <title>Acquisition-Independent Deep Learning for Quantitative MRI Parameter Estimation using Neural Controlled Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has proven to be a suitable alternative to least-squares (LSQ) fitting for parameter estimation in various quantitative MRI (QMRI) models. However, current deep learning implementations are not robust to changes in MR acquisition protocols. In practice, QMRI acquisition protocols differ substantially between different studies and clinical settings. The lack of generalizability and adoptability of current deep learning approaches for QMRI parameter estimation impedes the implementation of these algorithms in clinical trials and clinical practice. Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) allow for the sampling of incomplete and irregularly sampled data with variable length, making them ideal for use in QMRI parameter estimation. In this study, we show that NCDEs can function as a generic tool for the accurate prediction of QMRI parameters, regardless of QMRI sequence length, configuration of independent variables and QMRI forward model (variable flip angle T1-mapping, intravoxel incoherent motion MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI). NCDEs achieved lower mean squared error than LSQ fitting in low-SNR simulations and in vivo in challenging anatomical regions like the abdomen and leg, but this improvement was no longer evident at high SNR. NCDEs reduce estimation error interquartile range without increasing bias, particularly under conditions of high uncertainty. These findings suggest that NCDEs offer a robust approach for reliable QMRI parameter estimation, especially in scenarios with high uncertainty or low image quality. We believe that with NCDEs, we have solved one of the main challenges for using deep learning for QMRI parameter estimation in a broader clinical and research setting.</description>
