      <title>Three-dimensional crustal deformation analysis using physics-informed deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquake-related phenomena such as seismic waves and crustal deformation impact broad regions, requiring large-scale modeling with careful treatment of artificial outer boundaries. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been applied to analyze wavefront propagation, acoustic and elastic waveform propagations, and crustal deformation in semi-infinite domains. In this study, we investigated the capability of PINNs for modeling earthquake crustal deformation in 3-D structures. To improve modeling accuracy, four neural networks were constructed to represent the displacement and stress fields in two subdomains divided by a fault surface and its extension. Forward simulations exhibited high accuracy for internal deformation but yielded errors for rigid motions, underscoring the inherent difficulty in constraining static deformation at an infinite distance. In the inversion analysis, fault slip distributions were estimated using surface observational data. Application to real data from the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi inland earthquake showed a fault slip consistent with previous studies, despite underestimation of the magnitude. This study demonstrates the capability of PINNs to analyze 3-D crustal deformation, thereby offering a flexible approach for large-scale earthquake modeling using real-world observations and crustal structures.</description>

      <title>Probing Earth's core using atmospheric neutrino oscillations with NSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos can serve as a complementary and independent tool to gravitational and seismic studies in exploring the interior of Earth, thanks to their unique properties: extremely low interaction cross sections and flavor oscillations. With the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and observation of the non-zero value of mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, it has become feasible to detect the forward scattering of GeV-energy atmospheric neutrinos passing through Earth with ambient electrons in the form of matter effects on neutrino oscillation probabilities. These matter effects depend on both the neutrino energy and electron density distribution along their path, making them ideally suited for exploring the inner structure of Earth. Furthermore, in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter, oscillation patterns undergo additional modifications. In this study, we quantify the capability of an atmospheric neutrino experiment, such as a magnetized iron calorimeter detector, to validate the Earth's core and measure the position of the core-mantle boundary in the presence of NSI. We perform this study considering a three-layered density profile of Earth. Our analysis demonstrates that neutrino non-standard interactions impact these Earth tomography measurements in comparison to standard interactions.</description>

      <title>Flowy: High performance probabilistic lava emplacement prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lava emplacement is a complex physical phenomenon, affected by several factors. These include, but are not limited to features of the terrain, the lava settling process, the effusion rate or total erupted volume, and the probability of effusion from different locations. One method, which has been successfully employed to predict lava flow emplacement and forecast the inundated area and final lava thickness, is the MrLavaLoba method from Vitturi et al. The MrLavaLoba method has been implemented in their code of the same name. Here, we introduce Flowy, a new computational tool that implements the MrLavaLoba method in a more efficient manner. New fast algorithms have been incorporated for all performance critical code paths, resulting in a complete overhaul of the implementation. When compared to the MrLavaLoba code, Flowy exhibits a significant reduction in runtime -- between 100 to 400 times faster -- depending on the specific input parameters. The accuracy and the probabilistic convergence of the model outputs are not compromised, maintaining high fidelity in generating possible lava flow paths and deposition characteristics. We have validated Flowy's performance and reliability through comprehensive unit-testing and a real-world eruption scenario. The source code is freely available on GitHub, facilitating transparency, reproducibility and collaboration within the geoscientific community.</description>
