      <title>Meteorologically-Informed Adaptive Conformal Prediction for Tropical Cyclone Intensity Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid intensification (RI) of tropical cyclones (TCs) poses a great challenge due to their highly nonlinear dynamics and inherent uncertainties. Conventional statistical dynamics and artificial intelligence prediction models typically rely on static parameterization schemes, which limits their ability to capture the non-stationary error structure in the intensity evolution. To address this issue, we propose a physically-inspired covariate adaptive conformal prediction framework that dynamically adjusts uncertainty quantification by incorporating process information such as intensity and evolutionary stage. Our approach not only surpasses state-of-the-art models in point prediction accuracy, but also delivers physically consistent and interpretable forecast intervals, establishing a more process-aware framework for probabilistic prediction of extreme weather events.</description>

      <title>Closure of the sea surface height budget with a Stokes offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sea surface height budget, obtained by integrating hydrostatic balance over the water column, relates sea surface height variations to variations of the seafloor pressure, density in the water column, and atmospheric surface pressure. This budget is crucial for calibrating and interpreting satellite altimetry measurements. It only holds once non-hydrostatic surface gravity waves are averaged out, however, which complicates an observational closure of the budget. Using data from the California Current System, this study demonstrates that the budget closes to within understood uncertainties if GPS buoy measurements of surface height are interpreted as Lagrangian measurements. The buoy largely follows wave motion and spends slightly more time near wave crests than troughs. The associated Stokes offset, which reaches a maximum of 15 cm in these observations, must be accounted for in the Eulerian sea surface height budget.</description>

      <title>Capability demonstration of a JEDI-based system for TEMPO assimilation: system description and evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The launch of the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) mission in 2023 marked a new era in air quality monitoring by providing high-frequency, geostationary observations of column NO2 across North America. In this study, we present the first implementation of a TEMPO NO2 data assimilation system using the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) framework. Leveraging a four-dimensional ensemble variational (4DEnVar) approach and an Ensemble of Data Assimilations (EDA), we demonstrate a novel capability to assimilate hourly NO2 retrievals from TEMPO alongside polar-orbiting TROPOMI data into NASA's GEOS Composition Forecast (GEOS-CF) model. The system is evaluated over the CONUS region for August 2023, using a suite of independent measurements including Pandora spectrometers, AirNow surface stations, and aircraft-based observations from AEROMMA and STAQS field campaigns. Results show that the assimilation system successfully integrates geostationary NO2 observations, improves model performance in the column, and captures diurnal variability. However, assimilation also leads to systematic reductions in surface NO2 levels, improving agreement with some datasets (e.g., Pandora, AEROMMA) but degrading comparisons with others (e.g., AirNow). These findings highlight the importance of joint evaluation across platforms and motivate further development of dual-concentration emission assimilation schemes. While the system imposes high computational costs, primarily from the forecast model, ongoing efforts to integrate AI-based model emulators offer a promising path toward scalable, real-time assimilation of geostationary atmospheric composition data.</description>

      <title>DEF: Diffusion-augmented Ensemble Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DEF (\textbf{\ul{D}}iffusion-augmented \textbf{\ul{E}}nsemble \textbf{\ul{F}}orecasting), a novel approach for generating initial condition perturbations. Modern approaches to initial condition perturbations are primarily designed for numerical weather prediction (NWP) solvers, limiting their applicability in the rapidly growing field of machine learning for weather prediction. Consequently, stochastic models in this domain are often developed on a case-by-case basis. We demonstrate that a simple conditional diffusion model can (1) generate meaningful structured perturbations, (2) be applied iteratively, and (3) utilize a guidance term to intuitivey control the level of perturbation. This method enables the transformation of any deterministic neural forecasting system into a stochastic one. With our stochastic extended systems, we show that the model accumulates less error over long-term forecasts while producing meaningful forecast distributions. We validate our approach on the 5.625$^\circ$ ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which comprises atmospheric and surface variables over a discretized global grid, spanning from the 1960s to the present. On this dataset, our method demonstrates improved predictive performance along with reasonable spread estimates.</description>

      <title>Energetically consistent localised APE budgets for local and regional studies of stratified flow energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because it allows a rigorous separation between reversible and irreversible processes, the concept of available potential energy (APE) has become central to the study of turbulent stratified fluids. In ocean modelling, it is fundamental to the parameterisation of meso-scale ocean eddies and of the turbulent mixing of heat and salt. However, how to apply APE theory consistently to local or regional subdomains has been a longstanding source of confusion due to the globally defined Lorenz reference state entering the definition of APE and of buoyancy forces being generally thought to be meaningless in those cases. In practice, this is often remedied by introducing heuristic `localised' forms of APE density depending uniquely on region-specific reference states, possibly diverging significantly from the global Lorenz reference state. In this paper, we argue that across-scale energy transfers can only be consistently described if localised forms of APE density are defined as the eddy APE component of an exact mean/eddy decomposition of the APE density, for which a new physically more intuitive and mathematically simpler framework is proposed. The eddy APE density thus defined exhibits a much weaker dependency on the global Lorenz reference state than the mean APE, in agreement with physical intuition, but with a different structure than that of existing heuristic localised APE forms. Our framework establishes a rigorous physical basis for linking parameterised energy transfers to molecular viscous and diffusive dissipation rates. We illustrate its potential usefulness by discussing the energetics implications of standard advective and diffusive parameterisations of the turbulent density flux, which reveals potential new sources of numerical instability in ocean models.</description>

      <title>Review of Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics And Statistical Mechanics of Vortex Gases in Tornado Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work puts into mathematical, statistical mechanical, and thermodynamical context the initial stages of the genesis of tornado-like vortices with the aim to be consistent with the current state of knowledge of the process of tornadogenesis. In particular, it discusses a mathematical foundation of the formation of coherent structures such as ``cusps'' and ``hairpins'' using variants of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that arise via the Hasimoto transform of a vortex filament model. The behavior of such structures is then analyzed within a quasi-two-dimensional boundary layer model using the statistical mechanics of vortex gases to explain the rearrangement of cusps and other vertical vortex filaments into patches and possibly supercritical vortices. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is used to obtain the entropic balance and the internal entropy production rate, and connect them to the turbulent heat flux. A formula for the non-equilibrium turbulent heat supply and formulas for the entropy supply and entropy production in the boundary layer are also provided. A relationship between the vorticity and the entropy gradient based on macroscopic fluctuations is given with implications to stretching and tilting of vorticity in the vertical direction. We conclude with some remarks on equivalence of Schr\"odinger and Gross-Pitaevskii equations in describing vortex filaments.</description>
