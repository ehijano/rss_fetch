      <title>A case study: the savings potential thanks to FAIR data in one Materials Science PhD project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles have gained significant attention as a means to enhance data sharing, collaboration, and reuse across various domains. Here, we explore the potential benefits of implementing FAIR data practices within engineering projects, with a monetary focus in the German context, but by considering aspects which are relatively universal. By examining the FAIR-data aspect of a Materials Science and Engineering PhD project, it becomes evident that substantial cost savings can be achieved. The estimated savings are 2,600 Euros per year from the PhD project considered. This study underscores the importance of implementing FAIR data practices in engineering projects and highlights some significant economic benefits that can be derived from such initiatives. By embracing FAIR principles, organizations in the engineering sector can unlock the full potential of their data, optimize resource allocation, and drive innovation in a cost-effective manner.</description>

      <title>Circular Directional Flow Decomposition of Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Circular Directional Flow Decomposition (CDFD), a new framework for analyzing circularity in weighted directed networks. CDFD separates flow into two components: a circular (divergence-free) component and an acyclic component that carries all nett directional flow. This yields a normalized circularity index between 0 (fully acyclic) and 1 (for networks formed solely by the superposition of cycles), with the complement measuring directionality. This index captures the proportion of flow involved in cycles, and admits a range of interpretations - such as system closure, feedback, weighted strong connectivity, structural redundancy, or inefficiency. Although the decomposition is generally non-unique, we show that the set of all decompositions forms a well-structured geometric space with favourable topological properties. Within this space, we highlight two benchmark decompositions aligned with distinct analytical goals: the maximum circularity solution, which minimizes nett flow, and the Balanced Flow Forwarding (BFF) solution, a unique, locally computable decomposition that distributes circular flow across all feasible cycles in proportion to the original network structure. We demonstrate the interpretive value and computational tractability of both decompositions on synthetic and empirical networks. They outperform existing circularity metrics in detecting meaningful structural variation. The decomposition also enables structural analysis - such as mapping the distribution of cyclic flow - and supports practical applications that require explicit flow allocation or routing, including multilateral netting and efficient transport.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Human Capital Complexity: Economic Complexity Analysis of Occupations and Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural embeddedness of skills in the division of labor. Drawing on O*NET data covering 120 skills across 872 U.S. occupations, we identify three skill communities: general, cognitive, and physical skills. Compressing the connectivity in the occupation-skill network through the Method of Reflection, we derive the Occupational Complexity Index (OCI) and the Skill Complexity Index (SCI). They unpack the structure of the occupation skill network that general skills are embedded at the core, while cognitive and physical skills diverge in opposite directions. We further assess each skill's contribution to the network's modular and nested structure, finding that cognitive and physical skills contribute equally to specialization but differ in their interactions with general skills. Regression analysis reveals that general skills significantly moderate the wage effects of specialized skills, amplifying the returns to cognitive skills and mitigating the penalties of physical skills. These findings underscore the central function of general skills in transforming individual competencies into labor market value. Reskilling policies aimed at investing in human capital should consider general skills, which are intangible yet play a foundational role in the labor market.</description>

      <title>A data-driven analysis of the impact of non-compliant individuals on epidemic diffusion in urban settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals who do not comply with public health safety measures pose a significant challenge to effective epidemic control, as their risky behaviours can undermine public health interventions. This is particularly relevant in urban environments because of their high population density and complex social interactions. In this study, we employ detailed contact networks, built using a data-driven approach, to examine the impact of non-compliant individuals on epidemic dynamics in three major Italian cities: Torino, Milano, and Palermo. We use a heterogeneous extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model that distinguishes between ordinary and non-compliant individuals, who are more infectious and/or more susceptible. By combining electoral data with recent findings on vaccine hesitancy, we obtain spatially heterogeneous distributions of non-compliance. Epidemic simulations demonstrate that even a small proportion of non-compliant individuals in the population can substantially increase the number of infections and accelerate the timing of their peak. Furthermore, the impact of non-compliance is greatest when disease transmission rates are moderate. Including the heterogeneous, data-driven distribution of non-compliance in the simulations results in infection hotspots forming with varying intensity according to the disease transmission rate. Overall, these findings emphasise the importance of monitoring behavioural compliance and tailoring public health interventions to address localised risks.</description>

      <title>Adding links wisely: how an influencer seeks for leadership in opinion dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of leadership development for an external influencer using the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model, where the influencer is modeled as a fully stubborn agent and leadership is quantified by social power. The influencer seeks to maximize her social power by strategically adding a limited number of links to regular agents. This optimization problem is shown to be equivalent to maximizing the absorbing probability to the influencer in an augmented Markov chain. The resulting objective function is both monotone and submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm to compute an approximate solution. To handle large-scale networks efficiently, a random walk sampling over the Markov chain is employed to reduce computational complexity. Analytical characterizations of the solution are provided for both low and high stubbornness of regular agents. Specific network topologies are also examined: for complete graphs with rank-one weight matrices, the problem reduces to a hyperbolic 0-1 programmming problem, which is solvable in polynomial time; for symmetric ring graphs with circulant weight matrices and uniform agent stubbornness, the optimal strategy involves selecting agents that are sufficiently dispersed across the network. Numerical simulations are presented for illustration.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Evolution of Cooperation Based on Adaptive Reputation Threshold and Game Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world social systems, individual interactions are frequently shaped by reputation, which not only influences partner selection but also affects the nature and benefits of the interactions themselves. We propose a heterogeneous game transition model that incorporates a reputation-based dynamic threshold mechanism to investigate how reputation regulates game evolution. In our framework, individuals determine the type of game they engage in according to their own and their neighbors' reputation levels. In turn, the outcomes of these interactions modify their reputations, thereby driving the adaptation and evolution of future strategies in a feedback-informed manner. Through simulations on two representative topological structures, square lattice and small-world networks, we find that network topology exerts a profound influence on the evolutionary dynamics. Due to its localized connection characteristics, the square lattice network fosters the long-term coexistence of competing strategies. In contrast, the small-world network is more susceptible to changes in system parameters due to the efficiency of information dissemination and the sensitivity of strategy evolution. Additionally, the reputation mechanism is significant in promoting the formation of a dominant state of cooperation, especially in contexts of high sensitivity to reputation. Although the initial distribution of reputation influences the early stage of the evolutionary path, it has little effect on the final steady state of the system. Hence, we can conclude that the ultimate steady state of evolution is primarily determined by the reputation mechanism and the network structure.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Nuclear Microreactor Cost-competitiveness in Current Electricity Markets Considering Reactor Cost Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the cost competitiveness of microreactors in today's electricity markets, with a focus on uncertainties in reactor costs. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize key technical parameters, such as reactor capacity, fuel enrichment, tail enrichment, refueling interval, and discharge burnup, to minimize the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). Base case results are validated using Simulated Annealing (SA). By incorporating Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) for fuel cycle costs, the study identifies optimal configurations under uncertainty. Methodologically, it introduces a novel framework combining probabilistic cost modeling with evolutionary optimization. Results show that microreactors can remain cost-competitive, with LCOEs ranging from \$48.21/MWh to \$78.32/MWh when supported by the Production Tax Credit (PTC). High reactor capacity, low fuel enrichment, moderate tail enrichment and refueling intervals, and high discharge burnup enhance cost efficiency. Among all factors, overnight capital cost (OCC) has the most significant impact on LCOE, while O&amp;M and fuel cost uncertainties have lesser effects. The analysis highlights how energy policies like the PTC can reduce LCOE by 22-24%, improving viability despite cost variability. Compared to conventional nuclear, coal, and renewable sources like offshore wind, hydro, and biomass, optimized microreactors show strong economic potential. This research defines a realistic design space and key trade-offs, offering actionable insights for policymakers, reactor designers, and energy planners aiming to accelerate the deployment of affordable, sustainable microreactors.</description>

      <title>Consideraciones para una formulacion termodinamica neo-gibbsiana aplicada a sistemas sociales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a first approach towards a neo-Gibbsian thermodynamic theory for social systems, grounded in quantifiable economic and cultural parameters, while deliberately avoiding direct analogies with classical thermodynamic equations of state. Building on previous thermodynamic approaches to economic modeling, we introduce a conceptual basis for defining intensive variables capable of characterizing equilibrium states and evolutionary dynamics in societies. Particular attention is given to cultural and structural diversification of goods and resources, as well as to the phenomenon of multi-currency systems. A non-decreasing function $S$ is defined over all social processes to represent the accumulation of laws, norms, and other quantifiable symbolic elements. Finally, we examine its interpretation in terms of thermodynamic forces, focusing on the case of equilibrium between two simple interacting social systems exchanging resources.</description>

      <title>Melody predominates over harmony in the evolution of musical scales across 96 countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard theory of musical scales since antiquity has been based on harmony, rather than melody. While recent analyses provide mixed support for a role of melody as well as harmony, we lack a comparative analysis based on cross-cultural data. We address this longstanding problem through a rigorous computational comparison of the main theories using 1,314 scales from 96 countries. There is near-universal support for melodic theories, which predict step-sizes of 1-3 semitones. Harmony accounts for the prevalence of certain simple-integer-ratio intervals, particularly for music-theoretic scales from Eurasian societies, which may explain their dominance amongst Western scholars. However, harmony is a poor predictor of scales measured from ethnographic recordings, particularly outside of Eurasia. Overall, we show that the historical emphasis on harmony is misguided and that melody is the primary determinant of the world's musical scales.</description>

      <title>Inference of Hierarchical Core-Periphery Structure in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks can have various types of mesoscale structures. One type of mesoscale structure in networks is core-periphery structure, which consists of densely-connected core nodes and sparsely-connected peripheral nodes. The core nodes are connected densely to each other and can be connected to the peripheral nodes, which are connected sparsely to other nodes. There has been much research on core-periphery structure in time-independent networks, but few core-periphery detection methods have been developed for time-dependent (i.e., ``temporal") networks. Using a multilayer-network representation of temporal networks and an inference approach that employs stochastic block models, we generalize a recent method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure \cite{Polanco23} from time-independent networks to temporal networks. In contrast to ``onion-like'' nested core-periphery structures (where each node is assigned to a group according to how deeply it is nested in a network's core), hierarchical core-periphery structures encompass networks with nested structures, tree-like structures (where any two groups must either be disjoint or have one as a strict subset of the other), and general non-nested mesoscale structures (where the group assignments of nodes do not have to be nested in any way). To perform statistical inference and thereby identify core-periphery structure, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We illustrate our method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure in two real-world temporal networks, and we briefly discuss the structures that we identify in these networks.</description>
