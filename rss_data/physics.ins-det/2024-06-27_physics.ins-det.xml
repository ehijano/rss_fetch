      <title>Relative Measurement and Extrapolation of the Scintillation Quenching Factor of $\alpha$-Particles in Liquid Argon using DEAP-3600 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The knowledge of scintillation quenching of $\alpha$-particles plays a paramount role in understanding $\alpha$-induced backgrounds and improving the sensitivity of liquid argon-based direct detection of dark matter experiments. We performed a relative measurement of scintillation quenching in the MeV energy region using radioactive isotopes ($^{222}$Rn, $^{218}$Po and $^{214}$Po isotopes) present in trace amounts in the DEAP-3600 detector and quantified the uncertainty of extrapolating the quenching factor to the low-energy region.</description>

      <title>Fudan Multi-purpose Active TArget Time Projection Chamber (fMeta-TPC) for Photonnuclear Reaction Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Target Time Projection Chambers (AT-TPCs) are state-of-the-art tools in the field of low-energy nuclear physics, particularly suitable for experiments using low-intensity radioactive ion beams or gamma rays. The Fudan Multi-purpose Active Target Time Projection Chamber (fMeta-TPC) with 2048 channels has been developed to study $\alpha$-clustering nuclei. {\fcb In this work, the focus is on the study of the photonuclear reaction with the Laser Compton Scattering (LCS) gamma source, especially for the decay of the highly excited $\alpha$-cluster state.} The design of fMeta-TPC is described and a comprehensive evaluation of its offline performance is performed by ultraviolet (UV) laser and $^{241}$Am $\alpha$ source. The result shows that the intrinsic angular resolution of the detector is within 0.30$^{\circ}$ and has an energy resolution of 6.85\% for 3.0 MeV $\alpha$ particles. The gain uniformity of the detector is about 10\% (RMS/Mean), tested by the $^{55}$Fe X-ray source.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Short Pulse Looped Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern optical systems send and receive ultra-short temporal pulses (USP). While ultra-broad band antennas do exist in the microwave region (e.g., log-periodic antennas, or, concentric loop antennas), their short temporal response is typically limited by the antenna's large dispersion, hence, resulting in a substantial pulse broadening. Here we show that loop antennas may exhibit USP attributes, below 400 ps (or, an equivalent coherent band pass exceeding 2.5 GHz) with only three loops, or, with a single, thick loop.</description>

      <title>The neutron array of the compact spectrometer for heavy ion experiments in Fermi energy region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emission of neutrons from heavy ion reactions is an important observable for studying the asymmetric nuclear equation of state and the reaction dynamics. A 20-unit neutron array has been developed and mounted on the compact spectrometer for heavy ion experiments (CSHINE) to measure the neutron spectra, neutron-neutron and neutron-proton correlation functions. Each unit consists of a $\rm 15\times 15\times 15~cm^3$ plastic scintillator coupled to a $ \phi=52 ~\rm mm$ photomultiplier. The Geant4 simulation with optical process is performed to investigate the time resolution and the neutron detection efficiency. The inherent time resolution of 212 ps is obtained by cosmic ray coincidence test. The n-$\gamma$ discrimination and time-of-flight performance are given by $\rm ^{252}Cf$ radioactive source test and beam test. The neutron energy spectra have been obtained in the angle range $30^\circ \le \theta_{\rm lab} \le 51^\circ$ in the beam experiment of $^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn at 25 MeV/u with CSHINE.</description>

      <title>Neutron Yield of Thermo Scientific P385 D-T Neutron Generator vs. Current and Voltage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Thermo Scientific P385 Neutron Generator is a compact neutron source, producing 14 MeV neutrons through the deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion reaction. For practical use, it is important to measure and preferably understand the dependence of the neutron production rate on the accelerator current and voltage. In this study, we evaluated neutron production with a neutron spectrometer (BTI N-Probe), a He-3 detector surrounded by HDPE shells (Nested Neutron Spectrometer, NNS), and two ZnS fast neutron scintillators (EJ-410) for both P385 A3082 and A3083 sealed tubes. We also predicted the neutron yield using the TRIM code, which calculates the trajectory and the energy loss of deuterons and tritons within the target. Experimental and theoretical results showed a linear dependence on beam current and a $\sim$3.5 power law dependence on the operating voltage. A series of NNS measurements, neutron spectrum from N-Probe and MCNP calculation showed that the A3083 and A3082 tubes provide a maximum neutron yield of $\sim 8.2 \times 10^8$ n/s and $\sim 4.5 \times 10^8$ n/s, respectively. We showed that tritium decay was not a significant contributor to this difference.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Navigation System (CRoNS) for Autonomous Navigation in GPS-Denied Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) systems are integral to our technological infrastructure, the increasing prevalence of severe space weather events and the advent of deliberate disruptions such as GPS jamming and spoofing pose significant risks. These challenges are underscored by recent military operations in Ukraine, highlighting the vulnerability of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In response, we introduce the Cosmic Ray Navigation System (CRoNS). This innovative and resilient alternative utilizes cosmic muon showers for precise location pinpointing, especially in environments where GNSS is compromised or unavailable. CRoNS capitalizes on an economical, distributed network of compact muon sensors deployed across urban landscapes and potentially integrated into mobile devices. These sensors are tasked with continuously monitoring muon flux resulting from extensive air showers (EASs) triggered by the consistent high-energy particle flux entering Earth's atmosphere. A central AI unit synthesizes the collected data, determining EAS parameters to establish a dynamic reference coordinate system that could span cities and even nations. A notable advantage of CRoNS lies in its capability for reliable operation beneath the Earth's surface and in aquatic environments.</description>

      <title>Development of an integrated device based on the gain/phase detector and Arduino platform for measuring magnetoelastic resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the development of an integrated device for measuring magnetoelastic resonance, utilizing a gain/phase detector and the Arduino platform. The device stands out for its simplicity, low cost, and efficiency. It employs the Arduino's ATmega328P microcontroller, coupled with the AD8302, and an intuitive graphical interface developed in Python, which facilitates the measurement of magnetoelastic signals in sensors. The device's validation is carried out through measurements of mass deposits on magnetoelastic sensors, confirming its accuracy and functionality. This advancement offers a practical and portable solution for detecting magnetoelastic resonances, promoting the use of these technologies in field environments and in diverse scientific applications. The integration of components into a compact, robust, and low-cost electronic circuit, along with an easy-to-operate graphical interface, significantly simplifies the complexity of the components, making the equipment complete and readily operational.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents analysis results of the operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) that combine feedforward paths and multistage amplifiers to achieve high-gain wideband operation as well as frequency compensation. To analyze multistage feedforward OTAs and provide an intuitive design method, the single-pole approximation model is employed for each substage of the OTA. Using the single-pole approximation model, the analysis is carried out from the two-stage OTA to the four-stage OTA in this work.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of forces in air-based acoustic levitation systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic levitation is frequently used for non-contact manipulation of objects and to study the impact of microgravity on physical and biological processes. While the force field produced by sound pressure lifts particles against gravity (primary acoustic force), multiple levitating objects in the same acoustic cavity interact via forces that arise from scattered sound (secondary acoustic forces). Current experimental techniques for obtaining these force fields are not well-suited for mapping the primary force field at high spatial resolution and cannot directly measure the secondary scattering force. Here we introduce a method that can measure both acoustic forces in situ, including secondary forces in the near-field limit between arbitrarily shaped, closely spaced objects. Operating similarly to an atomic force microscope, the method inserts into the acoustic cavity a suitably shaped probe tip at the end of a long, flexible cantilever and optically detects its deflection. This makes it possible to measure forces with a resolution better than 50 nN, and also to apply stress or strain in a controlled manner to manipulate levitated objects. We demonstrate this by extracting the acoustic potential present in a levitation cavity, directly measuring the acoustic scattering force between two objects, and applying tension to a levitated granular raft of acoustically-bound particles in order to obtain the force-displacement curve for its deformation.</description>

      <title>FiberPol-6D: Spectropolarimetric Integral Field mode for the SAAO 1.9 m Telescope using fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most optical spectropolarimeters built to date operate as long-slit or point-source instruments; they are inefficient for observations of extended objects such as galaxies and nebulae. 2D spectropolarimetry technique development is a major challenge in astronomical instrumentation. At the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) FiberLab, we are developing a spectropolarimetry capable Integral Field front-end called FiberPol(-6D) for the existing SpUpNIC spectrograph on the SAAO 1.9 m telescope. SpUpNIC is a general purpose 2 arc-minute long-slit spectrograph with a grating suite covering the wavelength range from 350 to 1000 nm and at spectral resolutions between 500 and 6000. FiberPol generates 6D observational data: x-y spatial dimensions, wavelength, and the three linear Stokes parameters $I$, $q$ and $u$. Using a rotating half-wave plate and a Wollaston prism, FiberPol executes two-channel polarimetry, and each channel is fed to an array of 14 fibers, corresponding to a field of view of $10\times20~arcseconds^2$ sampled with 2.9 arcsecond diameter fiber cores. These fiber arrays are then rerouted to form a pseudo-slit input to SpUpNIC. FiberPol aims to achieve a polarimetric accuracy of 0.1 % per spectral resolution bin. Further, it can also function as a non-polarimetric integral-field unit. The instrument design has been completed and it is currently being assembled and characterized in the lab. It is scheduled for on-sky commissioning in the second half of 2024. In this paper, we present the scientific and technical goals of FiberPol, its overall design and initial results from the lab assembly and testing. FiberPol is a low cost technology demonstrator, and the entire system predominantly employs small size, commercial off-the-shelve optics and optomechanical components. It can be modified and replicated for use on any existing spectrograph, especially on bigger telescopes.</description>

      <title>First ClearMind gamma detector prototype for TOF-PET imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ClearMind project aims to develop a TOF-PET position-sensitive detection module optimized for time and spatial resolutions and detection efficiency. For this, we use a 59 mm $\times$ 59 mm $\times$ 5 mm monolithic PbWO$_4$ (PWO) crystal, which is encapsulated within a commercial Micro-Channel Plate Photomultiplier tube MAPMT253 with a bialkali photocathode directly deposited on the crystal. We report the proof of concept of the directly deposited of a bialkali photocathode on a PWO crystal and its stability over time. The full calibration of the ClearMind photodetector module in the single-photoelectron regime is described. We measured a time resolution of 70 ps FWHM using a 20 ps pulsed laser. We present the performance of the prototype used in coincidence with a 3 $\times$ 3 $\times$ 3 mm$^3$ LYSO:Ca,Ce crystal readout by a SiPM. We obtained a coincidence time resolution of 350 ps FWHM, a spatial resolution of 4 to 5 mm, and a detection efficiency of 28 %, consistent with Monte Carlo simulations of the ClearMind detector module.</description>

      <title>$P_{tail}^{\alpha}$: a high resolution gamma/hadron and composition discriminant variable for Water-Cherenkov Detector cosmic-ray observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise and efficient identification of the nature of the primary cosmic rays on an event-by-event basis stands as a fundamental aspiration for any cosmic ray observatory. In particular, the detection and characterization of gamma ray events are challenged by their occurrence within an overwhelmingly greater flux of charged cosmic rays spanning several orders of magnitude. The intricacies of distinguishing between cosmic ray compositions and the inherent uncertainties associated with hadronic interactions present formidable challenges, which, if not properly addressed, can introduce significant sources of systematic errors. This work introduces a novel composition discriminant variable, $P_{tail}^{\alpha}$, which quantifies the number of Water Cherenkov Detectors with a signal well above the mean signal observed in WCDs located at an equivalent distance from the shower core, in events with approximately the same energy at the ground. This new event variable is then shown to be, in the reconstructed energy range $10\,{\rm TeV}$ to $1.6\,{\rm PeV}$, well correlated with the total number of muons that hit, in the same event, all the observatory stations located at a distance greater than $200\,{\rm m}$ from the shower core. The two variables should thus have similar efficiencies in the selection of high-purity gamma event samples and in the determination of the nature of charged cosmic ray events.</description>

      <title>First Measurement of Correlated Charge Noise in Superconducting Qubits at an Underground Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure space- and time-correlated charge jumps on a four-qubit device, operating 107 meters below the Earth's surface in a low-radiation, cryogenic facility designed for the characterization of low-threshold particle detectors. The rock overburden of this facility reduces the cosmic ray muon flux by over 99% compared to laboratories at sea level. Combined with 4$\pi$ coverage of a movable lead shield, this facility enables quantifiable control over the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit device. Long-time-series charge tomography measurements on these weakly charge-sensitive qubits capture discontinuous jumps in the induced charge on the qubit islands, corresponding to the interaction of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. The rate of these charge jumps scales with the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit package, as characterized by a series of independent measurements on another energy-resolving detector operating simultaneously in the same cryostat with the qubits. Using lead shielding, we achieve a minimum charge jump rate of 0.19$^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ mHz, almost an order of magnitude lower than that measured in surface tests, but a factor of roughly eight higher than expected based on reduction of ambient gammas alone. We operate four qubits for over 22 consecutive hours with zero correlated charge jumps at length scales above three millimeters.</description>

Abstract: Radiation damage significantly impacts the performance of silicon tracking detectors in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, with signal reduction being the most critical effect; adjusting sensor bias voltage and detection thresholds can help mitigate these effects, generating simulated data that accurately mirror the performance evolution with the accumulation of luminosity, hence fluence, is crucial.
  The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have developed and implemented algorithms to correct simulated Monte Carlo (MC) events for radiation damage effects, achieving impressive agreement between collision data and simulated events. In preparation for the high-luminosity phase (HL-LHC), the demand for a faster ATLAS MC production algorithm becomes imperative due to escalating collision, events, tracks, and particle hit rates, imposing stringent constraints on available computing resources. This article outlines the philosophy behind the new algorithm, its implementation strategy, and the essential components involved. The results from closure tests indicate that the events simulated using the new algorithm agree with fully simulated events at the level of few \%. The first tests on computing performance show that the new algorithm is as fast as it is when no radiation damage corrections are applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are serious prospects that the next $\gamma$-ray space mission could use a telescope based on silicon pixel detectors. I characterize the potential of such active targets for polarimetry with gamma-ray conversions to pairs and find it excellent both in terms of selection efficiency and of effective polarization asymmetry.</description>
