      <title>Region-Aware Color Smudging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color smudge operations from digital painting software enable users to create natural shading effects in high-fidelity paintings by interactively mixing colors. To precisely control results in traditional painting software, users tend to organize flat-filled color regions in multiple layers and smudge them to generate different color gradients. However, the requirement to carefully deal with regions makes the smudging process time-consuming and laborious, especially for non-professional users. This motivates us to investigate how to infer user-desired smudging effects when users smudge over regions in a single layer. To investigate improving color smudge performance, we first conduct a formative study. Following the findings of this study, we design SmartSmudge, a novel smudge tool that offers users dynamical smudge brushes and real-time region selection for easily generating natural and efficient shading effects. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed tool via a user study and quantitative analysis</description>

      <title>Rip-NeRF: Anti-aliasing Radiance Fields with Ripmap-Encoded Platonic Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), the renderings may still suffer from aliasing and blurring artifacts, since it remains a fundamental challenge to effectively and efficiently characterize anisotropic areas induced by the cone-casting procedure. This paper introduces a Ripmap-Encoded Platonic Solid representation to precisely and efficiently featurize 3D anisotropic areas, achieving high-fidelity anti-aliasing renderings. Central to our approach are two key components: Platonic Solid Projection and Ripmap encoding. The Platonic Solid Projection factorizes the 3D space onto the unparalleled faces of a certain Platonic solid, such that the anisotropic 3D areas can be projected onto planes with distinguishable characterization. Meanwhile, each face of the Platonic solid is encoded by the Ripmap encoding, which is constructed by anisotropically pre-filtering a learnable feature grid, to enable featurzing the projected anisotropic areas both precisely and efficiently by the anisotropic area-sampling. Extensive experiments on both well-established synthetic datasets and a newly captured real-world dataset demonstrate that our Rip-NeRF attains state-of-the-art rendering quality, particularly excelling in the fine details of repetitive structures and textures, while maintaining relatively swift training times.</description>

      <title>Rasterized Edge Gradients: Handling Discontinuities Differentiably</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing the gradients of a rendering process is paramount for diverse applications in computer vision and graphics. However, accurate computation of these gradients is challenging due to discontinuities and rendering approximations, particularly for surface-based representations and rasterization-based rendering. We present a novel method for computing gradients at visibility discontinuities for rasterization-based differentiable renderers. Our method elegantly simplifies the traditionally complex problem through a carefully designed approximation strategy, allowing for a straightforward, effective, and performant solution. We introduce a novel concept of micro-edges, which allows us to treat the rasterized images as outcomes of a differentiable, continuous process aligned with the inherently non-differentiable, discrete-pixel rasterization. This technique eliminates the necessity for rendering approximations or other modifications to the forward pass, preserving the integrity of the rendered image, which makes it applicable to rasterized masks, depth, and normals images where filtering is prohibitive. Utilizing micro-edges simplifies gradient interpretation at discontinuities and enables handling of geometry intersections, offering an advantage over the prior art. We showcase our method in dynamic human head scene reconstruction, demonstrating effective handling of camera images and segmentation masks.</description>

      <title>Effects of Realism and Representation on Self-Embodied Avatars in Immersive Virtual Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has recently gained traction with many new and ever more affordable devices being released. The increase in popularity of this paradigm of interaction has given birth to new applications and has attracted casual consumers to experience VR. Providing a self-embodied representation (avatar) of users' full bodies inside shared virtual spaces can improve the VR experience and make it more engaging to both new and experienced users . This is especially important in fully immersive systems, where the equipment completely occludes the real world making self awareness problematic. Indeed, the feeling of presence of the user is highly influenced by their virtual representations, even though small flaws could lead to uncanny valley side-effects. Following previous research, we would like to assess whether using a third-person perspective could also benefit the VR experience, via an improved spatial awareness of the user's virtual surroundings. In this paper we investigate realism and perspective of self-embodied representation in VR setups in natural tasks, such as walking and avoiding obstacles. We compare both First and Third-Person perspectives with three different levels of realism in avatar representation. These range from a stylized abstract avatar, to a "realistic" mesh-based humanoid representation and a point-cloud rendering. The latter uses data captured via depth-sensors and mapped into a virtual self inside the Virtual Environment. We present a throughout evaluation and comparison of these different representations, describing a series of guidelines for self-embodied VR applications. The effects of the uncanny valley are also discussed in the context of navigation and reflex-based tasks.</description>

      <title>Hand-Object Interaction Controller (HOIC): Deep Reinforcement Learning for Reconstructing Interactions with Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hand manipulating objects is an important interaction motion in our daily activities. We faithfully reconstruct this motion with a single RGBD camera by a novel deep reinforcement learning method to leverage physics. Firstly, we propose object compensation control which establishes direct object control to make the network training more stable. Meanwhile, by leveraging the compensation force and torque, we seamlessly upgrade the simple point contact model to a more physical-plausible surface contact model, further improving the reconstruction accuracy and physical correctness. Experiments indicate that without involving any heuristic physical rules, this work still successfully involves physics in the reconstruction of hand-object interactions which are complex motions hard to imitate with deep reinforcement learning.

      <title>Spatial and Surface Correspondence Field for Interaction Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new method for the task of interaction transfer. Given an example interaction between a source object and an agent, our method can automatically infer both surface and spatial relationships for the agent and target objects within the same category, yielding more accurate and valid transfers. Specifically, our method characterizes the example interaction using a combined spatial and surface representation. We correspond the agent points and object points related to the representation to the target object space using a learned spatial and surface correspondence field, which represents objects as deformed and rotated signed distance fields. With the corresponded points, an optimization is performed under the constraints of our spatial and surface interaction representation and additional regularization. Experiments conducted on human-chair and hand-mug interaction transfer tasks show that our approach can handle larger geometry and topology variations between source and target shapes, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: Image-based 3D reconstruction is a challenging task that involves inferring the 3D shape of an object or scene from a set of input images. Learning-based methods have gained attention for their ability to directly estimate 3D shapes. This review paper focuses on state-of-the-art techniques for 3D reconstruction, including the generation of novel, unseen views. An overview of recent developments in the Gaussian Splatting method is provided, covering input types, model structures, output representations, and training strategies. Unresolved challenges and future directions are also discussed. Given the rapid progress in this domain and the numerous opportunities for enhancing 3D reconstruction methods, a comprehensive examination of algorithms appears essential. Consequently, this study offers a thorough overview of the latest advancements in Gaussian Splatting.</description>

      <title>LGTM: Local-to-Global Text-Driven Human Motion Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LGTM, a novel Local-to-Global pipeline for Text-to-Motion generation. LGTM utilizes a diffusion-based architecture and aims to address the challenge of accurately translating textual descriptions into semantically coherent human motion in computer animation. Specifically, traditional methods often struggle with semantic discrepancies, particularly in aligning specific motions to the correct body parts. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage pipeline to overcome this challenge: it first employs large language models (LLMs) to decompose global motion descriptions into part-specific narratives, which are then processed by independent body-part motion encoders to ensure precise local semantic alignment. Finally, an attention-based full-body optimizer refines the motion generation results and guarantees the overall coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that LGTM gains significant improvements in generating locally accurate, semantically-aligned human motion, marking a notable advancement in text-to-motion applications.

      <title>A Construct-Optimize Approach to Sparse View Synthesis without Camera Pose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis from a sparse set of input images is a challenging problem of great practical interest, especially when camera poses are absent or inaccurate. Direct optimization of camera poses and usage of estimated depths in neural radiance field algorithms usually do not produce good results because of the coupling between poses and depths, and inaccuracies in monocular depth estimation. In this paper, we leverage the recent 3D Gaussian splatting method to develop a novel construct-and-optimize method for sparse view synthesis without camera poses. Specifically, we construct a solution progressively by using monocular depth and projecting pixels back into the 3D world. During construction, we optimize the solution by detecting 2D correspondences between training views and the corresponding rendered images. We develop a unified differentiable pipeline for camera registration and adjustment of both camera poses and depths, followed by back-projection. We also introduce a novel notion of an expected surface in Gaussian splatting, which is critical to our optimization. These steps enable a coarse solution, which can then be low-pass filtered and refined using standard optimization methods. We demonstrate results on the Tanks and Temples and Static Hikes datasets with as few as three widely-spaced views, showing significantly better quality than competing methods, including those with approximate camera pose information. Moreover, our results improve with more views and outperform previous InstantNGP and Gaussian Splatting algorithms even when using half the dataset.</description>

      <title>View-Independent Adjoint Light Tracing for Lighting Design Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentiable rendering methods promise the ability to optimize various parameters of 3d scenes to achieve a desired result. However, lighting design has so far received little attention in this field. In this paper, we introduce a method that enables continuous optimization of the arrangement of luminaires in a 3d scene via differentiable light tracing. Our experiments show two major issues when attempting to apply existing methods from differentiable path tracing to this problem: first, many rendering methods produce images, which restricts the ability of a designer to define lighting objectives to image space. Second, most previous methods are designed for scene geometry or material optimization and have not been extensively tested for the case of optimizing light sources. Currently available differentiable ray-tracing methods do not provide satisfactory performance, even on fairly basic test cases in our experience. In this paper, we propose a novel adjoint light tracing method that overcomes these challenges and enables gradient-based lighting design optimization in a view-independent (camera-free) way. Thus, we allow the user to paint illumination targets directly onto the 3d scene or use existing baked illumination data (e.g., light maps). Using modern ray-tracing hardware, we achieve interactive performance. We find light tracing advantageous over path tracing in this setting, as it naturally handles irregular geometry, resulting in less noise and improved optimization convergence. We compare our adjoint gradients to state-of-the-art image-based differentiable rendering methods. We also demonstrate that our gradient data works with various common optimization algorithms, providing good convergence behaviour. Qualitative comparisons with real-world scenes underline the practical applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>TensoSDF: Roughness-aware Tensorial Representation for Robust Geometry and Material Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing objects with realistic materials from multi-view images is problematic, since it is highly ill-posed. Although the neural reconstruction approaches have exhibited impressive reconstruction ability, they are designed for objects with specific materials (e.g., diffuse or specular materials). To this end, we propose a novel framework for robust geometry and material reconstruction, where the geometry is expressed with the implicit signed distance field (SDF) encoded by a tensorial representation, namely TensoSDF. At the core of our method is the roughness-aware incorporation of the radiance and reflectance fields, which enables a robust reconstruction of objects with arbitrary reflective materials. Furthermore, the tensorial representation enhances geometry details in the reconstructed surface and reduces the training time. Finally, we estimate the materials using an explicit mesh for efficient intersection computation and an implicit SDF for accurate representation. Consequently, our method can achieve more robust geometry reconstruction, outperform the previous works in terms of relighting quality, and reduce 50% training times and 70% inference time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce vertex block descent, a block coordinate descent solution for the variational form of implicit Euler through vertex-level Gauss-Seidel iterations. It operates with local vertex position updates that achieve reductions in global variational energy with maximized parallelism. This forms a physics solver that can achieve numerical convergence with unconditional stability and exceptional computation performance. It can also fit in a given computation budget by simply limiting the iteration count while maintaining its stability and superior convergence rate.
  We present and evaluate our method in the context of elastic body dynamics, providing details of all essential components and showing that it outperforms alternative techniques. In addition, we discuss and show examples of how our method can be used for other simulation systems, including particle-based simulations and rigid bodies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on billions of image-text pairs have recently enabled 3D content creation by optimizing a randomly initialized differentiable 3D representation with score distillation. However, the optimization process suffers slow convergence and the resultant 3D models often exhibit two limitations: (a) quality concerns such as missing attributes and distorted shape and texture; (b) extremely low diversity comparing to text-guided image synthesis. In this paper, we show that the conflict between the 3D optimization process and uniform timestep sampling in score distillation is the main reason for these limitations. To resolve this conflict, we propose to prioritize timestep sampling with monotonically non-increasing functions, which aligns the 3D optimization process with the sampling process of diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that our simple redesign significantly improves 3D content creation with faster convergence, better quality and diversity.</description>

      <title>SCULPT: Shape-Conditioned Unpaired Learning of Pose-dependent Clothed and Textured Human Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SCULPT, a novel 3D generative model for clothed and textured 3D meshes of humans. Specifically, we devise a deep neural network that learns to represent the geometry and appearance distribution of clothed human bodies. Training such a model is challenging, as datasets of textured 3D meshes for humans are limited in size and accessibility. Our key observation is that there exist medium-sized 3D scan datasets like CAPE, as well as large-scale 2D image datasets of clothed humans and multiple appearances can be mapped to a single geometry. To effectively learn from the two data modalities, we propose an unpaired learning procedure for pose-dependent clothed and textured human meshes. Specifically, we learn a pose-dependent geometry space from 3D scan data. We represent this as per vertex displacements w.r.t. the SMPL model. Next, we train a geometry conditioned texture generator in an unsupervised way using the 2D image data. We use intermediate activations of the learned geometry model to condition our texture generator. To alleviate entanglement between pose and clothing type, and pose and clothing appearance, we condition both the texture and geometry generators with attribute labels such as clothing types for the geometry, and clothing colors for the texture generator. We automatically generated these conditioning labels for the 2D images based on the visual question answering model BLIP and CLIP. We validate our method on the SCULPT dataset, and compare to state-of-the-art 3D generative models for clothed human bodies.

      <title>The Chosen One: Consistent Characters in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generation models have unlocked vast potential for visual creativity. However, these models struggle with generation of consistent characters, a crucial aspect for numerous real-world applications such as story visualization, game development asset design, advertising, and more. Current methods typically rely on multiple pre-existing images of the target character or involve labor-intensive manual processes. In this work, we propose a fully automated solution for consistent character generation, with the sole input being a text prompt. We introduce an iterative procedure that, at each stage, identifies a coherent set of images sharing a similar identity and extracts a more consistent identity from this set. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that our method strikes a better balance between prompt alignment and identity consistency compared to the baseline methods, and these findings are reinforced by a user study. To conclude, we showcase several practical applications of our approach. Project page is available at https://omriavrahami.com/the-chosen-one</description>

      <title>Spice-E : Structural Priors in 3D Diffusion using Cross-Entity Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are witnessing rapid progress in automatically generating and manipulating 3D assets due to the availability of pretrained text-image diffusion models. However, time-consuming optimization procedures are required for synthesizing each sample, hindering their potential for democratizing 3D content creation. Conversely, 3D diffusion models now train on million-scale 3D datasets, yielding high-quality text-conditional 3D samples within seconds. In this work, we present Spice-E - a neural network that adds structural guidance to 3D diffusion models, extending their usage beyond text-conditional generation. At its core, our framework introduces a cross-entity attention mechanism that allows for multiple entities (in particular, paired input and guidance 3D shapes) to interact via their internal representations within the denoising network. We utilize this mechanism for learning task-specific structural priors in 3D diffusion models from auxiliary guidance shapes. We show that our approach supports a variety of applications, including 3D stylization, semantic shape editing and text-conditional abstraction-to-3D, which transforms primitive-based abstractions into highly-expressive shapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Spice-E achieves SOTA performance over these tasks while often being considerably faster than alternative methods. Importantly, this is accomplished without tailoring our approach for any specific task.</description>

      <title>Mocap Everyone Everywhere: Lightweight Motion Capture With Smartwatches and a Head-Mounted Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lightweight and affordable motion capture method based on two smartwatches and a head-mounted camera. In contrast to the existing approaches that use six or more expert-level IMU devices, our approach is much more cost-effective and convenient. Our method can make wearable motion capture accessible to everyone everywhere, enabling 3D full-body motion capture in diverse environments. As a key idea to overcome the extreme sparsity and ambiguities of sensor inputs with different modalities, we integrate 6D head poses obtained from the head-mounted cameras for motion estimation. To enable capture in expansive indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose an algorithm to track and update floor level changes to define head poses, coupled with a multi-stage Transformer-based regression module. We also introduce novel strategies leveraging visual cues of egocentric images to further enhance the motion capture quality while reducing ambiguities. We demonstrate the performance of our method on various challenging scenarios, including complex outdoor environments and everyday motions including object interactions and social interactions among multiple individuals.</description>

      <title>Recent Trends in 3D Reconstruction of General Non-Rigid Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing models of the real world, including 3D geometry, appearance, and motion of real scenes, is essential for computer graphics and computer vision. It enables the synthesizing of photorealistic novel views, useful for the movie industry and AR/VR applications. It also facilitates the content creation necessary in computer games and AR/VR by avoiding laborious manual design processes. Further, such models are fundamental for intelligent computing systems that need to interpret real-world scenes and actions to act and interact safely with the human world. Notably, the world surrounding us is dynamic, and reconstructing models of dynamic, non-rigidly moving scenes is a severely underconstrained and challenging problem. This state-of-the-art report (STAR) offers the reader a comprehensive summary of state-of-the-art techniques with monocular and multi-view inputs such as data from RGB and RGB-D sensors, among others, conveying an understanding of different approaches, their potential applications, and promising further research directions. The report covers 3D reconstruction of general non-rigid scenes and further addresses the techniques for scene decomposition, editing and controlling, and generalizable and generative modeling. More specifically, we first review the common and fundamental concepts necessary to understand and navigate the field and then discuss the state-of-the-art techniques by reviewing recent approaches that use traditional and machine-learning-based neural representations, including a discussion on the newly enabled applications. The STAR is concluded with a discussion of the remaining limitations and open challenges.</description>

      <title>MoA: Mixture-of-Attention for Subject-Context Disentanglement in Personalized Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new architecture for personalization of text-to-image diffusion models, coined Mixture-of-Attention (MoA). Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts mechanism utilized in large language models (LLMs), MoA distributes the generation workload between two attention pathways: a personalized branch and a non-personalized prior branch. MoA is designed to retain the original model's prior by fixing its attention layers in the prior branch, while minimally intervening in the generation process with the personalized branch that learns to embed subjects in the layout and context generated by the prior branch. A novel routing mechanism manages the distribution of pixels in each layer across these branches to optimize the blend of personalized and generic content creation. Once trained, MoA facilitates the creation of high-quality, personalized images featuring multiple subjects with compositions and interactions as diverse as those generated by the original model. Crucially, MoA enhances the distinction between the model's pre-existing capability and the newly augmented personalized intervention, thereby offering a more disentangled subject-context control that was previously unattainable.

      <title>Configurable Learned Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of advancing holographic display technology, we face a unique yet persistent roadblock: the inflexibility of learned holography in adapting to various hardware configurations. This is due to the variances in the complex optical components and system settings in existing holographic displays. Although the emerging learned approaches have enabled rapid and high-quality hologram generation, any alteration in display hardware still requires a retraining of the model. Our work introduces a configurable learned model that interactively computes 3D holograms from RGB-only 2D images for a variety of holographic displays. The model can be conditioned to predefined hardware parameters of existing holographic displays such as working wavelengths, pixel pitch, propagation distance, and peak brightness without having to retrain. In addition, our model accommodates various hologram types, including conventional single-color and emerging multi-color holograms that simultaneously use multiple color primaries in holographic displays. Notably, we enabled our hologram computations to rely on identifying the correlation between depth estimation and 3D hologram synthesis tasks within the learning domain for the first time in the literature. We employ knowledge distillation via a student-teacher learning strategy to streamline our model for interactive performance. Achieving up to a 2x speed improvement compared to state-of-the-art models while consistently generating high-quality 3D holograms with different hardware configurations.</description>
