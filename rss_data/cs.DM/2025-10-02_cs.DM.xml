      <title>Exploring one-dimensional, binary, radius-2 cellular automata, over cyclic configurations, in terms of their ability to solve decision problems by distributed consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing the ability of automata networks to solve decision problems has received a continuous attention in the literature, and specially with the automata reaching the answer by distributed consensus, i.e., their all taking on a same state, out of two. In the case of binary automata networks, regardless of the kind of update employed, the networks should display only two possible attractors, the fixed points $0^L$ and $1^L$, for all cyclic configurations of size $L$. A previous investigation into the space of one-dimensional, binary, radius-2 cellular automata identified a restricted subset of rules as potential solvers of decision problems, but the reported results were incomplete and lacked sufficient detail for replication. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive reevaluation of the entire radius-2 rule space, by filtering it with all configuration sizes from 5 to 20, according to their basins of attraction being formed by only the two expected fixed points. A set of over fifty-four thousand potential decision problem solvers were then obtained. Among these, more than forty-five thousand were associated with 3 well-defined decision problems, and precise formal explanations were provided for over forty thousand of them. The remaining candidate rules suggest additional problem classes yet to be fully characterised. Overall, this work substantially extends the understanding of radius-2 cellular automata, offering a more complete picture of their capacity to solve decision problems by consensus.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Necklace Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The necklace splitting problem is a classic problem in fair division with many applications, including data-informed fair hash maps. We extend necklace splitting to a dynamic setting, allowing for relocation, insertion, and deletion of beads. We present linear-time, optimal algorithms for the two-color case that support all dynamic updates. For more than two colors, we give linear-time, optimal algorithms for relocation subject to a restriction on the number of agents. Finally, we propose a randomized algorithm for the two-color case that handles all dynamic updates, guarantees approximate fairness with high probability, and runs in polylogarithmic time when the number of agents is small.</description>

      <title>Throttling for metric dimension and its variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric dimension is a graph parameter that has been applied to robot navigation and finding low-dimensional vector embeddings. Throttling entails minimizing the sum of two available resources when solving certain graph problems. In this paper, we introduce throttling for metric dimension, edge metric dimension, and mixed metric dimension. In the context of vector embeddings, metric dimension throttling finds a low-dimensional, low-magnitude embedding with integer coordinates. We show that computing the throttling number is NP-hard for all three variants. We give formulas for the throttling numbers of special families of graphs, and characterize graphs with extremal throttling numbers. We also prove that the minimum possible throttling number of a graph of order $n$ is $\Theta\left(\frac{\log{n}}{\log{\log{n}}}\right)$, while the minimum possible throttling number of a tree of order $n$ is $\Theta(n^{1/3})$ or $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ depending on the variant of metric dimension.</description>

      <title>Cube Height, Cube Width and Related Extremal Problems for Posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a poset $P$, a family $\mathcal{S}=\{S_x:x\in P\}$ of sets indexed by the elements of $P$ is called an inclusion representation of $P$ if $x\leqslant y$ in $P$ if and only if $S_x\subseteq S_y$. The cube height of a poset is the least non-negative integer $h$ such that $P$ has an inclusion representation for which every set has size at most $h$. In turn, the cube width of $P$ is the least non-negative integer $w$ for which there is an inclusion representation $\mathcal{S}$ of $P$ such that $|\bigcup\mathcal{S}|=w$ and every set in $\mathcal{S}$ has size at most the cube height of $P$. In this paper, we show that the cube width of a poset never exceeds the size of its ground set, and we characterize those posets for which this inequality is tight. Our research prompted us to investigate related extremal problems for posets and inclusion representations. Accordingly, the results for cube width are obtained as extensions of more comprehensive results that we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Computability of extender sets in multidimensional subshifts: asymptotic growths, dynamical constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subshifts are sets of colorings of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ defined by families of forbidden patterns. In a given subshift, the extender set of a finite pattern is the set of all its admissible completions. Since soficity of $\mathbb{Z}$ subshifts is equivalent to having a finite number of extender sets, it had been conjectured that the number of extender sets could provide a way to separate the classes of sofic and effective subshifts in higher dimensions. We investigate some computational characterizations of extender sets in multidimensional subshifts, and in particular their growth, in terms of extender entropies (arXiv:1711.07515) and extender entropy dimensions. We prove here that sofic and effective subshifts have the same possible extender entropies (exactly the $\Pi_3$-computable real numbers of $[0,+\infty)$) and extender entropy dimensions, and investigate the computational complexity of these growth-type quantities under various dynamical and combinatorial constraints.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10088v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a result of 33 intercontinental Zoom calls, we characterise big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order. This is an infinitary extension of the well known fact that finite partial orders endowed with linear extensions form a Ramsey class (this result was announced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\"odl in 1984 with first published proof by Paoli, Trotter and Walker in 1985). Towards this, we refine earlier upper bounds obtained by Hubi\v{c}ka based on a new connection of big Ramsey degrees to the Carlson-Simpson theorem and we also introduce a new technique of giving lower bounds using an iterated application of the upper-bound theorem.</description>

      <title>Outerplanar and Forest Storyplans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of gradually representing a complex graph as a sequence of drawings of small subgraphs whose union is the complex graph. The sequence of drawings is called \emph{storyplan}, and each drawing in the sequence is called a \emph{frame}. In an (outer)planar storyplan, every frame is (outer)planar; in a forest storyplan, every frame is acyclic. It is known that every graph of treewidth at most 3 admits a planar storyplan and that deciding whether a given graph admits a planar storyplan is NP-complete [Binucci et al., JCSS, 2024].
  We first prove that deciding whether a given graph admits an outerplanar storyplan (or a forest storyplan) is NP-complete. Then, we show that the FPT algorithms of Binucci et al. also work for our problem variants with small modifications. We identify graph families that admit outerplanar and forest storyplans and families for which such storyplans do not always exist. In the affirmative case, we present efficient algorithms that produce straight-line storyplans.</description>

      <title>Twenty years of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17293v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, structural Ramsey theory emerged as a new branch of combinatorics. This development came with the isolation of the concepts of the $\mathbf{A}$-Ramsey property and Ramsey class. Following the influential Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\"odl theorem, several Ramsey classes have been identified. In the 1980s, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, inspired by a seminar of Lachlan, discovered a crucial connection between Ramsey classes and Fra\"iss\'e classes, and, in his 1989 paper, connected the classification programme of homogeneous structures to structural Ramsey theory. In 2005, Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c revitalized the field by connecting Ramsey classes to topological dynamics. This breakthrough motivated Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il to propose a program for classifying Ramsey classes. We review the progress made on this program in the past two decades, list open problems, and discuss recent extensions to new areas, namely the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA), and big Ramsey structures.</description>

      <title>Unique expansions in number systems via refinement equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the subdivision schemes theory, we develop a criterion to check if any natural number has at most one representation in the $n$-ary number system with a set of non-negative integer digits $A=\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\}$ that contains zero. This uniqueness property is shown to be equivalent to a certain restriction on the roots of the trigonometric polynomial $\sum_{k=1}^n e^{-2\pi i a_k t}$. From this criterion, under a natural condition of irreducibility for $A$, we deduce that in case of prime $n$ the uniqueness holds if and only if the digits of $A$ are distinct modulo $n$, whereas for any composite $n$ we show that the latter condition is not necessary. We also establish the connection of this uniqueness to the semigroup freeness problem for affine integer functions of equal integer slope; this together with the two criteria allows to fill the gap in the work of D. Klarner on the question of P. Erd\"os about densities of affine integer orbits and establish a simple algorithm to check the freeness and the positivity of density when the slope is a prime number.</description>

      <title>A Compendium of Subset Search Problems and Reductions relating to the Parsimonious Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This thesis centers around the concept of Subset Search Problems (SSP), a type of computational problem introduced by Gr\"une and Wulf to analyze the complexity of more intricate optimization problems. These problems are given an input set, a so-called universe, and their solution lies within their own universe, e.g. the shortest path between two point is a subset of all possible paths. Due to this, reductions upholding the SSP property require an injective embedding from the universe of the first problem into that of the second. This, however, appears inherently similar to the concept of a Parsimonious reduction, a reduction type requiring a bijective function between the solution spaces of the two problems. Parsimonious reductions are mainly used within the complexity class #P, as this class of problems concerns itself with the number of possible solutions in a given problem. These two concepts, SSP and Parsimonious reductions, are inherently similar but, crucially, not equivalent. We therefore explore the interplay between reductions upholding the SSP and Parsimonious properties, highlighting both the similarities and differences by providing a comprehensive theorem delineating the properties required for reductions to uphold both attributes. We also compile and evaluate 46 reductions between 30 subset search variants of computational problems, including those of classic NP-complete problems such as Satisfiability, Vertex Cover, Hamiltonian Cycle, the Traveling Salesman Problem and Subset Sum, providing reduction proofs, illustrative examples and insights as to where the SSP and Parsimonious properties coexist or diverge. With this compendium we contribute to the understanding of the computational complexity of bilevel and robust optimization problems, by contributing a vast collection of proven SSP- and #P-complete problems.</description>
