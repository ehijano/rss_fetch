      <title>Gravitational Torques from a Lopsided Young Stellar Component Sustain High Black Hole Accretion in NGC 4593</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow primarily through gas accretion, observed as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While mergers can drive luminous AGN episodes, secular processes may fuel a substantial portion of cosmic BH growth. Whether these mechanisms can sustain high BH accretion rates remains uncertain. This study aims to identify the secular mechanism driving high BH accretion rates, by targeting a galaxy with moderately massive SMBH, high central gas densities, accretion rates of a few percent of the Eddington limit, and gas kinematics resolved close to black hole-dominated scales. A blind search led to the identification of NGC 4593, which is representative of the AGN population driving BH mass density growth since $z=1$. A prominent single-arm ("$m=1$") molecular gas spiral with ${\rm log}\,M_{\rm mol}/{\rm M}_\odot=8.1\pm0.3$ extends from 1.3$\,$kpc down to the SMBH's sphere of influence ($1.7^{+0.5}_{-0.2}\,{\rm pc}$). Star formation in the spiral is inefficient (${\rm SFR} = 4.9 \times 10^{-2} \,{\rm M}_\odot {\rm /yr}$, $\langle t_{\rm dep}\rangle=3.9 \pm 0.6\,\rm{Gyr}$), whereas inflow rate exceeds the SFR by two orders of magnitude and is sufficient to sustain the current BH accretion rate for $\geq$35$\,$Myr, enabling $\sim$10% SMBH growth. A young, lopsided stellar component (${\rm log}\,M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot=7.5-9.3$) exerts torques on the molecular gas, likely driving the gas inflow. This young stellar component may serve as both a cause and a product of sustained gas funnelling towards the SMBH. These findings provide evidence for the sustained secular $m=1$ feeding mode at high BH accretion rates, linking kpc-scale gas dynamics to the black hole's sphere of influence. This mechanism, consistent with simulation predictions, may represent a key contributor to SMBH growth in luminous AGNs since cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Posteriors with Stellar Population Synthesis on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) provide a predictive framework for the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy. SPS predictions can be computationally intensive, creating a bottleneck for attempts to infer the physical properties of large populations of individual galaxies from their SEDs and photometry; these computational challenges are especially daunting for near-future cosmology surveys that will measure the photometry of billions of galaxies. In this paper, we explore a range of computational techniques aimed at accelerating SPS predictions of galaxy photometry using the JAX library to target GPUs. We study a particularly advantageous approximation to the calculation of galaxy photometry that speeds up the computation by a factor of 50 relative to the exact calculation. We introduce a novel technique for incorporating burstiness into models of galaxy star formation history that captures very short-timescale fluctuations with negligible increase in computation time. We study the performance of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms in which individual chains are parallelized across independent GPU threads, finding that our pipeline can carry out Bayesian inference at a rate of approximately $1,000$ galaxy posteriors per GPU-minute. Our results provide an update to standard benchmarks in the literature on the computational demands of SPS inference; our publicly available code enables previously-impractical Bayesian analyses of large galaxy samples, and includes several standalone modules that could be adopted to speedup existing SPS pipelines.</description>

      <title>The HST-Gaia Near-Infrared Astrometric Reference Frame near the Milky Way Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first high-precision proper motion catalog, tied to the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS), of infrared astrometric reference stars within R $\leq$ 25" (1 pc) of the central supermassive black hole at the Galactic center (GC). This catalog contains $\sim$2,900 sources in a highly extinguished region that is inaccessible via Gaia. New astrometric measurements are extracted from HST observations (14 epochs, 2010 - 2023) and transformed into the ICRS using 40 stars in common with Gaia-DR3. We implement a new method for modeling proper motions via Gaussian Processes that accounts for systematic errors, greatly improving measurement accuracy. Proper motion and position measurements reach precisions of $\sim$0.03 mas/yr and $\sim$0.11 mas, respectively, representing a factor of $\sim$20x improvement over previous ICRS proper motion catalogs in the region. These measurements define a novel HST-Gaia reference frame that is consistent with Gaia-CRF3 to within 0.025 mas/yr in proper motion and 0.044 mas in position, making it the first ICRS-based reference frame precise enough to probe the distribution of extended mass within the orbits of stars near SgrA*. In addition, HST-Gaia provides an independent test of the radio measurements of stellar masers that form the basis of current GC reference frames. We find that the HST-Gaia and radio measurements are consistent to within 0.041 mas/yr in proper motion and 0.54 mas in position at 99.7% confidence. Gaia-DR4 is expected to reduce the HST-Gaia reference frame uncertainties by another factor of $\sim$2x, further improving the reference frame for dynamical studies.</description>

      <title>Open Cluster Members in the APOGEE DR17. I. Dynamics and Star Members</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Open clusters are groups of stars formed from the same cloud of gas and cosmic dust. They play an important role in studying stars' formation and evolution and understanding galaxies' structure and dynamics. Aims. The main objective of this work is to identify stars that belong to open clusters using astrometric data from Gaia EDR3 and spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17. Furthermore, we investigate the metallicity gradients and orbital properties of the open clusters in our sample. Methods. By applying the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to this data, we identified observed stars in our galaxy with similar dynamics, chemical compositions, and ages. The orbits of the open clusters were also calculated using the GravPot16 code. Results. We found 1987 stars belonging to 49 open clusters, and 941 of these stars have probabilities above 80 % of belonging to open clusters. Our metallicity gradient presents a two-slope shape for two measures of different Galactic center distances, the projected Galactocentric distance, and the guiding center radius to the Galactic Center, as already reported in previous work. However, when we separate the open clusters by age, we observe no significant difference in the metallicity gradient slope beyond a certain distance from the Galactic center. Our results show a shallower gradient for clusters younger than 2 Gyr than those older than 2 Gyr. All our OCs dynamically assemble the Disk-like population very well, and they are in prograde orbits, which is typical for disk-like populations. Some OCs resonate with the Galactic bar at the Lagrange points L4 and L5.</description>

      <title>Predicting wide binaries and deviations from standard gravity using machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) framework for the detection of wide binary star systems and the identification of deviations from standard gravity using Gaia DR3 data. By training supervised ML models on established wide binary catalogues, we efficiently classify wide binaries and employ clustering and nearest neighbour search to pair candidate systems. We recast the problem of identifying systematic deviations from standard gravity as a supervised anomaly detection. Our approach incorporates data preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE, correlation analysis, and PCA, and achieves high accuracy and recall in both binary classification and anomaly detection tasks. The resulting publicly available code enables rapid, scalable, and customizable analysis of wide binaries and gravitational anomalies, complementing conventional analyses and providing a valuable resource for future astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Shaping Galactic Habitability: the impact of stellar migration and gas giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In exoplanet research, the focus is increasingly on identifying Earth analogs, planets similar in density and habitability potential. As the number of rocky exoplanets grows, parallel discussions have emerged on system architectures and Galactic environments that may support life, drawing comparisons to our own Earth. This has brought renewed attention to the concept of the Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ) as a broader context for interpreting the diversity of planetary environments. This study is the first to use detailed chemical evolution models to investigate the impact of stellar migration, modeled through a parametric approach, on the GHZ. Our findings reveal that stellar migration significantly enhances the number of stars capable of hosting habitable planets in the outer Galactic regions, with an increase of up to a factor of five at 18 kpc relative to a baseline value of unity at 6 kpc. Furthermore, we explore a novel scenario where the presence of gas giant planets increases the probability for the formation of terrestrial ones. We find that this increased probability is higher in the inner Galactic disc, but is also mitigated by stellar migration. In particular, at the present time, the number of FGK stars hosting terrestrial planets with minimum habitability conditions in the ring centered at 4 kpc is approximately 1.4 times higher than in scenarios where gas giants are assumed to hinder the formation and evolution of Earth-like planets. Without stellar migration, this factor increases to 1.5. Even larger ratios are predicted for terrestrial planets orbiting retired A stars, reaching 2.8 in models with stellar migration and 3.3 in models without it.</description>

      <title>GAMA 526784: the progenitor of a globular cluster-rich ultra-diffuse galaxy? II. Molecular gas, neutral gas and environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We investigate the gas reservoirs, star formation (SF) properties, and environment of the ultra-diffuse galaxy GAMA526784 to understand its formation history, the efficiency of molecular gas conversion into stars, and the possible role of an interacting companion in shaping its morphology. Methods. We analyse low and high-resolution CO observations to constrain the molecular gas content, compare with HI data, and examine the SF efficiency of GAMA526784. The potential influence of a newly identified nearby dwarf galaxy is assessed using photometric and spatial information. Results. GAMA526784 exhibits a regular HI reservoir (M_HI/M* = 2.88) but only upper limits on its molecular gas mass (M_H2(5sigma)/M* &lt; 0.23). The HI reservoir and CO non-detection can be explained by several mechanisms: (1) predominance of CO-dark H2, invisible to CO observations but contributing to SF; (2) a time delay in HI-to-H2 conversion following a recent interaction; or (3) elevated turbulence inhibiting gas collapse. An identified companion, found at a projected distance of 48 kpc, shows similar colours and lies in the direction of young star clusters in GAMA526784, indicating a possible association. We hypothesise this companion may have triggered the formation of star clusters in GAMA526784 through a high-velocity encounter. Conclusions. Our findings suggest GAMA526784 may have undergone an interaction that influenced its gas reservoirs and SF activity. The presence of a nearby companion agrees with predictions of a high-speed encounter, potentially offering a rare example of such an interaction in progress. We suggest this encounter may have shaped the system's recent evolution. Future observations, particularly targeting molecular gas tracers beyond CO and resolved HI maps, will be crucial in determining the extent of GAMA526784's cold gas reservoir and the nature of its recent star formation.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Morphology Classification: Are Stellar Circularities Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a preliminary study exploring whether the stellar orbital circularity of simulated galaxies, available from precomputed catalogs in the IllustrisTNG project, can be used as a proxy for broad morphological classification. We focus on the publicly available "Stellar Circularities, Angular Momenta, Axis Ratios" catalog, which enables a simple kinematic decomposition of the stellar component into disk and spheroid subsystems. By validating this approach against the more detailed five-component kinematic decomposition in TNG50, we confirm that the circularity-based disk fraction correlates most strongly with the thin disk, while the bulge fraction broadly represents the combined contribution of classical bulges and stellar halos. We then apply this decomposition to galaxies in the TNG100 simulation at redshift $z=0$ and identify a data-motivated threshold of $\mathrm{F_{disk}} = 0.25$ to distinguish early- and late-type galaxies. This threshold, lower than the commonly adopted value of $0.4$, better captures the diversity of disk-dominated systems and avoids excluding galaxies with moderately prominent disks. Additionally, we identify irregular or morphologically complex systems based on galaxies with low total disk and spheroid mass fractions. Using this classification, we recover a morphology-density relation that is broadly consistent with observations: late-type galaxies dominate in the field, while early-type galaxies are the most prevalent morphological type in clusters. Our results demonstrate that stellar circularity alone can serve as an accessible and computationally efficient morphological proxy. We also discuss the potential for this classification to support machine learning efforts as a baseline or training set for future morphological studies.</description>

      <title>Investigating silicate, carbon, and water in the diffuse interstellar medium: the first shots from WISCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dusty interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way is distributed in a complex, cloudy structure. It is fundamental to the radiation balance within the Milky Way, provides a reaction surface to form complex molecules, and is the feedstock for future generations of stars and planets. The life cycle of interstellar dust is not completely understood, and neither are its structure nor composition. The abundance, composition, and structure of dust in the diffuse ISM can be determined by combining infrared, optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy. JWST enables measurement of the faint absorption of ISM dust grains against bright stars at kiloparsec distances across the infrared spectrum. Here we present an overview of the project `Webb Investigation of Silicates, Carbons, and Ices' (WISCI) along with interpretation of two targets, GSC 08152-02121 and CPD-59 5831. Observations of 12 WISCI target stars were taken by JWST, the Hubble Space Telescope, Himalayan Chandra Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We use these to characterize the targets' spectral types and calculate their line-of-sight extinction parameters, $A_{\rm V}$ and $R_{\rm V}$. We find absorption in the JWST spectra of GSC 08152-02121, and CPD-59 5831 associated with carbonaceous dust around 3.4 and 6.2 micron and amorphous silicates at 9.7 micron. In GSC 08152-02121 we also find indications of absorption by trapped water around 3 micron. This first look from WISCI demonstrates the line-of-sight variability within the sample, and the program's potential to identify and correlate features across ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Morphology Radio Sources from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS): Radio, Mid-infrared and Environmental Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid morphology radio sources (HyMoRSs) are a rare subclass of radio galaxies that display a Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR I) morphology on one side of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a type II (FR II) morphology on the other. These unique sources provide valuable insights into the physical mechanisms behind the FR dichotomy. In this study, we report the discovery of thirty-six new HyMoRSs, marking the largest collection of such sources in the southern sky to date, using data obtained from the MeerKAT absorption line survey (MALS). The identified HyMoRSs exhibit moderate radio luminosities, with a median value of 4.4 $\times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 1.4 GHz, and are located within the redshift range 0.04 &lt; z &lt; 1.34. To gain further insights into their origin, we also investigate the mid-infrared properties and environments of their host galaxies. Notably, nine out of the thirty-six sources are situated near the centers of galaxy clusters, including one with giant radio jets that extend over 811 kpc. Our analysis reveals that the majority of HyMoRSs are high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs), hosted by actively star-forming galaxies that exhibit elevated star formation rates. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hybrid morphology may arise from FR II jets being deflected by a dense, cluster-like environment, along with orientation effects that make one jet appear FR I-like. As our candidates are selected through visual inspection of MALS radio maps, higher-resolution follow-up observations are still necessary to confirm the nature of their morphologies.</description>

      <title>High resolution ALMA observations of H$_2$S in LIRGS (Dense gas and shocks in outflows and CNDs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular gas plays a critical role in regulating star formation and nuclear activity in galaxies. Sulphur bearing molecules, such as H2S, are sensitive to the physical and chemical environments in which they reside and are potential tracers of shocked, dense gas in galactic outflows and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We aim to investigate the origin of H2S emission and its relation to dense gas and outflow activity in the central regions of nearby infrared luminous galaxies. We present ALMA Band 5 observations of the ortho H2S 1(1,0) 1(0,1) transition in three nearby galaxies: NGC 1377, NGC 4418, and NGC 1266. We perform radiative transfer modelling using RADEX to constrain the physical conditions of the H2S emitting gas and compare the results to ancillary CO and continuum data. We detect compact H2S emission in all three galaxies, arising from regions smaller than approximately 150 parsecs. The H2S spectral profiles exhibit broad line wings, suggesting an association with outflowing or shocked gas. In NGC 4418, H2S also appears to be tracing gas that is counterrotating. A peculiar red shifted emission feature may correspond to inflowing gas, or possibly a slanted outflow. RADEX modelling indicates that the H2S emitting gas has high densities (molecular hydrogen density greater than 10^7 cm^-3) and moderately warm temperatures (between 40 and 200 Kelvin). The derived densities exceed those inferred from CO observations, implying that H2S traces denser regions of the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>MIRIS Pa{\alpha} Galactic Plane Survey. II. The Catalog of Pa{\alpha} Emission-line Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using data from the MIRIS Pa{\alpha} Galactic Plane Survey (MIPAPS), we present a Pa{\alpha} 1.87 um line image of the entire Galactic plane within the latitude range of -3{\deg} &lt; b &lt; +3{\deg}, revealing numerous Pa{\alpha} features. Based on the MIPAPS Pa{\alpha} image and the WISE H II region catalog, we compile a catalog of 1489 Pa{\alpha} emission-line sources in the Galactic plane within 90{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 330{\deg}. By comparing our Pa{\alpha} images with H{\alpha} images constructed from the IPHAS and VPHAS+ survey data, we demonstrate the advantages of Pa{\alpha} line observations. We identify 902 Pa{\alpha} sources associated with H II regions, and newly confirm 619 H II region candidates as definitive H II regions through Pa{\alpha} or H{\alpha} detections. We also identify 261 extended and 326 point-like Pa{\alpha} sources not included in the WISE catalog, most of which have H{\alpha} counterparts in the IPHAS or VPHAS+ images. A search of the SIMBAD database indicates that these sources originate from diverse object types. By measuring Pa{\alpha} and H{\alpha} fluxes, we estimate the E(B-V) color excesses derived from extended emissions for 138 Pa{\alpha} sources, showing good agreement with values obtained from spectrophotometry of ionizing stars in previous studies. Futhermore, we calculate total Lyman continuum luminosities for 42 Pa{\alpha} sources, providing constraints on the distances to H II regions and the spectral types of their ionizing stars. These results highlight the scientific potential of Pa{\alpha} line observations and the benefits of combining multiple hydrogen recombination lines in exploring ionized regions.</description>

      <title>Water vapour masers in long-period variable stars IV. Mira variables RCas, oCet and RLeo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Between 1987 and 2023 we carried out single-dish monitoring campaigns of water-maser emission at 22 GHz in the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of four stars: RCas, oCet, RLeo and ChiCyg. The variability in integrated flux in RCas and oCet followed that in the optical with the same period, but with a lag of about one-third in phase. RLeo was too often below our sensitivity threshold for us to determine a radio period. No maser was detected in ChiCyg. The variability in the masers in RCas has a distinctive pattern that confirms the existence of a zone in the CSE with favourable conditions for maser excitation. The total flux, modulated by the pulsations of the star, gradually increases to a maximum, which is followed by a similar decrease. This takes about 20 years. The pattern is repeated after an interval of quiescence of several years. During its decline, the variation in the flux resembles a damped harmonic oscillator. There are two dominant emission components that move almost tangentially on either side of the star with respect to the observer. The redshifted one is consistent with an origin in a single cloud that lived for at least about eight years, falling back towards the star. The blue component, moving in the CSE hemisphere nearest to us, has no drift in the line-of-sight velocity and appears to originate in a time series of short-living clouds with line-of-sight velocities within ca. 1 km/s of each other. No systematic drifts are found in RLeo and oCet. A few bursts of emission were detected in RCas and RLeo that lasted about a year and caused an increase in the flux density by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The velocity range of the maser emission is &lt; 10 km/s and is clearly correlated with the bolometric luminosity of the stars.</description>

      <title>Outflows from Star-Forming Galaxies in the Early Universe: Evolution from Double- to Single-Peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ Profiles Following Delayed Supernova Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyman-$ \alpha $ emission, which owing to its resonant nature strongly couples the emergent line profile to gas kinematics, has become a key observable for probing outflows from star-forming galaxies in the early universe. Typically, Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles are explained in terms of idealised expanding shell models, while empirically-motivated interpretations of Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles that make use of comparisons with kinematics revealed by other spectral features (e.g. metal emission and absorption lines) are limited. Here, we analyse the kinematics of emission/absorption lines in the spectra of 338 gravitationally-lensed Lyman-$ \alpha $ sources revealed via blind spectroscopy of galaxy clusters with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Using metal emission lines to measure systemic redshifts, we confirm that the Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles are consistent with outflowing gas. In cases where interstellar metal absorption lines are detected, we find their kinematics and line ratios to be indicative of clumpy outflows. We investigate the differences between sources with single- and double-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles, finding the latter to drive weaker outflows yet show spectral signatures suggestive of younger stellar ages ($ &lt; 4\,$Myr compared with $ &gt; 20\,$Myr for sources with single-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles). We argue that double-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles may reflect weaker feedback in extremely young starbursts due to the delayed onset of supernova explosions. We also investigate whether outflow properties can be reliably inferred by fitting simple expanding shell models. We find that these models yield unphysical parameters in many cases even when they can reproduce the Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles to high precision, and urge caution when inferring outflow properties from such models.</description>

      <title>Nucleosynthesis and the chemical enrichment of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars are fossils that retain the history of their host galaxies. Carbon and heavier elements are created inside stars and are ejected when they die. From the spatial distribution of elements in galaxies, it is therefore possible to constrain the physical processes during galaxy formation and evolution. This approach, Galactic archaeology, has been popularly used for our Milky Way Galaxy thanks to a vast amount of data from the Gaia satellite and multi-object spectrographs, and now can also be applied to very distant galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) - extra-galactic archaeology. In these studies the most important factor is the input stellar physics, namely nucleosynthesis yields and binary physics, which predominantly determine the model predictions. In this review I give a summary of stellar nucleosynthesis, and how they are tested with the observations in the Milky Way. Then I show how chemical enrichment of galaxies can be calculated, and show some results with the latest nucleosynthesis yields.</description>

      <title>The changing impact of radio jets as they evolve: The view from the cold gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) observations of a powerful young radio galaxy, PKS 0023-26, hosted by a far-infrared bright galaxy. The galaxy has a luminous optical AGN and a very extended distribution of molecular gas. We used these observations (together with available CO(2-1) data) to trace the impact of the AGN across the extent of the radio emission and beyond on scales of a few kpc. Despite the strength of the optical AGN, the kinematics of the cold molecular gas is strongly affected only in the central kpc, and is more weakly affected around the northern lobe. We found other signatures of the substantial impact of the radio AGN, however. Most notably, extreme line ratios of the CO transitions in a region aligned with the radio axis indicate conditions very different from those observed in the undisturbed gas at large radii. The non-detection of CO(1-0) at the location of the core of the radio source implies extreme conditions at this location. Furthermore, on the scale of a few kpc, the cold molecular gas appears to be wrapped around the northern radio lobe. This suggests that a strong jet-cloud interaction has depleted the northern lobe of molecular gas, perhaps as a result of the hot wind behind the jet-induced shock that shreds the clouds via hydrodynamic instabilities. The higher gas velocity dispersion and molecular excitation that we observed close to this location may then be the result of a milder interaction in which the expanding jet cocoon induces turbulence in the surrounding interstellar medium. These results highlight that the impact of an AGN can manifest itself not only in the kinematics of the gas, but also in molecular line ratios and in the distribution of the gas. Although the radio plasma and the cold molecular gas are clearly coupled, the kinetic energy that is transferred to the ISM is only a small fraction of the energy available from the AGN.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Photo-dissociation Regions. II. Aliphatic/Aromatic Carbonaceous Dust, Ices, and Gas Phase Spectral Line Inventory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20468v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the spectroscopic data obtained by the JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program 1192, "The Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts", including an inventory of the spatially resolved dust, gas, and molecular content in the Horsehead nebula and the NW filament of NGC~7023. We demonstrate the unique capability of this high spatial resolution data set to elucidate the evolution of gas and dust at the interface between stars and their natal clouds at the scale at which the physics and chemistry occur. The Disassociation Regions (PDRs) in the Horsehead nebula and the North West (NW) filament of NGC 7023 were mapped with a spectral resolution 1000-3000 and a spatial resolution of ~2e-4 pc between 0.97-28um. Spectra extracted from template regions yield a large number of atomic, ionized, and molecular lines. Full line lists and extracted spectra for all 10 regions are provided through CDS. Absorption from H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO ices are identified in 3 regions in NGC 7023. In this overview, we have focused on the spectral region between 3 and 5 um which is dominated by emission from aromatic and aliphatic carbon bonds to illustrate the power of the data set. We confirm the entrainment of aromatic carbonaceous species in the photo-evaporative flow from the PDR surface into the H\,{\sc{ii}} region in the Horsehead. No aliphatic emission is present in the outflow, indicating the complete removal of aliphatic bonds when exposed to strong UV fields. There is a clear detection of deuterium substitution in the carbon bonds. Aliphatic D-substitution is more efficient relative to aromatic D-substitution, ranging from N$_{D}$/N$_{H}$ ~ 0.1-0.3 for aliphatics compared to ~0.03 for the aromatics.</description>

      <title>The MALATANG survey: Dense gas distribution on sub-kiloparsec scales across the disk of M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 lines obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the MALATANG survey, combined with archival HCN J=1-0 and HCO^+ J=1-0 data from the Green Bank Telescope, to study the spatial distribution and excitation conditions of dense molecular gas in the disk of M82. We detect HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 emission within the central region (&lt; 500 pc) of the galaxy, while the J=1-0 emission lines exhibit a more extended spatial distribution (&gt; 700 pc). The dense gas shows a clear double-lobed structure in both spatial distribution and kinematics, with the HCN and HCO^+ J=4-3 lines in the southwest lobe blueshifted by ~ 40 km/s relative to the J=1-0 lines. The HCN J=4-3/1-0 and HCO^+ J=4-3/1-0 line-luminosity ratios range from 0.09 to 0.53 and from 0.14 to 0.87, respectively, with mean values of 0.18 +/- 0.04 and 0.36 +/- 0.06. The HCN ratio is lower than the typical average observed in nearby star-forming galaxies, whereas the HCO^+ ratio is comparatively higher, suggesting that the high-J HCN emission in M82 is significantly sub-thermally excited. Spatially, the peak values of the J=4-3/1-0 ratios are found in the northwest region of M82, coinciding with the galaxy-scale outflow. Elevated HCN/HCO^+ ratios are also detected in roughly the same area, potentially tracing local excitation enhancements driven by the outflow. The HCN/HCO^+ J=4-3 ratio across all detected regions ranges from 0.19 to 1.07 with a mean value of 0.41 +/- 0.11, which is significantly lower than the average J=1-0 ratio of 0.76 +/- 0.08. Both ratios are significantly lower than the average values observed in nearby star-forming galaxies, which could be related to the relatively low gas density and the presence of an extended photo-dissociation region in M82.</description>

      <title>Properties of the cores and filaments in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud and its L1688 hub-filament system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing filaments and cores in molecular clouds is key to understanding galactic star formation and its environmental dependence. This paper studies the properties and distribution of dense cores and filaments in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, with a focus on the L1688 hub-filament system (HFS) and its star formation potential. We extracted sources and filaments from Herschel images and a 13.5 arcsec resolution surface density map using the getsf method, identified prestellar cores among the extracted sources, evaluated core mass segregation, and constructed the core mass function (CMF). We derived properties of the filaments from their radial surface density profiles, constructed the filament linear density function (FLDF), and assessed the mass distribution in the L1688 HFS to estimate the core and filament formation efficiencies (CFE, FFE). The results suggest that the filament-dominated core formation is a key mechanism in star formation within the system.</description>

      <title>The VLA Frontier Fields Survey: A 6GHz High-resolution Radio Survey of Abell 2744</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 6GHz radio continuum image of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 ($z = 0.307$) obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) as part of the VLA Frontier Fields program, whose goal is to explore the radio continuum emission from high-redshift galaxies that are magnified by foreground, massive galaxy clusters. With an rms noise of $\approx 1 \mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, at the phase center, and sub-arcsec angular resolution ($\theta_{1/2}=0.82$ arcsec), this is the deepest and most detailed radio image of Abell 2744 ever obtained. A total of 93 sources are detected with a peak signal-to-noise ratio $\geq5$, of which 46 have optical/near-infrared (IR) counterparts with available redshift, magnification ($\mu$), and stellar mass (${M}_*$) estimates. The radio sources are distributed over a redshift from 0.15 to 3.55, with a median redshift value of $z = 0.93$, and a median stellar mass of ${M}_{*}= 2.3 \times 10^{10}\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$. A comparison between the radio-based star formation rates (SFRs) and those derived from ultraviolet-to-near IR data reveals that the radio SFRs are, on average, an order of magnitude higher than the ultraviolet-to-near IR SFRs. We look for radio counterparts of the so-called "Little Red Dots (LRDs)'' galaxies at $z\approx6$ in Abell 2744, but find no significant detections. After stacking, we derive a 3$\sigma$ upper limit to the 6GHz radio luminosity of LRDs of $4.1\times 10^{39}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Finally, we present a sample of 22 moderately/strongly lensed galaxies ($\mu \gtrsim 2$) in the VLA Frontier Fields survey, which is adequate to zoom into star formation processes of main sequence galaxies at $z\approx 1-2$.</description>

      <title>Not-quite-primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for the formation of seeds of supermassive black holes at early cosmic epochs. Enhanced density fluctuations with amplitudes that are not large enough to form primordial black holes post-inflation can still lead to collapsed dark matter halos at very early times. For halos forming prior to $1+z \approx 200$, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is energetic enough to suppress the formation of molecular hydrogen, hence preventing cooling and fragmentation, as a consequence of which baryons falling into the potential well of the halo may undergo "direct collapse" into a black hole. We show using a few illustrative models how this mechanism may account for the abundance of high-redshift black holes inferred from observations by the James Webb Space Telescope while remaining consistent with current limits from CMB spectral distortions. Limits on the primordial power spectrum are also derived by requiring that the universe not reionize too early.</description>

      <title>Perturbing AGN Accretion Disks with Stars and Moderately Massive Black Holes: Implications for Changing-Look AGN and Quasi-Periodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model that explains some extreme variability phenomena observed in active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this model, an orbiting companion interacts with the accretion disk surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). This interaction excites spiral density waves, leading to bursts of mass inflow lasting a few orbital timescales, whose mass content depends sensitively on the sphere of influence of the orbiting companion. To explain changing-look (CL) AGN, we find that lighter SMBH companions are necessary, while we generally exclude stellar companions. The moderately massive black hole perturber must be on a highly eccentric orbit in order to account for the non-repeating nature of most CL AGN. When applied to quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), we find that stars with highly eccentric orbits and close pericenter passages can produce accretion flares with QPE-like characteristics. For many QPEs, low-mass main-sequence stars or stripped-envelope stars are required. Although moderately massive black hole perturbers could also match the observed properties of QPEs, the gravitational-wave merger timescales of such binary systems are prohibitively short.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Diffuse Radio Emission in a Massive z=1.709 Cool Core Cluster: A Candidate Radio Mini-Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clusters of galaxies host spectacular diffuse radio sources, extending over scales from 100 kpc to several Mpcs. These sources, with extremely faint surface brightness ($\mu$Jy/arcsec$^2$ level), are not tied to individual galaxies but trace synchrotron emission from large-scale magnetic fields and relativistic particles within the intracluster environment. Here, we report the discovery of a candidate radio mini-halo in SpARCS104922.6+564032.5, the most distant cool-core galaxy cluster identified to date at $z=1.709$, using deep LOFAR 120-168 MHz observations. We show that this emission originates from diffuse cluster-associated processes rather than unresolved AGN or star-forming galaxies. The diffuse radio emission coincides spatially with the X-ray emission of the hot intracluster medium and has a radio power of $P_{\rm 150~MHz}=49.8^{+14.7}_{-11.7} \times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, exhibiting striking similarities to low-redshift radio mini-halos. This discovery doubles the redshift of previously known mini-halos, challenging models of inverse Compton losses and indicating the presence of strong magnetic fields, enhanced turbulence in high-redshift clusters, or active hadronic processes that require a cosmic ray-to-thermal energy ratio of 0.07 within 200 kpc, assuming a clumped distribution with spatial correlations among the gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic field that partially compensate for cosmological redshift dimming. It further implies that magnetic fields are efficiently amplified to $\sim$$10~\mu$G levels within a Mpc$^3$ volume during the epoch of cluster formation before $z\sim2$. These findings provide critical insights into high-redshift cluster physics and emphasize the transformative potential of next-generation radio surveys, such as those with the SKA and ngVLA, in exploring the early evolution of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Low-Luminosity Type IIP Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe. II: Lightcurve Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe survey yielded a sample of 330 Type IIP supernovae (SNe) with well-constrained peak luminosities. In paper I (arXiv:2502.19493), we measured their luminosity function and volumetric rate. Here (paper II), we present the largest systematic study of lightcurve properties for Type IIP SNe from a volume-limited survey, analyzing a selected subset of 129 events, including 16 low-luminosity Type IIP (LLIIP) SNe with M${r,peak} \geq -16$ mag. We find that plateau slope correlates with peak brightness, with many LLIIP SNe showing positive slopes--suggesting smaller progenitor radii and distinct density profiles compared to brighter Type IIP SNe. The plateau duration shows only a weak dependence on peak brightness, likely suggesting binary interaction. One SN exhibits a plateau-to-tail drop of &gt;3.5 mag, consistent with an electron-capture or failed SN with very low or zero nickel mass. We derive explosion and progenitor parameters of the entire Type IIP SN sample using semi-analytical and radiation-hydrodynamical models. Based on radiation-hydrodynamical model fitting, LLIIP SNe are characterized by low nickel masses (0.001-0.025 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), low explosion energies (0.1-0.28 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), low ejecta masses ($8.1^{+0.8}_{-1.7}$ $\mathrm{M\odot}$), and ZAMS masses below 11 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$. In comparison, the full Type IIP SN sample spans a wider range with nickel masses (0.001-0.222 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), explosion energies (0.10-4.43 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), ejecta masses (5.4-24.8 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), and ZAMS masses (9.3-16.7 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$). We find strong correlations between peak brightness, explosion energy, and nickel mass that extend to the low-luminosity end. We conclude that LLIIP SNe represent the faint, low-energy end of the Type IIP population and originate from the lowest-mass core-collapse progenitors.</description>

      <title>Empirically Predicted Absolute Magnitudes for Red Clump Stars in Mephisto and CSST Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red clump (RC) stars are reliable standard candles for studying the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. In this study, we present empirical calibrations of RC absolute magnitudes in the Mephisto (v, g, r, i) and CSST (g, r, i) photometric systems using a high-purity sample of 25,059 RC stars cross-matched between APOGEE and Gaia DR3 XP spectra. Through synthetic photometry and polynomial fitting, we find that RC absolute magnitudes exhibit strong dependencies on effective temperature and metallicity, with the strongest variations observed in bluer bands and progressively decreasing towards redder wavelengths. In particular, the Mephisto v band exhibits the highest sensitivity, with variations reaching up to 2.0 mag across the metallicity range (-1.0 dex &lt;[Fe/H] &lt;0.5 dex) and the temperature range (4500-5200 K). The calibrations achieve high precision for all bands, enabling accurate determination of RC absolute magnitudes and distances. Furthermore, we evaluate the metallicity estimation capabilities of both systems using a Random Forest-based method, achieving a precision of 0.12 dex for Mephisto and 0.14 dex for CSST under typical photometric uncertainties (&lt; 0.01 mag). These results provide robust tools for distance and metallicity determinations, supporting future Galactic structure studies with Mephisto and CSST data.</description>

      <title>Signatures of planets and Galactic subpopulations in solar analogs. Precise chemical abundances with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to obtain precise atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances automatically for solar twins and analogs to find signatures of exoplanets, as well as to assess how peculiar the Sun is compared to these stars and to analyze any possible fine structures in the Galactic thin disk. We developed a neural network (NN) algorithm using Python to obtain these parameters for a sample of 99 solar twins and solar analogs previously studied in the literature from normalized high-quality spectra from HARPS, with a resolving power of R $\sim$ 115000 and a signal-to-noise ratio S/N &gt; 400. We obtained precise atmospheric parameters and abundance ratios [X/Fe] of 20 chemical elements (Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba). The results are in line with the literature, with average differences and standard deviations of $(2 \pm 27)$ K for T$_{\rm eff}$, $(0.00 \pm 0.06)$ dex for log g, $(0.00 \pm 0.02)$ dex for [Fe/H], $(-0.01 \pm 0.05)$ km s$^{-1}$ for microturbulence velocity, $(0.02 \pm 0.08)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the macro turbulence velocity, and $(-0.12 \pm 0.26)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the projected rotational velocity (vsin$i$). Regarding the chemical abundances, most of the elements agree with the literature within 0.01 - 0.02 dex. The abundances were corrected from the effects of the Galactic chemical evolution and analyzed with the condensation temperature (T$_{\rm cond}$) to verify whether the stars presented depletion of refractories compared to volatiles. We found that the Sun is more depleted in refractory elements compared to volatiles than 89% of the studied solar analogs, with a significance of 9.5$\sigma$ when compared to the stars without detected exoplanets. We also found the possible presence of three subpopulations in the solar analogs: one Cu-rich, one Cu-poor, and the last one slightly older and poor in Na.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic star candidates in Gaia Data Release 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars, binary pairs with a cool giant fueling accretion onto a hot compact companion, offer unique insights to our understanding of stellar evolution. Yet, only a few hundred symbiotic stars are confirmed. Here, we report on a new search for symbiotic star candidates in Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3), based entirely on the archive's astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic information. To begin our search, we identified known symbiotic stars in GDR3 and assessed their absolute magnitude and colors, which are dominated by the cool giant. We also considered measures of astrometric quality that might be affected by binary motion in these systems. Finally, from those sources with Gaia spectroscopic data, we built a low-resolution spectral template that characterizes the unique features of these systems, including H$\alpha$ emission from interaction with the giant's wind and radiation from the hot star. We then queried the full GDR3 archive for sources with spectroscopic data that are bright (&lt; 17 mag in G-band), have modest relative parallax uncertainties (&lt; 20%), and fall within a region of color-magnitude space characteristic of red giants, keeping only sources with spectra that quantitatively match our template. A machine-learning algorithm, trained on known symbiotic stars, produced a new catalog of 1,674 sources. From cross-matches with infrared and X-ray surveys, we present 25 of these sources as particularly compelling candidates for new symbiotic stars.</description>

      <title>The Dust Extinction Curve: Beyond R(V)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dust extinction curve is typically parameterized by a single variable, R(V), in optical and near-infrared wavelengths. R(V) controls the slope of the extinction-vs.-wavelength curve, and is thought to reflect the grain-size distribution and composition of dust. Low-resolution, flux-calibrated BP/RP spectra from Gaia have allowed the determination of the extinction curve along sightlines to 130 million stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. We show that these extinction curves contain more than a single degree of freedom - that is, that they are not simply described by R(V). We identify a number of components that are orthogonal to R(V) variation, and show that these components vary across the sky in coherent patterns that resemble interstellar medium structure. These components encode variation in the 770 nm extinction feature, intermediate-scale and very broad structure, and a newly identified feature at 850 nm, and likely trace both dust composition and local conditions in the interstellar medium. Correlations of the 770 nm and 850 nm features with R(V) suggest that their carriers become more abundant as the carrier of the 2175 Angstrom feature is destroyed. Our 24 million extinction-curve decompositions and feature equivalent-width measurements are publicly available at https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14005028.</description>

      <title>Interactions among binary black holes in star clusters: Eccentric gravitational wave captures and triple formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of star clusters with black holes find that there is only a single dynamically active binary black hole (BBH), at odds with the theoretical expectation of ~5 dynamically formed - or, commonly referred to as three-body - BBHs in clusters with a few hundred BHs. We test the recent suggestion that this tension is because interactions among three-body BBHs were neglected in the theory. We use the public catalogue of Cluster Monte Carlo models to obtain a sample of strong BBH-BBH interactions, which we integrate using post-Newtonian equations of motion up to 3.5PN. We explore the nature of the BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions in star clusters, as well as the various outcomes: gravitational wave (GW) captures and the associated eccentricities at the frequencies of ground-based GW detectors, as well as BH triple formation and their contribution to BBH mergers via the ZLK mechanism. We find that almost all BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions are indeed three-body binaries and that BBH formation and disruption in BBH-BBH interactions occur at approximately the same rate, providing an explanation for the finding of a single dynamically active BBH in N-body models. An important implication is that the resulting rates of GW capture and triple formation are independent of uncertain initial binary properties. With the use of a population synthesis model for BBH-BBH interactions in globular clusters, we obtain a local rate of GW captures of $R=1Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ as well as their eccentricity distribution and redshift dependence. We find that a BBH-BBH interaction is more likely to trigger a GW merger than a BH-BBH interaction. We also confirm that stable triples that are assembled in BBH-BBH interactions can merge via ZLK oscillations, although their merger rate is lower than GW captures. Our results will help with the interpretation of future GW signals from eccentric BBHs</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As part of the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey (CAPOS), high-resolution, high Signal-to-Noise Ratio Near-Infrared spectroscopy, we aim to conduct the most robust chemical study to date for NGC 6316, deriving abundances for a number of elements with a variety of nucleosynthetic origins, most of which have never been studied before in this cluster. We use the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High accuracy Spectra (BACCHUS) with atmospheric parameters photometrically obtained in order to determine, for the first time, abundances for C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Ce for this cluster. We obtained a mean metallicity $[Fe/H]=-0.87\pm0.02$, finding no indication of an intrinsic metallicity spread. Our metallicity agrees with the most recent values from other studies, revising earlier values that were $\sim0.5$ dex metal-richer. With this new value, this cluster, long believed to be a member of the classical metal-rich group of bulge GCs around $-0.5$, now falls in the dominant bulge globular cluster peak around $[Fe/H]=-1$. The cluster presents a clear C-N anticorrelation. We also found a $[\alpha/Fe]=0.31\pm0.02$. Our abundances show similar behaviour to other in situ globular clusters with comparable metallicity. An isochrone fitting gave us $E(B-V)=0.71$, a higher value than any other from the literature for this cluster since we also estimated $R_V=2.7$, in good agreement with determinations from other works; $(M-m)_0=15.32\pm0.05$. We derive an overall metallicity $[M/H]=-0.6\pm0.05$, in agreement with our abundance determination.</description>

      <title>Constraints on asteroid-mass primordial black holes in dwarf galaxies using Hubble Space Telescope photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass range remain a viable and until now unconstrained dark matter (DM) candidate. If such PBHs exist, they could be captured by stars in DM-dominated environments with low velocity dispersion such as ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). The capture probability increases with the stellar mass, and captured PBHs would rapidly destroy their host stars. As a result, the presence of PBHs in UFDs would alter their stellar mass functions. Using photometric observations of three ultra-faint dwarf galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope, we show that it is unlikely that their mass functions have been significantly modified by PBHs, and we place constraints on the PBH abundance. In the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Triangulum II, PBHs around $10^{19}$g are excluded at the $2\sigma$ ($3\sigma$) level from constituting more than $\sim55\%$ ($\sim78\%$) of the dark matter, while the possibility that PBHs represent the entirety of the DM is excluded at the $3.7\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Galaxy morphologies at cosmic noon with JWST: A foundation for exploring gas transport with bars and spiral arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The way in which radial flows shape galaxy structure and evolution remains an open question. Internal drivers of such flows, such as bars and spiral arms, known to mediate gas flows in the local Universe, are now observable at high redshift thanks to JWST's unobscured view. We investigated the morphology of massive star-forming galaxies at 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.3 and 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.5, epochs marking the peak and decline of cosmic star formation, both well covered by kinematic surveys. Using JWST/NIRCam imaging, we visually classified 1,451 galaxies, identified nonaxisymmetric features, counted the number of spiral arms, analyzed nonparametric morphological indicators, and studied the dynamical support of the sample covered by kinematics ($\approx$ 11% of the sample) as measured via $v/\sigma$. Disks dominate the sample (fraction $0.82 \pm 0.03$); among them, $0.48 \pm 0.04$ exhibit spiral structure and $0.11 \pm 0.03$ host bars. Both fractions decline with redshift, in agreement with previous studies. The proportion of two- and three-armed spirals remains largely unchanged across our redshift bins: approximately two-thirds show two arms and one-third show three arms in both bins. Notably, we find a higher incidence of three-armed spirals ($\approx 0.30$) than reported in the local Universe ($\approx 0.20$), suggesting a mild evolution in spiral arm multiplicity. Nonparametric morphological metrics strongly correlate with stellar mass but show no significant redshift evolution. Finally, kinematic analysis reveals a correlation between disk morphology and rotational support: most disks exhibit $v/\sigma &gt; 3$ and median values of $v/\sigma &gt; 7$ for spirals and $v/\sigma &gt; 5$ for barred galaxies. This study establishes a population-wide framework for linking galaxy morphology and dynamics at cosmic noon, providing a key reference for future studies on the role of detailed structural features in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS): overview of program and early results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The embedded phase is a crucial period in the development of a young star. Mid-IR observations, now possible with JWST with unprecedented sensitivity, spectral resolution and sharpness are key for probing many physical and chemical processes on sub-arcsecond scales. JOYS addresses a wide variety of questions, from protostellar accretion and the nature of primeval jets, winds and outflows, to the chemistry of gas and ice, and the characteristics of embedded disks. We introduce the program and show representative results. MIRI-MRS data of 17 low-mass and 6 high-mass protostars show a wide variety of features. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe), semi-refractory (e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), linked to their different levels of depletion and local (shock) conditions. Nested, stratified jet structures consisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are commonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the jet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more evolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I lines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission (CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated with hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice components but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with comparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO ice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link with disks and comets. A deep search for solid O2 suggests it is not a significant oxygen reservoir. Only few embedded Class I disks show the same forest of water lines as Class II disks do, perhaps due to significant dust extinction of the upper layers [abridged].</description>

      <title>Lonely Little Red Dots: Challenges to the AGN-nature of little red dots through their clustering and spectral energy distributions</title>

Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously unseen population of compact red objects, known as ``little red dots`` (LRDs). We study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift range $z$ $\sim$ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF, JADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find that whilst the $\chi^{2}$ of the majority of models containing AGN components is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field, JADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.</description>

      <title>Survival of dust in super-dusty galaxies at redshifts $z \approx 5-8$</title>

Abstract: The presence of dust in galaxies at redshifts $z&gt;5$ is commonly connected with core collapse supernovae (SN). Galaxies with exceptionally large dust mass, of order of $1 - 3$\% of the galaxy stellar mass, have been detected during the last decade. The required SN dust yield is $\gtrsim 1~M_\odot$ per supernova, which is comparable to the theoretically predicted maximum. However, the reverse shock (RS) penetrating the SN ejecta significantly destroy the dust particles nucleating there through sputtering. The resulting net dust mass injected into the interstellar gas after processing by the RS turns out to be $\lesssim 0.1~M_\odot$ per SN. This makes the explanation of the existence of $z&gt;5$ galaxies with dust masses as high as $M_d\gtrsim (0.01-0.03)M_\ast$ a challenging one. In this paper we present arguments in favor of an efficient inhibition of the sputtering behind the RS, caused by a strong radiation cooling from the dust in the supernova ejecta.</description>

      <title>Overmassive Black holes live in compact galaxies in the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant population of quasars have been found to exist within the first Gyr of cosmic time. Most of them have high black hole (BH) masses ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{8-10} M_{\odot}$) with an elevated BH-to-stellar mass ratio compared to typical local galaxies, posing challenges to our understanding of the formation of supermassive BHs and their coevolution with host galaxies. Here, based on size measurements of [CII] 158$\mu$m emission for a statistical sample of $z \sim 6$ quasars, we find that their host galaxies are systematically more compact (with half-light radius $R_{\rm e} \sim 1.6$ kpc) than typical star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. Specifically, the sizes of the most compact quasar hosts, which also tend to contain less cold gas than their more extended counterparts, are comparable to that of massive quiescent galaxies at $z \sim 4-5$. These findings reveal an intimate connection between the formation of massive BHs and compactness of their host galaxies in the early universe. These compact quasar hosts are promising progenitors of the first population of quiescent galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Bulge exploration V.: The secular spherical and X-shaped Milky Way bulge</title>

Abstract: In this work, we derive systemic velocities and subsequently orbits for 8456 RR~Lyrae stars. We identify interlopers from other Milky Way (MW) structures, which amount to 22 percent of the total sample. Most interlopers are associated with the halo, with the remainder linked to the Galactic disk. We confirm the previously reported lag in the rotation curve of bulge RR~Lyrae stars regardless of the removal of interlopers. Metal-rich RR~Lyrae stars' rotation patterns are consistent with that of non-variable metal-rich giants, following the MW bar, while metal-poor stars exhibit slower rotation. The analysis of orbital parameter space is used to distinguish bulge stars that, in the bar reference frame, have prograde orbits from those in retrograde orbits. We classify the prograde stars into orbital families and estimate the chaoticity (in the form of frequency drift) of their orbits. RR~Lyrae stars with banana-like orbits have a bimodal distance distribution, similar to the distance distribution seen in the metal-rich red clump stars. The fraction of stars with banana-like orbits decreases linearly with metallicity, as does the fraction of stars on prograde orbits (in the bar reference frame). The retrograde moving stars (in the bar reference frame) form a centrally concentrated nearly spherical distribution. Analyzing an $N$-body+SPH simulation, we find that some stellar particles in the central parts oscillate between retrograde and prograde orbits and only a minority stays prograde over a long period of time. Based on the simulation, the ratio between prograde and retrograde stellar particles seems to stabilize within a couple of gigayears after bar formation. The non-chaoticity of retrograde orbits and their high numbers can explain some of the spatial and kinematical features of the MW bulge that have been often associated with a classical bulge.</description>

      <title>A gas-rich cosmic web revealed by the partitioning of the missing baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximately half of the Universe's dark matter resides in collapsed halos; significantly less than half of the baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) remains confined to halos. A small fraction of baryons are in stars and the interstellar medium within galaxies. The lion's share are diffuse ($&lt;$10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) and ionized (neutral fraction $&lt;$10$^{-4}$), located in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and in the halos of galaxy clusters, groups, and galaxies. This diffuse ionized gas is notoriously difficult to measure, but has wide implications for galaxy formation, astrophysical feedback, and precision cosmology. Recently, the dispersion of extragalactic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) has been used to measure the total content of cosmic baryons. Here, we present a large cosmological sample of FRB sources localized to their host galaxies. We have robustly partitioned the missing baryons into the IGM, galaxy clusters, and galaxies, providing a late-Universe measurement of the total baryon density of $\Omega_b\,h_{70} = 0.051_{-0.006}^{+0.006}$. Our results indicate efficient feedback processes that can deplete galaxy halos and enrich the IGM ($f_{\rm IGM}=0.76_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$), agreeing with the baryon-rich cosmic web scenario seen in cosmological simulations. Our results may reduce the ``$S_8$ tension'' in cosmology, as strong feedback leads to suppression of the matter power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Heating the dark matter halo with dark radiation from supernovae</title>

Abstract: Supernova explosions are among the most extreme events in the Universe, making them a promising environment in which to search for the effects of light, weakly coupled new particles. As significant sources of energy, they are known to have an important effect on the dynamics of ordinary matter in their host galaxies but their potential impact on the dark matter (DM) halo remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the possibility that some fraction of the supernova energy is released via the form of dark radiation into the DM halo. Based on evaluation of energetics, we find that even a small fraction of the total SN energy is sufficient to change the overall shape of the DM halo and transform a cuspy halo into a cored one. This may help to explain the cores that are observed in some dwarf galaxies. Alternatively, one can interpret the upper limit on the size of a possible DM core as an upper limit on the energy that can go into light particles beyond the SM. These arguments are largely independent of a concrete model for the new physics. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the conditions we need, i.e.~significant supernova emissivity of dark radiation and the opacity of DM halo to the dark radiation, can be met in actual models. To demonstrate this, we study four simple benchmark models: the dark photon, dark Higgs, and gauged $B-L$ and $L_\mu - L_\tau$ models -- all provide light weakly coupled particles serving as the dark radiation. Assuming a sizable coupling of the dark radiation to DM, we find that all of the benchmark models have a significant part of the parameter space that meets the conditions. Interestingly, the couplings allowed by observations of SN1987A can have a significant effect on the halo of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</description>

      <title>CMB lensing tomography with clustering estimation of lens redshift distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a clustering-based redshift estimation approach for CMB lensing tomography, focusing on the kernel function of the lensing galaxies. Within a linear galaxy bias framework, we derive estimators for this kernel from two-point cross-correlations between lens mass and reference samples. The reconstructed kernel then enables a theoretical prediction for the angular cross-power spectrum \(C_{g\kappa}\) between CMB lensing convergence and lens galaxies. As a proof of concept, we measure \(C_{g\kappa}\) by correlating the \emph{Planck} PR4 convergence map with NVSS+SUMSS radio galaxies (\(0\lesssim z\lesssim 3\)). We estimate the radio-galaxy kernel by collectively cross-correlating their distribution with spectroscopic and photometric surveys (2MPZ, LOWZ-CMASS, eBOSS DR16 LRGs, and Gaia-unWISE QSOs). From the measured \(C_{g\kappa}\), we obtain \(\sigma_8 = 0.86^{+0.12}_{-0.09}\) when the density parameter is set to the {\it Planck} value of $\Omega_m = 0.315$; this is in good agreement with the \emph{Planck} normalisation of $\sigma_8 = 0.812$.</description>

Abstract: Investigations of the Galactic black hole low-mass X-ray binaries (BH-LMXBs) offer valuable insights into the elusive black hole population in the Milky Way. Motivated by recent tensions in the natal kick velocity distribution and BH mass distribution of BH-LMXBs, we revisit the spatial distribution of the Galactic BH-LMXBs using a new set of distance measurements obtained from an X-ray spectral modelling framework that we introduced in earlier work. We perform a multiparameter simulation study to mitigate part of the bias present in our prior estimates and gain insights into possible observational selection effects that affect the observed population. We derive a bias correction factor, well described by a Pareto probability density function that closely follows an inverse-square law dependence on distance. We then construct a bias-corrected, literature-independent, Galactic spatial distribution that clearly traces spiral arm structures and shows a deficit of sources very close to the Galactic centre, which might be explained due to high extinction or a true paucity of these sources at that region. Further analysis of the simulation results provides hints for a hidden population of BH-LMXBs at low Galactic heights. Lastly, we estimate the root-mean-squared Galactic height and find that it is most compatible with a hybrid scenario of BH formation, with some BHs receiving high natal kicks and thus propelled further from the thin disc plane while others receiving low natal kicks and remaining close to their birth place.</description>

      <title>The accretion luminosity of Class I protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The value of the accretion luminosity during the early phases of star formation is a crucial information which helps us understand how stars form, yet it is still very difficult to obtain. We develop a new methodology to measure accretion luminosity using mid-infrared hydrogen recombination lines, and apply it to a limited sample of Class~I protostars in the Taurus and Ophiuchus star forming regions. We adopt the commonly used assumption that the properties of disk-protostar accretion in Class I objects is similar to the disk-star accretion in Class II objects. Using simultaneous observations of three hydrogen recombination lines Brg, Pfg, and Bra, we derive the mean intrinsic line ratios, and we verified that these are constant across the probed range of photospheric and accretion properties. We establish correlations between the line luminosities and accretion luminosity. We measure the extinction towards the line emission regions in Class I protostars comparing the observed line ratios to the Class II mean values. We then derive the Class I accretion luminosities from the established Class II correlations. We find that the accretion luminosity dominates the bolometric luminosity for the more embedded protostars, corresponding to lower values of the bolometric temperature. As the bolometric temperature increases above ~700K, there is a sharp drop of the contribution of the accretion from the bolometric luminosity. Our finding are in qualitative agreement with numerical simulations of star formation. We suggest that this methodology should be applied to larger and more statistically significant samples of Class I objects, for a more detailed comparison. Our results also suggest that by combining multiple infrared line ratios, it will be possible to derive a more detailed description of the dust extinction law in protostellar envelopes.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Quasar Spectra and Measuring the Ly$\alpha$ Forest with ${\rm S{\scriptsize pender}Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasar spectra carry the imprint of foreground intergalactic medium (IGM) through absorption features. In particular, absorption caused by neutral hydrogen gas, the ``Ly$\alpha$ forest,'' is a key spectroscopic tracer for cosmological analyses used to measure cosmic expansion and test physics beyond the standard model. Despite their importance, current methods for measuring LyA absorption cannot directly derive the intrinsic quasar continuum and make strong assumptions on its shape, thus distorting the measured LyA clustering. We present SpenderQ, a ML-based approach for directly reconstructing the intrinsic quasar spectra and measuring the LyA forest from observations. SpenderQ uses the Spender spectrum autoencoder to learn a compact and redshift-invariant latent encoding of quasar spectra, combined with an iterative procedure to identify and mask absorption regions. To demonstrate its performance, we apply SpenderQ to 400,000 synthetic quasar spectra created to validate the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Year 1 LyA cosmological analyses. SpenderQ accurately reconstructs the true intrinsic quasar spectra, including the broad LyB, LyA, SiIV, CIV, and CIII emission lines. Redward of LyA, SpenderQ provides percent-level reconstructions of the true quasar spectra. Blueward of LyA, SpenderQ reconstructs the true spectra to &lt; 5\%. SpenderQ reproduces the shapes of individual quasar spectra more robustly than the current state-of-the-art. We, thus, expect it will significantly reduce biases in LyA clustering measurements and enable studies of quasars and their physical properties. SpenderQ also provides informative latent variable encodings that can be used to, e.g., classify quasars with Broad Absorption Lines. Overall, SpenderQ provides a new data-driven approach for unbiased LyA forest measurements in cosmological, quasar, and IGM studies.</description>
