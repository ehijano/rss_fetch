      <title>An Open Source Realtime GPU Beamformer for Row-Column and Top Orthogonal to Bottom Electrode (TOBE) Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research ultrasound platforms have enabled many next-generation imaging sequences but have lacked realtime navigation capabilities for emerging 2D arrays such as row-column arrays (RCAs). We present an open-source, GPU-accelerated reconstruction and rendering software suite integrated with a programmable ultrasound platform and novel electrostrictive Top-Orthogonal-to-Bottom-Electrode (TOBE) arrays. The system supports advanced real-time modes, including cross-plane aperture-encoded synthetic-aperture imaging and aperture-encoded volumetric scanning. TOBE-enabled methods demonstrate improved image quality and expanded field of view compared with conventional RCA techniques. The software implements beamforming and rendering kernels using OpenGL compute shaders and is designed for maximum data throughput helping to minimize stalls and latency. Accompanying sample datasets and example scripts for offline reconstruction are provided to facilitate external testing.</description>

      <title>Feature Compression for Machines with Range-Based Channel Truncation and Frame Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method that enhances the compression performance of the current model under development for the upcoming MPEG standard on Feature Coding for Machines (FCM). This standard aims at providing inter-operable compressed bitstreams of features in the context of split computing, i.e., when the inference of a large computer vision neural-network (NN)-based model is split between two devices. Intermediate features can consist of multiple 3D tensors that can be reduced and entropy coded to limit the required bandwidth of such transmission. In the envisioned design for the MPEG-FCM standard, intermediate feature tensors may be reduced using Neural layers before being converted into 2D video frames that can be coded using existing video compression standards. This paper introduces an additional channel truncation and packing method which enables the system to preserve the relevant channels, depending on the statistics of the features at inference time, while preserving the computer vision task performance at the receiver. Implemented within the MPEG-FCM test model, the proposed method yields an average reduction in rate by 10.59% for a given accuracy on multiple computer vision tasks and datasets.</description>

      <title>mViSE: A Visual Search Engine for Analyzing Multiplex IHC Brain Tissue Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-slide multiplex imaging of brain tissue generates massive information-dense images that are challenging to analyze and require custom software. We present an alternative query-driven programming-free strategy using a multiplex visual search engine (mViSE) that learns the multifaceted brain tissue chemoarchitecture, cytoarchitecture, and myeloarchitecture. Our divide-and-conquer strategy organizes the data into panels of related molecular markers and uses self-supervised learning to train a multiplex encoder for each panel with explicit visual confirmation of successful learning. Multiple panels can be combined to process visual queries for retrieving similar communities of individual cells or multicellular niches using information-theoretic methods. The retrievals can be used for diverse purposes including tissue exploration, delineating brain regions and cortical cell layers, profiling and comparing brain regions without computer programming. We validated mViSE's ability to retrieve single cells, proximal cell pairs, tissue patches, delineate cortical layers, brain regions and sub-regions. mViSE is provided as an open-source QuPath plug-in.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fusion of Regional Brain Experts for Interpretable Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can benefit from integrating complementary information from multiple modalities, mirroring clinical practice. However, conventional fusion approaches often rely on simple concatenation of features, which cannot adaptively balance the contributions of biomarkers such as amyloid PET and MRI across brain regions. In this work, we propose MREF-AD, a Multimodal Regional Expert Fusion model for AD diagnosis. It is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that models meso-scale brain regions in each modality as an independent expert and employs two-level gating networks to learn subject-specific fusion weights. Beyond improving diagnostic performance, MREF-AD provides modality- and region-level insight into how structural and molecular imaging jointly contribute to disease diagnosis. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), MREF-AD achieves state-of-the-art performance over baselines while providing enhanced interpretability of brain region-specific biomarker relevance, underscoring its utility as a general framework for adaptive and interpretable multimodal fusion in neuroimaging.</description>

      <title>E-CHUM: Event-based Cameras for Human Detection and Urban Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human movement and city dynamics has always been challenging. From traditional methods of manually observing the city's inhabitant, to using cameras, to now using sensors and more complex technology, the field of urban monitoring has evolved greatly. Still, there are more that can be done to unlock better practices for understanding city dynamics. This paper surveys how the landscape of urban dynamics studying has evolved with a particular focus on event-based cameras. Event-based cameras capture changes in light intensity instead of the RGB values that traditional cameras do. They offer unique abilities, like the ability to work in low-light, that can make them advantageous compared to other sensors. Through an analysis of event-based cameras, their applications, their advantages and challenges, and machine learning applications, we propose event-based cameras as a medium for capturing information to study urban dynamics. They offer the ability to capture important information while maintaining privacy. We also suggest multi-sensor fusion of event-based cameras and other sensors in the study of urban dynamics. Combining event-based cameras and infrared, event-LiDAR, or vibration has to potential to enhance the ability of event-based cameras and overcome the challenges that event-based cameras have.</description>

      <title>Learning from a Generative Oracle: Domain Adaptation for Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained image restoration models often fail on real-world, out-of-distribution degradations due to significant domain gaps. Adapting to these unseen domains is challenging, as out-of-distribution data lacks ground truth, and traditional adaptation methods often require complex architectural changes. We propose LEGO (Learning from a Generative Oracle), a practical three-stage framework for post-training domain adaptation without paired data. LEGO converts this unsupervised challenge into a tractable pseudo-supervised one. First, we obtain initial restorations from the pre-trained model. Second, we leverage a frozen, large-scale generative oracle to refine these estimates into high-quality pseudo-ground-truths. Third, we fine-tune the original model using a mixed-supervision strategy combining in-distribution data with these new pseudo-pairs. This approach adapts the model to the new distribution without sacrificing its original robustness or requiring architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO effectively bridges the domain gap, significantly improving performance on diverse real-world benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Unified Theory of Dynamic Programming Algorithms in Small Target Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small target detection is inherently challenging due to the minimal size, lack of distinctive features, and the presence of complex backgrounds. Heavy noise further complicates the task by both obscuring and imitating the target appearance. Weak target signals require integrating target trajectories over multiple frames, an approach that can be computationally intensive. Dynamic programming offers an efficient solution by decomposing the problem into iterative maximization. This, however, has limited the analytical tools available for their study. In this paper, we present a robust framework for this class of algorithms and establish rigorous convergence results for error rates under mild assumptions. We depart from standard analysis by modeling error probabilities as a function of distance from the target, allowing us to construct a relationship between uncertainty in location and uncertainty in existence. From this framework, we introduce a novel algorithm, Normalized Path Integration (NPI), that utilizes the similarity between sequential observations, enabling target detection with unknown or time varying features.</description>

Abstract: Image Compression for Machines (ICM) has emerged as a pivotal research direction in the field of visual data compression. However, with the rapid evolution of machine intelligence, the target of compression has shifted from task-specific virtual models to Embodied agents operating in real-world environments. To address the communication constraints of Embodied AI in multi-agent systems and ensure real-time task execution, this paper introduces, for the first time, the scientific problem of Embodied Image Compression. We establish a standardized benchmark, EmbodiedComp, to facilitate systematic evaluation under ultra-low bitrate conditions in a closed-loop setting. Through extensive empirical studies in both simulated and real-world settings, we demonstrate that existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) fail to reliably perform even simple manipulation tasks when compressed below the Embodied bitrate threshold. We anticipate that EmbodiedComp will catalyze the development of domain-specific compression tailored for Embodied agents , thereby accelerating the Embodied AI deployment in the Real-world.</description>

      <title>Particle Image Velocimetry Refinement via Consensus ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is an imaging technique in experimental fluid dynamics that quantifies flow fields around bluff bodies by analyzing the displacement of neutrally buoyant tracer particles immersed in the fluid. Traditional PIV approaches typically depend on tuning parameters specific to the imaging setup, making the performance sensitive to variations in illumination, flow conditions, and seeding density. On the other hand, even state-of-the-art machine learning methods for flow quantification are fragile outside their training set. In our experiments, we observed that flow quantification would improve if different tunings (or algorithms) were applied to different regions of the same image pair. In this work, we parallelize the instantaneous flow quantification with multiple algorithms and adopt a consensus framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, seamlessly incorporating priors such as smoothness and incompressibility. We perform several numerical experiments to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. For instance, we achieve a decrease in end-point-error of up to 20% of a dense-inverse-search estimator at an inference rate of 60Hz, and we show how this performance boost can be increased further with outlier rejection. Our method is implemented in JAX, effectively exploiting hardware acceleration, and integrated in Flow Gym, enabling (i) reproducible comparisons with the state-of-the-art, (ii) testing different base algorithms, (iii) straightforward deployment for active fluids control applications.</description>

      <title>EditMGT: Unleashing Potentials of Masked Generative Transformers in Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) have achieved exceptional visual quality in image editing tasks. However, the global denoising dynamics of DMs inherently conflate local editing targets with the full-image context, leading to unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we shift our attention beyond DMs and turn to Masked Generative Transformers (MGTs) as an alternative approach to tackle this challenge. By predicting multiple masked tokens rather than holistic refinement, MGTs exhibit a localized decoding paradigm that endows them with the inherent capacity to explicitly preserve non-relevant regions during the editing process. Building upon this insight, we introduce the first MGT-based image editing framework, termed EditMGT. We first demonstrate that MGT's cross-attention maps provide informative localization signals for localizing edit-relevant regions and devise a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme that refines these maps to achieve fine-grained and precise localization. On top of these adaptive localization results, we introduce region-hold sampling, which restricts token flipping within low-attention areas to suppress spurious edits, thereby confining modifications to the intended target regions and preserving the integrity of surrounding non-target areas. To train EditMGT, we construct CrispEdit-2M, a high-resolution dataset spanning seven diverse editing categories. Without introducing additional parameters, we adapt a pre-trained text-to-image MGT into an image editing model through attention injection. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks demonstrate that, with fewer than 1B parameters, our model achieves similarity performance while enabling 6 times faster editing. Moreover, it delivers comparable or superior editing quality, with improvements of 3.6% and 17.6% on style change and style transfer tasks, respectively.</description>

      <title>MarsQE: Semantic-Informed Quality Enhancement for Compressed Martian Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09433v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lossy image compression is essential for Mars exploration missions, due to the limited bandwidth between Earth and Mars. However, the compression may introduce visual artifacts that complicate the geological analysis of the Martian surface. Existing quality enhancement approaches, primarily designed for Earth images, fall short for Martian images due to a lack of consideration for the unique Martian semantics. In response to this challenge, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Martian images, yielding two key insights based on semantics: the presence of texture similarities and the compact nature of texture representations in Martian images. Inspired by these findings, we introduce MarsQE, an innovative, semantic-informed, two-phase quality enhancement approach specifically designed for Martian images. The first phase involves the semantic-based matching of texture-similar reference images, and the second phase enhances image quality by transferring texture patterns from these reference images to the compressed image. We also develop a post-enhancement network to further reduce compression artifacts and achieve superior compression quality. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MarsQE significantly outperforms existing approaches for Earth images, establishing a new benchmark for the quality enhancement on Martian images.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Learning for Scalable Representation of High-Dimensional Medical Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with healthcare data is rapidly transforming medical diagnostics and driving progress toward precision medicine. However, effectively leveraging multimodal data, particularly digital pathology whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic sequencing, remains a significant challenge due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of these modalities and the need for scalable and interpretable frameworks. Existing diagnostic models typically operate on unimodal data, overlooking critical cross-modal interactions that can yield richer clinical insights. We introduce MarbliX (Multimodal Association and Retrieval with Binary Latent Indexed matriX), a self-supervised framework that learns to embed WSIs and immunogenomic profiles into compact, scalable binary codes, termed ``monogram.'' By optimizing a triplet contrastive objective across modalities, MarbliX captures high-resolution patient similarity in a unified latent space, enabling efficient retrieval of clinically relevant cases and facilitating case-based reasoning. \textcolor{black}{In lung cancer, MarbliX achieves 85-89\% across all evaluation metrics, outperforming histopathology (69-71\%) and immunogenomics (73-76\%). In kidney cancer, real-valued monograms yield the strongest performance (F1: 80-83\%, Accuracy: 87-90\%), with binary monograms slightly lower (F1: 78-82\%).</description>

Abstract: This review explores anomaly localization in medical images using denoising diffusion models. After providing a brief methodological background of these models, including their application to image reconstruction and their conditioning using guidance mechanisms, we provide an overview of available datasets and evaluation metrics suitable for their application to anomaly localization in medical images. In this context, we discuss supervision schemes ranging from fully supervised segmentation to semi-supervised, weakly supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised methods, and provide insights into the effectiveness and limitations of these approaches. Furthermore, we highlight open challenges in anomaly localization, including detection bias, domain shift, computational cost, and model interpretability. Our goal is to provide an overview of the current state of the art in the field, outline research gaps, and highlight the potential of diffusion models for robust anomaly localization in medical images.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multifractal Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Multifractal analysis (MFA) provides a framework for the global characterization of image textures by describing the spatial fluctuations of their local regularity based on the multifractal spectrum. Several works have shown the interest of using MFA for the description of homogeneous textures in images. Nevertheless, natural images can be composed of several textures and, in turn, multifractal properties associated with those textures. This paper introduces an unsupervised Bayesian multifractal segmentation method to model and segment multifractal textures by jointly estimating the multifractal parameters and labels on images, at the pixel-level. For this, a computationally and statistically efficient multifractal parameter estimation model for wavelet leaders is firstly developed, defining different multifractality parameters for different regions of an image. Then, a multiscale Potts Markov random field is introduced as a prior to model the inherent spatial and scale correlations (referred to as cross-scale correlations) between the labels of the wavelet leaders. A Gibbs sampling methodology is finally used to draw samples from the posterior distribution of the unknown model parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted on synthetic multifractal images to evaluate the performance of the proposed segmentation approach. The proposed method achieves superior performance compared to traditional unsupervised segmentation techniques as well as modern deep learning-based approaches, showing its effectiveness for multifractal image segmentation.</description>

      <title>UStyle: Waterbody Style Transfer of Underwater Scenes by Depth-Guided Feature Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of waterbody style transfer remains largely unexplored in the underwater imaging and vision literature. Traditional image style transfer (STx) methods primarily focus on artistic and photorealistic blending, often failing to preserve object and scene geometry in images captured in high-scattering mediums such as underwater. The wavelength-dependent nonlinear attenuation and depth-dependent backscattering artifacts further complicate learning underwater image STx from unpaired data. This paper introduces UStyle, the first data-driven learning framework for transferring waterbody styles across underwater images without requiring prior reference images or scene information. We propose a novel depth-aware whitening and coloring transform (DA-WCT) mechanism that integrates physics-based waterbody synthesis to ensure perceptually consistent stylization while preserving scene structure. To enhance style transfer quality, we incorporate carefully designed loss functions that guide UStyle to maintain colorfulness, lightness, structural integrity, and frequency-domain characteristics, as well as high-level content in VGG and CLIP (contrastive language-image pretraining) feature spaces. By addressing domain-specific challenges, UStyle provides a robust framework for no-reference underwater image STx, surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that rely solely on end-to-end reconstruction loss. Furthermore, we introduce the UF7D dataset, a curated collection of high-resolution underwater images spanning seven distinct waterbody styles, establishing a benchmark to support future research in underwater image STx. The UStyle inference pipeline and UF7D dataset are released at: https://github.com/uf-robopi/UStyle.</description>

      <title>CTorch: PyTorch-Compatible GPU-Accelerated Auto-Differentiable Projector Toolbox for Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16741v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces CTorch, a PyTorch-compatible, GPU-accelerated, and auto-differentiable projector toolbox designed to handle various CT geometries with configurable projector algorithms. CTorch provides flexible scanner geometry definition, supporting 2D fan-beam, 3D circular cone-beam, and 3D non-circular cone-beam geometries. Each geometry allows view-specific definitions to accommodate variations during scanning. Both flat- and curved-detector models may be specified to accommodate various clinical devices. CTorch implements four projector algorithms: voxel-driven, ray-driven, distance-driven (DD), and separable footprint (SF), allowing users to balance accuracy and computational efficiency based on their needs. All the projectors are primarily built using CUDA C for GPU acceleration, then compiled as Python-callable functions, and wrapped as PyTorch network module. This design allows direct use of PyTorch tensors, enabling seamless integration into PyTorch's auto-differentiation framework. These features make CTorch an flexible and efficient tool for CT imaging research, with potential applications in accurate CT simulations, efficient iterative reconstruction, and advanced deep-learning-based CT reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Random-phase Wave Splatting of Translucent Primitives for Computer-generated Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for VR/AR systems but rely on advanced computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Conventional CGH typically generates smooth-phase holograms, limiting view-dependent effects and realistic defocus blur, while severely under-utilizing the SLM space-bandwidth product. We propose Random-phase Wave Splatting (RPWS), a unified wave optics rendering framework that converts arbitrary 3D representations based on 2D translucent primitives into random-phase holograms. RPWS is fully compatible with modern 3D representations such as Gaussians and triangles, improves bandwidth utilization which effectively enlarges eyebox size, reconstructs accurate defocus blur and parallax, and leverages time-multiplexed rendering not as a heuristic for speckle suppression, but as a mathematically exact alpha-blending mechanism derived from first principles in statistics. At the core of RPWS are (1) a new wavefront compositing procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme for random-phase geometric primitives, ensuring correct color reconstruction and robust occlusion when compositing millions of primitives. RPWS departs substantially from the recent primitive-based CGH algorithm, Gaussian Wave Splatting (GWS). Because GWS uses smooth-phase primitives, it struggles to capture view-dependent effects and realistic defocus blur and under-utilizes the SLM space-bandwidth product; moreover, naively extending GWS to random-phase primitives fails to reconstruct accurate colors. In contrast, RPWS is designed from the ground up for arbitrary random-phase translucent primitives, and through simulations and experimental validations we demonstrate state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for next-generation near-eye displays.</description>

      <title>Time-Series at the Edge: Tiny Separable CNNs for Wearable Gait Detection and Optimal Sensor Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study on-device time-series analysis for gait detection in Parkinson's disease (PD) from short windows of triaxial acceleration, targeting resource-constrained wearables and edge nodes. We compare magnitude thresholding to three 1D CNNs for time-series analysis: a literature baseline (separable convolutions) and two ultra-light models - one purely separable and one with residual connections. Using the BioStampRC21 dataset, 2 s windows at 30 Hz, and subject-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on 16 PwPD with chest-worn IMUs, our residual separable model (Model 2, 533 params) attains PR-AUC = 94.5%, F1 = 91.2%, MCC = 89.4%, matching or surpassing the baseline (5,552 params; PR-AUC = 93.7%, F1 = 90.5%, MCC = 88.5%) with approximately 10x fewer parameters. The smallest model (Model 1, 305 params) reaches PR-AUC = 94.0%, F1 = 91.0%, MCC = 89.1%. Thresholding obtains high recall (89.0%) but low precision (76.5%), yielding many false positives and high inter-subject variance. Sensor-position analysis (train-on-all) shows chest and thighs are most reliable; forearms degrade precision/recall due to non-gait arm motion; naive fusion of all sites does not outperform the best single site. Both compact CNNs execute within tight memory/latency budgets on STM32-class MCUs (sub-10 ms on low-power boards), enabling on-sensor gating of transmission/storage. Overall, ultra-light separable CNNs provide a superior accuracy-efficiency-generalization trade-off to fixed thresholds for wearable PD gait detection and underscore the value of tailored time-series models for edge deployment.</description>
