      <title>Feedback Driven Convergence, Competition, and Entanglement in Classical Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical theory of statistical convergence in which the law of large numbers arises from outcome-outcome feedback rather than assumed independence. Defining the convergence field and its derivative, we show that empirical frequencies evolve through coupling, producing competition, finite-m fluctuations, and classical entanglement. Using the Kramers-Moyal expansion, we derive an Ito-Langevin and Fokker-Planck description, reducing in the symmetric regime to a time-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We propose variance-based witnesses that detect outcome-space entanglement in both binary sequences and coupled Brownian trajectories, and confirm entanglement through numerical experiments. Extending the formalism yields multi-outcome feedback dynamics and finite-time cross-diffusion between Brownian particles. The results unify convergence, fluctuation, and entanglement as consequences of a single feedback-driven stochastic principle.</description>

      <title>A Unified Computational Framework for Two Dimensional Diffusion Limited Aggregation via Finite-Size Scaling, Multifractality, and Morphological Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA), the canonical model for non-equilibrium fractal growth, emerges from the simple rule of irreversible attachment by random walkers. Despite four decades of study, a unified computational framework reconciling its stochastic algorithm, universal fractal dimension, multifractal growth measure, and finite-size effects remains essential for applications from materials science to geomorphology. Through large-scale simulations (clusters up to $N = 10^6$ particles) in two dimensions, we perform a tripartite analysis: (1) We establish a definitive finite-size scaling collapse, extracting the universal fractal dimension $D = 1.712 \pm 0.015$ and identifying the crossover to boundary-dominated growth at a scaled mass $x_0 \approx 0.10 \pm 0.02$. (2) We quantify the full multifractal spectrum of the harmonic measure ($\Delta\alpha \approx 1.13$), directly linking the stochastic algorithm to the deterministic Laplacian growth equation $\nabla^2 p = 0$ and explaining the screening effect via an exponential decay $\eta \sim e^{-r/\xi}$ with screening length $\xi = 22.7 \pm 0.8$ lattice units. (3) We provide a complete morphological characterization, revealing power-law branch length distributions ($\tau \approx 2.1$) and angular branching preferences ($\sim 72^\circ$). This work computationally validates DLA as a robust universality class and provides a scalable methodology for analyzing diffusion-controlled pattern formation across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic freedom, lost: Complex conformal field theory in the two-dimensional $O(N&gt;2)$ nonlinear sigma model and its realization in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional $O(N)$ nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) is asymptotically free for $N&gt;2$: it exhibits neither a nontrivial fixed point nor spontaneous symmetry-breaking. Here we show that a nontrivial fixed point generically does exist in the $\textit{complex}$ coupling plane and is described by a complex conformal field theory (CCFT). This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\leq 2$. We further construct a realistic Lindbladian for a spin-1 chain whose no-click dynamics are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian realizing the CCFT. Since the CCFT vacuum is the eigenstate with the smallest decay rate, the system naturally relaxes under dissipative dynamics toward a CFT state, thus providing a route to preparing long-range entangled states through engineered dissipation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion from hydrodynamic recoupling in particle-hole symmetric fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In charged fluids obeying particle-hole symmetry, such as the Dirac fluid in graphene, charge transport is diffusive despite the presence of ballistically propagating sound waves: sound waves "hydrodynamically decouple" from the slower charge fluctuations. For quasi-one-dimensional fluids, we show that this symmetry-protected charge diffusion is not smoothly connected to the normal diffusion that arises when momentum conservation is broken by noise (or static impurities). Instead, the charge diffusion constant is a discontinuous function of noise, which (in the weak-noise limit) depends only on the ratio of momentum and energy relaxation rates. In the special limit of momentum-conserving noise (e.g., spatially uniform fluctuations of the Hamiltonian), the diffusion constant diverges in the presence of noise. We describe the resulting superdiffusion in terms of coupled Burgers equations. We present a general mechanism--hydrodynamic recoupling--by which weak noise can induce singular changes in transport coefficients. Our results highlight the limits of zero-noise extrapolation for predicting dynamical quantities like diffusion constants.</description>

      <title>Superextensive charging speeds in a correlated quantum charger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a quantum charger as an interacting quantum system that transfers energy between two drives. The key figure of merit characterizing a charger is its charging power. Remarkably, the presence of long-range interactions within the charger can induce a collective steady-state charging mode that depends superlinearly on the size of the charger, exceeding the performance of noninteracting, parallel units. Using the driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and power-law interacting spin chains, we show that this effect persists up to a critical system size set by the breakdown of the high-frequency regime. We discuss optimal work output as well as experimentally accessible initial states. The superlinear charging effect can be probed in trapped-ion experiments, and positions interacting Floquet systems as promising platforms for enhanced energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Thermalization in the mixed-field Ising model: An occupation number perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occupation number is a key observable for diagnosing thermalization, as it connects directly to standard statistical laws such as Fermi--Dirac, Bose--Einstein, and Boltzmann distributions. In the context of spin systems, it represents the population of the sublevels of the magnetization in the $z$-direction. We use this quantity to probe the onset of thermalization in the isolated quantum and classical one-dimensional spin-1 Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields. Thermalization is achieved when the long-time average of the occupation number converges to the microcanonical prediction as the chain length $L$ increases, consistent with the emergence of ergodicity. However, the finite-size scaling analysis in the quantum model is challenged by the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with $L$. To overcome this limitation, we turn to the corresponding classical model, which enables access to much larger system sizes. By tracking the dynamics of individual spins on their three-dimensional Bloch spheres and employing tools from random matrix theory, we establish a quantitative criterion for classical ergodicity in interacting spin systems. We find that deviations from classical ergodicity decay algebraically with system size. This power-law scaling then provides a quantitative bound on the approach to thermal equilibrium in the quantum model.</description>

      <title>Exact critical-temperature bounds for two-dimensional Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive exact critical-temperature bounds for the classical ferromagnetic Ising model on two-dimensional periodic tessellations of the plane. For any such tessellation or lattice, the critical temperature is bounded from a above by a universal number that is solely determined by the largest coordination number on the lattice. Crucially, these bounds are tight in some cases such as the Honeycomb, Square, and Triangular lattices. We prove the bounds using the Feynman--Kac--Ward formalism, confirm their validity for a selection of over two hundred lattices, and construct a two-dimensional lattice with 24-coordinated sites and record high critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Thermalized buckling of extensible, semiflexible polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler buckling of rods is a long-studied mechanical instability, and it remains relevant to this day, as the constituent components in many biological and physical systems are linear polymers, such as microtubules or carbon nanotubes. At finite temperature, if a polymer is shorter than its persistence length, the polymer is semiflexible, and its elasticity remains rod-like. But polymers can also stretch due to their finite extensibility, which can couple to energetically cheap bending deformations in nonlinear ways when a load is applied to the system. We show how the interplay between thermal fluctuations and nonlinear elasticity dramatically modifies the Euler buckling instability for compressed semiflexible polymers in a fixed strain ensemble. We identify a Ginzburg-like length scale beyond which thermally excited undulations lead to a softened Young's modulus, while the polymer nevertheless remains semiflexible. Both perturbative calculations and numerical Monte Carlo simulations suggest a qualitative change in several scaling properties of the buckling transition. The critical compressional strain for thermal buckling now increases with system size, in contrast to athermal buckling, where it decreases with system size. Renormalization group calculations confirm this picture, and also show that thermal buckling is controlled by a new fixed point with different critical exponents compared to classical Euler buckling.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Reduction of Transfer Operators for Particle Clustering Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an operator-based framework to coarse-grain interacting particle systems that exhibit clustering dynamics. Starting from the particle-based transfer operator, we first construct a sequence of reduced representations: the operator is projected onto concentrations and then further reduced by representing the concentration dynamics on a geometric low-dimensional manifold and an adapted finite-state discretization. The resulting coarse-grained transfer operator is finally estimated from dynamical simulation data by inferring the transition probabilities between the Markov states. Applied to systems with multichromatic and Morse interaction potentials, the reduced model reproduces key features of the clustering process, including transitions between cluster configurations and the emergence of metastable states. Spectral analysis and transition-path analysis of the estimated operator reveal implied time scales and dominant transition pathways, providing an interpretable and efficient description of particle-clustering dynamics.</description>

      <title>Propulsion dispersion mediated ordering transition in active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that dispersion in propulsion strength qualitatively alters collective behavior of active multi-particle systems interacting via short-range attractive potential, giving rise to novel ordered phases that combine spatial and orientational ordering. Considering a binary mixture of active Brownian particles with two distinct self-propulsion strengths, we find that, the interplay between interaction range, self-propulsion strengths and the relative numbers of the particles with different propulsion strengths can lead to three different phases, namely, a disordered one, and two ordered ones with partial and complete spatial and orientational ordering. The partially ordered phase is characterized by formation of a ring-like assembly of the slower particles while the faster particles diffuse randomly. Two concentric rings, comprising faster and slower particles, form in the fully ordered phase. Using the example of a truncated harmonic potential, we analytically characterize the phase boundaries and identify the associated order parameters. Our results demonstrate that propulsion dispersion provides a robust and novel route to collective ordering in attractive active matter.</description>

      <title>Consistent thermodynamics reconstructed from transitions between nonequilibrium steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing a thermodynamic framework for nonequilibrium systems remains a major challenge, as quantities such as temperature and free energy often become ambiguous when inferred solely from steady-state properties. Here we take a transformation-based approach and experimentally examine transitions between nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). Using an optically trapped microparticle driven by a tunable correlated stochastic force, we generate active-like steady states with controllable noise statistics. By abruptly changing the trap stiffness, we measure the stochastic work, heat, and entropy produced during NESS-to-NESS transformations. We identify a state-dependent effective temperature that restores the second law for these transitions, enabling the definition of a generalized work that incorporates the consequence of the nonequilibrium fluctuations. With this quantity, we derive and experimentally verify a Crooks-like fluctuation relation linking work distributions to a nonequilibrium free-energy difference defined through the effective temperature. Finally, we establish a fluctuation-response relation for the positional variance following stiffness changes. We demonstrate that this relation is key to distinguishing systems that can be described by a unique effective temperature (i.e., those under equilibrium or white-noise conditions) from those under colored-noise, where an equilibrium-like response cannot be restored. These results delineate the applicability and limits of effective-temperature thermodynamics in driven systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical equivalence between resonant translocation of a polymer chain and diversity-induced resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of heterogeneous oscillators are often seen to display collective synchronized oscillations, even when single elements of the network do not oscillate in isolation. It has been found that it is the diversity of the individual elements that drives the phenomenon, possibly leading to the appearance of a resonance in the response. Here we study the way in which heterogeneity acts in producing an oscillatory regime in a network and show that the resonance response is based on the same physics underlying the resonant translocation regime observed in models of polymer diffusion on a substrate potential. Such a mechanical analog provides an alternative viewpoint that is useful to interpret and understand the nature of collective oscillations in heterogeneous networks.</description>

Abstract: We study the accumulation of zeros of a polynomial arising from the enumeration of edge-coloured graphs along certain limit curves. The polynomial is a variant of an edge-chromatic polynomial, which specialises to the partition function of the ferromagnetic Ising model on a random regular graph. We call this accumulation behaviour a Lee-Yang phenomenon in analogy with the Lee-Yang theorem. The limiting loci are semialgebraic and arise from anti-Stokes curves of an exponential integral.</description>

      <title>Fluids at an electrostatically active surface: Optimum in interfacial friction and electrohydrodynamic drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While fluids near a solid surface are at the core of applications in energy storage/conversion, electrochemistry/electrowetting and adsorption/catalysis, their nanoscale behavior remains only partially deciphered. Beyond conventional effects (e.g. adsorption/reaction, interfacial transport, phase transition shifts), recent experimental and theoretical studies on metallic surfaces have unraveled exotic peculiarities such as complex electrostatic screening, unexpected wetting transition, and interfacial quantum friction. These novel features require developing and embarking new tools to tackle the coupling between charge relaxation in the metal and molecular behavior in the vicinal fluid. Here, using the concept of Virtual Thomas-Fermi fluids, we employ a molecular simulation approach to investigate interfacial transport of fluid molecules and metal charge carriers at their interface--including the underlying electrostatically-driven dynamic friction and the coupling between charge current/hydrodynamic flow (the so-called electrohydrodynamic drag). While conventional numerical techniques consider either insulating materials or metallic materials described as polarizable, non-conducting media, our atom-scale strategy provides an effective yet realistic description of the solid excitation spectrum--including charge relaxation modes and conductivity. By applying this approach to water near metallic surfaces of various electrostatic screening lengths, we unveil a non-monotonous dependence of the fluid/solid friction on the metallicity with a maximum occurring as the charge dynamic structure factors of the solid and fluid strongly overlap. Moreover, we report a direct observation of the electrohydrodynamic drag which arises from the momentum transfer between the solid and liquid through dynamic electrostatic interactions and the underlying interfacial friction.</description>

      <title>Tensor renormalization group approach to critical phenomena via symmetry-twisted partition functions</title>

Abstract: The locality of field theories strongly constrains the possible behaviors of symmetry-twisted partition functions, and thus they serve as order parameters to detect low-energy realizations of global symmetries, such as spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). We demonstrate that the tensor renormalization group (TRG) offers an efficient framework to compute the symmetry-twisted partition functions, which enables us to detect the symmetry-breaking transition and also to study associated critical phenomena. As concrete examples of SSB, we investigate the two-dimensional (2D) classical Ising model and the three-dimensional (3D) classical $O(2)$ nonlinear sigma model, and we identify their critical points solely from the twisted partition function. By employing the finite-size scaling argument, we find the critical temperature $T_c=2.2017(2)$ with the critical exponent $\nu = 0.663(33)$ for the 3D $O(2)$ model. In addition, we also study the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) criticality of the 2D classical $O(2)$ model by extracting the helicity modulus from the twisted partition functions, and we obtain the BKT transition temperature, $T_{\mathrm{BKT}}=0.8928(2)$.</description>

      <title>Protein-Water Energy Transfer via Anharmonic Low-Frequency Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat dissipation is ubiquitous in living systems, which constantly convert distinct forms of energy into each other. The transport of thermal energy in liquids and even within proteins is well understood but kinetic energy transfer across a heterogeneous molecular boundary provides additional challenges. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations under steady-state conditions to analyze how a protein dissipates surplus thermal energy into the surrounding solvent. We specifically focus on collective degrees of freedom that govern the dynamics of the system from the diffusive regime to mid-infrared frequencies. Using a fully anharmonic analysis of molecular vibrations, we analyzed their vibrational spectra, temperatures, and heat transport efficiencies. We find that the most efficient energy transfer mechanisms are associated with solvent-mediated friction. However, this mechanism only applies to a small number of degrees of freedom of a protein. Instead, less efficient vibrational energy transfer in the far-infrared dominates heat transfer overall due to a large number of vibrations in this frequency range. A notable by-product of this work is a highly sensitive measure of deviations from energy equi-partition in equilibrium systems, which can be used to analyze non-ergodic properties.</description>

      <title>Boundary operators in the Brownian loop soup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain infinitely many boundary operators in the Brownian loop soup in the subcritical phase by analyzing the conformal block expansion of the two-point function that computes the probability of having two marked points on the upper half-plane being separated by Brownian loops. The resulting boundary operators are primary operators in a 2D CFT with central charge $c\leq1$ and have conformal dimensions that are non-negative integers. By comparing the above-mentioned conformal block expansion with probabilities in the Brownian loop soup, we provide a physical interpretation of the boundary operators of even dimensions as operators that insert multiple outer boundaries of Brownian loops at points on the real axis.</description>

      <title>Dimension-decaying diffusion processes as the scaling limit of condensing zero-range processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that, on the diffusive time scale, condensing zero-range processes converge to a dimension-decaying diffusion process on the simplex \[ \Sigma = \{(x_1,\dots,x_S) : x_i \ge 0,\; \sum_{i\in S} x_i = 1\}, \] where $S$ is a finite set. This limiting diffusion has the distinctive feature of being absorbed at the boundary of the simplex. More precisely, once the process reaches a face \[ \Sigma_A = \{(x_1,\dots,x_S) : x_i \ge 0,\; \sum_{i\in A} x_i = 1\}, \qquad A \subset S, \] it remains confined to this set and evolves in the corresponding lower-dimensional simplex according to a new diffusion whose parameters depend on the subset $A$. This mechanism repeats itself, leading to successive reductions of the dimension, until one of the vertices of the simplex is reached in finite time. At that point, the process becomes permanently trapped.
  The proof relies on a method to extend the domain of the associated martingale problem, which may be of independent interest and useful in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and macroscopic ground state degeneracy of frustrated spin-1/2 anisotropic Heisenberg model on diamond-decorated lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ground state properties of the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on lattices built from ideal diamond units with competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions. The study covers the one-dimensional diamond chain and its two- and three-dimensional generalizations. The ground-state phase diagram contains four distinct phases: ferromagnetic (F), critical (C), monomer-dimer (MD), and tetramer-dimer (TD), which converge at a quadruple point. We demonstrate the presence of macroscopic ground-state degeneracy and corresponding residual entropy, which is maximal at the quadruple point and also extends throughout the MD phase and its boundaries with TD and F phases. For the diamond chain, we derive exact degeneracies, while for higher-dimensional lattices, we map the problem onto a bond percolation model or used transfer-matrix approach, enabling the numerical computation of the ground state degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Global thermodynamic manifold for conservative control of stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal control of stochastic systems plays a central role in nonequilibrium physics, with applications in the study of biological molecular motors and the design of single-molecule experiments. While exact analytic solutions to optimization problems are rare, under slow driving conditions, the problem can be reformulated geometrically solely in terms of equilibrium properties. In this framework, minimum-work protocols are geodesics on a thermodynamic manifold whose metric is a generalized friction tensor. Here, we introduce a new foundation for this friction-tensor formalism for conservatively driven systems. Under complete control of the potential energy, a global thermodynamic manifold (on which points are identified with instantaneous energy landscapes) has as its metric a full-control friction tensor. Arbitrary partial-control friction tensors arise naturally as inherited metrics on submanifolds of this global manifold. Leveraging a simple mathematical relationship between system dynamics and the geometry of the global manifold, we derive new expressions for the friction tensor that offer powerful tools for interpretation and computation of friction tensors and minimum-work protocols. Our results elucidate a connection between relaxation and dissipation in slowly driven systems and suggest optimization heuristics. We demonstrate the utility of these developments in three illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations for multi-terminal systems with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in steady-state transport for a multi-terminal system consisting of two conducting terminals and N-2 probe terminals, within the linear response regime under broken time-reversal symmetry. We independently derive exact bounds on the TURs for the steady-state particle and heat currents under a strong constraint on the Onsager coefficients. Based on our proposed exact bounds, the analysis reveals that the bounds differ for particle and heat currents and are dependent on the system parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under specific parameter conditions, the TURs of the particle and heat currents have a unified minimum value that depends solely on the number of terminals.</description>

      <title>Integrated covariances as excess observables weighted by currents and activities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near equilibrium, the symmetric part of the time-integrated steady-state covariance, i.e., the time integral of correlation functions, is governed by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, while the antisymmetric part vanishes due to Onsager reciprocity. Far from equilibrium, where these principles no longer apply, we develop a unified formalism for both symmetric and antisymmetric components of integrated covariances. We derive exact, computationally tractable expressions for these quantities, valid in arbitrary nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes. Both components are expressed in terms of excess observables, a notion central to both statistical physics and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we establish thermodynamic upper bounds for antisymmetric covariances in terms of (pseudo-)entropy production and cycle affinities. Finally, we show that the speed up of self-averaging induced by nonequilibrium drivings which preserve kinetics (activity) is bounded by the cycle affinities (thermodynamic forces).</description>

      <title>From Ising to Potts: Physics-inspired Potts machines of coupled oscillators for low-energy sampling and combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $q$-state Potts model is a fundamental model in statistical physics that generalizes the Ising model and plays a key role in the study of phase transitions, critical phenomena, complex systems, and combinatorial optimization. Sampling low-energy configurations of the $q$-state Potts model is essential to these studies, but it remains challenging. While physics-inspired dynamical sampling has been extensively explored for the Ising case ($q=2$) in the form of Ising machines, its generalization to general $q$-state Potts models remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose a class of physics-inspired dynamical samplers that directly target general $q$-state Potts models, which we refer to as the oscillator Potts machine (OPM). We show, through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, that the OPM exhibits a systematic low-energy bias with respect to the underlying Potts energy landscape. Furthermore, we demonstrate, via phase perturbation analysis, that the OPM, as overdamped Langevin dynamics, can be realized with a network of self-sustaining oscillators, demonstrating that the OPM is naturally realizable in hardware using standard technology such as CMOS. We design a small-scale ring-oscillator circuit that implements a three-state OPM and validate its operation through transistor-level simulation. Leveraging the low-energy bias of the OPM for Potts models, we then apply it to large-scale max-$K$-cut problems by mapping these instances to $q$-state Potts Hamiltonians and compare its performance against established algorithms. Our results position the OPM as a promising, physically grounded dynamical system framework for multi-state sampling and combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a kinetic theory of two species of hard spheres undergoing reactive collisions that convert chemical energy into kinetic energy. The model describes an active species interacting with a passive background, labeled as birds and air respectively, with the reactive collisions representing of self-propulsion. Microscopic reversibility of the reactive dynamics is imposed, and a chemostat is introduced to drive the system out of equilibrium. When the chemostat is sufficiently strong and one restricts to grazing interspecies collisions, we find that the bird momentum damping coefficient can change sign, giving rise to a flocking transition.</description>

Abstract: H-theorem provides a microscopic foundation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and is therefore essential to establishing statistical physics, but at the same time, H-theorem has been subject to controversy that in part persists till this day. To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the arrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for approximating the large deviation rate function of time-integrated observables of diffusion processes, used in statistical physics to characterize the fluctuations of nonequilibrium systems. The method is based on linearizing the effective process associated with the large deviations of the process and observable considered, and is tested for a simple one-dimensional nonlinear diffusion model involving a cubic drift. The results show that the linear approximation compares well with the exact rate function, especially in the large fluctuation regime, and that its accuracy is related to the way the linearized process localizes in space. Possible extensions and applications to more complex diffusion models are proposed for future work.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the percolation behavior of Fortuin-Kasteleyn--type clusters in the spin-$1/2$ Baxter--Wu model with three-spin interactions on a triangular lattice. The considered clusters are constructed by randomly freezing one of the three sublattices, resulting in effective pairwise interactions among the remaining spins. Using Monte Carlo simulations combined with a finite-size scaling analysis, we determine the percolation temperature of these stochastic clusters and show that it coincides with the exact thermal critical point of the model. The critical exponents derived from cluster observables are consistent with those of the underlying thermal phase transition. Finally, we analyze the dynamical scaling of the multi-cluster and single-cluster algorithms resulting from the cluster construction, highlighting their efficiency and scaling behavior with system size.</description>

      <title>Langevin equation with potential of mean force: The case of anchored bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential of mean force (PMF) is an effective average potential acting on an open system, renormalized due to the interaction with the surrounding thermal bath. The PMF determines the correction to the equilibrium Gibbs distribution, but it is generally unclear how to implement the concept for time-dependent phenomena described by a (generalized) Langevin equation. We study a model where the system is a single particle (so there are no complications related to internal forces) and a non-trivial PMF is due to the presence of on-site (anchor) potentials applied to the bath particles. We found that the PMF does not merely replace the external potential, but also makes the dissipation kernel and statistical properties of noise dependent on the system's position. That dependence is determined by the internal bath and system-bath interactions and is a priori unknown. Therefore, in the general case the Langevin equation with the PMF is not closed and thus inoperable. However, for systems with linear forces the aforementioned dependence on the system's position is canceled. As an example, we consider a model where the bath is formed by the Klein-Gordon chain, i. e. a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials. In that case, the generalized Langevin equation has the standard form with an external potential replaced by a quadratic PMF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the approaches based on matrix-product states (MPSs), such as the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, the ordering of the sites crucially affects the computational accuracy. We investigate the performance of an algorithm that searches for the optimal site order by iterative local site rearrangement. We improve the algorithm by expanding the range of site rearrangement and apply it to a one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model with random site permutation. The results indicate that increasing the range of the site rearrangement significantly improves the computational accuracy of the DMRG method. In particular, increasing the rearrangement range from two to three sites reduces the average relative error in the ground-state energy by 65% to 94% in the cases we tested. We also discuss the computational cost of the algorithm and its application as a preprocessing for MPS-based calculations.</description>

      <title>Preempting Fermion Sign Problem: Unveiling Quantum Criticality through Nonequilibrium Dynamics in Imaginary Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notorious fermion sign problem, arising from fermion statistics, presents a fundamental obstacle to the numerical simulation of quantum many-body systems. Here, we introduce a framework that circumvents the sign problem in the studies of quantum criticality and its associated phases by leveraging imaginary-time nonequilibrium critical dynamics. We demonstrate that the critical properties can be accurately determined from the system's short-time relaxation, a regime where the sign problem remains manageable for quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations. After validating this approach on two benchmark fermionic models, we apply it to the sign-problematic Hubbard model hosting SU(3)-symmetric Dirac fermions. We present the first numerically exact characterization of its quantum phase diagram, revealing a continuous transition between a Dirac semi-metal and a SU(3) antiferromagnetic phase. This transition defines an unconventional Gross-Neveu universality class that fundamentally reshapes current understanding of Gross-Neveu criticality. Our work provides a powerful tool for investigating sign-problematic systems and quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>The source of hardware-tailored codes and coding phases</title>

Abstract: A central challenge in quantum error correction is identifying powerful quantum codes tailored to specific hardware and determining their error thresholds above which quantum information is unprotected. This problem is hard because we cannot determine the noise models for our devices. Inspired by the quantum capacity theorem, we seek an optimal quantum source of information, namely the density matrix that degrades minimally when passed through a noisy channel. We explore this idea with the Open Random Unitary Model (ORUM), a simplified model of a $N$-qubit quantum computer with competing depolarizing and dephasing channels as a stand-in for unitary gates and measurements. Through numerical optimization, we find that the ORUM hosts three discrete regimes, three "phases", the "maximally mixed source" phase, a "$\mathbb{Z}_2$ source" phase (where ORUM's $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_2$), and a no-coding phase where all information is lost. These phases exhibit first-order transitions among themselves and converge at a novel zero-capacity multicritical point. These results show a remarkable similarity between the quantum capacity theorem and Jaynes' maximum entropy principle of statistical mechanics. Using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ source, we build two codes, a classical cat code capable of correcting all the dephasing errors and a concatenated cat code capable of correcting all errors up to a distance $d=\text{min}(m,N)$ and reduces to Shor's 9-qubit code for $m=N=3$. Neither classical nor quantum code survives near the vicinity of the zero-capacity multicritical point in the source phase diagram. Applying our approach to current noisy devices could provide a systematic method for constructing quantum codes for robust computation and communication.</description>

      <title>Deterministic quantum trajectory via imaginary time evolution</title>

Abstract: Stochastic quantum trajectories, such as pure state evolutions under unitary dynamics and random measurements, offer a crucial ensemble description of many-body open system dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted that individual quantum trajectories also encode essential physical information. Prominent examples include measurement induced phase transitions, where a pure quantum state corresponding to fixed measurement outcomes (trajectories) exhibits distinct entanglement phases, depending on the measurement rate. However, direct observation of this effect is hindered by an exponential post-selection barrier, whereby the probability of realizing a specific trajectory is exponentially small. We propose a deterministic method to efficiently prepare quantum trajectories in polynomial time using imaginary time evolution and, thus, overcome this fundamental challenge. We demonstrate that our method applies to a certain class of quantum states, and argue that there does not exist universal approaches for any quantum trajectories. Our result paves the way for experimentally exploring the physics of individual quantum trajectories at scale and enables direct observation of certain post-selection-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product-state approach for qubits-waveguide systems in real space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix-product-state-based numerical approach for simulating systems composed of several qubits and a common one-dimensional waveguide. In the presented approach, the one-dimensional waveguide is modeled in real space. Thus, one can use the advantage of matrix-product states that are suited for simulating low-entangled one-dimensional systems. The price to pay is that the vacuum of the waveguide in this modeling becomes the Bogoliubov vacuum, and one has to consider a not-so-small local Hilbert space for bosonic degrees of freedom. To manage the large local Hilbert space, we adopt the recently proposed single-site schemes. We demonstrate the potential of the presented approach by simulating superradiant phenomena within the Hamiltonian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Toward a Complexity Classification of High-Temperature Bosons: Computational Tractability and Power-Law Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining when quantum many-body systems admit simple, efficiently simulable structure is a central problem. High-temperature thermal states are a natural candidate for such simplicity, yet for bosons, the unbounded local Hilbert space and energy invalidate the usual expectation that large $T$ guarantees tractability. Here we investigate the resulting complexity boundary for interacting lattice bosons and show that the repulsive Bose--Hubbard class lies on the ``simple'' side. For a family with long-range hopping decaying as $r^{-\alpha}$, we prove convergence of a controlled cluster expansion, which implies (above an explicit temperature threshold) an efficient classical algorithm to approximate the partition function and a rigorous power-law clustering bound for connected correlations. More broadly, our results provide a first step toward charting complexity boundaries for high-temperature bosons and suggest the repulsive Bose--Hubbard class as a natural candidate cusp.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Through Topological Defects: Reconciling Theory with Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Present theoretical predictions for the entanglement entropy through topological defects are violated by numerical simulations. In order to resolve this, we introduce a paradigm shift in the preparation of reduced density matrices in the presence of topological defects, and emphasize the role of defect networks with which they can be dressed. We consider the cases of grouplike and duality defects in detail for the Ising model, and find agreement with all numerically found entanglement entropies. Since our construction functions at the level of reduced density matrices, it accounts for topological defects beyond the entanglement entropy to other entanglement measures.</description>

      <title>Nanocrystal Geometry Governs Phase Transformation Pathways in Palladium Hydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pathways and structural dynamics of phase transformations impact performance of materials in energy and information storage technologies. Palladium hydride ($\mathrm{PdH}_x$) nanocrystals are an ideal model system for studying solute-induced phase transformations, where elastic energy from lattice mismatch between $\alpha$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ and $\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases is often considered a key to determining the transformation pathways. $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfacial elastic energy is affected by the confined geometry of a nanocrystal. However, how nanocrystal geometry influences phase transformation pathways is largely unknown. Using in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy, we directly visualize hydrogenation in Pd nanocrystals with two geometries -- a nanocube and a hexagonal nanoplate. Both follow similar sequences of an initially curved nucleus, interface flattening, and reverse-stage nucleation; however, their evolving $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibit geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments. In nanocubes, $\{100\}$-aligned configurations conform to static elastic energy ordering, representing a pathway that maintains a local mechanical equilibrium, whereas nanoplates display both $\{110\}$- and $\{211\}$-aligned interfaces. Theoretical simulations show that geometry determines the accessibility of alternative phase transformation pathways as the system is driven far from equilibrium during hydrogenation. These findings identify geometry as a fundamental parameter for directing phase transformation pathways, offering design principles for accessing atypical configurations and improving properties of intercalation-based devices.</description>
