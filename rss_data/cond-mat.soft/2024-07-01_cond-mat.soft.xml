      <title>Amoeba Monte Carlo algorithms for random trees with controlled branching activity: efficient trial move generation and universal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reptation Monte Carlo algorithm is a simple, physically motivated and efficient method for equilibrating semi-dilute solutions of linear polymers. Here we propose two simple generalizations for the analogue {\it Amoeba} algorithm for randomly branching chains, which allow to efficiently deal with random trees with controlled branching activity. We analyse the rich relaxation dynamics of Amoeba algorithms and demonstrate the existence of an unexpected scaling regime for the tree relaxation. In particular, our results suggests that the equilibration time for Amoeba algorithms scales in general like $N^2 \langle n_{\rm lin}\rangle^\Delta$, where $N$ denotes the number of tree nodes, $\langle n_{\rm lin}\rangle$ the mean number of linear segments the trees are composed of and $\Delta \simeq 0.4$.</description>

      <title>Structuring in Thin Films during Meniscus-Guided Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically the evaporation-driven phase separation of a binary fluid mixture in a thin film deposited on a moving substrate, as occurs in meniscus-guided deposition for solution-processed materials. Our focus is on rapid substrate motion during, where phase separation takes place far removed from the coating device under conditions where the mixture is essentially stationary with respect to the substrate. We account for the hydrodynamic transport of the mixture within the lubrication approximation. In the early stages of demixing, diffusive and evaporative mass transport predominates, consistent with earlier studies on evaporation-driven spinodal decomposition. By contrast, in the late-stage coarsening of the demixing process, the interplay of solvent evaporation, diffusive, and hydrodynamic mass transport results in a number of distinct coarsening mechanisms. The effective coarsening rate is dictated by the (momentarily) dominant mass transport mechanism and therefore depends on the material properties, evaporation rate and time: slow solvent evaporation results in initially diffusive coarsening that for sufficiently strong hydrodynamic transport transitions to hydrodynamic coarsening, whereas rapid solvent evaporation can preempt and suppress either or both hydrodynamic and diffusive coarsening. We identify a novel hydrodynamic coarsening regime for off-critical mixtures, arising from the interaction of the interfaces between solute-rich and solute-poor regions in the film with the solution-gas interface. This interaction induces directional motion of solute-rich droplets along gradients in the film thickness, from regions where the film is relatively thick to where it is thinner. The solute-rich domains subsequently accumulate and coalesce in the thinner regions, enhancing domain growth.</description>

      <title>Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Model for Bacterial Heat Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Brownian dynamics simulations to study a model of a cyclic bacterial heat engine based on a harmonically confined colloidal probe particle in a bath formed by active Brownian particles. For intermediate activities, active noise experienced by large enough probes becomes Gaussian with exponential autocorrelation function. We show that, in this experimentally pertinent regime, the probability densities for stochastic work, heat, and efficiency are well represented by those of an effective active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle (AOUP). Due to the probe's fast relaxation in the potential in typical experimental implementations, good agreement can prevail even when the noise autocorrelation function develops non-exponential tails. Our results show that the AOUP provides a convenient and accurate, analytically tractable effective model to mimic and analyze experimental bacterial heat engines, especially when operating with comparatively large probes and stiff traps.</description>

      <title>Deposit of Red Blood Cells at low concentrations in evaporating droplets: central edge growth and potential applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaporation of blood droplets and diluted blood samples is a topic of intensive research, as it is seen as a possible low-cost tool for diagnosis. So far, samples with volume fraction down to a few percents of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) have been studied, and those were reportedly dominated by a ``coffee-ring'' deposit. In this study, samples with lower volume fractions have been used in order to study the growth of the evaporative deposit from sessile droplets more in details. We observed that blood samples and salt solutions with less than 1\% volume fraction of RBCs are dominated by a central deposit. We characterized the growth process of this central deposit by evaporating elongated drops, and determined that it is consistent with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang process in the presence of quenched disorder. Our results showed a sensitivity of this deposit size to the fibrinogen concentration and shape of the RBCs, meaning that this parameter could be used to develop a new and cost-effective clinical marker for inflammation and RBC deformation.</description>

      <title>Complexity Scaling of Liquid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to excess-entropy scaling, dynamic properties of liquids like viscosity and diffusion coefficient are determined by the entropy. This link between dynamics and thermodynamics is increasingly studied and of interest also for industrial applications, but hampered by the challenge of calculating entropy efficiently. Utilizing the fact that entropy is basically the Kolmogorov complexity, which can be estimated from optimal compression algorithms [Avinery et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 178102 (2019); Martiniani et al., Phys. Rev. X 9, 011031 (2019)], we here demonstrate that the diffusion coefficients of four simple liquids follow a universal, exponential function of the estimated optimal-compression length of a single equilibrium configuration. We conclude that ``complexity scaling'' has the potential to become a useful tool for estimating dynamic properties of any liquid from a single configuration.</description>

      <title>Collective motion of energy depot active disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we have studied collectives of active disks with an energy depot, moving in the two-dimensional plane and interacting via excluded volume. The energy depot accounts for the extraction of energy taking place at the level of each particle in order to perform self-propulsion, included in an underdampled Langevin dynamics. We show that this model undergoes a flocking transition, exhibiting some of the key features of the Vicsek model, namely, band formation and giant number fluctuations. Large density bands disappear as the activity is further increased, eventually reaching a homogeneous polar state. We unravel an effective alignment interaction at the level of two-particle collisions that can be controlled by activity and gives rise to flocking at large scales.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of quasi-one-dimensional fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate thermodynamic and structural quantities of a fluid of hard spheres of diameter $\sigma$ in a quasi-one-dimensional pore with accessible pore width $W $ smaller than $\sigma$ by applying a perturbative method worked out earlier for a confined fluid in a slit pore [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{109}, 240601 (2012)]. In a first step, we prove that the thermodynamic and a certain class of structural quantities of the hard-sphere fluid in the pore can be obtained from a purely one-dimensional fluid of rods of length $ \sigma$ with a central hard core of size $\sigma_W =\sqrt{\sigma^2 - W^2}$ and a soft part at both ends of length $(\sigma-\sigma_W)/2$. These rods interact via effective $k$-body potentials $v^{(k)}_\text{eff}$ ($k \geq 2$) . The two- and the three-body potential will be calculated explicitly. In a second step, the free energy of this effective one-dimensional fluid is calculated up to leading order in $ (W/\sigma)^2$. Explicit results for, e.g. the perpendicular pressure, surface tension, and the density profile as a function of density, temperature, and pore width are presented presented and partly compared with results from Monte-Carlo simulations and standard virial expansions. Despite the perturbative character of our approach it encompasses the singularity of the thermodynamic quantities at the jamming transition point.</description>

      <title>Learning glass transition temperatures via dimensionality reduction with data from computer simulations: Polymers as the pilot case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods provide advanced means for understanding inherent patterns within large and complex datasets. Here, we employ the principal component analysis (PCA) and the diffusion map (DM) techniques to evaluate the glass transition temperature ($T_\mathrm{g}$) from low-dimensional representations of all-atom molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of polylactide (PLA) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). Four molecular descriptors were considered: radial distribution functions (RDFs), mean square displacements (MSDs), relative square displacements (RSDs), and dihedral angles (DAs). By applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to analyze the PCA and DM projections, and by quantifying their log-likelihoods as a density-based metric, a distinct separation into two populations corresponding to melt and glass states was revealed. This separation enabled the $T_\mathrm{g}$ evaluation from a cooling-induced sharp increase in the overlap between log-likelihood distributions at different temperatures. $T_\mathrm{g}$ values derived from the RDF and MSD descriptors using DM closely matched the standard computer simulation-based dilatometric and dynamic $T_\mathrm{g}$ values for both PLA and PHB models. This was not the case for PCA. The DM-transformed DA and RSD data resulted in $T_\mathrm{g}$ values in agreement with experimental ones. Overall, the fusion of atomistic simulations and diffusion maps complemented with the Gaussian Mixture Models presents a promising framework for computing $T_\mathrm{g}$ and studying the glass transition in a unified way across various molecular descriptors for glass-forming materials.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulations of glass-forming liquids beyond Metropolis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are widely employed to measure the physical properties of glass-forming liquids in thermal equilibrium. Combined with local Monte Carlo moves, the Metropolis algorithm can also be used to simulate the relaxation dynamics, thus offering an efficient alternative to molecular dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations are however more versatile, because carefully designed Monte Carlo algorithms can more efficiently sample the rugged free energy landscape characteristic of glassy systems. After a brief overview of Monte Carlo studies of glass-formers, we define and implement a series of Monte Carlo algorithms in a three-dimensional model of polydisperse hard spheres. We show that the standard local Metropolis algorithm is the slowest, and that implementing collective moves or breaking detailed balance enhances the efficiency of the Monte Carlo sampling. We use time correlation functions to provide a microscopic interpretation of these observations. Seventy years after its invention, the Monte Carlo method remains the most efficient and versatile tool to compute low-temperatures properties in supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Universal Hyperuniform Organization in Looped Leaf Vein Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leaf vein network is a hierarchical vascular system that transports water and nutrients to the leaf cells. The thick primary veins form a branched network, while the secondary veins develop closed circuits forming a well-defined cellular structure. Through extensive analysis of a variety of distinct leaf species, we discover that the apparently disordered cellular structures of the secondary vein networks exhibit a universal hyperuniform organization and possess a hidden order on large scales. Disorder hyperuniform (DHU) systems lack conventional long-range order, yet they completely suppress normalized large-scale density fluctuations like crystals. Specifically, we find that the distributions of the geometric centers associated with the vein network loops possess a vanishing static structure factor in the zero-wavenumber limit, i.e., $S(k) \sim k^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha \approx 0.64$, providing an example of class III hyperuniformity in biology. This hyperuniform organization leads to superior efficiency of diffusive transport, as evidenced by the much faster convergence of the time-dependent spreadability $\mathcal{S}(t)$ to its long-time asymptotic limit, compared to that of other uncorrelated or correlated disordered but non-hyperuniform organizations. Our results also have implications for the discovery and design of novel disordered network materials with optimal transport properties.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Polyalkylfluorene Conjugated Polymers: Insights from Neutron Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of the conjugated polymers poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PF8) and poly(9,9-didodecylfluorene) (PF12), differing by the length of their side chains, is investigated in the amorphous phase using the quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) technique. The measurements are synergistically underpinned by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The probe is focused on the picosecond time scale, where the structural dynamics of both PF8 and PF12 would mainly be dominated by motions of their side chains. The measurements highlighted temperature-induced dynamics, reflected in the broadening of the QENS spectra upon heating. The MD simulations reproduced well the observations; hence validating the MD force fields, the adopted amorphous model structures, and the numerical procedure. As the QENS spectra are dominated by the signal from the hydrogens on the backbones and side chains of PF8 and PF12, extensive analysis of the MD simulations allowed: (i) tagging these hydrogens, (ii) estimating their contributions to the self-part of the van Hove functions and hence to the QENS spectra, and (iii) determining the activation energies of the different motions involving the tagged hydrogens. PF12 is found to exhibit QENS spectra broader than those of PF8, indicating a more pronounced motion of the didodecyl chains of PF12 as compared to dioctyl chains of PF8. This is in agreement with the outcome of our MD analysis: (i) confirming a lower glass transition temperature of PF12 compared to PF8, (ii) showing PF12 having a lower density than PF8, and (iii) highlighting lower activation energies of the motions of PF12 in comparison with PF8. This study helped to gain insights into the temperature-induced side-chain dynamics of the PF8 and PF12 conjugated polymers, influencing their stability, which could potentially impact the performance of the associated optoelectronic active layer.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Correlation Augmented Self-Consistent Field Theory and Its Application to Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Socioeconomic agents as active matter in nonequilibrium Sakoda-Schelling models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How robust are socioeconomic agent-based models with respect to the details of the agents' decision rule? We tackle this question by considering an occupation model in the spirit of the Sakoda-Schelling model, historically introduced to shed light on segregation dynamics among human groups. For a large class of utility functions and decision rules, we pinpoint the nonequilibrium nature of the agent dynamics, while recovering the equilibrium-like phase separation phenomenology. Within the mean field approximation we show how the model can be mapped, to some extent, onto an active matter field description. Finally, we consider non-reciprocal interactions between two populations, and show how they can lead to non-steady macroscopic behavior. We believe our approach provides a unifying framework to further study geography-dependent agent-based models, notably paving the way for joint consideration of population and price dynamics within a field theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Phase Diagram and Reaction Paths of the Active Model B with the Deep Minimum Action Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium phase transitions are notably difficult to analyze because their mechanisms depend on the system's dynamics in a complex way due to the lack of time-reversal symmetry. To complicate matters, the system's steady-state distribution is unknown in general. Here, the phase diagram of the active Model B is computed with a deep neural network implementation of the geometric minimum action method (gMAM). This approach unveils the unconventional reaction paths and nucleation mechanism in dimensions 1, 2 and 3, by which the system switches between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases in the binodal region. Our main findings are: (i) the mean time to escape the phase-separated state is (exponentially) extensive in the system size $L$, but it increases non-monotonically with $L$ in dimension 1; (ii) the mean time to escape the homogeneous state is always finite, in line with the recent work of Cates and Nardini~[Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 098203]; (iii) at fixed $L$, the active term increases the stability of the homogeneous phase, eventually destroying the phase separation in the binodal for large but finite systems. Our results are particularly relevant for active matter systems in which the number of constituents hardly goes beyond $10^7$ and where finite-size effects matter.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have implemented resetting by means of an external trap, whereby a system relaxes to the minimum of the trap and is reset in a finite time. In this work, we set up and analyse the thermodynamics of such a protocol. We present a general framework, even valid for non-Poissonian resetting, that captures the thermodynamic work required to maintain a resetting process up to a given observation time, and exactly calculate the moment generating function of this work. Our framework is valid for a wide range of systems, the only assumption being relaxation to equilibrium in the resetting trap. Examples and extensions are considered. In the case of Brownian motion, we investigate optimal resetting schemes that minimise work and its fluctuations, the mean work for arbitrary switching protocols and comparisons to previously studied resetting schemes. Numerical simulations are performed to validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Onset of spontaneous beating and whirling in the follower force model of an active filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the onset of spontaneous dynamics in the follower force model of an active filament, wherein a slender elastic filament in a viscous liquid is clamped normal to a wall at one end and subjected to a tangential compressive force at the other. Clarke, Hwang and Keaveny (Phys. Rev. Fluids, to appear) have recently conducted a thorough investigation of this model using methods of computational dynamical systems; inter alia, they show that the filament first loses stability via a supercritical double-Hopf bifurcation, with periodic 'planar-beating' states (unstable) and 'whirling' states (stable) simultaneously emerging at the critical follower-force value. We complement their numerical study by carrying out a weakly nonlinear analysis close to this unconventional bifurcation, using the method of multiple scales. The main outcome is an 'amplitude equation' governing the slow modulation of small-magnitude oscillations of the filament in that regime. Analysis of this reduced-order model provides insights into the onset of spontaneous dynamics, including the creation of the nonlinear whirling states from particular superpositions of linear planar-beating modes as well as the selection of whirling over planar beating in three-dimensional scenarios.</description>
