      <title>Codimensions-Two Submanifolds Contained in the Light-like Hypercylinder $\mathcal{LC}^n\times\mathbb R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate space-like codimension-two submanifolds of the Lorentz-Minkowski space $\mathbb{E}_1^{n+2}$ constrained to lie on the light-like hypercylinder $\mathcal{LC}^n \times \mathbb{R}$ over the light cone $\mathcal{LC}^n$. By constructing a geometrically defined global frame field on the submanifold, we analyze the geometric interpretations of the associated extrinsic invariants by providing characterizations of (pseudo-)isotropic and pseudo-umbilical submanifolds, as well as submanifolds with flat normal bundle. In particular, we obtain local classification theorems for these classes of submanifolds.</description>

      <title>Construction of an isometric immersion of a bounded, planar region from a framed curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for characterizing isometric immersions of simply connected, bounded, planar regions with piecewise smooth boundaries into three-dimensional space. Each immersion is associated with a framed curve along the boundary of the image surface, comprised by a parametrized curve and a unit normal vector. We identify a set of compatibility and regularity conditions on this framed curve that ensure the existence of a $C^1$ isometric immersion that is $C^2$ almost everywhere and possesses finite bending energy. Under these conditions, we derive an exact dimensional reduction of the bending energy to a line integral over the boundary curve, without relying on asymptotic assumptions or approximations. By analyzing the behavior of the unit normal vector along the framed boundary, we distinguish between planar and curved regions of the immersed surface. We identify the geometric conditions under which global $C^2$ regularity is potentially lost, in which case the associated immersion belongs to $W^{2,2}$ -- a Sobolev space that arises naturally in variational models of unstretchable elastic surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11855v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of generalized $s$-manifolds, which is a generalization of symmetric spaces. Then we give a method to construct generalized $s$-manifolds and present some typical examples. We study polars and antipodal sets of generalized $s$-manifolds aiming to extend the results on compact symmetric spaces due to Chen and Nagano.</description>

      <title>A geometry of cubic discriminants in 8 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines 8-dimensional Riemannian manifolds whose structure group reduces to ${SO(4)}_{ir}\subset GL(8,\mathbb R)$, the image of an irreducible representation of $SO(4)$ on $\mathbb R^8$. We demonstrate that such a reduction can be described by an almost quaternion-Hermitian structure and a special rank-4 tensor field, which we call a cubic discriminant. This tensor field is pointwise linearly equivalent to the formula for the discriminant of a cubic polynomial. We show that the only non-flat, integrable examples of these structures are the quaternion-K\"ahler symmetric spaces $G_2\big/SO(4)$ and $G_{2(2)}\big/SO(4)$. We also present a new curvature-based characterization for the Riemannian metrics on these spaces.</description>

      <title>Almost Ricci Solitons on Class $\mathcal A$ Hypersurfaces of Product Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study hypersurfaces in the product spaces $\mathbb{Q}_{\epsilon}^3 \times \mathbb{R}$ for which the tangential component $T$ of the vector field $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ is a principal direction, where $\mathbb{Q}_{\epsilon}^3$ denotes the three-dimensional non-flat Riemannian space form with sectional curvature $\epsilon = \pm 1$, and $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ is the unit vector field tangent to the $\mathbb{R}$-factor. We obtain a local classification of hypersurfaces with three distinct principal curvatures satisfying specific functional relations. Then, we determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for such hypersurfaces to admit an almost Ricci soliton structure with potential vector field $T$. Finally, we prove that the only hypersurfaces admitting such solitons are rotational, by showing that the constructed examples with three distinct principal curvatures do not admit almost Ricci solitons.</description>

      <title>Rigidity Results for Spacelike Self-Shrinkers via Different Maximum Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish several rigidity results for spacelike self-shrinkers immersed in the pseudo-Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n+p}_p$. Under suitable boundedness conditions on either the mean curvature vector or the second fundamental form, we apply different versions of Omori--Yau type maximum principles due to Qiu [20], Chen and Qiu [10], and Al\'ias, Caminha, and Nascimento [3] to show that such self-shrinkers must be spacelike hyperplanes. These results contribute to the broader classification of spacelike self-shrinkers under natural geometric assumptions.</description>

      <title>Hodge-de Rham Theory on Higher-Dimensional Level-L Sierpinski Gaskets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the Hodge-de Rham theory of Aaron \textit{et al.} [Commun. Pure Appl. Anal. {\bf 13} (2014)] to higher-dimensional level-$l$ Sierpinski gaskets $SG_{\ell}^{n},$ providing a framework for analyzing differential forms and Laplacians on these fractal structures. We construct a sequence of graphs approximating $SG_{\ell}^{n}$ and define $k$-forms, de Rham derivatives, and their duals on these graphs. We prove that the extension of a $1$-form on a generation-$m$ graph to a $1$-form on a generation-$(m+1)$ graph is harmonic. We obtain a basis for the space of harmonic $1$-forms. We also explore the properties of $2$-forms on the level-$3$ Sierpinski gasket, under the assumptions that the $2$-forms are absolutely continuous with respect to the Kusuoka measure or the standard self-similar measure and that the Radon-Nikodym derivatives are continuous.</description>

      <title>Closed $\mathrm{G}_2$ structures on compact manifolds satisfying the known topological obstructions to holonomy $\mathrm{G}_2$ metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new compact manifolds endowed with closed $\mathrm{G}_2$ structures that satisfy the topological properties found by Joyce and Baraglia for the existence of a torsion-free $\mathrm{G}_2$ structure in the same cohomology class. Those manifolds arise as resolutions of orbifolds of the form $M/\mathbb{Z}_2$, where $M$ itself does not admit any torsion-free $\mathrm{G}_2$ structure. We develop an equivariant resolution procedure for closed $\mathrm{G}_2$ orbifolds with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ isotropy, and analyze some topological properties of the resolved manifolds, including their first Pontryagin class and certain triple Massey products.</description>

      <title>Shannon entropy for harmonic metrics on cyclic Higgs bundles II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Riemann surface and $K_X \rightarrow X$ the canonical bundle. For each integer $r \geq 2$, each $q \in H^0(K_X^r)$, and each choice of the square root $K_X^{1/2}$ of the canonical bundle, we obtain a Higgs bundle, which is called a cyclic Higgs bundle. A diagonal harmonic metric $h = (h_1, \dots, h_r)$ on a cyclic Higgs bundle yields $r-1$-Hermitian metrics $H_1, \dots, H_{r-1}$ on $K_X^{-1} \rightarrow X$, while $h_1$, $h_r$, and $q$ yield a degenerate Hermitian metric $H_r$ on $K_X^{-1}\rightarrow X$. The $r$-differential $q$ induces a subharmonic weight function $\phi_q=\frac{1}{r}\log|q|$ on $K_X$, and the diagonal harmonic metric depends solely on this weight function. In the previous papers, the author studied the extension of harmonic metrics associated with arbitrary subharmonic weight function $\varphi$, which also constructs Hermitian metrics $H_1,\dots, H_r$ on $K_X^{-1}\rightarrow X$. Especially, the author introduced a function called entropy that quantifies the degree of mutual misalignment of the metrics $H_1,\dots, H_r$. In this paper, by analogy with the canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics, we further introduce the quantity which we call free energy. When $H_1,\dots, H_{r-1}$ are all complete and satisfy a condition concerning their approximation, we give a sufficient condition for the free energy to decrease at each point, and when $r=2,3$ we also give a sufficient condition for the entropy to increase at each point. Furthermore, on the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$, when is $C^2$ outside a compact subset, we provide, from the perspective of entropy and free energy, necessary and sufficient conditions for the function $e^\varphi h_\ast^{-1} \otimes h_{\mathbb{D}}$ to be bounded, where $h_{\mathbb{D}}$ denotes the Hermitian metric induced by the Poincar\'e metric. This result extends the work of Wan, Benoist-Hulin, Labourie-Toulisse, and Dai-Li.</description>

      <title>Complete harmonic metrics and subharmonic functions on the unit disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Riemann surface, $K_X \rightarrow X$ the canonical bundle, and $T_X\rightarrow X$ the dual bundle of the canonical bundle. For each integer $r \geq 2$, each $q \in H^0(K_X^r)$, and each choice of the square root $K_X^{1/2}$ of the canonical bundle, we obtain a Higgs bundle $(\mathbb{K}_r,\Phi(q))$, which is called a cyclic Higgs bundle. A diagonal harmonic metric $h = (h_1, \dots, h_r)$ on a cyclic Higgs bundle yields $r-1$-Hermitian metrics $H_1, \dots, H_{r-1}$ on $T_X$, while $h_1$, $h_r$, and $q$ yield a degenerate Hermitian metric $H_r$ on $T_X$. A diagonal harmonic metric is said to be complete if the K\"ahler metrics induced by $H_1,\dots, H_{r-1}$ are all complete. Li-Mochizuki established a theorem stating that on any Riemann surface $X$ and any $q$ that is non-zero unless $X$ is hyperbolic, there exists a unique complete harmonic metric $h$ on $(\mathbb{K}_r,\Phi(q))$ with a fixed determinant. The holomorphic section $q$ induces a subharmonic weight function $\phi_q=\frac{1}{r}\log|q|^2$ on $K_X$, and a diagonal harmonic metric depends solely on this weight function $\phi_q$. In this paper, we extend the uniqueness part of the theorem of Li-Mochizuki to any subharmonic weight function $\varphi$ whose exponential is $C^2$ outside a compact subset $K \subseteq X$. We also show that on the unit disc, a complete Hermitian metric associated with $\varphi$ always exists. Furthermore, on the unit disc, when $\varphi$ can be monotonically approximated by a family of weight functions $(\varphi_\epsilon)_{0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1}$, where each $\varphi_\epsilon$ is smooth and defined on a disc $\mathbb{D}_\epsilon= \{z \in \mathbb{C} \mid |z| &lt; 1 - \epsilon\}$, we show that the corresponding family of complete metrics $(h_\epsilon)_{0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1}$ converges monotonically to a complete metric $h$ associated with $\varphi$ as $\epsilon\searrow 0$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Deformation Flow and Global Classification of Simply-Connected Closed Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a spectral deformation flow for amplitudes $C_n(\tau)$, governed by a second-order self-adjoint operator $\hat{C}$ on a compact domain. This flow leads to exponential stabilization $C_n(\tau) \to \pi$, encoded in the spectral multi-function $C(v,\tau,n)$, which describes the geometric deformation across scales. Building on prior results on spectral rigidity, completeness, and asymptotics of $\hat{C}$, we analyze conditions under which this convergence determines the full topological and smooth structure of simply-connected closed manifolds in all dimensions $d \ge 3$. Using spectral asymptotics and global analysis, we show that such convergence uniquely selects the standard sphere, excluding exotic smooth structures and isospectral non-isometric manifolds within the operator domain. In particular, we examine the critical case $d = 4$ and prove that no non-standard smooth structure can yield the limiting spectral profile. These results suggest that the spectrum of $\hat{C}$, shaped by its geometric flow, serves as a complete invariant of smooth geometry.</description>

Abstract: We introduce $\hat{H}$-eigenvalue for $2m$-th order $n$-dimensional complex tensors. Then we determine several checkable inclusion sets for $\hat{H}$-eigenvalues and derive some criterions for the Hermitian positive definiteness (semi-definiteness) of Hermitian and CPS tensors. We also apply the Hermitian tensors to study holomorphic sectional curvature in complex differential geometry and reprove the algebraic part of recent results by Alvarez-Heier-Zheng and Chaturvedi-Heier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that on every non-$G_2$ complex symmetric space of rank two, there are complete Calabi-Yau metrics of Euclidean volume growth with prescribed horospherical singular tangent cone at infinity, providing the first examples of affine Calabi-Yau smoothings of singular and irregular tangent cone. As a corollary, we obtain infinitely many examples of Calabi-Yau manifolds degenerating to the tangent cone in a single step, supporting a recent conjecture by Sun-Zhang, which was only proved when the tangent cone at infinity has only an isolated singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study globally defined $(\lambda,\mu)$-eigenfamilies on closed Riemannian manifolds. Among others, we provide (non-)existence results for such eigenfamilies, examine their topological properties and classify $(\lambda,\mu)$-eigenfamilies on flat tori. It is further shown that for $f=f_1+i f_2$ being an eigenfunction decomposed into its real and its imaginary part, the powers $\{f_1^a f_2^b\mid a,b\in\mathbb N\}$ satisfy highly rigid orthogonality relations in $L^2(M)$. In establishing these orthogonality relations one is led to combinatorial identities involving determinants of products of binomials, which we view as being of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We estimate the number of ends of smooth and singular Ricci shrinkers focussing first on general ends and later on asymptotically conical ones. In particular, we obtain a variety of applications to sequences of Ricci shrinkers converging in a weak pointed sense to a possibly singular limit Ricci shrinker, for instance no new conical end can form in the limit.</description>

      <title>Shannon entropy for harmonic metrics on cyclic Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Riemann surface, $K_X \rightarrow X$ the canonical bundle, and $T_X= K_X^{-1}\rightarrow X$ the dual bundle of the canonical bundle. For each integer $r \geq 2$, each $q \in H^0(K_X^r)$, and each choice of the square root $K_X^{1/2}$ of the canonical bundle, we canonically obtain a Higgs bundle, which is called a cyclic Higgs bundle. A diagonal harmonic metric $h = (h_1, \dots, h_r)$ on a cyclic Higgs bundle yields $r-1$-Hermitian metrics $H_1, \dots, H_{r-1}$ on $T_X\rightarrow X$, defined as $H_j=h_j^{-1} \otimes h_{j+1}$ for each $j=1,\dots, r-1$, while $h_1$, $h_r$, and $q$ yield a degenerate Hermitian metric $H_r$ on $T_X \rightarrow X$. The $r$-differential $q$ induces a subharmonic weight function $\phi_q=\frac{1}{r}\log|q|^2$ on $K_X\rightarrow X$, and the diagonal harmonic metric depends solely on this weight function $\phi_q$. In the previous papers, the author introduced and studied the extension of harmonic metrics associated with arbitrary subharmonic weight function $\varphi$, which also constructs $r-1$-Hermitian metrics $H_1,\dots, H_{r-1}$ and a degenerate Hermitian metric $H_r$ on $T_X\rightarrow X$. In this paper, for each non-zero real parameter $\beta$, we introduce a function, which we call entropy, that quantifies the degree of mutual misalignment of the Hermitian metrics $H_1,\dots, H_r$. By extending the estimate established by Dai-Li and Li-Mochizuki to general subharmonic weight functions, we provide an upper bound and a lower bound for the entropy when $H_1,\dots, H_{r-1}$ are all complete and satisfy a condition concerning their approximation. Additionally, we show that the difference between the lower and upper bounds of entropy converges to a finite real number if and only if $\beta&gt;-1$.</description>

      <title>Integrable sub-Riemannian geodesic flows on the special orthogonal group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the geometry of the rubber-rolling distribution on the special orthogonal group and show that almost all the normal geodesics of any right-invariant sub-Riemannian metric defined on this distribution are completely integrable. Our argument is an adaptation of the method used to establish integrability of the Riemannian metric arising from the $n$-dimensional rigid body: namely, by exhibiting a Lax pair and bi-Hamiltonian structure for the reduced equations of motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal geodesics form an invariantly defined family of unparametrized curves in a conformal manifold generalizing unparametrized geodesics/paths of projective connections. The equation describing them is of third order, and it was an open problem whether they are given by an Euler--Lagrange equation. In dimension 3 (the simplest, but most important from the viewpoint of physical applications) we demonstrate that the equation for unparametrized conformal geodesics is variational.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local Donaldson-Scaduto conjecture predicts the existence and uniqueness of a special Lagrangian pair of pants with three asymptotically cylindrical ends in the Calabi-Yau 3-fold $X \times \mathbb{R}^2$, where $X$ is an ALE hyperk\"ahler 4-manifold of $A_2$-type. The existence of this special Lagrangian has previously been proved. In this paper, we prove a uniqueness theorem, showing that no other special Lagrangian pair of pants satisfies this conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the Parallels Between Minimal Surfaces and Einstein Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimal surfaces and Einstein manifolds are among the most natural structures in differential geometry. Whilst minimal surfaces are well understood, Einstein manifolds remain far less so. This exposition synthesises together a set of parallels between minimal surfaces embedded in an ambient three-manifold, and Einstein four-manifolds. These parallels include variational formulations, topological constraints, monotonicity formulae, compactness and epsilon-regularity theorems, and decompositions such as thick/thin and sheeted/non-sheeted structures. Though distinct in nature, the striking analogies between them raises a profound question: might there exist circumstances in which these objects are, in essence, manifestations of the same underlying geometry? Drawing on foundational results such as Jensen's theorem, Takahashi's theorem, and a conjecture of Song, this work suggests a bridge between the two structures. In particular, it shows that certain Einstein four-manifolds admit a minimal immersion into a higher-dimensional sphere. A key example of this is the embedding of $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ into $S^{7}$ via the Veronese map, where it arises as a minimal submanifold.</description>

      <title>On limit sets for geodesics of meromorphic connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.14222v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meromorphic connections on Riemann surfaces originate and are closely related to the classical theory of linear ordinary differential equations with meromorphic coefficients. Limiting behaviour of geodesics of such connections has been studied by e.g. Abate, Bianchi and Tovena in relation with generalized Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson theorems. At present, it seems still to be unknown whether some of the theoretically possible asymptotic behaviours of such geodesics really exist. In order to fill the gap, we use the branched affine structure induced by a Fuchsian meromorphic connection to present several examples with geodesics having infinitely many self-intersections and quite peculiar omega-limit sets.</description>

Abstract: The Mikami-Weinstein theorem is a generalization of the classical Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer symplectic reduction theorem to the case of symplectic groupoid actions. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a cosymplectic groupoid action on a cosymplectic manifold and prove a theorem which is a natural analogue of the Mikami-Weinstein theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of our paper is twofold. First, we present new mathematical developments on the analysis of de Gennes' hypothesis on the short-time asymptotics of the heat content for bounded domains with smooth boundary and with fractal boundary. Second, we discuss new findings and concepts related to fractal curvatures for domains with fractal boundary. We conjecture that fractal curvatures and their scaling exponents will emerge in the short-time heat content asymptotics of domains with fractal boundary and the results discussed here are small initial contributions towards a resolution.</description>

      <title>On The Geometry and Topology of Cayley Condition in Poncelet Porism for Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the differential-geometric and topological properties of the Cayley condition in Poncelet porism for triangles, defined as the locus of pairs of non-degenerate conics that admit a Poncelet triangle. While the algebraic condition for this porism, established by Cayley, is classical, the geometric nature of the set of solutions has remained largely unexplored. We demonstrate that this Cayley set is a smooth, connected, 9-dimensional complex manifold. This is proven by showing it is an open subset of a smooth algebraic variety endowed with a trivial fiber bundle structure over the space of non-degenerate conics.
  To further analyze its structure, we construct the moduli space of transversely intersecting conic pairs under the action of $\mathbb{P}GL_3(\mathbb{C})$ and identify it with an open subset of $\mathbb{CP}^2/S_3$. We compute the fundamental group of a generic orbit.
  The elliptic j-invariant is then introduced as a holomorphic map on this space of conics, which factors through this moduli space. We analyze the subset of the Cayley set where this map is a submersion - its regular part - which corresponds to excluding points whose j-invariant is one of the critical values $0$ or $1728$. We prove that this regular part is the total space of a fiber bundle over $\C \setminus \{0,1728\}$. This structure allows for the computation of the fundamental group via the long exact sequence of homotopy.
  Finally, we provide a principal bundle formulation for the Poncelet correspondence itself over orbits of conic pairs.</description>

      <title>1-Uryson width and covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the following question: Do there exist Riemannian polyhedra $X$ such that the 1-Uryson width of their universal covers $\mathrm{UW}_1(\widetilde{X})$ is bounded but $\mathrm{UW}_1(X)$ is arbitrarily large? We rule out two specific cases: when $\pi_1(X)$ is virtually cyclic and when $X$ is a Riemannian surface. More specifically, we show that if $X$ is a compact polyhedron with a virtually cyclic fundamental group, then its 1-Uryson width is bounded by the 1-Uryson width of its universal cover $\widetilde{X}$. Precisely: $$\mathrm{UW}_1(X) \leq 6 \cdot \mathrm{UW}_1(\widetilde{X}).$$ We show that if $X$ is a Riemannian surface with boundary then $$\mathrm{UW}_1(X) \leq \mathrm{UW}_1(\widetilde{X}).$$ Furthermore, we show that if there exist spaces $X$ for which $\mathrm{UW}_1(\widetilde{X})$ is bounded while $\mathrm{UW}_1(X)$ is arbitrarily large, then such examples must already appear in low dimensions. In particular, such $X$ can be found among Riemannian $2$-complexes.</description>
