      <title>Quark and gluon momentum fractions in the pion and in the kaon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results on the momentum fraction carried by quarks and gluons in the pion and the kaon. We employ three gauge ensembles generated with $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson twisted-mass clover-improved fermions with physical quark masses. We perform, for the first time, a continuum extrapolation directly at the physical pion. We find that the total momentum fraction carried by quarks is $\langle x \rangle_{q, R}^{\pi}= 0.575(79)$ and $\langle x \rangle_{q,R}^{K} = 0.683(50)$ and by gluons $\langle x \rangle_{g, R}^{\pi}=0.402(53)$ and $\langle x \rangle_{g, R}^{K}=0.422(67)$ in the pion and in the kaon, respectively, in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme and at the renormalization scale of 2 GeV.
  Having computed both the quark and gluon contributions in the continuum limit, we verify the momentum sum, finding 0.984(89) for the pion and 1.13(11) for the kaon.</description>

      <title>Monomer-dimer tensor-network basis for qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be formulated using an orthonormal basis constructed from the irreducible representations (irreps) $V_{\lambda}$ of the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge symmetry. On a lattice, the elements of this basis are tensor networks comprising dimer tensors on the links labeled by a set of irreps $\{\lambda_\ell\}$ and monomer tensors on sites labeled by $\{\lambda_s\}$. These tensors naturally define a local site Hilbert space, $\mathcal{H}^g_s$, on which gauge transformations act. Gauss's law introduces an additional index $\alpha_s = 1, 2, \dots, \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H}_s^g)$ that labels an orthonormal basis of the gauge-invariant subspace of $\mathcal{H}^g_s$. This monomer-dimer tensor-network (MDTN) basis, $\left| \{\lambda_s\},\{\lambda_\ell\},\{\alpha_s\}\right\rangle$, of the physical Hilbert space enables the construction of new qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theories that are free of sign problems while preserving key features of traditional LGTs. Here, we investigate finite-temperature confinement-deconfinement transitions in a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory in $d=2$ and $d=3$ spatial dimensions, formulated using the MDTN basis, and show that they reproduce the universal results of traditional LGTs at these transitions. Additionally, in $d=1$, we demonstrate using a plaquette chain that the string tension at zero temperature can be continuously tuned to zero by adjusting a model parameter that plays the role of the gauge coupling in traditional LGTs.</description>

      <title>QCD predictions for physical multimeson scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use lattice QCD calculations of the finite-volume spectra of systems of two and three mesons to determine, for the first time, three-particle scattering amplitudes with physical quark masses. Our results are for combinations of $\pi^+$ and $K^+$, at a lattice spacing $a=0.063\;$fm, and in the isospin-symmetric limit. We also obtain accurate results for maximal-isospin two-meson amplitudes, with those for $\pi^+ K^+$ and $2K^+$ being the first determinations at the physical point. Dense lattice spectra are obtained using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, and the analysis leading to scattering amplitudes is done using the relativistic finite-volume formalism. Results are compared to chiral perturbation theory and to phenomenological fits to experimental data, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>Expanded ensemble method for bubble nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of impurities and boundary effects, first order phase transitions are initiated by the nucleation of critical bubbles. In thermally driven transitions many systems can remain metastable for an extended time, possibly tens of orders of magnitude longer than typical microscopic timescales. In standard Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of these systems the probability of critical bubbles can be too suppressed for the transition to happen in any practical simulation time. The computation can be accelerated by using modified sampling methods, for example multicanonical or Wang-Landau sampling. However, even using these methods, there remains a condensation barrier which dramatically reduces the efficiency at large volumes. We present a novel sampling method, the method of expanded ensembles, which very effectively circumvents the condensation barrier and enables efficient simulations at large volumes.</description>

      <title>Update on the isospin breaking corrections to the HVP with C-periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the RC$^\star$ collaboration, we simulate lattice QCD+QED using $C-$periodic spatial boundary conditions to ensure that locality, gauge invariance, and translational invariance are preserved throughout the calculation. We present our progress in computing isospin-breaking (IB) corrections to the leading hadronic contribution to $(g-2)_\mu$. We compare two ways of including the IB corrections: the RM123 method and dynamical QCD+QED simulations, both with $C-$periodic boundary conditions. The two calculations are performed at $\beta=3.24$ with four flavours of $\mathcal{O}(a)-$improved Wilson fermions; the QCD ensemble features $SU(3)-$symmetric sea quarks plus charm, while down and strange quarks are degenerate in QCD+QED gauge ensembles.</description>

      <title>Dumbbell Fermions and Spin Models on Honeycomb Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We express Kitaev's exact solution of spin models on the honeycomb lattice as a special case of a higher dimensional duality between staggered Majorana fermions and Pauli spins. General models with bilinear nearest neighbor couplings of spins and external magnetic fields are soluble in this way. Each model gives rise to an infinite number of single particle fermion Schrodinger equations, depending on the choice of discrete gauge field flux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Kitaev's real-space formulation of the first Chern number to the second Chern number and establish a computational framework for its evaluation. To test its validity, we apply the derived formula to the disordered Wilson-Dirac model and analyze its ability to capture topological properties in the presence of disorder. Our results demonstrate that the real-space approach provides a viable method for characterizing higher-dimensional topological phases beyond momentum-space formulations.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping SU(3) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the positivity bootstrap approach to SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills (YM) theory, extending previous studies of large N and SU(2) theories by incorporating multiple-trace Wilson loop operators. Utilizing Hermitian and reflection positivity conditions, along with Schwinger-Dyson (SD) loop equations, we compute rigorous bounds for the expectation values of plaquette Wilson loop in 2D, 3D, and 4D YM theories. Our results exhibit clear convergence and are consistent with known analytic or numerical results. To enhance the approach, we introduce a novel twist-reflection positivity condition, which we prove to be exact in the 2D YM theory. Additionally, we propose a dimensional-reduction truncation, where Wilson loop operators are effectively restricted to a lower-dimensional subplane, significantly simplifying the computations. SD equations for double-trace Wilson loops are also derived in detail. Our findings suggest that the positivity bootstrap method is broadly applicable to higher-rank gauge theories beyond the single-trace cases, providing a solid foundation for further non-perturbative investigations of gauge theories using positivity-based methods.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States for Quantum Simulation of Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for the quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories using gauge-invariant packaged quantum states \cite{Ma2017,Ma2025}. In this formalism, every single excitation transforms as a complete \textbf{irreducible representation (irrep)} of the local gauge group, preventing any appearance of fractional or partial \textbf{internal quantum numbers (IQNs)}. Multi-particle excitations can form nontrivial packaged entangled states that are also gauge invariant, thereby forbidding partial or fractional IQNs. In other words, all IQNs of such packaged entangled states remain inseparably entangled. This ``packaging principle'' ensures that physical states remain confined to the correct gauge sector and excludes partial charges or colors, even when multiple excitations are entangled.
  We illustrate this approach for $\mathrm{U}(1)$, $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theories, discussing explicit constructions, Trotterized Hamiltonian evolution, and gauge-invariant measurements on a quantum simulator. We also outline how packaged states can mitigate gauge-violating errors and serve as natural building blocks for gauge-invariant coding schemes, while noting that standard quantum error correction is still required against typical local noise that respects gauge symmetry.</description>

      <title>Dense and magnetized QCD from imaginary chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we computed the equation of state of dense QCD in the presence of background magnetic fields using lattice QCD simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential. Our simulations include 2+1+1 flavors of stout-smeared staggered fermions with masses at the physical point and a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action. Using several expansion schemes, we tuned our simulation parameters such that the equation of state satisfies strangeness neutrality and isospin asymmetry constraints, which are relevant to the phenomenology of heavy-ion collisions. Our results suggest a strong change in the equation of state due to the magnetic field, in particular, around the crossover temperature. A continuum extrapolation of our data is still needed for future applications of our equation of state to heavy-ion-collision phenomenology.</description>

      <title>HMC and gradient flow with machine-learned classically perfect fixed-point actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixed-point (FP) lattice actions are classically perfect, i.e., they have continuum classical properties unaffected by discretization effects and are expected to have suppressed lattice artifacts at weak coupling. Therefore they provide a possible way to extract continuum physics with coarser lattices, allowing to circumvent problems with critical slowing down and topological freezing towards the continuum limit. We use machine-learning methods to parameterize a FP action for four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory using lattice gauge-covariant convolutional neural networks. The large operator space allows us to find superior parameterizations compared to previous studies and we show how such actions can be efficiently simulated with the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that FP lattice actions can be used to define a classically perfect gradient flow without any lattice artifacts at tree level. We present initial results for scaling of the gradient flow with the FP action.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for hadronic light-by-light scattering: subleading contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an evaluation of subleading effects in the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Using a recently derived optimized basis, we first study the matching of axial-vector contributions to short-distance constraints at the level of the scalar basis functions, finding that also the tails of the pseudoscalar poles and tensor mesons play a role. We then develop a matching strategy that allows for a combined evaluation of axial-vector and short-distance constraints, supplemented by an estimate of tensor-meson contributions based on simplified assumptions for their transition form factors. Uncertainties are primarily propagated from the axial-vector transition form factors and the variation of the matching scale, but we also consider estimates of the low-energy effect of hadronic states not explicitly included. In total, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}\big|_\text{subleading}=33.2(7.2)\times 10^{-11}$, which in combination with previously evaluated contributions in the dispersive approach leads to $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}\big|_\text{total}=101.9(7.9)\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative constraints on perturbation theory at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been understood that the inclusion of temperature in the perturbative treatment of quantum field theories leads to complications that are not present at zero temperature. In these proceedings we report on the non-perturbative obstructions that arise, and how these lead to deviations in the predictions of lattice scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory. Using the known non-perturbative spectral constraints satisfied by finite-temperature correlation functions we outline why the presence of distinct particle-like excitations could provide a resolution to these issues.</description>
