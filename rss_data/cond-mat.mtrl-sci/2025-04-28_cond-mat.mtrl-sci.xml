      <title>Ferroelastic Domain Induced Electronic Modulation in Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their exceptional properties. In the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskites, ferroelastic domains formed during phase transitions enhance bulk transport and emissive efficiency. However, the microscopic mechanisms governing carrier dynamics remain poorly understood. In this study, we employ cathodoluminescence (CL) and micro-Raman spectroscopy to image and investigate the electronic properties of the ferroelastic domain walls in CsPbBr3 single crystals. CL measurements reveal a reduced emissive yield and a slight redshift in emission at the domain walls. Further, micro-Raman studies provide spatially resolved mapping of vibrational modes, exhibiting second-order phonon modes localized at the domain boundaries. Our findings suggest that electron-phonon coupling at twin domain walls plays a critical role in facilitating efficient charge separation, thereby improving the optoelectronic performance of the CsPbBr3 perovskites.</description>

      <title>Revealing domain wall stability during ultrafast demagnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultrafast control of nanoscale spin textures such as magnetic domain walls or skyrmions is essential for advancing high-speed, high-density spintronics. However, imaging their dynamics will require a technique that combines nanometer spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution. Introducing ultrafast sub-wavelength imaging in the extreme ultraviolet, we track domain wall properties during ultrafast demagnetization in ferro- and ferrimagnetic thin films. We reveal that domain walls remain invariant in position, shape, and width, down to a demonstrated sub-nanometer precision, for up to 50% demagnetization. Stronger excitation causes stochastic nanoscale domain switching. This previously unobservable robustness of laser-excited domain walls highlights the localized nature of photoinduced demagnetization and presents both challenges and opportunities for all-optical magnetic control. The presented technique can be generalized to directly probe nanoscale dynamics in spintronic materials and devices.</description>

      <title>First-principles open quantum dynamics for solids based on density-matrix formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical description of materials' properties driven out of equilibrium has important consequences in various fields such as semiconductor spintronics, nonlinear optics, continuous and discrete quantum information science and technology. The coupling of a quantum many-body system to an external bath can dramatically modify its dynamics compared to that of closed systems, new phenomena like relaxation and decoherence appear as a consequence of the nonunitary evolution of the quantum system. In addition, electron-electron correlations must be properly accounted for in order to go beyond a simple one-electron or mean-field description of the electronic system. Here we discuss a first-principles methodology based on the evolution of the electronic density matrix capable of treating electron-environment interactions and electron-electron correlations at the same level of description. The effect of the environment is separated in a coherent contribution, like the coupling to applied external electro-magnetic fields, and an incoherent contribution, like the interaction with lattice vibrations or the thermal background of radiation. Electron-electron interactions are included using the nonequilibrium Green's function plus generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz. The obtained non-Markovian coupled set of equations reduce to ordinary Lindblad quantum master equation form in the Markovian limit.</description>

      <title>Lowering Insulator-to-Metal Transition Temperature of Vanadium Dioxide Thin Films via Co-Sputtering, Furnace Oxidation and Thermal Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermochromic vanadium dioxide thin films have attracted much attention recently for constructing variable-emittance coatings upon its insulator-metal phase transition for dynamic thermal control. However, fabrication of high-quality vanadium dioxide thin films in a cost-effective way is still a challenge. In addition, the phase transition temperature of vanadium dioxide is around 68{\deg}C, which is higher than most of terrestrial and extraterrestrial applications. In this study, we report the fabrication and characterization of tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide thin films with lowered phase transition temperatures via co-sputtering, furnace oxidation and thermal annealing processes for wider application needs. The doping is achieved by co-sputtering of tungsten and vanadium targets while the doping level is varied by carefully controlling the sputtering power for tungsten. Doped thin film samples of 30-nm thick with different tungsten atomic concentrations are prepared by co-sputtering onto undoped silicon wafers. Optimal oxidation time of 4 hours is determined to reach full oxidation in an oxygen-rich furnace environment at 300{\deg}C. Systematic thermal annealing study is carried out to find the optimal annealing temperature and time. By using an optical cryostat coupled to an infrared spectrometer, the temperature-dependent infrared transmittance of fully annealed tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide thin films are measured in a wide temperature range from -60{\deg}C to 100{\deg}C. The phase transition temperature is found to decrease at 24.5{\deg}C per at.% of tungsten doping, and the thermal hysteresis between heating and cooling shrinks at 5.5{\deg}C per at.% from the fabricated vanadium dioxide thin films with tungsten doping up to 4.1 at.%.</description>

      <title>Why Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ has higher Curie temperature than Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ having higher Curie temperature ($T_C$) than Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ is explored theoretically in the framework of magnetic exchange interactions. Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ are isostructural, with Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ having one less valence electron and smaller nearest-neighbor exchange coefficients ($J_1$ and $J_2$), challenging the conventional notion that larger $J_1$ or $J_2$ leads to a higher $T_C$. We show that higher order exchange coefficients, $J_3$ or higher, of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ are positive whereas those of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ are negative. As a consequence, total sum of all possible exchange coefficients in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ are larger than Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, which accounts for higher $T_C$. To validate these findings, $T_C$ are computed using both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulation. Indeed, higher-order exchange interactions, when properly accounting for the number of neighbors, confirm the higher $T_C$ of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Tunable topological phase in 2D ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the vanadium-based 2D kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, a ferromagnetic material with a magnetic moment of 0.86 $\mu_B$ per atom. Using ab initio methods, we explore spin-orbit coupling-induced gapped states and identify multiple Weyl-like crossings around the Fermi energy, confirming a Chern number $|C| = 1$ and a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of 257 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$. Our calculations reveal a transition from a topological semimetal to a trivial metallic phase at an electric field strength of $\approx$0.40 eV/{\AA}. These findings position 2D ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ as a promising candidate for applications in modern electronic devices, with its tunable topological phases offering the potential for future innovations in quantum computing and material design.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Assisted Radiative Lifetimes and Exciton Dynamics from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-phonon interactions play a fundamental role in phonon-assisted radiative recombination and exciton dynamics in solids. In this work, we present a first-principles framework for computing phonon-assisted radiative lifetimes and exciton dynamics at finite temperatures. Starting from the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we construct an effective excitonic Hamiltonian that incorporates both exciton-photon and exciton-phonon interactions. Phonon-assisted radiative lifetimes in anisotropic media are evaluated using time-dependent second-order perturbation theory. We further analyze the temperature and phonon-mode dependence of phonon-assisted radiative lifetime and compare our results with available experimental data. We explain the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the phonon-assisted radiative lifetime by different mechanisms at low and high-temperature regimes. Finally, we perform real-time exciton relaxation at the diagonal approximation of Lindbladian dynamics for time-resolved exciton occupation, providing insights into ultrafast thermalization and scattering pathways. Our ab-initio theory offers a detailed microscopic understanding of phonon-mediated exciton relaxation and recombination processes, and provides in-depth perspectives on phonon-assisted many-body interactions and their influence on optical properties for light-emitting and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>DFT Investigations of Major Defects in Quartz Crystal: Implications for Luminescence and ESR Dosimetry and Dating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quartz is extensively used for luminescence and ESR dosimetry as well as dating. These techniques use inherent defects introduced in quartz crystal during its crystallization in nature. The defect comprises both intrinsic as well as extrinsic defects. These defects give important luminescence properties to quartz but are not yet well understood from a theoretical perspective. Specifically, in case of luminescence dosimetry the nature of traps and their involvement in luminescence production is not exactly known. Thus, present work attempts to understand the basic physics of defects and their implication for luminescence and ESR techniques via Density Functional Theory (DFT) modelling. The work uses DFT to model the presence of some possible major impurities in quartz. Several interesting novel results are obtained that will have implications for ongoing research in Luminescence and ESR methods. The DFT modelling suggested that Oxygen deficiency in quartz crystal results in the formation of both electron and hole trapping centres. However, it is observed that these centres can be passivated by the introduction of charge compensating OH or H ions. Further, it is found that peroxy defects can be formed in the presence of either excess Oxygen or due to the absence of Silicon (Si4+), however, the nature of the traps formed in both cases is different. Besides these intrinsic defects, Al and Fe are the major impurities which are observed as defects in quartz. The modelling of these impurities suggested that negligible change in DOS is observed for Al defect and Fe generally forms a recombination centre or hole trap. In addition to these, there are several interesting first-time observations that are not reported and will be helpful for progressing luminescence and ESR dosimetry research.</description>

      <title>Chalcogen Vacancies Rule Charge Recombination in Pnictogen Chalcohalide Solar-Cell Absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pnictogen chalcohalides (MChX, M = Bi, Sb; Ch = S, Se; X = I, Br) represent an emerging class of nontoxic photovoltaic absorbers, valued for their favorable synthesis conditions and excellent optoelectronic properties. Despite their proposed defect tolerance, stemming from the antibonding nature of their valence and conduction bands, their experimentally reported power conversion efficiencies remain below 10%, far from the ideal Shockley-Queisser limit of 30%. Using advanced first-principles calculations and defect sampling techniques, we uncover a complex point-defect landscape in MChX materials, exemplified by BiSeI. Previously overlooked selenium vacancies are identified as critical nonradiative charge-recombination centers, which exist in high concentrations and, although exhibit modest capture coefficients, can reduce the maximum power conversion efficiency of BiSeI down to 24%. We argue that such detrimental effects can be mitigated by cation-poor synthesis conditions and strategic anion substitutions. Building on these insights, and supported by further simulations, we predict BiSBr to be a more defect-tolerant light absorber. This study not only identifies efficiency-limiting factors in MChX but also provides a roadmap for their improvement, paving the way for next-generation solution-processed chalcogenide photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topological corner states and edge states in grid-like frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum grid-like frames composed of rigidly jointed beams, wherein bending is the predominant deformation mode, are classic subjects of study in the field of structural mechanics. However, their topological dynamical properties have only recently been revealed. As the structural complexity of the frame increases along with the number of beam members arranged in the two-dimensional plane, the vibration modes also increase significantly in number, with frequency ranges of topological states and bulk states overlapped, leading to hybrid mode shapes. Therefore, concise theoretical results are necessary to guide the identification of topological modes in such planar continuum systems with complex spectra. In this work, within an infinitely long frequency spectrum, we obtain analytical expressions for the frequencies of higher-order topological corner states, edge states, and bulk states in kagome frames and square frames, as well as the criteria of existence of these topological states and patterns of their distribution in the spectrum. Additionally, we present the frequency expressions and the existence criterion for topological edge states in quasi-one-dimensional structures such as bridge-like frames, along with an approach to determine the existence of topological edge states based on bulk topological invariants. These theoretical results fully demonstrate that the grid-like frames, despite being a large class of continuum systems with complex spectra, have topological states (including higher-order topological states) that can be accurately characterized through concise analytical expressions. This work contributes to an excellent platform for the study of topological mechanics, and the accurate and concise theoretical results facilitate direct applications of topological grid-like frame structures in industry and engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral dependence of the Bragg peak position under conditions of extremely asymmetric diffraction has been analyzed in the kinematical and dynamical approximations of the diffraction theory. Simulations have been performed for the L$_3$ absorption edge of yttrium in a single crystal YFe$_2$ film; they have shown that the magneto optical constants (or, equivalently, the dispersion corrections to the atomic scatter ing factor) for hard X rays can be determined from this dependence. Comparison with the experimental data obtained for a Nb(4 nm)/YFe$_2$(40 nm $\langle 110 \rangle$)/Fe(1.5 nm)/Nb(50 nm)/sapphire sample at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility has been made.</description>

      <title>The structural effects of (111) growth of La$_2$CoMnO$_6$ on SrTiO$_3$ and LSAT -- new insights from 3D crystallographic characterisation with 4D-STEM and Digital Dark Field imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3-dimensional orientation of La atom modulations has been mapped in two thin films of La$_2$CoMnO$_6$ grown on SrTiO$_3$ and LSAT ([La,Sr,Al,Ta] oxide) using a 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) method based on the recently developed Digital Dark Field method. This images the shifts of diffraction spots and the azimuthal intensity distribution in the First Order Laue Zone, and then uses them to reconstruct and map the 3D crystallography. This clearly shows a flip from out-of-plane modulation with tensile strain on SrTiO3 to in-plane modulation with compressive strain on LSAT. This hitherto unobserved crystallographic change had a significant influence on the out-of-plane lattice parameter which left more room for the full incorporation of the larger CoO6 octahedra on LSAT and therefore explained the improved Mn-Co ordering and better properties for this film. Moreover, the method would be applicable to many other systems of epitaxial growth of complex oxides, revealing crystallographic details of crucial importance to properties which are not visible in conventional atomic resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>How ferromagnetic plane drives magnetocrystalline anisotropy in antiferromagnetic CoO and FeO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we present a theoretical investigation of the role that ferromagnetic plane (111) plays in the formation of magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) effects in CoO and FeO monoxides. For this purpose, a first-principles calculations of the electronic structure is performed within the GGA$+U$ approach. Based on the low-energy model in the Wannier functions basis, the MCA energy angular profile and the isotropic exchange environment of the transition metal atom are estimated using $\bf{k}$-dependent Green's functions. We have revealed a clear regularity in the direction of the easy and hard axes in both systems as lying in the (111) plane or along [111]. While for CoO the easy / hard axis orientation is (111) / [111], for FeO it appears reversed and thus emphasises the fundamental importance of (111) as the geometrical driver of the magnetism in the crystals. The identification of the contributions that individual sublattices make to the MCA energy allowed us to reveal the decisive role of the electron hopping mechanisms in easy axis orientation. Considering the MCA and exchange environment with orbital decomposition in CoO and FeO under directional pressure in the (111) plane and along [111] showed a direct interrelation between the ferro- and antiferromagnetic contributions to the exchange environment and the energetic stability of the easy axis.</description>

Abstract: Identification of charge carrier separation processes in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells and recombination at buried interfaces of charge selective contacts is crucial for photovoltaic research. Here, intensity- and wavelength- dependent transient surface photovoltage (tr-SPV) is used to investigate slot-die-coated perovskite top layers deposited on n-type Heterojunction Silicon bottom cells. We show that using an appropriate combination of photon energy and/or bottom cell polarity, one can individually probe the buried interfaces of the bottom silicon cell or the perovskite`s buried interfaces of a tandem solar cell: For excitation with higher energy photons, time delays before the onset of a strong SPV signal indicate significant hole minority drift before separation in the silicon bottom cells. Furthermore, symmetric bottom Si heterojunction solar cell stacks can serve to investigate the top perovskite stack including its junction to the bottom cell, unhampered by photovoltages from the silicon substrate. Thus, investigation of the buried interfaces in tandem devices using time-resolved surface photovoltage is found to yield valuable information on charge carrier extraction at buried interfaces and demonstrates its unique potential compared to more conventional approaches that rely on photoluminescence decay kinetics.</description>

Abstract: Metal halide perovskite solar cells have achieved dramatic improvements in their power conversion efficiency in the recent past. Since compositional engineering plays an important role in optimizing material properties, we investigate the effect of alloying at Cs and Pb sites on the energetics and electronic structure of CsPbI$_{3}$ using cluster expansion method in combination with first-principles calculations. For Ge-mixing at Pb-site, the $\alpha$ and $\beta$-phases are considered with emphasis on the electronic structure, transition probability, absorption coefficient, efficiency, and carrier mobility of higher-symmetry configurations. CsPb$_{0.50}$Ge$_{0.50}$I$_{3}$ (Cs$_{2}$PbGeI$_{6}$) which takes up a double perovskite (elpasolite) structure has a direct band gap with no parity-forbidden transitions. Further, we utilize the alloy entropic effect to improve the material stability and optoelectronic properties of CsPbI$_{3}$ by multi-element mixing. For the proposed mixed compositions, the Fr{\"o}hlich electron-phonon coupling constant is determined. Scattering rates and electron mobility are obtained from first-principles inputs. These lower Pb-content inorganic perovskites offer great promise as efficient solar cell materials for photovoltaic applications.</description>

      <title>Orientation- and pressure-dependence of the vibrational response of a monolayer crystal on a vicinal diamond surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate polarization-dependent Raman spectra of a monolayer crystal of WS2 on the (100) and (230) surfaces of diamond. At ambient pressure, identical polarization dependence of the Raman spectra is observed on the different surfaces, independent of the orientation of the monolayer crystal relative to the diamond crystal. However, when monolayer WS2 is compressed to about 4 GPa, an abrupt drop of the intensity of the 2LA mode relative to the A' mode occurs on the (100) surface and the (230) surface with the zigzag direction along the atomic step edges of the (230) surface. In contrast, no such drop is observed when the armchair direction is along or at 15{\deg} to the atomic steps of the (230) surface. We also observe a shift of the polarization angle of the intensity maxima of the 2LA and A' modes on (230) surface during compression. These results demonstrate that the atomic steps of a vicinal surface strongly modify the vibrational response under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Valley Polarization and Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in Altermagnet Ti2Se2S with Multipiezo Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, altermagnets demonstrate numerous newfangle physical phenomena due to their inherent antiferromagnetic coupling and spontaneous spin splitting, that are anticipated to enable innovative spintronic devices. However, the rare two-dimensional altermagnets have been reported, making it difficult to meet the requirements for high-performance spintronic devices on account of the growth big data. Here, we predict a stable monolayer Ti2Se2S with out-of-plane altermagnetic ground state and giant valley splitting. The electronic properties of altermagnet Ti2Se2S are highly dependent on the onsite electron correlation. Through symmetry analysis, we find that the valleys of X and Y points are protected by the mirror Mxy symmetry rather than the time-reversal symmetry. Therefore, the multipiezo effect, including piezovalley and piezomagnetism, can be induced by the uniaxial strain. The total valley splitting of monolayer Ti2Se2S can be as high as ~500 meV. Most interestingly, the direction of valley polarization can be effectively tuned by the uniaxial strain, based on this, we have defined logical "0", "+1", and "-1" states for data transmission and storage. In addition, we have designed a schematic diagram for observing the anomalous Hall effect in experimentally. Our findings have enriched the candidate materials of two-dimensional altermagnet for the ultra-fast and low power consumption device applications.</description>

      <title>Computational search for materials having a giant anomalous Hall effect in the pyrochlore and spinel crystal structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic pyrochlore and spinel materials with topological flat bands are of interest for their potential to exhibit a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE). In this work, we present computational predictions of stability and electronic structure for 448 compositions within the pyrochlore (A2B2O7) and spinel (AB2O4) frameworks. Of these, 92 are predicted to be thermodynamically stable or close (&lt; 100 meV/atom) to the convex hull, with trends deviating from expectations based on ionic radius-ratio rules. Among these 92 materials, 13 are predicted to adopt a ferromagnetic ground state at 0 K. Two additional materials meeting these criteria were also identified from open materials databases. Calculations of anomalous Hall angles (AHA) and conductivities reveal that 11 out of these 15 materials are promising candidates for spintronic applications requiring high electronic conductivity and a giant AHE. Our results suggest that the AHA can be further enhanced by tuning the Fermi level, for example through chemical doping. Using this approach, we identify five materials whose AHA may exceed 0.2. Notably, In2Ir2O7 exhibits an exceptionally high AHA of 0.728 when its Fermi level is optimized. These findings provide a roadmap for the targeted synthesis of new pyrochlore and spinel compounds with enhanced AHE properties. They also broaden the compositional design space for these structures and support the discovery of high-performance materials for next-generation spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Piezomagnetism in Noncollinear Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 3d-electron magnetic systems, the magnetic structures that transform each other by spin rotation have very close degenerate energies due to small spin-orbit coupling and can be easily controlled by chemical substitution and external magnetic fields. We investigate anisotropic piezomagnetic effects, exhibiting the different magnetic responses depending on the type of strain and the magnetic structures, for non-collinear magnetic states in Mn$_3A$N ($A=$ Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga) and Mn$_3X$ ($X$= Sn and Ge) based on detailed symmetry analysis using spin group and magnetic group and first-principles calculations of piezomagnetic responses. In Mn$_3A$N, magnetization develops along two distinct directions under the same applied stress, corresponding to two AFM states connected by spin rotation. Analysis of the piezomagnetic tensor based on magnetic and spin point groups for the states with and without spin-orbit coupling, respectively, shows that the difference in the magnitude of magnetization along different directions is attributed to the spin-orbit coupling. Mn$_3X$ are known to stabilize different AFM structures in the directions of the applied in-plane magnetic fields. Under uniaxial stress along the orthorhombic $x$ and $y$ axes, magnetization is induced without breaking the magnetic symmetry, but it develops in the opposite direction due to exchange interaction. Our study demonstrates that the direction and sign of strain-induced magnetization in Mn$_3A$N and Mn$_3X$ can be effectively controlled by strain in combination with magnetic fields. These findings highlight the potential for strain-tunable magnetic devices in noncollinear AFMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformations in bcc-$\beta$, hcp-$\alpha$, and the $\omega$ phases of Ti alloys are studied using Density Functional Theory for pure Ti and Ti alloyed with Al, Si, V, Cr, Fe, Cu, Nb, Mo, and Sn. The $\beta$-stabilization caused by alloying Si, Fe, Cr, and Mo was observed, but the most stable phase appears between the $\beta$ and the $\alpha$ phases, corresponding to the martensitic $\alpha''$ phase. Next, the $\{112\}\langle11\bar1\rangle$ bcc twins are separated by a positive barrier, which further increases by alloying w.r.t. pure Ti. The $\{332\}\langle11\bar3\rangle$ twinning yields negative barriers for all species but Mo and Fe. This is because the transition state is structurally similar to the $\alpha$ phase, which is preferred over the $\beta$ phase for the majority of alloying elements. Lastly, the impact of alloying on twin boundary energies is discussed. These results may serve as design guidelines for novel Ti-based alloys with specific application areas.</description>

      <title>Interface phonon modes governing the ideal limit of thermal transport across diamond/cubic boron nitride interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the ideal limit of interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) across semiconductor heterointerfaces is crucial for optimizing heat dissipation in practical applications. By employing a highly accurate and efficient machine-learned potential trained herein, we perform extensive non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the ITC of diamond/cubic boron nitride ($c$BN) interfaces. The ideal diamond/$c$BN interface exhibits an unprecedented ITC of 11.0 $\pm$ 0.1 GW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, setting a new upper bound for heterostructure interfaces. This exceptional conductance originates from extended phonon modes due to acoustic matching and localized C-atom modes that propagate through B-C bonds. However, atomic diffusion across the ideal interface creates mixing layers that disrupt these characteristic phonon modes, substantially suppressing the thermal transport from its ideal limit. Our findings reveal how interface phonon modes govern thermal transport across diamond/$c$BN interfaces, providing insights for thermal management in semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy of materials under high pressure in a diamond anvil cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the combination of a broadband terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system (0.1 - 8 THz), a diamond anvil cell capable of generating high pressure conditions of up to 10 GPa and a cryostat reaching temperatures as low as 10 K. This combination allows us to perform equilibrium and time-resolved THz spectroscopy measurements of a sample while continuously tuning its temperature and pressure conditions. In this work, the procedures and characterizations necessary to carry out such experiments in a tabletop setup are presented. Due to the large modifications of the terahertz beam as it goes through the diamond anvil cell (DAC), standard terahertz time-domain spectroscopy analysis procedures are no longer applicable. New methods to extract the pressure dependent material parameters are presented, both for samples homogeneously filling the DAC sample chamber as well as for bulk samples embedded in pressure media. Different pressure media are tested and evaluated using these new methods, and the obtained material parameters are compared to literature values. Time resolved measurements under pressure are demonstrated using an optical pump - THz probe scheme.</description>

      <title>Electric-field independent spin-orbit coupling gap in hBN-encapsulated bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in bilayer graphene (BLG) is essential for encoding spin qubits while bringing technical challenges for extracting the opened small SOC gap {\Delta}_SO in experiments. Moreover, in addition to the intrinsic Kane-Mele term, extrinsic mechanisms also contribute to SOC in BLG, especially under experimental conditions including encapsulation of BLG with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and applying an external out-of-plane electric displacement field D. Although measurements of {\Delta}_SO in hBN-encapsulated BLG have been reported, the relatively large experimental variations and existing experimental controversy make it difficult to fully understand the physical origin of {\Delta}_SO. Here, we report a combined experimental and theoretical study on {\Delta}_SO in hBN-encapsulated BLG. We use an averaging method to extract {\Delta}_SO in gate-defined single quantum dot devices. Under D fields as large as 0.57-0.90 V/nm, {\Delta}_SO=53.4-61.8 {\mu}eV is obtained from two devices. Benchmarked with values reported at lower D field regime, our results support a D field-independent {\Delta}_SO. This behavior is confirmed by our first-principle calculations, based on which {\Delta}_SO is found to be independent of D field, regardless of different hBN/BLG/hBN stacking configurations. Our calculations also suggest a weak proximity effect from hBN, indicating that SOC in hBN-encapsulated BLG is dominated by the intrinsic Kane-Mele mechanism. Our results offer insightful understandings of SOC in BLG, which benefit SOC engineering and spin manipulations in BLG.</description>

      <title>Spin decoherence in molecular crystals: nuclear v.s. electronic spin baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The loss of information about the relative phase between two quantum states, known as decoherence, strongly limits resolution in electron paramagnetic spectroscopy and hampers the use of molecules for quantum information processing. At low temperatures, the decoherence of an electronic molecular spin can be driven by its interaction with either other electron spins or nuclear spins. Many experimental techniques have been used to prolong the coherence time of molecular qubits, but these efforts have been hampered by the uncertainty about which of the two mechanisms is effectively limiting coherence in different experimental conditions. Here, we use the Cluster-Correlation Expansion (CCE) to simulate the decoherence of two prototypical molecular qubits and quantitatively demonstrate that nuclear spins become the leading source of decoherence only when the electron spin concentration is below 1 mM. Moreover, we show that deuterated samples, much easier to achieve than fully spin-free environments, could achieve record coherence times of 0.1 ms for an electron spin concentration of 0.1 mM. Alternatively, hydrogen-rich molecular crystals with electron spins concentration below 1 mM can still achieve coherence times of 10 ms through dynamical decoupling, showing that the potential of molecular spins for quantum technologies is still untapped.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnetic RGaGe (R = Nd, Gd) single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetallic candidate family RTX (R = rare-earth element, T= poor metal, X = Si and Ge) has recently attracted significant attention due to its exotic quantum states and potential applications in quantum devices. In this study, our comprehensive investigations of high-quality NdGaGe and GdGaGe single crystals reveal distinct magnetic and electrical responses. Both compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic transitions with TN - 7.6 K and 22.4 K for NdGaGe and GdGaGe, respectively. NdGaGe exhibits strong magnetic anisotropy (\c{hi}c /\c{hi}a - 70). In contrast, GdGaGe displays weak magnetic anisotropic behavior (\c{hi}c /\c{hi}a - 1) with a distinctive spin-flop transition. Below TN, NdGaGe shows significant negative magnetoresistance due to the reduced spin-disorder scattering arising from the field-induced spin alignment. GdGaGe exhibits more complex magnetoresistance behavior: positive values at low fields transitioning to negative values attributed to the reduced spin-flop scattering. Specially, NdGaGe demonstrates a large anomalous Hall conductance (AHC) of approximately 368 {\Omega}-1 cm-1, which is dominated by the intrinsic mechanism. These reveal the pivotal role of rare-earth elements in modulating the electronic structure, magnetic properties, and transport characteristics of the RGaGe system, thereby providing valuable insights for developing next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Amending CALPHAD databases using a neural network for predicting mixing enthalpy of liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18366v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to establish the thermodynamic stability of a system, knowledge of its Gibbs free energy is essential. Most often, the Gibbs free energy is predicted within the CALPHAD framework using models employing thermodynamic properties, such as the mixing enthalpy, heat capacity, and activity coefficients. Here, we present a deep-learning approach capable of predicting the mixing enthalpy of liquid phases of binary systems that were not present in the training dataset. Therefore, our model allows for a system-informed enhancement of the thermodynamic description to unknown binary systems based on information present in the available thermodynamic assessment. Thereby, significant experimental efforts in assessing new systems can be spared. We use an open database for steels containing 91 binary systems to generate our initial training (and validation) and amend it with several direct experimental reports. The model is thoroughly tested using different strategies, including a test of its predictive capabilities. The model shows excellent predictive capabilities outside of the training dataset as soon as some data containing species of the predicted system is included in the training dataset. The estimated uncertainty of the model is below 1 kJ/mol for the predicted mixing enthalpy. Subsequently, we used our model to predict the enthalpy of mixing of all binary systems not present in the original database and extracted the Redlich-Kister parameters, which can be readily reintegrated into the thermodynamic database file.</description>

      <title>Tailoring hBN's Phonon Polaritons with the Plasmonic Phase-Change Material In3SbTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18418v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polaritons in van-der-Waals materials (vdWM) promise high confinement and multiple tailoring options by optical structures, e.g., resonators, launching structures and lenses. These optical structures are conventionally fabricated using cumbersome multi-process lithography techniques. In contrast, phase-change materials (PCMs) offer fast and reconfigurable programming of optical structures. PCMs can reversibly be switched between two stable phases with distinct permittivities by local heating, e.g., by optical laser pulses. While the well-known dielectric PCM GeSbTe-alloys feature only a permittivity change, the PCM In3SbTe2 can be switched between a dielectric and metallic phase. This makes In3SbTe2 promising for programming metallic launching structures. Here, we demonstrate direct optical programming and thereby rapid prototyping of optical launching structures in In3SbTe2 to tailor and confine polaritons in vdWM. We combine the vdWM hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with In3SbTe2 and optically program circular resonators for hBN's phonon polaritons through hBN into In3SbTe2. We investigate the polariton resonators with near-field optical microscopy. Demonstrating the reconfigurability, we decrease the resonator diameter to increase the polariton confinement. Finally, we fabricate focusing structures for hBN's phonon polaritons whose focal point is changed in a second post-processing step. We promote In3SbTe2 as a versatile platform for rapid prototyping of polariton optics in vdWM.</description>

      <title>Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.</description>

      <title>Automating Nanoindentation: Optimizing Workflows for Precision and Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoindentation is vital for probing mechanical properties, yet traditional grid-based workflows are inefficient for targeting specific microstructural features. We present an automated nanoindentation framework that integrates machine learning, real-time alignment, and adaptive indentation strategies. The system operates in three modes: standard automation, feature-based indentation via image-to-coordinate mapping, and large-scale indentation with full x, y, and z axis alignment. A key challenge (precise sample positioning across imaging and indentation stages) was met by correcting initial travel-distance errors (2.5-6 micrometres) through pixel-to-micron calibration, reducing alignment errors to the submicron level. Benchmark tests demonstrate phase-specific and orientation-guided indentation enabled by self-organising maps and macro imaging. The framework markedly improves precision, minimises user intervention, and enables efficient, targeted characterisation of complex materials. By providing a direct interface between nanoindentation instruments and Python-based automation frameworks, it can be adopted on most existing platforms. This work lays the foundation for next-generation autonomous mechanical testing tailored to microstructurally complex materials.</description>

Abstract: The transition to smart wearable and flexible optoelectronic devices communicating with each other and performing neuromorphic computing at the edge is a big goal in next-generation optoelectronics. These devices should perform their regular tasks supported by energy-efficient in-memory calculations. Here, we study the response of the CsPbBr$_3$ halide-perovskite single crystal fabricated on the flexible polymer substrate and integrated with the single-walled carbon nanotube thin film electrodes in a lateral geometry. We show both photodetection functions combined with the synaptic functionality in our device under the application of hybrid optoelectrical stimuli. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our device exhibits frequency-dependent bidirectional modification of synaptic weight with a sliding threshold similar to biologically plausible Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro learning. The demonstrated optoelectronic synaptic behavior in halide-perovskite single-crystals opens the opportunity for the development of hybrid organic-inorganic artificial visual systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptation of Wallace's Approach to the Specific Heat of Elemental Solids with Significant Intrinsic Anharmonicity, Particularly the Light Actinide Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasiharmonic approximation is the most common method for modeling the specific heat of solids; however, it fails to capture the effects of intrinsic anharmonicity. In this study, we introduce the "elastic softening approximation," an alternative approach to modeling intrinsic anharmonic effects on thermodynamic quantities, which is grounded in Wallace's thermodynamic framework that tracks entropy changes resulting from the continuous change (e.g., softening) of phonons as a function of temperature. A key finding of our study is a direct correlation between Poisson's ratio and the differential rate of phonon softening at finite frequencies, compared to lower frequencies relevant to elastic moduli measurements. We observe that elemental solids such as $\alpha$-Be, diamond, Al, Cu, In, W, Au, and Pb, which span a wide range of Poisson's ratios and exhibit varying degrees of intrinsic anharmonicity, consistently follow this trend. When applied to $\alpha$-U, $\alpha$-Pu, and $\delta$-Pu, our method reveals unusually large anharmonic phonon contributions at elevated temperatures across all three light actinide metals. These findings are attributed to the unique combination of enhanced covalency and softer elastic moduli inherent in the actinides, potentially influenced by their 5f-electron bonding.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Theory of Proximity Ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where the multilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression" where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of dielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozen ferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated electric field (E-field) induced modulation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in both amorphous and crystalline W/CoFeB/MgO/HfO2 ultra-thin films. We find that in the amorphous state, the E-field effect is volatile and reversible, which is consistent with the conventional electrostatic effect through charge accumulation and depletion. In the crystallized system annealed at 370{\deg}C, we find that two effects are at play, a non-volatile and reversible voltage-induced effect on PMA and an electrostatic response. We discuss these results in terms of higher oxygen mobility at the crystallized CoFeB-MgO interface, which induces a non-volatile magnetoionic response. Modulating PMA in crystallized CoFeB-MgO materials through ionic migration opens the path to integrating magneto-ionics in full magnetic tunnel junctions.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics in itinerant antiferromagnet SrCr$_2$As$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SrCr$_2$As$_2$ is an itinerant antiferromagnet in the same structural family as the SrFe$_2$As$_2$ high-temperature superconductors. We report our calculations of exchange-coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ for SrCr$_2$As$_2$ using a static linear-response method based on first-principles electronic-structure calculations. We find that the dominant nearest-neighbor exchange coupling $J_{\rm{1}} &gt; 0$ is antiferromagnetic whereas the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_{\rm{2}} &lt; 0$ is ferromagnetic with $J_{\rm{2}}$/$J_{\rm{1}}$~=~$-0.68$, reinforcing the checkerboard in-plane magnetic structure. Thus, unlike other transition-metal arsenides based on Mn, Fe, or Co, we find no competing magnetic interactions in SrCr$_2$As$_2$, which aligns with experimental findings. Moreover, the orbital resolution of exchange interactions shows that $J_1$ and $J_2$ are dominated by direct exchange mediated by the Cr $d$ orbitals. To validate the calculations we conduct inelastic neutron-scattering measurements on powder samples that show steeply dispersive magnetic excitations arising from the magnetic $\Gamma$ points and persisting up to energies of at least 175 meV. The spin-wave spectra are then modeled using the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with the theoretically-calculated exchange couplings. The calculated neutron-scattering spectra are in good agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Universality of Dynamic and Thermodynamic Behavior of Polymers near their Glass Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing the dynamics and thermodynamics of amorphous materials near the glass transition is a major challenge in soft-matter physics and polymer engineering. Here, we show that the dependence of the dielectric alpha-relaxation time on temperature can be captured by a universal equation with only two independent parameters, Tg and fragility, m. This is similar in spirit to the ideas of van Krevelen and Bicerano, and can be related to the Boyer-Spencer and Simha-Boyer rules for the volumetric thermal expansion via a modified free-volume approach such as Sanchez-Lacombe "Two-state, two-(time)scale" (SL-TS2) theory. The model is compared to experimental data for nine amorphous polymers with varying values of Tg and m, and a good qualitative and quantitative agreement is found. We also derive the relationship between the experimental and computational (high-cooling-rate) Tg, and compare our model prediction for the Tg-shift between the two with the simulation results of Afzal et al., finding a good qualitative and semi-quantitative agreement. The results could serve as a guidance for future simulation studies.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use the localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate the behavior of a Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier assuming a current-phase relation with a second--harmonic contribution. We find that varying the weight of harmonic terms in the Josephson current affects the gain profile. The analysis of gain characteristics, phase-space portraits, Poincar\'e sections, and Fourier spectra demonstrates that the nonsinusoidal contribution influences the operating mode and stability of the device. In particular, we identify the optimal weighting of harmonic contributions that maximizes amplification, achieving gains up to $\sim 13\;\text{dB}$ in a device without dispersion engineering.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors induced by magnetic field. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experiments find that the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature at which the longitudinal thermal conductivity peaks. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions (which do not produce entropy) dominate Umklapp and boundary scattering events (which do). In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a geometric [Berry] phase. Its origin is the difference in the spatial distributions of the positive charge of the nuclei and the negative charge of the electron cloud. The magnetic flux is negligible for the point-like nuclei, but not for the electron cloud. Therefore, the molecular wave-function becomes a complex number in the presence of the magnetic field. In a crystal, this implies a complex amplitude for transverse acoustic phonons, modifying three-phonon interference patterns, and twisting the quasi-momentum of the outgoing phonon. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest displacement amplitude, $u_m$, of transverse acoustic phonons at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface.

Abstract: We report on the synthesis of single crystals of a new kagome compound, UV$_6$Sn$_6$, and present the results of magnetization, electrical resistivity, heat capacity, X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments to characterize the structure and magnetic properties. UV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystallizes in a large supercell of the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$ parent structure with an hexagonal symmetry in which some of the U atoms are shifted by $c/2$ in an ordered fashion. Below $T_{N1}\approx29$\,K, an incommensurate magnetic structure with a temperature-dependent wavevector $(0,0,k_z)$ is observed. Below $T_{N2}=23.5$\,K, the wavevector locks in to $(0,0,0.5)$ forming an antiferromagnetic ground state. The U moments align along the $c$ axis retaining a large magnetic anisotropy. These findings highlight the role of the $5f$ orbitals from uranium in this structural family in driving both magnetic ordering and structural modulation and distinguish UV$_6$Sn$_6$ from its lanthanide-based analogs.</description>

      <title>Fluctuated lattice-driven charge density wave far above the condensation temperature in kagome superconductor KV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, F$_c$, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of T$_c$ = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at F$_c$ were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at T$_c$. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near T$_c$, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>
