      <title>A complete characterization of pairs of binary phylogenetic trees with identical $A_k$-alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees play a key role in the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. Typically, they are derived from aligned sequence data (like DNA, RNA, or proteins) by using optimization criteria like, e.g., maximum parsimony (MP). It is believed that the latter is able to reconstruct the \enquote{true} tree, i.e., the tree that generated the data, whenever the number of substitutions required to explain the data with that tree is relatively small compared to the size of the tree (measured in the number $n$ of leaves of the tree, which represent the species under investigation). However, reconstructing the correct tree from any alignment first and foremost requires the given alignment to perform differently on the \enquote{correct} tree than on others.
  A special type of alignments, namely so-called $A_k$-alignments, has gained considerable interest in recent literature. These alignments consist of all binary characters (\enquote{sites}) which require precisely $k$ substitutions on a given tree. It has been found that whenever $k$ is small enough (in comparison to $n$), $A_k$-alignments uniquely characterize the trees that generated them. However, recent literature has left a significant gap between $k\leq 2k+2$ -- namely the cases in which no such characterization is possible -- and $k\geq 4k$ -- namely the cases in which this characterization works. It is the main aim of the present manuscript to close this gap, i.e., to present a full characterization of all pairs of trees that share the same $A_k$-alignment. In particular, we show that indeed every binary phylogenetic tree with $n$ leaves is uniquely defined by its $A_k$-alignments if $n\geq 2k+3$. By closing said gap, we also ensure that our result is optimal.</description>

      <title>Dwellers in the Deep: Biological Consequences of Dark Oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The striking recent putative detection of "dark oxygen" (dark O$_2$) sources on the abyssal ocean floor in the Pacific at $\sim 4$ km depth raises the intriguing scenario that complex (i.e., animal-like) life could exist in underwater environments sans oxygenic photosynthesis. In this work, we thus explore the possible (astro)biological implications of this discovery. From the available data, we roughly estimate the concentration of dissolved O$_2$ and the corresponding O$_2$ partial pressure, as well as the flux of O$_2$ production, associated with dark oxygen sources. Based on these values, we infer that organisms limited by internal diffusion may reach maximal sizes of $\sim 0.1-1$ mm in habitats with dark O$_2$, while those with circulatory systems might achieve sizes of $\sim 0.1-10$ cm. Optimistically, the estimated dark oxygen flux can potentially support biomass densities up to $\sim 3-30$ g m$^{-2}$, perhaps surpassing typical reported densities at similar depths in global deep-sea surveys. Finally, we outline how oceanic settings with dark O$_2$ may facilitate the origin(s) of life via the emergence of electrotrophy. Our findings indicate that complex life fueled by dark oxygen is plausibly capable of inhabiting submarine environments devoid of photosynthesis on Earth, conceivably extending likewise to extraterrestrial locations such as icy worlds with subsurface oceans (e.g., Enceladus and Europa), which are likely common throughout the Universe.</description>

      <title>A hybrid framework for compartmental models enabling simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-scale systems often exhibit stochastic and deterministic dynamics. Capturing these aspects in a compartmental model is challenging. Notably, low occupancy compartments exhibit stochastic dynamics and high occupancy compartments exhibit deterministic dynamics. Failing to account for stochasticity in small populations can produce 'atto-foxes', e.g. in the Lotka-Volterra ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. This limitation becomes problematic when studying extinction of species or the clearance of infection, but it can be resolved by using discrete stochastic models e.g. continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs). Unfortunately, simulating CTMCs is infeasible for most realistic populations.
  We develop a novel mathematical framework, to couple continuous ODEs and discrete CTMCs: 'Jump-Switch-Flow' (JSF). In this framework populations can reach extinct states ("absorbing states"), thereby resolving atto-fox-type problems. JSF has the desired behaviours of exact CTMC simulation, but is substantially faster than existing alternatives.
  JSF's utility for simulation-based inference, particularly multi-scale problems, is demonstrated by several case-studies. In a simulation study, we demonstrate how JSF can enable a more nuanced analysis of the efficacy of public health interventions. We also carry out a novel analysis of longitudinal within-host data from SARS-CoV-2 infections to quantify the timing of viral clearance. JSF offers a novel approach to compartmental model development and simulation.</description>
