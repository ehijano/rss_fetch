      <title>Gravitational Quasinormal Modes and Grey-Body Factors of Bonanno-Reuter Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations of the Bonanno--Reuter quantum-corrected black hole arising in the asymptotic safety scenario, focusing on QNMs and grey-body factors. Assuming the RG parameter $\tilde{\omega}$ is fixed to its phenomenologically motivated value, we treat the interpolation parameter $\gamma$ as free and investigate how it modifies the black hole's response to axial gravitational perturbations. Quasinormal frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB method with Pad\'e approximants, and their dependence on $\gamma$ and the black hole mass $M$ is analyzed. We find that the Schwarzschild limit is rapidly recovered for large $M$ or large $\gamma$, while significant deviations arise in the quantum regime. The accuracy of the WKB results is confirmed by time-domain integration of the wave equation. Comparison of grey-body factors computed via both the WKB method and the quasinormal mode correspondence are in a good concordance. Our findings indicate that quantum corrections can leave significant imprints in the ringdown and radiation spectra, while preserving consistency with classical results in the appropriate limit.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian expansion of fluxes from a scalar charge on an inclined-spherical orbit about a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts are underway to accurately model extreme-mass-ratio inspirals for binaries with a spinning (Kerr) primary. At lowest order the adiabatic evolution depends on the radiation fluxes. Fluxes and other self-force quantities can be expanded analytically in post-Newtionian (PN) series allowing the early evolutionary phase to be understood. When it comes to more complicated background geodesic orbits, it proves useful to use the scalar field model problem to guide development and testing of techniques. In this paper, we present analytical expressions for the scalar fluxes from a scalar point-charge in inclined-spherical orbit about a Kerr black hole up to 12PN relative order, with expressions that are exact in terms of the inclination parameter $x$ and black hole spin $a$. The expressions are constructed using the Mano, Suzuki, and Takasugi (MST) method of solving the scalar wave equation in a Kerr background. We compare the numerical evaluation of these flux expressions to full numerical ($s=0$) Teukolsky code results, examining their degree of utility as the strong-field region is approached.</description>

      <title>Polymer Black Hole Surrounded by Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the polymer black hole solution surrounded by a quintessence field. The influence of quintessence on the polymer black hole is investigated through its thermodynamic properties, such as the Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat, which allow us to address the question of thermodynamic stability. We then calculate bounds on the electromagnetic greybody factors and photon emission rates of the black hole, highlighting the interplay between quintessence and quantum gravity effects in determining these phenomena. We also examine the effects of quintessence and quantum gravity on the geodesics and shadows of massless particles around the black hole. Our results are further compared with observational data of the Sagittarius A black hole from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration.</description>

      <title>Implications of Rastall Theory on Stellar Solutions admitting Vanishing Complexity: A New Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the notion of complexity factor and its implication is extended to the framework of non-conserved Rastall theory of gravity. First of all, the field equations governing a static spherical geometry associated with the anisotropic fluid are formulated. The mass function corresponding to the considered geometry is defined in terms of both matter and geometric quantities. The orthogonal decomposition of the Riemann tensor is then performed through which a family of scalar quantities, known as structure scalars, is obtained. Using the Herrera's recent definition, one of the scalars among them is claimed as the complexity factor, \emph{i.e.}, $\mathcal{Y}_{TF}$. Since there are extra degrees of freedom in the gravitational equations, some constraints are needed to make their solution possible to obtain. In this regard, a well-known vanishing complexity condition is introduced along with three different constraints which ultimately lead to distinct stellar models. In order to check their physical feasibility, a detailed graphical interpretation is provided using multiple values of the Rastall parameter. It is concluded that the obtained results in all three cases are consistent with those of general relativity. Further, the Rastall theory provides more suitable results in the case of model 2, indicating its superiority over Einstein's gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Critical Phenomena in Gravitational Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As first discovered by Choptuik, the black hole threshold in the space of initial data for general relativity shows both surprising structure and surprising simplicity. Universality, power-law scaling of the black hole mass, and scale echoing have given rise to the term ``critical phenomena''. They are explained by the existence of exact solutions which are attractors within the black hole threshold, that is, attractors of codimension one in phase space, and which are typically self-similar. Critical phenomena give a natural route from smooth initial data to arbitrarily large curvatures visible from infinity, and are therefore likely to be relevant for cosmic censorship, quantum gravity, astrophysics, and our general understanding of the dynamics of general relativity. Major additions since the 2010 version of this review are numerical simulations beyond spherical symmetry, in particular of vacuum critical collapse, and new sections on mathematical results in PDE blowup (as a toy model for singularity formation) and on naked singularity formation in GR.</description>

      <title>Tidal effects in gravitational and scalar waveforms and fluxes to one post-Newtonian order in massless scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within scalar-tensor (ST) theories, neutron stars in binary systems experience tidal deformations caused by both their companion and the scalar field. These deformations are strongly correlated to the star's internal structure and composition. Accurately modeling their imprint on the emitted gravitational waves will be essential for interpreting the high-precision data expected from future detectors and for disentangling potential signatures of modified gravity from those arising due to the properties of neutron star matter. Using the post-Newtonian multipolar-post-Minkowskian formalism adapted to ST theories, and working within the adiabatic approximation, we compute the tidal corrections to the gravitational and scalar energy fluxes, and to the waveform phasing, at the first post-Newtonian (PN) order beyond the standard quadrupole radiation in general relativity. This corresponds to 2PN order beyond the leading-order dipolar tidal contribution. At this accuracy, three independent types of tidal deformability (scalar, tensorial, and mixed scalar-tensorial) contribute to the signal. We also derive the gravitational and scalar waveform amplitude modes, including the memory ones, to the same accuracy.</description>

      <title>Trapped string states in AdS$_5$ black hole geometry: A path toward Hawking radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a closed bosonic string in the curved spacetime of an AdS$_5$-Schwarzschild black hole. Starting from the Polyakov action, we perform a canonical quantization of the string and formulate its quantum mechanical equation of motion in the Schr\"odinger (string coordinate) representation. This framework facilitates in obtaining quantum mechanical wave equation governing the radial and angular modes of the string. A central result of our analysis is the emergence of a trapping radius in the exterior region of the black hole. Near this radius, the radial motion of the string is governed by an effective potential that supports small, quantized oscillations, akin to a quantum harmonic oscillator. This behavior indicates a localization of the string at the trapping surface, where it becomes dynamically confined. The angular sector of the wave function is found to be governed by the confluent Heun equation, yielding confluent Heun functions as the angular part of the wave function. The emergence of a trapping surface is analogous to the stretched horizon proposed by Susskind in the context of black hole complementarity. The quantized harmonic oscillation of the string at the trapping radius complements with the Planck's black body whence the string can emit black-body radiation. Thus, the quantum dynamics of strings in black hole spacetimes offers a novel path to probing the quantum origin of Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Metric reconstruction and the Hamiltonian for eccentric, precessing binaries in the small-mass-ratio limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the first-order (in the mass-ratio) metric perturbation produced by a small body on an eccentric, precessing bound orbit about a Kerr black hole. We reconstruct the metric perturbation from the maximal spin-weight Weyl scalars, $\psi_0$ and $\psi_4$, using four different methods. The first two follow the work of Chrzanowski, Cohen, Kegeles, and Wald and reconstruct the metric perturbation from either $\psi_0$ or $\psi_4$, leading to perturbations in the ingoing or outgoing radiation gauges. The other two methods build upon the work of Aksteiner, Andersson, and B{\"a}ckdahl and reconstruct the metric perturbation from both $\psi_0$ and $\psi_4$. We compare the local and asymptotic behaviors of the metric across different gauges. We also calculate the generalized redshift invariant along eccentric, precessing orbits in Kerr spacetime for the first time and make the numerical methods employed in these calculations openly available through the Python library \texttt{pybhpt}. Building off recent work by Lewis \emph{et al.}, we also relate our redshift data to the Hamiltonian of the system. Combining our numerical data with this Hamiltonian formulation provides a method for generating waveforms that include post-adiabatic conservative effects and acts as a useful bridge between results in self-force, effective-one-body, and post-Newtonian theory.</description>

      <title>Extending unified gravity to account for graviton-graviton interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a gauge theory of unified gravity [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)] has been developed to extend the Standard Model to include gravity. Here we present unified gravity using the ordinary four-vector and tensor field notation of the Standard Model. The main goal of the present work is to extend the original Minkowski spacetime formulation of the theory to account for graviton-graviton interaction. This is a necessary extension for problems involving interactions between gravitational fields, for example, in the propagation of gravitational waves in external gravitational potentials. The 4xU(1) gauge invariance of unified gravity is preserved in this extension.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Searches for Long-Transient Gravitational Waves from Newborn Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method to efficiently search for long-duration gravitational wave transients emitted by new-born neutron star remnants of binary neutron star coalescences or supernovae. The detection of these long-transient gravitational waves would contribute to the understanding of the properties of neutron stars and fundamental physics. Additionally, studying gravitational waves emitted by neutron stars can provide valuable tests of general relativity and offer insights into the neutron star population, of which only a small fraction appears to be observable through current electromagnetic telescopes. Our approach uses GPUs and the JAX library in Python, resulting in significantly faster processing compared to previous methods. The efficiency of this code enables wide regions of the sky to be covered, eliminating the need for precise pinpointing of mergers or supernovae. This method will be deployed in searches for long-transient gravitational waves following any detection of a binary neutron star system merger in the latest O4 science run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, which started in May 2023 with a significant improvement in sensitivity with respect to previous runs.</description>

      <title>From spatial to null infinity: Connecting initial data to peeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic structure of space-time is studied by imposing conditions on the asymptotics of the metric. These conditions are weak enough to include large classes of physically relevant isolated space-times, but have a rich enough structure to be able to define important physically meaningful quantities like mass, angular momentum, and gravitational waves.
  By using a unified expansion of the metric in a neighborhood of spatial infinity that includes a piece of null infinity, we connect the asymptotic expansions of solutions to Einstein's equations in the different asymptotic regimes. Within the class of space-times under consideration, we find a connection between the peeling properties of the Weyl scalars and symmetries of initial data near spatial infinity. In particular, we show that for initial data that to leading order is symmetric under parity + time reversal, $\Psi_2$ has the usual $1/r^3$ fall-off rate at null infinity. If, in addition, the subleading part of the data is antisymmetric under parity + time reversal, then $\Psi_1$ has the usual $1/r^4$ fall-off rate at future null infinity.</description>

      <title>Null Distance and Temporal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of null distance was introduced by Sormani and Vega as part of a broader program to develop a theory of metric convergence adapted to Lorentzian geometry. Given a time function $\tau$ on a spacetime $(M,g)$, the associated null distance $\hat{d}_\tau$ is constructed from and closely related to the causal structure of $M$. While generally only a semi-metric, $\hat{d}_\tau$ becomes a metric when $\tau$ satisfies the local anti-Lipschitz condition.
  In this work, we focus on temporal functions, that is, differentiable functions whose gradient is everywhere past-directed timelike. Sormani and Vega showed that the class of $C^1$ temporal functions coincides with that of $C^1$ locally anti-Lipschitz time functions. When a temporal function $f$ is smooth, its level sets $M_t = f^{-1}(t)$ are spacelike hypersurfaces and thus Riemannian manifolds endowed with the induced metric $h_t$. Our main result establishes that, on any level set $M_t$ where the gradient $\nabla f$ has constant norm, the null distance $\hat{d}_f$ is bounded above by a constant multiple of the Riemannian distance $d_{h_t}$.
  Applying this result to a smooth regular cosmological time function $\tau_g$ -- as introduced by Andersson, Galloway, and Howard -- we prove a theorem confirming a conjecture of Sakovich and Sormani (arXiv:2410.16800, 2025): if the diameters of the level sets $M_t = \tau_g^{-1}(t)$ shrink to zero as $t \to 0$, then the spacetime exhibits a Big Bang singularity, as defined in their work.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots from Small-Scale Primordial Black Hole Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have identified a class of compact galaxies at high redshifts ($4 \lesssim z \lesssim 11$), dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs). The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of $10^{5-8}{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ in LRDs favor a heavy-seed origin. We propose a mechanism for their formation: Clusters of primordial black holes, formed through long-short mode coupling on small scales in the early Universe, undergo sequential mergers over extended timescales. This mechanism can evade cosmic microwave background distortions and result in heavy-seed SMBHs via runaway mergers. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave background offers a distinct signature of this process, and the forming SMBHs can be highly spinning at their formation due to the spin residual of the cluster from tidal fields. This mechanism may explain the rapidly spinning SMBHs in LRDs under the assumption of obscured active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Extended JT supergravity and random matrix models: The power of the string equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of supersymmetric Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity theories are known to be described (in the Euclidean path integral formulation) by double-scaled random matrix models. Such matrix models can be characterized using a certain ``string equation''. It was shown recently that in extended supergravity, when the number of BPS states scales as ${\rm e}^{S_0}$, where $S_0$ is the extremal entropy, a special ansatz for the leading order solution of the string equation yields the supergravity spectrum. Somewhat miraculously, the construction showed that the functional form of the non-BPS (continuum) sector predicts the precise form of the BPS sector, showing the robustness of the supergravity/matrix-model correspondence. In this paper, we refine the analysis and show that the string equation, combined with some simple requirements on solutions, are powerful tools for constraining the spectrum of extended JT supergravity theories. We re-explore the cases of ${N}{=}2$ and (small) ${N}{=}4$ JT supergravity, and then explore the new cases of spectra from ${N}{=}3$ and large ${N}{=}4$ JT supergravity (recently derived by Heydeman, Shi, and Turiaci) showing that our approach also works naturally for (nearly) all the models. Based on this success, we conjecture that these new supergravity models also have matrix model descriptions.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Dark Energy in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favor a scenario in which dark energy (DE) decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state (EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w &lt; - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w &gt; - 1$ at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$. Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In this work, we investigate a class of thawing scalar field models propagating on a (4+1)-dimensional phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the Om diagnostic, and demonstrate that the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$ values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.</description>

      <title>Correlators from Amplitubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the wavefunction coefficients for conformally coupled scalars in an FRW cosmology have been presented as a sum over amplitude-like functions known as {\it amplitubes}. In this work we extend this analysis to full {\it correlation functions}. Remarkably, the amplitube expansion of the correlator exhibits many vanishing contributions that are otherwise present in the expansion of the wavefunction. Moreover, while the wavefunction coefficients suffer from relative minus signs between terms, the surviving terms in correlation function do not. These observations point to a hidden simplicity in the structure of the correlation function compared to that of the wavefunction coefficient.</description>

      <title>Investigating non-Keplerian motion in flare events with astrometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GRAVITY interferometer has achieved microarcsecond precision in near-infrared interferometry, enabling tracking of flare centroid motion in the strong gravitational field near the Sgr A*. It might be promising to serve as a unique laboratory for exploring the accretion matter near black holes or testing Einstein's gravity. Recent studies debated whether there is a non-Keplerian motion of the flares in the GRAVITY dataset. It motivates us to present a comprehensive analysis based on error estimation under the Bayesian framework. This study uses asctrometric flare data to investigate the possibility that the flares exhibit deviations from the circular Keplerian motion. By fixing the black hole mass of Sgr A* and using the averaged astrometric data from the four flares, our results find that the super-Keplerian orbit is favored at the near $1\sigma$ confidence level, where the non-Keperian parameter is $\omega/\omega_k=1.45^{+0.35}_{-0.38}$. By treating the black hole mass as a free parameter, both the averaged and individual data exhibit no significant evidence in favor of non-Keplerian motions, where the non-Keplerian parameter is close to $1$ within $1\sigma$ confidence level. We further analyze flares undergoing planar geodesic motion, where the orbital circularity parameter is $\gamma = 0.99_{-0.10}^{+0.07}$. This indicates that the astrometric data favor the circular orbits. Future improvements in astrometry precision might enable stronger constraints on the kinematical behavior of the flares, potentially offering insights into black hole physics or accretion matter in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Probing Axions via Spectroscopic Measurements of S-stars at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions, encompassing both QCD axions and axion-like particles, can generate loop-induced quadratic couplings to electromagnetic field strength tensors, resulting in oscillatory shifts of the fine-structure constant. Near a Kerr black hole, an axion field with a Compton wavelength comparable to the event horizon can exponentially grow through the superradiance mechanism, potentially reaching a maximum amplitude near the decay constant, provided this scale is below approximately $10^{16}$ GeV. The saturated axion cloud formed around the black hole induces characteristic oscillations in the fine-structure constant, with a period of $10$-$40$ minutes determined by the axion mass, and a spatial profile governed by the axion wavefunction and its coupling strength. At lower axion masses, axion dark matter can form a soliton-like core characterized by a nearly constant amplitude, extending measurable variations of the fine-structure constant to greater distances. Precise spectroscopic measurements of S-stars orbiting the supermassive black hole Sgr A$^*$ provide a powerful probe of these predictions, potentially excluding substantial regions of parameter space for quadratic scalar couplings to photons, owing to the high boson density near the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Whispers from the Early Universe: The Ringdown of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by the ringdown phase of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. As the ringdown signal is independent of the PBH formation mechanism, the resulting SGWB offers a model-independent probe of PBHs. We numerically compute the ringdown waveform and derive the corresponding SGWB. We show that such a signal could be detected by future pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) for PBHs heavier than the solar mass. Additionally, we evaluate the SGWB from binary PBH mergers and demonstrate that it lies within the sensitivity bands of next-generation ground-based interferometers such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, suggesting a multi-band observational strategy for probing the PBH dark matter scenario.</description>

      <title>Exploring non-cold dark matter in a scenario of dynamical dark energy with DESI DR2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of DESI hint that dark matter (DM) may not be cold but have a non-zero equation of state (EoS) parameter, and that dark energy (DE) may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero DM EoS parameter within the framework of dynamical DE. We perform analysis by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova (SN) data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. When using the combination of CMB, BAO, and SN data, our results indicate a preference for a non-zero DM EoS parameter at the $2.8\sigma$ and $3.3\sigma$ level within the content of a constant DE EoS. In contrast, for a time-evolving DE EoS parameterized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, this preference decreases to $0.8\sigma$ and $1.1\sigma$. Furthermore, allowing a non-zero DM EoS yields best-fit values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ that exhibit smaller deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM expectations, and Bayesian evidence analysis shows a comparable preference for this model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. The overall results of this work indicate that a non-zero DM EoS parameter warrants further exploration and investigation.</description>

      <title>Probing small-scale primordial power spectra with tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale primordial perturbations have been well constrained by current cosmological observations, but the properties of small-scale perturbations remain elusive. This study focuses on second-order tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves (TSIGWs) generated by large-amplitude primordial scalar and tensor perturbations on small scales. We provide the analytical expressions for the kernel functions and the corresponding energy density spectra of second-order TSIGWs. By combining observations of SGWB across different scales, TSIGWs can be used to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility of TSIGWs dominating the current PTA observations under various primordial power spectra scenarios. Our results indicate that TSIGWs generated by monochromatic primordial power spectra might be more likely to dominate the current PTA observations.</description>

      <title>A case study of GW190425 for classifying binary neutron star versus binary black hole mergers and constraining asymmetric dark matter with gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO Scientific, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration has identified two binary neutron star merger candidates, GW170817 and GW190425, along with several binary black hole candidates. While GW170817 was confirmed as a BNS merger through its electromagnetic counterparts, GW190425 lacked such observations, leaving its classification uncertain. We examine the possibility that GW190425 originated from black holes that merged after dark matter accretion caused their progenitor neutron stars to implode. Using this event, we place constraints on dark matter parameters, such as its mass and interaction cross section. We simulate GW190425-like events and analyze them using future gravitational wave detector networks, including upcoming upgrades to current detector networks and next-generation observatories. We show that a network with A+ sensitivity can not classify a GW190425-like event with sufficient confidence. Detector networks with A# sensitivity can classify such events only if the neutron stars follow a relatively stiff equation of state, whose stronger tidal imprint differs measurably from a binary black hole waveform. Next-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer recover the tidal signature even for soft, compact stars, enabling confident classification. Finally, we forecast the dark matter constraints that future gravitational wave networks could achieve for similar events.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing rarely produces high-mass outliers to the compact binary population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All gravitational-wave signals are inevitably gravitationally lensed by intervening matter as they propagate through the Universe. When a gravitational-wave signal is magnified, it appears to have originated from a closer, more massive system. Thus, high-mass outliers to the gravitational-wave source population are often proposed as natural candidates for strongly lensed events. However, when using a data-driven method for identifying population outliers, we find that high-mass outliers are not necessarily strongly lensed, nor will the majority of strongly-lensed signals appear as high-mass outliers. This is both because statistical fluctuations produce a larger effect on observed binary parameters than does lensing magnification, and because lensing-induced outliers must originate from intrinsically high-mass sources, which are rare. Thus, the appearance of a single lensing-induced outlier implies the existence of many other lensed events within the catalog. We additionally show that it is possible to constrain the strong lensing optical depth, which is a fundamental quantity of our Universe, with the detection or absence of high-mass outliers. However, constraints using the latest gravitational-wave catalog are weak$\unicode{x2014}$we obtain an upper limit on the optical depth of sources at redshift $1$ magnified by a factor of $5$ or more of $\tau(\mu\geq5,z=1)\leq 0.035 \unicode{x2014}$and future observing runs will not make an outlier-based method competitive with other probes of the optical depth. Future work will investigate the ability of the full inferred population of compact binaries to inform the distribution of lenses in the Universe, opening a unique opportunity to access the high-redshift Universe and constrain cosmic structures.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are open systems which, when perturbed, radiate quasi-normal modes (QNMs) to infinity. By contrast, laboratory analogues are necessarily finite-sized, presenting a potential obstacle to exciting QNMs in experiments. We explore how the QNM spectrum of a toy-model black hole changes when enclosed by a partially reflecting wall with adjustable reflectivity. Our results reveal a continuous connection between the QNM spectra of open and finite-sized systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that QNMs in this setup are easily excited by incoherent background noise. This work opens new avenues for studying QNMs of black holes and compact objects in laboratory settings, where finite-size effects and noise are unavoidable.</description>

Abstract: In this article, the quasinormal modes and greybody factor of charged black hole in non-commutative geometry are studied. Under the assumption of a uniformly distributed charge within the matter, we obtain the metric for a charged black hole in non-commutative geometry. We calculated the wave function and obtained the effective potential of three different perturbed fields with spin. Then we applied $6^{\rm{th}}$ order WKB method to analyze the quasinormal modes of the black hole and derived quasinormal frequencies. Futhermore, we discussed the greybody factor in different perturbed fields under this spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two results which are relevant for constructing marginally outer trapped tubes (MOTTs) in de Sitter spacetime. The first one holds more generally, namely for spacetimes satisfying the null convergence condition and containing a timelike conformal Killing vector with a "temporal function". We show that all marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs) in such a spacetime are unstable. This prevents application of standard results on the propagation of stable MOTSs to MOTTs. On the other hand, it was shown recently that, for every sufficiently high genus, there exists a smooth, complete family of CMC surfaces embedded in the round 3-sphere S3. This family connects a Lawson minimal surface with a doubly covered geodesic 2-sphere. We show by a simple scaling argument that this result translates to an existence proof for complete MOTTs with CMC sections in de Sitter spacetime. Moreover, the area of these sections increases strictly monotonically. We compare this result with an area law obtained before for holographic screens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a recently introduced extension of General Relativity dubbed as Cotton gravity (CG), based on the use of the Cotton tensor, to estimate the size of a new constant $\gamma$ appearing within a spherically symmetric, vacuum solution of the theory. Taking into account its non-asymptotically flat character, we use the inferred size of the central brightness depression of the supermassive object at the heart of the Milky Way galaxy (Sgr A*) by the Event Horizon Telescope to constrain at $2\sigma$ the CG parameter as $\gamma M \approx 3.5 \times 10^{-12}$. We study the potential observational consequences from the smallness of such a value using exact and numerical expressions for the deflection angle, optical images from optically and geometrically thin accretion disks, isoradials, and instability scales (Lyapunov index) of nearly bound geodesics associated to photon rings. Our results point towards the impossibility to distinguish between these two geometries using current and foreseeable techniques in the field of interferometric detection of optical sources.</description>

      <title>Near-Horizon Polarization as a Diagnostic of Black Hole Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in imaging supermassive black holes is disentangling gravitational effects from plasma physics in order to accurately determine spacetime properties, particularly black hole spin. In this Letter, we present a fully covariant and rigorous analysis of the synchrotron emission from accreting plasma in the equatorial plane in the stationary, axisymmetric, high-conductivity regime, and identify--for the first time--a distinctive near-horizon polarization pattern that remains robust across different flow structures. This pattern arises from strong frame dragging near the event horizon, which induces a degeneracy among plasma flow and magnetic field configurations, yielding a polarization signature determined solely by the spacetime geometry and the observer's inclination. The near-horizon polarization thus offers a clean and precise probe of black hole spin and other fundamental parameters. If future space-based millimeter VLBI observations can resolve synchrotron emission originating within approximately 1$\%$ of the event horizon radius in M87* or Sgr A*, this universal polarization pattern may become observable.</description>

      <title>Search for exotic gravitational wave signals beyond general relativity using deep learning</title>

Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves by LIGO has confirmed general relativity (GR) and sparked rapid growth in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. However, subtle post-Newtonian (PN) deviations observed during the analysis of high signal-to-noise ratio events from the observational runs suggest that standard waveform templates, which assume strict adherence to GR, might overlook signals from alternative theories of gravity. Incorporating these exotic signals into traditional search algorithms is computationally infeasible due to the vast template space required. This paper introduces a proof-of-principle deep learning framework for detecting exotic GW signals, leveraging neural networks trained on GR-based templates. Through their generalization ability, neural networks learn intricate features from the data, enabling the detection of signals that deviate from GR. We present the first study evaluating the capability of deep learning to detect beyond-GR signals, including a variety of PN orders. Our model achieves rapid and accurate identification of exotic GW signals across different luminosity distances, with performance comparable to GR-based detections. In particular, applying the model to the GW150914 event demonstrates excellent performance, highlighting the potential of AI-driven methods for detecting previously overlooked signals beyond GR. This work paves the way for new discoveries in gravitational wave astronomy, enabling the detection of signals that might escape traditional search pipelines.</description>

      <title>Interacting phantom dark energy: new accelerating scaling attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed investigation of interacting phantom cosmology, by applying the powerful method of dynamical system analysis. We consider two well-studied interaction forms, namely one global and one local one, while the novel ingredient of our work is the examination of new potentials for the phantom field. Our analysis shows the existence of saddle matter-dominated points, stable dark-energy dominated points, and scaling accelerating solutions, that can attract the Universe at late times. As we show, some of the stable accelerating scaling attractors, in which dark matter and dark energy can co-exist, alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem, are totally new, even for the previously studied interaction rates, and arise purely from the novel potential forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The black hole shadow is fundamentally connected to the structure of light rings and the photon region in the background geometry. We investigate the photon region boundary in a generic asymptotically flat, stationary, axisymmetric black hole spacetime that admits spherical photon orbits (SPOs). We define the photon region's boundary purely in terms of the background metric functions, independent of the photon's parameters like energy or angular momentum, which is applicable to both separable and non-separable spacetimes. We establish the existence of at least one bounded photon region. We further analyze its common features, including overlap with the ergoregion and rotation sense of SPOs. Additionally, light rings are identified at the extrema of the photon region boundary curves in the $(r,\theta)$ plane. Our approach is validated against a few exact black hole solutions. Implications are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from the first-order phase transition can be characterized by a few phenomenological parameters but with high degeneracies in model/data distinguishments. In this paper, we look into the high-frequency power law of the GW spectrum with preliminary numerical simulations for both quantum and semi-classical pictures of vacuum decay. We first reveal an anti-correlation of the high-frequency power law to a certain power of the ratio between the wall thickness and bubble radius at the onset of bubble collisions, which can be further approximated analytically by some other phenomenological model characteristics to break the model degeneracy.</description>

Abstract: We present a simple field theory model with reduced invariance under diffeomorphisms whose energy-momentum tensor is identical to the sum of pressureless irrotational matter and a cosmological constant. The model action is built from a single scalar field with a canonical kinetic term without any potential or Lagrange multiplier terms. The coupling to gravity is realized through a particular transverse diffeomorphism invariant volume element. The corresponding sound speed is exactly zero in any background geometry and the model is dynamically identical to $\Lambda$CDM. By restoring the full diffeomorphism invariance through the introduction of Stueckelberg-like fields, we obtain an equivalent local scalar-vector theory.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Primordial Black Holes, Dimensionless Small Parameter, Inflationary Cosmology and Non-Gaussianity</title>

Abstract: In the present work consideration is given to the primordial black holes ({\bf pbhs}) in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter Metric with small mass (ultralight) in the preinflationary epoch. Within the scope of natural assumptions, it has been shown that the quantum-gravitational corrections ({\bf qgcs}) to the characteristics of such black holes can contribute to all the cosmological parameters, shifting them compared with the semiclassical consideration. These contributions are determined by a series expansion in terms of a small parameter dependent on the hole mass (radius). For this pattern different cases have been considered (stationary, black hole evaporation...). It has been demonstrated that involvement of ({\bf qgcs}) leads to a higher probability for the occurrence of such {\bf pbhs}. Besides, high-energy deformations of Friedmann Equations created on the basis of these corrections have been derived for different patterns. In the last section of this work it is introduced a study into the contributions generated by the above-mentioned {\bf qgcs} in inflationary cosmological perturbations. Besides, it has been shown that non-Gaussianity of these perturbations is higher as compared to the semi-classical pattern.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the contribution of extragalactic DWD to the astrophysical SGWB could be detectable in the mHz regime by LISA. Conversely, the presence of this SGWB could hamper the detection of cosmological SGWB, which are one of the key targets of GW astronomy. We aim to confirm the spectrum of the extragalactic DWD SGWB and estimate its detectability with LISA under different assumptions. We also aim at understanding the main uncertainties in the spectrum and estimate if the signal could be anisotropic. We use population synthesis code COSMIC with several assumptions on binary evolution and initial conditions. We incorporate a specific treatment to account for the mass transfer and tidal torques after DWDs formation. Our study is in global agreement with previous studies, although we find a lower contribution at high frequencies, due to a different treatment of mass transfer in stellar binaries. We find that the uncertainties in the amplitude are dominated by the SFR model, and to a lesser degree by the binary evolution model. The inclusion of tidal effects and mass transfer episodes in DWDs can change the amplitude of the estimated SGWB up to a factor 3 at the highest frequencies. For all the models, we find that this SGWB would be detectable observable by LISA after 4 years. Under the hypothesis of an homogeneous Universe beyond 200Mpc, anisotropies associated to the astrophysical population of DWDs will likely not be detectable. We provide fits of this SGWB under different assumptions to be used by the community. We demonstrate variability in SGWB predictions, emphasizing uncertainties due to different astrophysical assumptions. We highlight the importance of determining the position of the knee in the SGWB spectrum, as it provides insights on mass transfer models. The prediction of this SGWB is of critical importance for LISA in the context of observing other SGWB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a comprehensive perturbative analysis of four cosmological models featuring a sign-switching cosmological constant. Among these, we include the well-known $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, characterised by an abrupt transition from a negative to a positive cosmological constant. We also consider the L$\Lambda$CDM model, which exhibits a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as the SSCDM and ECDM models, both of which undergo a smooth sign change at comparable redshifts. We solve the linear cosmological perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter and radiation, for modes well outside the Hubble radius in the early Universe. We analyse the behaviour of the matter density contrast, the gravitational potential, the linear growth rate, the matter power spectrum, and the $f\sigma_8$ evolution . These results are contrasted with predictions from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and are confronted with observational data.</description>

      <title>Dymnikova Black Hole Surrounded by Quintessence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dymnikova black hole (BH) is a regular solution that interpolates between a de Sitter core near the origin and a Schwarzschild-like behavior at large distances. In this work, we investigate the properties of a Dymnikova BH immersed in a quintessential field, characterized by the state parameter $\omega$ and a normalization constant $c$. We explore the thermodynamic behavior, null geodesics, scalar quasinormal modes and shadow profiles for this model. Our analysis shows that the presence of quintessence alters the Hawking temperature and specific heat, leading to parameter-dependent phase transitions. The null geodesics and corresponding black hole shadows are also found to be sensitive to the model parameters, especially $\omega$ and $c$. This sensitivity influences light deflection and shadow size. Furthermore, we compute the scalar quasinormal modes and observe that quintessence tends to enhance the damping of the modes, indicating greater stability under perturbations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on interacting dark energy revisited: implications for the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a class of coupled dark energy models where dark energy interacts with dark matter via phenomenological energy exchange terms. We include the perturbation of the Hubble rate in the interaction term, which was absent in previous works. We also consider more recent data sets such as cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies from \text{Planck} 2018, type I-a supernovae (SNIa) measurements from Pantheon+ and data from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and redshift space distortions (RSD). One of the models presents a strong incompatibility when different cosmological datasets are used. We analyze the influence of the SH0ES Cepheid host distances on the results and, although for one model the discrepancy of $H_0$ is reduced to $3.2\sigma$ when compared to the value obtained by the \textit{Planck} collaboration and $3.6\sigma$ when compared to the SH0ES team, joint analysis is incompatible. Including BAO with RSD shows incompatibility with SH0ES for all models considered here. We perform a model comparison and although there is a preference for interacting dark energy over $\Lambda$CDM for all the models for joint analysis CMB+BAO+RSD+SNIa, most of the 2D contours do not overlap. We conclude that the models of interactions in the dark sector considered in this paper are not flexible enough to fit all the cosmological data including values of $H_0$ from SH0ES in a statistically acceptable way. Therefore, the addition of one extra degree of freedom (i.e. the coupling between dark matter and dark matter) does not help enough to alleviate the already existing tension in the vanilla $\Lambda$CDM, suggesting that the models would need to be modified to include further flexibility of predictions to help elucidate this issue.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we revisit $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation, also know as $E$-model, in the light of current CMB and LSS observations. The inflaton potential in the Einstein frame for this model contains a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential, which alters the predictions for the scalar and tensor power spectra of Starobinsky inflation. We obtain these power spectra numerically without using slow-roll approximation and perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on parameters $M$ and $\alpha$ from Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We consider general reheating scenario by varying the number of e-foldings during inflation, $N_{pivot}$, along with the other parameters. We find $\log_{10}\alpha = 0.0^{+1.6}_{-5.6}$, $\log_{10}M= -4.91^{+0.69}_{-2.7}$ and $N_{pivot} = 53.2^{+3.9}_{-5}$ with $95\%$ C. L.. This implies that the present CMB and LSS observations are insufficient to constrain the parameter $\alpha$. We also find that there is no correlation between $N_{pivot}$ and $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Searching for ultra-light dark matter through frequency modulation of gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-light bosons, naturally appearing in well-motivated extensions to the Standard Model, can constitute all the dark matter. Models with particle mass close to the smallest phenomenologically allowed exhibit coherent field configurations at (sub)galactic scales, oscillating at a frequency corresponding to the fundamental mass of the dark matter particle. The gravitational field of these structures inherits the dark matter field's coherent oscillations, leaving an imprint on gravitational (and electromagnetic) waves sourced close to (or in) such overdensities. This happens via a heterodyning frequency modulation, which can later be decoded in a gravitational-wave detector. An analogous effect occurs in models with universal (conformal) couplings of ultra-light bosons with ordinary matter, generated by the direct interaction with the oscillating field. In this work, we explore this phenomenon in detail and assess the capability of near-future interferometers to probe ultra-light dark matter and its potential conformal couplings to matter. Using astrophysical population models, together with results from cosmological simulations, we find that the observation of gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars at the Galactic Centre with the Einstein Telescope/Cosmic Explorer would be particularly effective in constraining ultra-light dark matter.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to cosmological non-linearities as an effective fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two parameters extension of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model to capture the impact of matter inhomogeneities on our cosmological inference. Non virialized but non-linearly evolving overdense and underdense regions, whose abundance is quantified using the Press-Schechter formalism, are collectively described by two effective perfect fluids $\rho_{\rm{c}},\rho_{\rm{v}}$ with non vanishing equation of state parameters $w_{\rm{c,v}}\neq 0$. These fluids are coupled to the pressureless dust, akin to an interacting DM-DE scenario. The resulting phenomenology is very rich, and could potentially address a number of inconsistencies of the standard model, including a simultaneous resolution of the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions. To assess the viability of the model, we set initial conditions compatible to the Planck 2018 best fit $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and fit its additional parameters using SN~Ia observations from DESY5, BAO distances from DESI DR2 and a sample of uncorrelated $f\sigma_8$ measurements. Our findings show that backreaction effects from the cosmic web could restore the concordance between early and late Universe cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>The Spectre of Underdetermination in Modern Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scientific status of physical cosmology has been the subject of philosophical debate ever since detailed mathematical models of the Universe emerged from Einstein's general theory of relativity. Such debates have revolved around whether and to what extent cosmology meets established demarcation criteria for a discipline to be scientific, as well as determining how to best characterize cosmology as a science, given the unique challenges and limitations faced by a discipline which aims to study the origin, composition, and fate of the Universe itself. The present article revisits, in light of the dramatic progress in cosmology in recent decades, an earlier debate held in the 1950s between Herman Bondi and Gerald Whitrow regarding the scientific status of cosmology. We analyse cosmology's transition from an emerging science to a cornerstone of modern physics, highlighting its empirical successes in establishing the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and in its delivery of various successful novel predictions. Despite this remarkable scientific success and progress, we argue that modern cosmology faces a further profound challenge: the permanent underdetermination of the microphysical nature of its exotic energy components: inflation, dark matter, and dark energy. Drawing historical parallels with the role of spectroscopy in revealing the microphysical nature of atomic physics, we argue that the epistemic barriers obstructing us from ascertaining the microphysical nature of these exotic energy components are significant, in turn casting doubt upon whether cosmology can ever transcend these particular epistemic challenges. We conclude by reflecting on the prospects for future breakthroughs and/or non-empirical arguments which could decide this issue conclusively.</description>

      <title>Effect of dark matter halo on transonic accretion flow around a galactic black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transonic accretion flow in the spacetime of a supermassive black hole (BH) coupled to an anisotropic dark matter fluid, as proposed by Cardoso {\it et al}. We essentially compare the accretion properties of the Cardoso BH with those of an isolated Schwarzschild BH. The Cardoso BH is described by the halo mass ($M_{\rm H}$) and its characteristic length scale ($a_0$). Various classes of accretion solution topologies (e.g., A and W-types) are obtained by solving the dynamical equations of the flow in a fully general relativistic framework. We find that the global accretion solutions in the identified solution topologies are substantially influenced by the halo parameters ($M_{\rm H}, a_0$) when the halo mass is high or the dark matter distribution is concentrated near the black hole. In this high compactness regime, different observational signatures of the accretion disc, like the spectral energy distribution (SED) and bolometric disc luminosity, are found to exhibit considerable deviations from the known results in the Schwarzschild BH model. Furthermore, we obtain shock-induced accretion solutions, where different shock properties, such as the shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$), flow mass density ($\rho$) compression, and electron temperature ($T_e$) compression across the shock front, are potentially altered from those in the Schwarzschild BH model when the halo compactness is high. Interestingly, the existing shock parameter space, defined by the flow specific angular momentum ($\lambda$) and energy ($E$), is largely reduced for higher halo compactness compared to that of the Schwarzschild BH. These unique features offer a possible valuable tool for characterizing the presence or absence of a dark matter halo around a galactic black hole.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of mutual information in the Page curve for a functional renormalization group improved Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work delves into probing the importance of mutual information of relevant subsystems in obtaining the correct time-evolution of fine-grained entropy of Hawking radiation, as suggested by Page. This was done by considering a functional renormalization group improved or simply, quantum corrected Schwarzschild black solution which captures the flavour of an effective theory of quantum gravity. The mentioned black hole solution emerges from a asymptotically safe average effective action which describes a trajectory in momentum-space and satisfies a renormalizarion group equation. Furthermore, in the before Page time scenario, the behaviour of the mutual information between appropriate subsystems over time leads to the Hartman-Maldacena time. The observations made for the quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole have been compared to the same made for the standard Schwarzschild black hole in order to draw some novel conclusions. Based upon our observations, we also propose a formula for computing fine-grained entropy of Hawking radiation for an eternal black hole, in presence of the island.</description>

      <title>Quasar Pairs as Large--Scale Structure tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasars are effective tracers of the large-scale distribution of galaxies at high redshift thanks to their high luminosity and dedicated surveys. Previous studies have shown that quasars exhibit a bias similar to that of rich groups, indicating that quasar pairs may be linked to higher density environments, serving as protocluster proxies. In this work, we aim to characterize close quasar pairs within the same halo by identifying them in redshift space. We analyze pair-quasar cross correlations and CMB-derived lensing convergence profiles centered in these systems. We have identified 2777 pairs of quasars in the redshift range from 1.2 to 2.8. Quasar pairs exhibit a distribution of relative luminosities that differs from that of random pairs with the same redshift distribution, indicating that quasars in these systems are distinct from isolated ones. The cross-correlation between pairs and quasars shows a larger amplitude than the auto-correlation function of quasars, suggesting these systems are more strongly biased toward the large-scale mass distribution and reside in more massive halos. This is further supported by higher convergence CMB lensing profiles of pairs compared to isolated quasars with a similar redshift distribution. Our results indicate that quasar pairs are suitable precursors to present-day clusters of galaxies, unlike isolated quasars, which are associated with less dense environments.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble Tension with a Local Void and Transitions of the Absolute Magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, one of the well-known serious challenges in cosmology is the Hubble tension, namely the discrepancy between the Hubble constants from the local observation of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) and the high-$z$ observation of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Here, we are interested in alleviating the Hubble tension with a local void. The key idea is assuming that we live in a locally underdense void, where one will feel a faster expansion rate compared to the cosmic average. In the literature, it was found that a local void cannot satisfyingly alleviate the Hubble tension, since it is not preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model by the observations such as the Pantheon SNIa sample, especially in terms of the information criteria AIC and BIC. In the present work, we try to alleviate the Hubble tension with a local void and transitions of the absolute magnitude $M$, by using the Pantheon+ SNIa sample alone or jointly with the CMB data of Planck 2018. We find that the Hubble tension can be satisfyingly alleviated, while the $\Lambda$LTB void models are strongly preferred by the observations.</description>

      <title>On the difficulty of capturing the distribution function of neutrinos in neutron star merger simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collision of two neutron stars is a rich source of information about nuclear physics. In particular, the kilonova signal following a merger can help us elucidate the role of neutron stars in nucleosynthesis, and informs us about the properties of matter above nuclear saturation. Approximate modeling of neutrinos remains an important limitation to our ability to make predictions for these observables. Part of the problem is the fermionic nature of neutrinos. By the exclusion principle, the expected value $f_\nu$ for the number of neutrinos in a quantum state is at most 1. Any process producing neutrinos is suppressed by a blocking factor $(1-f_\nu)$. Recent simulations focused on neutrino physics mostly use a gray two-moment scheme to evolve neutrinos. This evolves integrals of $f_\nu$ over momentum space, preventing direct calculations of blocking factors. Monte Carlo methods may be an attractive alternative, providing access to the full distribution of neutrinos. Their current implementation is however inadequate to estimate $f_\nu$: in our most recent simulations, a single Monte Carlo packet causes, in the worst cases, estimates of $f_\nu$ to jump from $f_\nu=0$ to $f_\nu\sim 10^5$. While this is concerning, this brazen violation of the fermionic nature of neutrinos has been largely inconsequential as the interactions used in simulations avoid direct calculations of $f_\nu$. We are however reaching a level of modeling at which this problem can no longer be ignored. Here, we discuss the relatively simple origin of this issue. We then show that very rough estimates of $f_\nu$ can in theory be obtained in merger simulations, but that they will require a combination of unintuitive weighting schemes for Monte Carlo packets and smoothing of the neutrino distribution at coarser resolution than what the merger simulation uses.</description>

      <title>Phantom matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observations of the recent universe suggest that dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ is growing with time, departing from a cosmological constant for which $w=-1$. Standard quintessence models allow for a varying $w\geq-1$, but observations report that a phantom regime, $w&lt;-1$, is quickly reached in the past. Often discarded because of uncertainties or parametrisation, we rather propose here to embrace the reality of this phantom regime. We revisit an elegant mechanism that accounts for it, thanks to a coupling of quintessence field(s) to matter (and possibly radiation). We show that this allows for steep scalar potentials, and illustrate this with string-inspired models, where $V=V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \varphi}$ and $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$. Those provide solutions in very good agreement with observations, including the phantom regime. We then discuss poles that can appear in $w$, making it diverge at recent times ($z\leq 4$), and that could be detected by observations. We finally comment on an Early Dark Energy-like feature, that systematically appears for free from the models considered, and could be of interest for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Planckian Quark and Gluon Scattering in Agravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate tree-level scattering processes involving quarks ($q$) and gluons ($g$) mediated by graviton exchange in the framework of Agravity, a dimensionless and renormalizable theory of quadratic quantum gravity. Focusing on the ultra-Planckian regime, characterized by the Mandelstam variable $s = (p_1 + p_2)^2$, which corresponds to the total energy squared in the center-of-momentum frame, being much larger than any particle mass scale, we compute the squared amplitudes and analyze the differential cross sections for the processes $gg \to gg$, $gg \to q\bar{q}$, $gq \to gq$, and $qq \to qq$. We demonstrate that all amplitudes scale as $1/s$ at high energies, in agreement with expectations for a UV-complete theory of gravity. In addition, we explore the issue of unitarity in the presence of higher-derivative ghost modes by analyzing the positivity properties of the squared amplitudes. While IR divergences appear in the forward scattering of massless particles, we show that these are regularized by finite quark masses. Our findings support the viability of Agravity as a perturbatively unitary and UV-complete extension of general relativity, capable of consistently describing gravitational interactions among elementary matter fields at trans-Planckian energies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing photon-axion conversion probability with squeezed coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states can enhance the conversion probability.</description>

      <title>Radiated Angular Momentum from Spinning Black Hole Scattering Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory approach we derive solutions to the equations of motion for spinning massive bodies up to quadratic order in spins. At leading post-Minkowskian (PM) order these trajectories are obtained in the time domain, and at sub-leading order in the frequency domain. Our approach incorporates diagrammatic techniques and modern Feynman integration technologies, and includes a new family of loop integrals different to those seen in asymptotic PM calculations. Our results provide a new mechanism for computing the radiated angular momentum involved in gravitational scattering, which we reproduce at 2PM order up to linear spins. We have established a framework for computing higher-order effects to further extend the high-precision frontier in analytical gravitational wave physics, and push predictions for the radiated angular momentum to higher perturbative orders.</description>

      <title>Milliarcsecond astrometric oscillations in active galactic nuclei as a precursor of multi-messenger gravitational wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is predicted by various cosmological and evolutionary scenarios for active galactic nuclei. These objects are considered as contributors into the gravitational wave (GW) background and emitters of discrete GW bursts. Yet, SMBHBs remain a rather elusive class of extragalactic objects. Previously we have identified the quasar J2102+6015 as potential SMBHB system based on its oscillating astrometric pattern. We analysed the available VLBI astrometry data and identified another case of astrometric oscillations in the source J0204+1514. We assume these oscillations as manifestations of orbital motion in a binary systems. We estimated parameters of the suspected SMBHB in this source and applied basic theoretical models for projecting its evolution toward coalescence. We also develop a toy model of SMBHB consistent with the discovered astrometric oscillations and give quantitative predictions of GW emission of such the source using the case of J0204+1514 as an example. As an ad hoc result, we also provide a re-assessed estimate of the redshift of J2102+6015, z=1.42. A toy model of the object containing SMBHB with parameters consistent with the observed astrometric oscillations of the source J0204+1514 enabled us to consider GW emission as the cause of the system's orbital evolution. Astrometric VLBI monitoring has an appreciable potential for future detections of SMBHBs as multi-messenger targets for both electromagnetic (in radio domain) and gravitational wave astronomy. To outline the contours of a future physical model connecting SMBHB with detectable GW manifestations, we apply the toy model to the source J0204+1514. We also provide justification for aiming future space-borne VLBI missions toward direct imaging of SMBHBs as a synergistic contribution into future multi-messenger studies involving prospective GW facilities.</description>
