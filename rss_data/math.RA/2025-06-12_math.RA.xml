      <title>The Dixmier problem for skew PBW extensions and rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss for skew $PBW$ extensions the famous Dixmier problem formulated by Jacques Dixmier in 1968. The skew $PBW$ extensions are noncommutative rings of polynomial type and covers several algebras and rings arising in mathematical physics and noncommutative algebraic geometry. For this purpose, we introduce the Dixmier algebras and we will study the Dixmier problem for algebras over commutative rings, in particular, for $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras, i.e., for arbitrary rings. The results are focused on the investigation of the Dixmier problem for matrix algebras, product of algebras, tensor product of algebras and also on the Dixmier question for the following particular key skew $PBW$ extension: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and let $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ be the $K$-algebra generated by $n\geq 2$ elements $x_1,\dots,x_n$ subject to relations
  $$x_jx_i=x_ix_j+d_{ij}, 1\leq i&lt;j\leq n, d_{ij}\in K-\{0\}.$$ We prove that the algebra $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ is central and simple. We conjecture that $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ is Dixmier. In the last section we present a matrix-computational approach to the problem formulated by Jacques Dixmier and also we compute some concrete nontrivial examples of automorphisms of the first Weyl algebra $A_1(K)$ and $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ using the MAPLE library SPBWE developed for the first author.</description>

      <title>Acyclic complexes and regular rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2009 paper by Iacob and Iyengar characterizes noetherian regular rings in terms of properties of complexes of projective modules, flat modules, and injective modules. We show that the relevant properties of such complexes are equivalent without reference to regularity of the ring and that they characterize coherent regular rings and von Neumann regular rings.</description>

      <title>A contramodule generalization of Neeman's flat and projective module theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper builds on top of arXiv:2306.02734. We consider a complete, separated topological ring $\mathfrak R$ with a countable base of neighborhoods of zero consisting of open two-sided ideals. The main result is that the homotopy category of projective left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules is equivalent to the derived category of the exact category of flat left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules, and also to the homotopy category of flat cotorsion left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules. In other words, a complex of flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules is contraacyclic (in the sense of Becker) if and only if it is an acyclic complex with flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules of cocycles, and if and only if it is coacyclic as a complex in the exact category of flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules. These are contramodule generalizations of theorems of Neeman and of Bazzoni, Cortes-Izurdiaga, and Estrada.</description>

      <title>Deformations of ideals in Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops the deformation theory of Lie ideals. It shows that the smooth deformations of an ideal $\mathfrak i$ in a Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ differentiate to cohomology classes in the cohomology of $\mathfrak g$ with values in its adjoint representation on $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathfrak i, \mathfrak g/\mathfrak i)$. The cohomology associated with the ideal $\mathfrak i$ in $\mathfrak g$ is compared with other Lie algebra cohomologies defined by $\mathfrak i$, such as the cohomology defined by $\mathfrak i$ as a Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$ (Richardson, 1969), and the cohomology defined by the Lie algebra morphism $\mathfrak g \to \mathfrak g/\mathfrak i$.
  After a choice of complement of the ideal $\mathfrak i$ in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$, its deformation complex is enriched to the differential graded Lie algebra that controls its deformations, in the sense that its Maurer-Cartan elements are in one-to-one correspondence with the (small) deformations of the ideal. Furthermore, the $L_{\infty}$-algebra that simultaneously controls the deformations of $\mathfrak{i}$ and of the ambient Lie bracket is identified.
  Under appropriate assumptions on the low degrees of the deformation cohomology of a given Lie ideal, the (topological) rigidity and stability of ideals are studied, as well as obstructions to deformations of ideals of Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Twisted Steinberg algebras, regular inclusions and induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a field $K$ and an ample (not necessarily Hausdorff) groupoid $G$, we define the concept of a line bundle over $G$ inspired by the well known concept from the theory of C*-algebras. If $E$ is such a line bundle, we construct the associated twisted Steinberg algebra in terms of sections of $E$, extending the original construction introduced independently by Steinberg in 2010, and by Clark, Farthing, Sims and Tomforde in a 2014 paper (originally announced in 2011). We also generalize (strictly, in the non-Hausdorff case) the 2023 construction of (cocycle) twisted Steinberg algebras of Armstrong, Clark, Courtney, Lin, Mccormick and Ramagge. We then extend Steinberg's theory of induction of modules, not only to the twisted case, but to the much more general case of regular inclusions of algebras. Among our main results, we show that, under appropriate conditions, every irreducible module is induced by an irreducible module over a certain abstractly defined isotropy algebra. We also describe a process of disintegration of modules and use it to prove a version of the Effros-Hahn conjecture, showing that every primitive ideal coincides with the annihilator of a module induced from isotropy.</description>
