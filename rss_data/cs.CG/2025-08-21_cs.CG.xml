      <title>Constrained Flips in Plane Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flip in a plane spanning tree $T$ is the operation of removing one edge from $T$ and adding another edge such that the resulting structure is again a plane spanning tree. For trees on a set of points in convex position we study two classic types of constrained flips: (1)~Compatible flips are flips in which the removed and inserted edge do not cross each other. We relevantly improve the previous upper bound of $2n-O(\sqrt{n})$ on the diameter of the compatible flip graph to~$\frac{5n}{3}-O(1)$, by this matching the upper bound for unrestricted flips by Bjerkevik, Kleist, Ueckerdt, and Vogtenhuber [SODA~2025] up to an additive constant of $1$. We further show that no shortest compatible flip sequence removes an edge that is already in its target position. Using this so-called happy edge property, we derive a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to compute the shortest compatible flip sequence between two given trees. (2)~Rotations are flips in which the removed and inserted edge share a common vertex. Besides showing that the happy edge property does not hold for rotations, we improve the previous upper bound of $2n-O(1)$ for the diameter of the rotation graph to~$\frac{7n}{4}-O(1)$.</description>

      <title>Same Quality Metrics, Different Graph Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph drawings are commonly used to visualize relational data. User understanding and performance are linked to the quality of such drawings, which is measured by quality metrics. The tacit knowledge in the graph drawing community about these quality metrics is that they are not always able to accurately capture the quality of graph drawings. In particular, such metrics may rate drawings with very poor quality as very good. In this work we make this tacit knowledge explicit by showing that we can modify existing graph drawings into arbitrary target shapes while keeping one or more quality metrics almost identical. This supports the claim that more advanced quality metrics are needed to capture the 'goodness' of a graph drawing and that we cannot confidently rely on the value of a single (or several) certain quality metrics.</description>

      <title>Topological potentials guiding protein self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins, driven by short-range non-polar interactions, can find the biologically correct assembly as the energy minimizing state. Short-ranged potentials produce rugged energy landscapes however, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional, local minimizers.
  Successful self-assembly simulations depend both on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space.
  We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy. This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales.
  Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes.</description>

      <title>PyKirigami: An interactive Python simulator for kirigami metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of kirigami has been used in creating deployable structures for various scientific and technological applications. While the design of kirigami metamaterials has been widely studied, the simulation of the deployment and shape transformation process is less explored. In this work, we develop PyKirigami, an efficient Python-based open-source computational tool for the deployment simulation of kirigami metamaterials. In particular, our tool is capable of simulating both two- and three-dimensional deployments of a large variety of kirigami metamaterials with different geometric, topological, and physical properties. Altogether, our work paves a new way for the modelling and design of shape-morphing mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Implicit Toolpath Generation for Functionally Graded Additive Manufacturing via Gradient-Informed Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel gradient-informed slicing method for functionally graded additive manufacturing (FGM) that overcomes the limitations of conventional toolpath planning approaches, which struggle to produce truly continuous gradients. By integrating multi-material gradients into the toolpath generation process, our method enables the fabrication of FGMs with complex gradients that vary seamlessly in any direction. We leverage OpenVCAD's implicit representation of geometry and material fields to directly extract iso-contours, enabling accurate, controlled gradient toolpaths. Two novel strategies are introduced to integrate these gradients into the toolpath planning process. The first strategy maintains traditional perimeter, skin, and infill structures subdivided by mixture ratios, with automated 'zippering' to mitigate stress concentrations. The second strategy fills iso-contoured regions densely, printing directly against gradients to eliminate purging and reduce waste. Both strategies accommodate gradually changing printing parameters, such as mixed filament ratios, toolhead switching, and variable nozzle temperatures for foaming materials. This capability allows for controlled variation of composition, density, and other properties within a single build, expanding the design space for functionally graded parts. Experimental results demonstrate the fabrication of high-quality FGMs with complex, multi-axis gradients, highlighting the versatility of our method. We showcase the successful implementation of both strategies on a range of geometries and material combinations, demonstrating the potential of our approach to produce intricate and functional FGMs. This work provides a robust, open-source, and automated framework for designing and fabricating advanced FGMs, accelerating research in multi-material additive manufacturing.</description>
