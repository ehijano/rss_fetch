      <title>Orthogonality induced by norm derivatives : A new geometric constant and symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the difference between orthogonality induced by the norm derivatives (known as $\rho$-orthogonality) and Birkhoff-James orthogonality in a normed linear space $ \mathbb X$ by introducing a new geometric constant, denoted by $\Gamma(\mathbb{X}).$ We explore the relation between various geometric properties of the space and the constant $\Gamma(\mathbb{X}).$ We also investigate the left symmetric and right symmetric elements of a normed linear space with respect to $\rho$-orthogonality and obtain a characterization of the same. We characterize inner product spaces among normed linear spaces using the symmetricity of $\rho$-orthogonality. Finally, we provide a complete description of both left symmetric and right symmetric elements with respect to $\rho$-orthogonality for some particular Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of D and D' properties in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the equivalence of two sequential properties, $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{D}'$, for dual Banach spaces under the weak* topology. Property $\mathcal{D}$ ensures that any totally scalarly measurable function is also scalarly measurable, while property $\mathcal{D}'$ states that every weakly* sequentially closed subspace of $X^*$ is weakly* closed. These properties, which are central to the study of the interplay between topology and measurability in Banach spaces, were originally investigated in \cite{plichko2015}, where their equivalence was left as an open question.
  By examining the topological and measurable structures induced by the Baire $\sigma$-algebra, we prove that properties $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{D}'$ are indeed equivalent. The proof utilizes the relationship between total sets, weak* closures, and scalar measurability, extending previous results on sequential properties of dual Banach spaces. Additionally, we revisit the failure of property $\mathcal{D}$ in nonseparable Banach spaces with $M$-basic $\ell_1^+$-systems, providing a topological reinterpretation of this phenomenon. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the weak* topology and measurable mappings in Banach space theory.</description>

      <title>On the extension of one-parameter operator semigroups to completions of Archimedean vector lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensions of one-parameter operator semigroups on Archimedean vector lattices to their order/ru-completions are studied. Existence and uniqueness of the extension to the ru-completion is established in the class of positive semigroups. An extension theorem for positive ru-continuos semigroups on vector lattices with property (R) is proved. This theorem allows one to abandon the requirement of ru-completeness in various results concerning positive ru-continuous semigroups.</description>

      <title>An application of the spherical completion to finite-dimensional normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will establish a general method of studying finite-dimensional normed spaces, and apply this method to classifying $3$-dimensional and $4$-dimensional normed spaces over a non-spherically complete field. For this purpose, we will use the spherical completion. From the perspective of the spherical completion, each finite-dimensional normed space can be embedded into a simple space. In order to study simple spaces, the orthogonality is important. The orthogonality allows us to find a classification of finite-dimensional normed spaces. As an application of our study, we can get a characterization of strictly epicompact sets, which is an open problem.</description>

      <title>A microlocal calculus on filtered manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a pseudodifferential calculus on a general filtered manifold M . The symbols are fields of operators $\sigma$(x, $\pi$) parametrised by x $\in$ M and the unitary dual G x M of the osculating Lie group G x M . We define classes of symbols and a local quantization formula associated to a local frame adapted to the filtration. We prove that the collection of operators on M coinciding locally with the quantization of symbols enjoys the essential properties of a pseudodifferential calculus: composition, adjoint, parametrices, continuity on adapted Sobolev spaces. Moreover, we show that the polyhomogeneous subcalculus coincides with the calculus constructed by van Erp and Yuncken via groupoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Space-time divergence lemmas and optimal non-reversible lifts of diffusions on Riemannian manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reversible lifts reduce the relaxation time of reversible diffusions at most by a square root. For reversible diffusions on domains in Euclidean space, or, more generally, on a Riemannian manifold with boundary, non-reversible lifts are in particular given by the Hamiltonian flow on the tangent bundle, interspersed with random velocity refreshments, or perturbed by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, and reflected at the boundary. In order to prove that for certain choices of parameters, these lifts achieve the optimal square-root reduction up to a constant factor, precise upper bounds on relaxation times are required. A key tool for deriving such bounds by space-time Poincar\'e inequalities is a quantitative space-time divergence lemma. Extending previous work of Cao, Lu and Wang, we establish such a divergence lemma with explicit constants for general locally convex domains with smooth boundary in Riemannian manifolds satisfying a lower, not necessarily positive, curvature bound. As a consequence, we prove optimality of the lifts described above up to a constant factor, provided the deterministic transport part of the dynamics and the noise are adequately balanced. Our results show for example that an integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on a locally convex domain with diameter $d$ achieves a relaxation time of the order $d$, whereas, in general, the Poincar\'e constant of the domain is of the order $d^2$.</description>

      <title>Local unitarty equivalence and entanglement by Bargmann invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum states frequently examines the connection between non-local effects in quantum mechanics and quantities that remain unchanged under local unitary transformations. Among these concepts, local unitary equivalence, defined through local unitary transformations, holds significant importance in quantum state classification and resource theory. This paper focuses on the fundamental issue of local unitary equivalence for multipartite quantum states within quantum information theory, with the aim of identifying the comprehensive set of invariants that define their local unitary orbits. These invariants are crucial for deriving polynomial invariants and describing physical properties that remain invariant under local unitary transformations. Specifically, the research delves into the characterization of local unitary equivalence and the detection of entanglement using local unitary Bargmann invariants, utilizing the generalized Schur-Weyl duality to analyze tensor product symmetries. Taking the two-qubit system as an example, our study demonstrates the measurability of the invariants that determine local unitary equivalence and establishes a relationship between Makhlin's fundamental invariants (a complete set of 18 local unitary invariants for two-qubit states) and local unitary Bargmann invariants. These Bargmann invariants are related to the trace of density operator products with marginal states and can be measured through a cycle test, an extension of the SWAP test.These findings offer a practical criterion for entanglement detection based on local unitary Bargmann invariants, contributing to the advancement of quantum information theory and its applications.</description>

      <title>Braided tensor product of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a definition of braided tensor product $\operatorname{M}\overline{\boxtimes}\operatorname{N}$ of von Neumann algebras equipped with an action of a quasi-triangular quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ (this includes the case when $\mathbb{G}$ is a Drinfeld double). It is a new von Neumann algebra which comes together with embeddings of $\operatorname{M},\operatorname{N}$ and the unique action of $\mathbb{G}$ for which embeddings are equivariant. More generally, we construct braided tensor product of von Neumann algebras equipped with actions of locally compact quantum groups linked by a bicharacter. We study several examples, in particular we show that crossed products can be realised as braided tensor products. We also show that one can take the braided tensor product $\vartheta_1\boxtimes\vartheta_2$ of normal, completely bounded maps which are equivariant, but this fails without the equivariance condition.</description>

      <title>Strange shadows of $\ell_p$-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a large deviations principle for orthogonal projections of the unit ball $\mathbb{B}_p^n$ of $\ell_p^n$ onto a random $k$-dimensional linear subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ as $n\to\infty$ in the case $2&lt;p\le \infty$ and for the intersection of $\mathbb{B}_p^n$ with a random $k$-dimensional subspace in the case $1\le p &lt;2$. The corresponding rate function is finite only on $L_q$-zonoids and their duals, respectively, and given in terms of the maximum entropy over suitable measures generating the $L_q$-zonoid, where $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1$. In particular, we obtain that the renormalized projections/sections almost surely tend to a $k$-dimensional Euclidean ball of certain radius. Moreover, we identify the asymptotic probability that the random orthogonal projection remains within a ball of smaller radius. As a byproduct we obtain an interesting inequality for the Gamma function.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Cotlar identities for groups acting on tree-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T_m$ be a noncommutative Fourier multiplier. In recent work, Mei and Ricard introduced a noncommutative analogue of Cotlar's identity in order to prove that certain multipliers are bounded on the non-commutative $L_p$-spaces of a free group. Here, we study Cotlar type identities in full generality, giving a closed characterization for them in terms of $m$:
  \[
  \big( m(g h) - m(g) \big) \, \big( m(g^{-1}) - m(h) \big) = 0,
  \; \forall g \in \mathrm{G} \setminus \{e\}, h \in \mathrm{G}.
  \] We manage to prove, using a geometric argument, that if $X$ is a tree -- or more generally an $\mathbb{R}$-tree -- on which $\mathrm{G}$ acts and $m$ lifts to a function $\widetilde{m}: X \to \mathbb{C}$ that is constant on the connected subsets of $X \setminus \{x_0\}$, then $m$ satisfies Cotlar's identity and thus $T_m$ is bounded in $L_p$ for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. This result establishes a new connection between groups actions on $\mathbb{R}$-trees and Fourier multipliers. We show that $m$ is trivial when the action has global fixed points. This machinery allows us to simultaneously generalize the free group transforms of Mei and Ricard and the theory of Hilbert transforms in left-orderable groups, which follows from Arveson's subdiagonal algebras. Using Bass-Serre theory, we construct new examples of Fourier multipliers in groups. Those include new families like Baumslag-Solitar groups. We also show that a natural Hilbert transform in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ satisfies Cotlar's identity when restricted to the Bianchi group $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-1}])$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12298v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to a question due to M. Megrelishvili, and show that for a locally compact group $G$ we have $\operatorname{Tame}(L^{1}(G)) = \operatorname{Tame}(G)$, which means that a functional is tame over $L^{1}(G)$ if and only if it is tame as a function over $G$. In fact, it is proven that for every norm-saturated, convex vector bornology on $\operatorname{RUC}_{b}(G)$, being small as a function and as a functional is the same. This proves that $\operatorname{Asp}(L^{1}(G)) = \operatorname{Asp}(G)$ and reaffirms a well-known, similar result which states that $\operatorname{WAP}(G) = \operatorname{WAP}(L^{1}(G))$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sz\'asz inequality is a classical result that provides a bound for polynomials with zeros in the upper half of the complex plane, expressed in terms of their low-order coefficients. Generalizations of this result to polynomials in several variables have been obtained by Borcea-Br\"and\'en and Knese. In this article, we discuss the Sz\'asz inequality in the context of polynomials with matrix coefficients or matrix variables. In the latter case, the estimation provided by the Sz\'asz-type inequality can be sharper than that offered by the von Neumann inequality. As a byproduct, we improve the scalar Sz\'asz inequality by relaxing the assumption regarding the location of zeros.</description>

      <title>Extension of Norm One Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through the establishment of several extension theorems, we provide explicit expressions for norm one projections and 1-complemented subspaces in the Hardy space $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ for $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, $p\neq 2$. Our characterization leads to two significant corollaries: first, all 1-complemented subspaces of $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ with dimension greater than one are isometric to $H^p(\mathbb{T})$; second, all norm one projections on $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ are restrictions of norm one projections on $L^p(\mathbb{T})$ that leave $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ invariant.
  The second corollary answers an open problem posed by P. Wojtaszczyk in 2003. Moreover, this is the first time that norm one projections and 1-complemented subspaces in an analytic function space have been completely understood.</description>

      <title>Compensated Integrability in bounded domains ; Applications to gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An accurate functional inequality for Div-BV positive symmetric tensors $A$ in a bounded domain $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ arises whenever the tangential part of the normal trace $\gamma_\nu A\sim A\vec\nu$ is a finite measure over $\partial U$. The proof involves an extension operator to a neighbourhood of $\bar U$. The resulting inequality depends upon the domain only through the $C^3$-regularity of $\partial U$, some constant involving the curvature and its first derivatives.This abstract statement applies to several models of Gas Dynamics (Euler system, Hard Spheres dynamics), as the boundary condition (slip, or reflection) tells us that $A\vec\nu$ is parallel to $\vec\nu$, where $A$ is the mass-momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Analysis and White Noise Calculus of Nonlinear Wave Equations with Application to Laser Propagation and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a large class of nonlinear stochastic wave equations that arise in laser generation models and models for propagation in random media in a unified mathematical framework. Continuous and pulse-wave propagation models, free electron laser generation models, as well as laser-plasma interaction models have been cast in a convenient and unified abstract framework as semilinear evolution equations in a Hilbert space to enable stochastic analysis. We formulate Ito calculus and white noise calculus methods of treating stochastic terms and prove existence and uniqueness of mild solutions.</description>

      <title>The Wehrl-type entropy conjecture for symmetric $SU(N)$ coherent states: cases of equality and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lieb and Solovej proved that, for the symmetric $SU(N)$ representations, the corresponding Wehrl-type entropy is minimized by symmetric coherent states. However, the uniqueness of the minimizers remained an open problem when $N\geq 3$. In this note we complete the proof of the Wehrl entropy conjecture for such representations, by showing that symmetric coherent states are, in fact, the only minimizers. We also provide an application to the maximum concentration of holomorphic polynomials and deduce a corresponding Faber-Krahn inequality. A sharp quantitative form of the bound by Lieb and Solovej is also proved.</description>
