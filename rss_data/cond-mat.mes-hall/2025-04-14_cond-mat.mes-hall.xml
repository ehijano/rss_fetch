      <title>Twist-Induced Effects on Weyl Pairs in Magnetized Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</description>

      <title>Tuning Charge Density Wave in the Transition from Magnetically Frustrated Conductor to Ferrimagnetic Insulator in Carbon Nanowire within Boron Nitride Nanotube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of exotic charge density wave (CDW) alongside ferrimagnetism materials opens exciting new possibilities for quantum switching, particularly in field-tuning CDW electronics. However, these two phenomena often compete and rely heavily on strong electronic correlations. While carbon nanowire arrays have been experimentally shown to exhibit ferromagnetism above 400 K, our research shows that encapsulating a linear carbon chain (LCC) within zigzag boron nitride nanotubes (BNT) induces a short-range CDW state under a competing effect of ferrimagnetism and magnetic frustrations. However, for this exotic feature to occur, the LCC needs to break the symmetry along the circular plane of the BNT. Then we utilize a Monte Carlo model to identify the optimal length of LCC@BNT to tackle its size effect, while also comparing the stability of chains provided by carbon nanotubes. The shorter LCC@BNT displays a more prominent long-range CDW pattern with a tunneling barrier of 2.3 eV on the Fermi surface, transitioning into an unconventional insulator. Meanwhile, magnetic frustrations disappear, and ferrimagnetism remains stable up to 280 K. Our discovery of ferrimagnetic CDW carbyne insulators, which function without conventional periodic lattice distortion, spin-orbit coupling, or complex d and f hybridization represents a groundbreaking shift in thinking, which demonstrates that such exotic properties are not exclusive to transition metal elements. We anticipate that spin fluctuations in LCC@BNT could enable fine-tuning of the CDW pattern, and applying an electric excitation of 2.3 eV triggers an abrupt insulator-to-conductor transition for quantum switching applications.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Berry curvature contributions to Hall current in $C_4K$ materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a new contribution to the conventional Hall effect that emerges in materials with $C_4K$ symmetry. This contribution originates from the modification of phase space density due to the Berry curvature, as we demonstrate using semiclassical equations of motion for band electrons. As an illustration, we build a minimal two-band tight-binding model with altermagnetic order that breaks $C_4$ and $K$ symmetries while preserving $C_4K$. The resulting Hall conductivity shows a square-root feature at the altermagnetic phase transition, which is due to the novel Berry curvature-driven contribution emerging below the critical temperature. This effect may offer a simple transport-based signature of an altermagnetic phase transition.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable electroresistance in a sliding ferroelectric tunnel junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fabricate and measure electrically-gated tunnel junctions in which the insulating barrier is a sliding van der Waals ferroelectric made from parallel-stacked bilayer hexagonal boron nitride and the electrodes are single-layer graphene. Despite the nominally-symmetric tunnel-junction structure, these devices can exhibit substantial electroresistance upon reversing the ferroelectric polarization. The magnitude and sign of tunneling electroresistance are tunable by bias and gate voltage. We show that this behavior can be understood within a simple tunneling model that takes into account the quantum capacitance of the graphene electrodes, so that the tunneling densities of states in the electrodes are separately modified as a function of bias and gate voltage.</description>

      <title>Tunable Magnon Polaritons via Eddy-Current-Induced Dissipation in Metallic-Banded YIG Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a robust method to dynamically tune magnon dissipation in yttrium iron garnet spheres by equipping a metallic band around the sphere's equator, enabling precise control over magnon-photon coupling states. The collective magnetization dynamics in the YIG sphere induce circular eddy currents in the metallic band, whose magnitude can be systematically varied by adjusting the angle between the metallic band plane and an external static magnetic field. This angular dependence yields a pronounced modulation of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth, facilitating seamless transitions between the Purcell and strong coupling regimes without altering photon cavity parameters. Systematic FMR and cavity spectroscopy measurements confirm that eddy-current-induced losses govern the primary mechanism behind the observed tunable damping. By achieving extensive periodic-angular dependence of magnon relaxation rate, we precisely control the magnon-photon coupling state, approaching the critical coupling condition. These results establish the YIG-metallic-band platform as a versatile and practical approach for engineering tunable magnon-polariton systems and advancing magnonic applications, including those exploring non-Hermitian magnonics.</description>

      <title>Controllable and Non-Dissipative Inertial Dynamics of Skyrmion in a Bosonic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been understood in the past a decade or two that the dynamics of spin or magnetization in ultrafast regime necessarily involves inertial term that reflects the reluctance to follow abrupt or sudden change in the spin or magnetization orientation. The role of inertial spin dynamics in governing the motion of Skyrmion, a topological spin texture, is elucidated. Using nonequilibrium Green's function Keldysh formalism, an equation of motion is derived in terms of collective coordinates for a Skyrmion coupled via a ''minimal coupling'' to a bath of harmonic oscillators of frequency $\omega$. A deterministic and non-dissipative dynamics equation of motion is obtained with an explicit mass term for the Skyrmion emerging due the coupling, even within rigid Skyrmion picture. This results in a cyclotronic motion of Skyrmion, with a frequency that can go ultrafast, depending on that of the oscillator. Controlling the oscillator frequency can therefore guide the Skyrmion dynamics. Our theory bridges inertial dynamics and topology in magnetism and opens a pathway to ultrafast control of topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermocouples: nonlocal conversion and control of heat in semiconductor nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale conductors are interesting for thermoelectrics because of their particular spectral features connecting separated heat and particle currents. Multiterminal devices in the quantum regime benefit from phase-coherent phenomena, which turns the thermoelectric effect nonlocal, and from tunable single-particle interactions. This way one can define quantum thermocouples which convert an injected heat current into useful power in an isothermal conductor, or work as refrigerators. Additionally, efficient heat management devices can be defined. We review recent theoretical and experimental progress in the research of multiterminal thermal and thermoelectric quantum transport leading to proposals of autonomous quantum heat engines and thermal devices.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised learning of non-Abelian multi-gap topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have successfully realized multi-band non-Abelian topological insulators with parity-time symmetry. Their topological classification transcends the conventional ten-fold classification, necessitating the use of non-Abelian groups, manifesting novel properties that cannot be described using integer topological invariants. The unique non-commutative multiplication of non-Abelian groups, along with the distinct topological classifications in the context of homotopy with or without a fixed base point, makes the identification of different non-Abelian topological phases more nuanced and challenging than in the Abelian case. In this work, we present an unsupervised learning method based on diffusion maps to classify non-Abelian multi-gap topological phases. The automatic adiabatic pathfinding process in our method can correctly sort the samples in the same phase even though they are not connected by adiabatic paths in the sample set. Most importantly, our method can deduce the multiplication table of the non-Abelian topological charges in a data-driven manner without requiring \textit{a priori} knowledge. Additionally, our algorithm can provide the correct classifications for the samples within both the homotopy with and without a fixed base point. Our results provide insights for future studies on non-Abelian phase studies using machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Stability diagram of layer-polarized quantum Hall states in twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the twisted trilayer graphene (tTLG) platform, the rich beating patterns between the three graphene layers give rise to a plethora of new length scales and reconstructed electronic bands arising from the emergent moir\'e and moir\'e-of-moir\'e superlattices. The co-existing lattices and superlattices interact and compete with each other to determine the overall transport properties of tTLG, the hierarchy of which can be electrostatically controlled by tuning the out-of-plane charge distribution or layer polarization. In this work, we measure the stability diagram of layer-polarized quantum Hall states in tTLG by systematically mapping out layer-specific Chern numbers in each layer, and intra- and interlayer Chern transitions as a function of displacement field D and total carrier density n. In contrast to twisted bilayer systems, the rich interplay between the three atomic layers gives rise to a complex layer-polarized stability diagram with unconventional transport features that evolve rapidly with electric and magnetic fields. The stability diagram quantitatively characterizes the interlayer screening and charge distribution in tTLG with implication of strong inter-atomic-layer Coulomb coupling. Our work provides comprehensive guidance and insights into predicting and controlling layer-polarization and interlayer transitions in tTLG, and for tuning the individual role and interactions of each participating constituent towards novel material properties.</description>

      <title>Photocurrent Nanoscopy of Quantum Hall Bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding nanoscale electronic and thermal transport of two-dimensional (2D) electron systems in the quantum Hall regime, particularly in the bulk insulating state, poses considerable challenges. One of the primary difficulties arises from the presence of chiral edge channels, whose transport behavior obscures the investigation of the insulating bulk. Using near-field (NF) optical and photocurrent (PC) nanoscopy, we probe real-space variations of the optical and thermal dynamics of graphene in the quantum Hall regime without relying on complex sample or electrode geometries. Near the charge neutrality point (CNP), we detect strong optical and photothermal signals from resonant inter-Landau level (LL) magnetoexciton excitations between the 0th and +-1st LLs, which gradually weaken with increasing doping due to Pauli blocking. Interestingly, at higher doping levels and full integer LL fillings, photothermal signals reappear across the entire sample over a ~10-micrometer scale, indicating unexpectedly long cooling lengths and nonlocal photothermal heating through the insulating bulk. This observation suggests thermal conductivity persists for the localized states even as electronic transport is suppressed - a clear violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. Our experiments provide novel insights into nanoscale thermal and electronic transport in incompressible 2D gases, highlighting the roles of magnetoexcitons and chiral edge states in the thermo-optoelectric dynamics of Dirac quantum Hall state.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric real topology of conduction and valence bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, it was believed that conduction and valence bands exhibit a symmetry: they possess opposite topological invariants (e.g., the Chern numbers of conduction and valence bands for the Chern insulator are $\pm C$). However, we present a counterexample: The second Stiefel-Whitney numbers for conduction and valence bands over the Klein bottle may be asymmetric, with one being nontrivial while the other trivial. Here, the Stiefel-Whitney classes are the characteristic classes for real Bloch functions under $PT$ symmetry with $(PT)^2=1$, and the Klein bottle is the momentum-space unit under the projective anti-commutation relation of the mirror reflection reversing $x$ and the translation along the $y$-direction. The asymmetry originates from the algebraic difference of real cohomology classes over Klein bottle and torus. This discovery is rooted in the fundation of topological band theory, and has the potential to fundamentally refresh our current understanding of topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research delves into the critical effects of magnetic interactions in low-dimensional systems, offering invaluable insights that deepen our comprehension of magnetic behavior at the nanoscale. By implementing this innovative approach, one can unequivocally identify two distinct magnetic states: demagnetizing and magnetizing. The resulting measurements significantly enhance our grasp of the magnetic dynamics within these nanostructures, paving the way for spin-wave excitations. To validate the effectiveness of this methodology, it was conducted rigorous numerical simulations on a diverse array of nanostructures, including one-dimensional nanowires and three-dimensional hexagonal arrays of nanowires. Each nanowire is precisely modeled as a chain of interacting ellipsoidal grains, illustrating the intricate nature of these magnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>Organic-Inorganic Polaritonics: Linking Frenkel and Wannier-Mott Excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, organic materials have emerged as promising candidates for a variety of light-harvesting applications ranging from the infrared to the visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Their enhanced excitonic binding energies and large transition dipole moments enable strong coupling with light, with some systems already reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime. In contrast, a wide range of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been extensively explored in the literature, exhibiting high exciton stability and strong electron-hole coupling due to reduced screening effects. In this Letter, we present a microscopic model describing the interaction of 2D materials and organic molecular aggregates in an optical cavity. We predict the formation of a hybrid Wannier-Mott-Frenkel exciton-polariton with an enhanced Rabi splitting, exceeding that of the pure organic cavity by several tens of meV. To elucidate this phenomenon, we examine a cavity with 2D tungsten sulfide and a cyanine dye, where this enhancement corresponds to a $5\%$ increase relative to the organic cavity. The complementary characteristics of Wannier-Mott and Frenkel excitons enable the formation of tunable polariton states that merge into a single hybrid state as a function of detuning, allowing for dual Rabi splitting mechanisms. This provides a promising platform for exploring quantum optical phenomena in both the strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes.</description>

      <title>Interface-Induced Stability of Nontrivial Topological Spin Textures: Unveiling Room-Temperature Hopfions and Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological spin configurations, such as soliton-like spin texture and Dirac electron assemblies, have emerged in recent years in both fundamental science and technological applications. Achieving stable topological spin textures at room-temperature is crucial for enabling these structures as long-range information carriers. However, their creation and manipulation processes have encountered difficulties due to multi-step field training techniques and competitive interactions. Thus, a spontaneous ground state for multi-dimensional topological spin textures is desirable, as skyrmions form swirling, hedgehog-like spin structures in two dimensions, while hopfions emerge as their twisted three-dimensional counterparts. Here, we report the first observation of robust and reproducible topological spin textures of hopfions and skyrmions observed at room temperature and in zero magnetic field, which are stabilized by geometric confinement and protected by interfacial magnetism in a ferromagnet/topological insulator/ferromagnet trilayer heterostructure. These skyrmion-hopfion configurations are directly observed at room temperature with Lorenz transmission electron microscopy. Using micromagnetic modelling, the experimental observations of hopfion-skyrmion assemblies are reproduced. Our model reveals a complete picture of how spontaneously organized skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings are controlled by surface electrons, uniaxial anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, all at ambient temperature. Our study provides evidence that topological chiral spin textures can facilitate the development of magnetically defined information carriers. These stable structures hold promise for ultralow-power and high-density information processing, paving the way for the next generation of topologically defined devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the perspective of symmetry-selective resonance of the $\Delta_1$ states in the Fe/MgO/ZnO/MgO/Fe heterostructures, offering a broad landscape to design magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) that yield a towering tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) up to $3.5\times10^4\%$ with the resistance area (RA) product dipping down to a minimum of $0.05~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$, while maintaining a nearly perfect (99\%) spin polarization. Our predictions are based on the self-consistent coupling of the non-equilibrium Green's function with density functional theory. We also present the charge current, spin current, and TMR with applied voltage of the Fe/MgO(3-layer)/ZnO(3-layer)/MgO(3-layer)/Fe MTJ, which offers a superior performance triad of TMR ($1.3\times10^4\%$), RA ($0.45~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$), and spin polarization (99\%) over a regular Fe/MgO(6-layer)/Fe based MTJ (TMR $\approx 3.4\times10^3\%$, RA $\approx 22~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$). We provide a comprehensive insight integrating the transmission eigenchannel, spectral density, and the band structure of the Fe contacts to establish the role of symmetry-selective resonance in the Fe/MgO/ZnO/MgO/Fe MTJ.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantum Capacitance of Rydberg Transitions of Surface Electrons on Liquid Helium via Microwave Frequency Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for probing the quantum capacitance associated with the Rydberg transition of surface electrons on liquid helium using RF reflectometry. Excitation to Rydberg states induces a redistribution of image charges on capacitively coupled electrodes, giving rise to a quantum capacitance. By applying frequency-modulated resonant microwaves to drive the Rydberg transition, we systematically measured a capacitance sensitivity of 0.38~aF/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. This level of sensitivity is sufficient to resolve the Rydberg transition of a single electron, providing a scalable pathway toward the implementation of qubit readout schemes based on surface electrons on helium.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear transport of Wigner solid phase surrounding the two-flux composite fermion liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the low temperature (T) transport properties of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in a high-mobility two-dimensional hole gas. According to the composite fermion (CF) model, FQH states stemming from a half-filled Landau level, specifically at filling factors ${\nu}=p/(2p+1) (p=\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3,...)$, can be associated with two-flux-attached CFs at the corresponding Lambda filling factor p. The zero-resistance minima and Hall plateaus of these states exhibit unusual temperature dependencies, characterized by rapid increases in width below a threshold temperature around 100 mK. Differential conductivity measurements from Corbino samples reveal that the regimes surrounding the CF liquid display clear nonlinear transport characteristics. This nonlinearity implies that each CF liquid is surrounded by CF solid phase composed of dilute CF excitations. Quantitatively, the applied electric field E influences the motion of CF solid in a way analogous to T, which is dubbed the "E-T duality". Our analysis indicates that this E-T duality is consistent with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless theory in two-dimensional phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Design Optimization of Flip FET Standard Cells with Dual-sided Pins for Ultimate Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we proposed a novel transistor architecture for 3D stacked FETs called Flip FET (FFET), featuring N/P transistors back-to-back stacked and dual-sided interconnects. With dual-sided power rails and signal tracks, FFET can achieve an aggressive 2.5T cell height. As a tradeoff, the complex structure and limited numbers of M0 tracks could limit the standard cell design. As a solution, multiple innovations were introduced and examined in this work. Based on an advanced node design rule, several unique building blocks in FFET such as drain merge (DM), gate merge (GM), field drain merge (FDM) and buried signal track (BST) were investigated. Other key design concepts of multi-row, split gate and dummy gate insertion (DG) were also carefully studied, delivering around 35.6% area reduction compared with 3T CFET. Furthermore, the symmetric design of FFET has unique superiority over CFET thanks to the separate N/P logic on two sides of the wafer and their connections using DM and GM. New routing scheme with dual-sided output pins on both wafer frontside (FS) and backside (BS) was proposed for the first time. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation on complex cell design, taking AOI22 as an example. New strategies were proposed and examined. The FDM design is identified as the best, outperforming the BST and dummy gate design by 1.93% and 5.13% for the transition delay.</description>

      <title>Topological exciton bands and many-body exciton phases in transition metal dichalcogenide trilayer heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a promising platform for realizing topological exciton phases. Here we propose that twisted TMD heterotrilayers WX$_2$/MX$_2$/WX$_2$ with layer symmetry represents a realistic system for realizing topological exciton bands and interesting many-body excitonic phases, simply by tuning the twist angle. These symmetric heterotrilayers form a type-II band alignment, where the electrons are confined in the middle layer and holes are distributed among the outer two layers, for the lowest energy excitons. The outer two layers are then rotated at different centers by opposite angles, forming a helical structure. Interlayer excitons with opposite dipoles are hybridized by the coupling between outer two layers, resulting in topological moir\'e exciton bands. Furthermore, by constructing a three-orbital tight-binding model, we map the many-body phase diagram of interacting dipolar and quadrupolar excitons at different twist angles and exciton densities and reveal the existence of sublattice-dependent staggered superfluid and Mott insulator phases. The recent experimental observation of quadrupolar excitons in symmetric heterotrilayers brings the intriguing phases predicted in this study within immediate experimental reach.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Neel orders in Layered Topological Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the two-dimensional limit, the interplay between Neel order and band topology in van der Waals topological antiferromagnets can give rise to novel quantum phenomena in the quantum anomalous Hall state, including the cascaded quantum phase transition and spin-modulation effect. However, due to the absence of net magnetization in antiferromagnets, probing the energetically degenerate Neel orders has long remained a significant challenge. Inspired by recent advances in realizing the quantum anomalous Hall effect in AlOx-capped layered topological antiferromagnet MnBi2Te4, we demonstrate deterministic control over the Neel order through surface anisotropy engineering enabled by the AlOx capping layer. By tuning the surface anisotropy, we uncover paritydependent symmetry breaking states that manifest as distinct odd-even boundary architectures, including 180 degree domain walls or continuous spin structures. Comparative studies between AlOx-capped and pristine odd-layer MnBi2Te4 flakes using domain-resolved magnetic force microscopy reveal pronounced differences in coercivity and magnetization-reversal dynamics. Notably, an unconventional giant exchange bias, which arises from perpendicular magnetic anisotropy rather than traditional interface pinning mechanisms, is observed for the first time. Our findings establish a pathway for manipulating Neel order through surface modification in A-type antiferromagnets, offering new opportunities for spintronic devices and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry from the Moyal product: quantum kinetic equation and non-linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically derive the dissipationless quantum kinetic equation for a multi-band free fermionic system with U(1) symmetry. Using the Moyal product formalism, we fully band-diagonalize the dynamics. Expanding to the second order in gradients, which is beyond the semiclassical limit, we give a complete analysis of the band-resolved thermodynamics and transport properties, especially those arising from the quantum geometric tensor. We apply our framework to a Bloch band theory under electric fields near equilibrium and find the linear and nonlinear transport coefficients. We also obtain the dynamical density-density response functions in the metallic case, including quantum metric corrections. Our results and approach can be applied very generally to multi-band problems even in situations with spatially varying Hamiltonians and distributions.</description>

      <title>AC Current-Driven Magnetization Switching and Nonlinear Hall Rectification in a Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque arising from the spin-orbit-coupled surface states of topological insulators enables current-induced control of magnetization with high efficiency. Here, alternating-current (AC) driven magnetization reversal is demonstrated in a semi-magnetic topological insulator (Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Bi,Sb)2Te3, facilitated by a low threshold current density of 1.5x10^9 A/m^2. Time-domain Hall voltage measurements using an oscilloscope reveal a strongly nonlinear and nonreciprocal Hall response during the magnetization reversal process. Fourier analysis of the time-varying Hall voltage identifies higher-harmonic signals and a rectified direct-current (DC) component, highlighting the complex interplay among the applied current, external magnetic field, and magnetization dynamics. Furthermore, a hysteretic behavior in the current-voltage characteristics gives rise to frequency mixing under dual-frequency excitation. This effect, distinct from conventional polynomial-based nonlinearities, allows for selective extraction of specific frequency components. The results demonstrate that AC excitation can not only switch magnetization efficiently but also induce tunable nonlinear responses, offering a new pathway for multifunctional spintronic devices with potential applications in energy-efficient memory, signal processing, and frequency conversion.</description>

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO2) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO2 interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in spin echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin depolarization with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Transition-State Searches in Zeolite Nanopores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zeolites are important for industrial catalytic processes involving organic molecules. Understanding molecular reaction mechanisms within the confined nanoporous environment can guide the selection of pore topologies, material compositions, and process conditions to maximize activity and selectivity. However, experimental mechanistic studies are time- and resource-intensive, and traditional molecular simulations rely heavily on expert intuition and hand manipulation of chemical structures, resulting in poor scalability.
  Here, we present an automated computational pipeline for locating transition states (TS) in nanopores and exploring reaction energy landscapes of complex organic transformations in pores. Starting from the molecular structure of potential reactant and products, the Pore Transition State finder (PoTS) locates gas-phase transition states using DFT, docks them in favorable orientations near active sites in nanopores, and leverages the gas-phase reaction mode to seed condensed-phase DFT calculations using the dimer method. The approach sidesteps tedious manipulations, increases the success rate of TS searches, and eliminates the need for long path-following calculations.
  This work presents the largest ensemble of zeolite-confined transition states computed at the DFT level to date, enabling rigorous analysis of mechanistic trends across frameworks, reactions, and reactant types. We demonstrate the applicability of PoTS by analyzing 644 individual reaction steps for transalkylation of diethylbenzene in BOG, IWV, UTL and FAU zeolites, and in skeletal isomerization of 162 individual reaction steps in BEA, FER, FAU, MFI and MOR zeolites finding good experimental agreement in both cases. Lastly, we propose a path to address the limitations we observe regarding unsuccessful TS searches and insufficient theory in other reactions, like alkene cracking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin defects in solids offer promising platforms for quantum sensing and memory due to their long coherence times and compatibility with quantum networks. Here, we integrate a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond with scanning probe microscopy to discover, read out, and spatially map arbitrary spin-based quantum sensors at the nanoscale. Using the boron vacancy (V$_B^-$) center in hexagonal boron nitride$\unicode{x2013}$an emerging two-dimensional spin system$\unicode{x2013}$as a model, we detect its electron spin resonance through changes in the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) of a nearby NV center, without requiring direct optical excitation or readout of the V$_B^-$ fluorescence. Cross-relaxation between the NV and V$_B^-$ ensembles results in a pronounced NV $T_1$ reduction, enabling nanoscale mapping of spin defect distributions beyond the optical diffraction limit. This approach highlights NV centers as versatile quantum probes for characterizing spin systems, including those emitting at wavelengths beyond the range of silicon-based detectors. Our results open a pathway to hybrid quantum architectures where sensing and readout qubits are decoupled, facilitating the discovery of otherwise inaccessible quantum defects for advanced sensing and quantum networking.</description>

      <title>Dissipation induced localization-delocalization transition in a flat band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between dissipation and localization in quantum systems has garnered significant attention due to its potential to manipulate transport properties and induce phase transitions. In this work, we explore the dissipation-induced extended-localized transition in a flat band model, where the system's asymptotic state can be controlled by tailored dissipative operators. By analyzing the steady-state density matrix and dissipative dynamics, we demonstrate that dissipation is able to drive the system to states dominated by either extended or localized modes, irrespective of the initial conditions. The control mechanism relies on the phase properties of the dissipative operators, which selectively favor specific eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Our findings reveal that dissipation can be harnessed to induce transitions between extended and localized phases, offering a novel approach to manipulate quantum transport in flat band systems. This work not only deepens our understanding of dissipation-induced phenomena in flat band systems but also provides a new avenue for controlling quantum states in open systems.</description>

      <title>Evaporative Refrigeration Effect in Evaporation and Condensation between Two Parallel Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is known that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the vapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the liquid-vapor interface. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on a quasi-continuum approach. Experimental evidence for this effect has been scarce so far. Here, we examine evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates, including the liquid films on both sides, by coupling the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum treatments in both liquid films. Our solution shows that the vapor phase temperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall temperature at the condensing surface, i.e., the evaporative refrigeration effect. Our work not only re-affirms the refrigeration effect, but clarifies that this effect is caused by two mechanisms. At the interface, the asymmetry in the distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules creates a cooling effect, which is the dominant mechanism. Additional cooling occurs within the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion similar to the Joule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial expansion is not an isenthalpic process. Our work will motivate future experiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential applications in air-conditioning and refrigeration.</description>

      <title>Strain Engineering of Magnetoresistance and Magnetic Anisotropy in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tailoring magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals magnetic materials is essential for advancing their integration into technological applications. In this regard, strain engineering has emerged as a powerful and versatile strategy to control magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here, we demonstrate that compressive biaxial strain significantly enhances the magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy of few-layer CrSBr flakes. Strain is efficiently transferred to the flakes from the thermal compression of a polymeric substrate upon cooling, as confirmed by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. This strain induces a remarkable increase in the magnetoresistance ratio and in the saturation fields required to align the magnetization of CrSBr along each of its three crystalographic directions, reaching a twofold enhancement along the magnetic easy axis. This enhancement is accompanied by a subtle reduction of the N\'eel temperature by ~10K. Our experimental results are fully supported by first-principles calculations, which link the observed effects to a strain-driven modification in interlayer exchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy energy. These findings establish strain engineering as a key tool for fine-tuning magnetotransport properties in 2D magnetic semiconductors, paving the way for implementation in spintronics and information storage devices.</description>

      <title>Topological $\pi/2$ modes in photonic waveguide arrays</title>

Abstract: Periodic driving is a powerful tool to generate exotic topological phases without static counterparts, such as the anomalous chiral edge modes from bulk bands with zero Chern number and topological $\pi$ modes exhibiting period-doubled dynamics. Recently, a new class of Floquet topological mode, namely the $\pi/2$ mode, which carries four-period periodicity and has potential applications in quantum computing, was proposed based on a square-root method and realized in an acoustic system. Here we propose a laser-written waveguide array lattice to realize topological $\pi/2$ modes in photonics. Our photonic model simulates a square-root periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and has a rich phase diagram allowing for the co-existence of conventional zero, $\pi$ modes, and the new $\pi/2$ modes. Through numerical simulations of the wave equation, we uncover the unique four-period evolution feature of the $\pi/2$ modes. Our model, which only contains four waveguides per unit cell and two driving steps, is easy to implement with current fabrication techniques and may find applications in quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Autonomous Microscopy for Scalable and Intelligent Characterization of 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterization of atomic-scale materials traditionally requires human experts with months to years of specialized training. Even for trained human operators, accurate and reliable characterization remains challenging when examining newly discovered materials such as two-dimensional (2D) structures. This bottleneck drives demand for fully autonomous experimentation systems capable of comprehending research objectives without requiring large training datasets. In this work, we present ATOMIC (Autonomous Technology for Optical Microscopy &amp; Intelligent Characterization), an end-to-end framework that integrates foundation models to enable fully autonomous, zero-shot characterization of 2D materials. Our system integrates the vision foundation model (i.e., Segment Anything Model), large language models (i.e., ChatGPT), unsupervised clustering, and topological analysis to automate microscope control, sample scanning, image segmentation, and intelligent analysis through prompt engineering, eliminating the need for additional training. When analyzing typical MoS2 samples, our approach achieves 99.7% segmentation accuracy for single layer identification, which is equivalent to that of human experts. In addition, the integrated model is able to detect grain boundary slits that are challenging to identify with human eyes. Furthermore, the system retains robust accuracy despite variable conditions including defocus, color temperature fluctuations, and exposure variations. It is applicable to a broad spectrum of common 2D materials-including graphene, MoS2, WSe2, SnSe-regardless of whether they were fabricated via chemical vapor deposition or mechanical exfoliation. This work represents the implementation of foundation models to achieve autonomous analysis, establishing a scalable and data-efficient characterization paradigm that fundamentally transforms the approach to nanoscale materials research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold atoms can adsorb to a surface with the emission of a single phonon when the binding energy is sufficiently small. The effects of phonon damping and adsorbent size on the adsorption rate in this quantum regime are studied using the multimode Rabi model. It is demonstrated that the adsorption rate can be either enhanced or suppressed relative to the Fermi golden rule rate, in analogy to cavity effects in the spontaneous emission rate in QED. A mesoscopic-sized adsorbent behaves as an acoustic cavity that enhances the adsorption rate when tuned to the adsorption transition frequency and suppresses the rate when detuned. This acoustic cavity effect occurs in the regime where the frequency spacing between vibrational modes exceeds the phonon linewidth.</description>

      <title>Magnon hydrodynamics in an atomically-thin ferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong interactions between particles can lead to emergent collective excitations. These phenomena have been extensively established in electronic systems, but are also expected to occur for gases of neutral particles like magnons, i.e. spin waves, in magnets. In a hydrodynamic regime where magnons are strongly interacting, they can form a slow collective density mode -- in analogy to sound waves in water -- with characteristic low-frequency signatures. While such a mode has been predicted in theory, its signatures have yet to be observed experimentally. In this work, we isolate exfoliated sheets of CrCl$_3$ where magnon interactions are strong, and develop a technique to measure its collective magnon dynamics via the quantum coherence of nearby Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We find that the thermal magnetic fluctuations generated by monolayer CrCl$_3$ exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence, whereby fluctuations increase upon decreasing temperature. Our analysis suggests that this anomalous trend is a consequence of the damping rate of a low-energy magnon sound mode which sharpens as magnon interactions increase with increasing temperature. By measuring the magnetic fluctuations emitted by thin multilayer CrCl$_{3}$ in the presence of a variable-frequency drive field, we observe spectroscopic evidence for this two-dimensional magnon sound mode.</description>

      <title>Topological Corner States in Bilayer and Trilayer Systems with Vertically Stacked Topological Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate bilayer and trilayer systems composed of topologically distinct, vertically stacked layers, forming topological heterostructures based on the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. We find that a topological phase transition induced by interlayer coupling significantly alters the number of corner states in these topological structures. Furthermore, we find that traditional nested Wilson loop analysis inaccurately classifies certain phases, leading us to evaluate multipole chiral numbers (MCNs) as a more appropriate topological invariant for this scenario. The MCNs not only enable accurate classification of topological phases but also directly correspond to the number of zero-energy corner states, effectively characterizing $\mathbb{Z}$-class HOTI phases. Our study proposes the novel concept of topological heterostructures, providing critical insights into the control of localized corner states within multilayer systems and expanding potential research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of semiconductor thin films that are only a few nanometers thick. In spite of intense research, the thickness-dependent resistivity or conductivity of semiconductor thin films is not understood at a fundamental physical level. We develop a theory based on quantum confinement which yields the dependence of the concentration of intrinsic carriers on the film thickness. The theory predicts that the resistivity $\rho$, in the 1-10 nm thickness range, increases exponentially as $\rho \sim \exp(const/L^{1/2})$ upon decreasing the film thickness $L$. This law is able to reproduce the remarkable increase in resistivity observed experimentally in Si thin films, whereas the effect of surface scattering (Fuchs-Sondheimer theory) alone cannot explain the data when the film thickness is lower than 10 nm.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the application of Madelung hydrodynamic models to study two-dimensional electron gases, with a focus on nonlocal plasmonics and nonlinear optics. We begin by reviewing the derivation of the Madelung equations. Using the Madelung equations in conjunction with Poisson's equation, we calculate the spectrum of magnetoplasmons and the magneto-optical conductivity in the electrostatic regime, incorporating nonlocal corrections due to the Fermi pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra.</description>

Abstract: The Berry phase-related nontrivial electronic band geometries can significantly influence bulk and edge plasmons resulting in their non-reciprocal propagation and opening new opportunities for plasmonics. In the present work, we extend the hydrodynamic framework to describe the scattering of plasmons in a Dirac electron fluid off a circular region with an induced nonzero anomalous Hall response, i.e. a Berry flux target. We demonstrate that the scattering has a giant asymmetry or skewness and exhibits a series of resonances. The latter appears due to a chiral non-topological trapped mode circulating the target. We discuss possible experimental realizations, including the surface of a topological insulator film and graphene irradiated by the circularly polarized beam.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the secondary low-energy electron emission induced by inelastic electron scattering from graphene and layered materials thereof. By applying a coincidence detection of the primary scattered and the emitted secondary electron we unravel pronounced resonance features otherwise overshadowed by the largely structureless secondary electron energy distribution. Supported by density functional theory calculations we show that these structures are the signature of prominent Feshbach resonances above the vacuum threshold which originate from interlayer states acting as a doorway state for electron emission. Remarkably, some of these doorway states open up only for samples with more than 5 layers.</description>

Abstract: The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Phononic Dressed States in a Nanomechanical System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) provide a platform for probing the quantum nature of mechanical motion in mesoscopic systems. This nature manifests most profoundly when the device vibrations are nonlinear and, currently, achieving vibrational nonlinearity at the single-phonon level is an active area of pursuit in quantum information science. Despite much effort, however, this has remained elusive. Here, we report the first observation of intrinsic mesoscopic vibrational dressed states. The requisite nonlinearity results from strong resonant coupling between an eigenmode of our NEMS resonator and a single, two-level system (TLS) that is intrinsic to the device material. We control the TLS in situ by varying mechanical strain, tuning it in and out of resonance with the NEMS mode. Varying the resonant drive and/or temperature allows controlled ascent of the nonequidistant energy ladder and reveals the energy multiplets of the hybridized system. Fluctuations of the TLS on and off resonance with the mode induces switching between dressed and bare states; this elucidates the complex quantum nature of TLS-like defects in mesoscopic systems. These quintessential quantum effects emerge directly from the intrinsic material properties of mechanical systems - without need for complex, external quantum circuits. Our work provides long-sought insight into mesoscopic dynamics and offers a new direction to harness nanomechanics for quantum measurements.</description>

Abstract: We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene with realistic Coulomb interaction using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the extended Hubbard model. Specifically, we analyze a model of an armchair hexagonal geometry comprising $42$ lattice sites, nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells with nearest-neighbor distance of $a = 50$ nm. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling where the ferromagnetic phase is further stabilized by Coulomb scattering terms. We determine effective Hubbard model parameters and identify the magnetic phase transition near $U/t \approx 60$.</description>

Abstract: We study the performance of quantum thermal machines in which the working fluid of the model is represented by a many-body quantum system that is periodically connected with external baths via local couplings. A formal characterization of the limit cycles of the set-up is presented in terms of the mixing properties of the quantum channel that describes the evolution of the fluid over a thermodynamic cycle. For the special case in which the system is a collection of spin 1/2 particles coupled via magnetization preserving Hamiltonians, a full characterization of the possible operational regimes (i.e., thermal engine, refrigerator, heater and thermal accelerator) is provided: in this context we show in fact that the different regimes only depend upon a limited number of parameters (essentially the ratios of the energy gaps associated with the local Hamiltonians of the parts of the network which are in direct thermal contact with the baths).</description>

Abstract: Thermalization phenomena, while ubiquitous in quantum systems, have traditionally been viewed as obstacles to be mitigated. In this study, we demonstrate the ability, instead, to harness thermalization to dynamically engineer and stabilize structured quantum states in a mesoscopically large ensemble of spins. Specifically, we showcase the capacity to generate, control, stabilize, and read out 'shell-like' spin texture with interacting $ {}^{ 13}\mathrm{C}$ nuclear spins in diamond, wherein spins are polarized oppositely on either side of a critical radius. The texture spans several nanometers and encompasses many hundred spins. We capitalize on the thermalization process to impose a quasi-equilibrium upon the generated texture; as a result, it is highly stable, immune to spin diffusion, and endures over multiple-minute long periods -- over a million times longer than the intrinsic interaction scale of the spins. Additionally, the texture is created and interrogated without locally controlling or probing the nuclear spins. These features are accomplished using an electron spin as a nanoscale injector of spin polarization, and employing it as a source of spatially varying dissipation, allowing for serial readout of the emergent spin texture. Long-time stabilization is achieved via prethermalization to a Floquet-induced Hamiltonian under the electronic gradient field. Our work presents a new approach to robust nanoscale spin state engineering and paves the way for new applications in quantum simulation, quantum information science, and nanoscale imaging.</description>

      <title>Collective quantum enhancement in critical quantum sensing</title>

Abstract: Critical systems represent a valuable resource in quantum sensing and metrology. Critical quantum sensing (CQS) protocols can be realized using finite-component phase transitions, where criticality arises from the rescaling of system parameters rather than the thermodynamic limit. Here, we show that a collective quantum advantage can be achieved in a multipartite CQS protocol using a chain of parametrically coupled critical resonators in the weak-nonlinearity limit. We derive analytical solutions for the low-energy spectrum of this unconventional quantum many-body system, which is composed of locally critical elements. We then assess the scaling of the quantum Fisher information with respect to fundamental resources. We demonstrate that the coupled chain outperforms an equivalent ensemble of independent critical sensors, achieving quadratic scaling in the number of resonators. Finally, we show that even with finite Kerr nonlinearity or Markovian dissipation, the critical chain retains its advantage, making it relevant for implementing quantum sensors with current microwave superconducting technologies.</description>

      <title>Low-energy critical behavior in two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals driven by fermion-fermion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07126v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.</description>

      <title>Thermal quantum information capacity in a topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal effects in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (SSH) topological insulator are studied. Particularly, we focus on quantum information processing (QIP) capacity for thermal ensembles. To evaluate QIP an optimized quantum Fisher information (OQFI) is introduced as a quantifier of entanglement and topological phases are calculated by a definition in real space for the electric polarization of mixture states. For the thermal ensemble, there is a relationship between the Fisher metric and the electric polarization in such a way that in the topological region, there is more entanglement, therefore, these generate more robustness and protection in the quantum information due to thermal effects. Also, long-range hopping effects are studied and it is found that in this case, the OQFI captures these topological phase transitions in the limit of low temperature by this formalism in real space.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model via Krylov spread complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with an imaginary chemical potential via Krylov spread complexity and Krylov fidelity. The spread witnesses the $\mathcal{PT}$-transition for the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum of the SSH Hamiltonian, where the spectrum goes from purely real to complex (oscillatory dynamics to damped oscillations). In addition, it also witnesses the transition occurring in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, where the spectrum goes from complex to purely imaginary (damped oscillations to sheer decay). For a purely imaginary spectrum, the Krylov spread fidelity, which measures how the time-dependent spread reaches its stationary state value, serves as a probe of previously undetected dynamical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Otto engine mimicking Carnot near pseudotransitions in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional extended Hubbard model (EHM) in the atomic limit has recently been found to exhibit a curious thermal pseudo-transition behavior, which closely resembles first and second-order thermal phase transitions. This phenomenon, occurring at half-filling, is influenced by the quantum phase transition between the alternating pair (AP) and paramagnetic (PM) phases at zero temperature. In this study, we leverage this anomalous behavior to investigate the performance of quantum many-body machines, using the EHM as the working substance. Our analysis reveals that the quantum Otto engine, when operating in the anomalous region, closely mimics the ideal Carnot engine. In this region, both the work output and thermal efficiency of the Otto engine increase, approaching the performance of a Carnot engine. This highlights the potential of many-body systems, such as the EHM, in enhancing quantum thermodynamic performance. Our findings demonstrate that, although the second law of thermodynamics prevents engines from surpassing Carnot efficiency, the Otto engine can operate remarkably close to this limit in the anomalous region, offering insights into new directions for future research on quantum thermodynamic cycles and working substances.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Entanglement Generation Protocols for Superconducting Qubits with Impedance-Matched FBAR Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $&gt;90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Ground State Energy of He molecule Using a Four-Qubit Photonic Processor with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the properties and interactions of materials, and determining the ground state energies is one of the important challenges in quantum chemistry, materials science, and quantum mechanics, where quantum computing can play an important role for studying the properties of materials. In this study, we have explored the quantum processor application to compute the He molecule ground state energy which utilizes the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In here, we have implemented VQE on a state-of-the-art quantum processor, optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit to minimize the energy expectation value of the He molecule's Hamiltonian on the four qubits processor. The obtained results of this work show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to classical computational methods, such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, which demonstrate the compute potential of quantum algorithms in quantum many-body problems. Thus, these results demonstrate the advantages of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy in simulations of molecular and material properties, and pave the way for future applications in more complex systems. This work highlights the potential of quantum processors in the fields of quantum chemistry, computational physics, and data science.</description>
