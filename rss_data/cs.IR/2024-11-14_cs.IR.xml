      <title>A Large-Scale Study of Relevance Assessments with Large Language Models: An Initial Look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of large language models to provide relevance assessments presents exciting opportunities to advance information retrieval, natural language processing, and beyond, but to date many unknowns remain. This paper reports on the results of a large-scale evaluation (the TREC 2024 RAG Track) where four different relevance assessment approaches were deployed in situ: the "standard" fully manual process that NIST has implemented for decades and three different alternatives that take advantage of LLMs to different extents using the open-source UMBRELA tool. This setup allows us to correlate system rankings induced by the different approaches to characterize tradeoffs between cost and quality. We find that in terms of nDCG@20, nDCG@100, and Recall@100, system rankings induced by automatically generated relevance assessments from UMBRELA correlate highly with those induced by fully manual assessments across a diverse set of 77 runs from 19 teams. Our results suggest that automatically generated UMBRELA judgments can replace fully manual judgments to accurately capture run-level effectiveness. Surprisingly, we find that LLM assistance does not appear to increase correlation with fully manual assessments, suggesting that costs associated with human-in-the-loop processes do not bring obvious tangible benefits. Overall, human assessors appear to be stricter than UMBRELA in applying relevance criteria. Our work validates the use of LLMs in academic TREC-style evaluations and provides the foundation for future studies.</description>

      <title>Neural Corrective Machine Unranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning in neural information retrieval (IR) systems requires removing specific data whilst maintaining model performance. Applying existing machine unlearning methods to IR may compromise retrieval effectiveness or inadvertently expose unlearning actions due to the removal of particular items from the retrieved results presented to users. We formalise corrective unranking, which extends machine unlearning in (neural) IR context by integrating substitute documents to preserve ranking integrity, and propose a novel teacher-student framework, Corrective unRanking Distillation (CuRD), for this task. CuRD (1) facilitates forgetting by adjusting the (trained) neural IR model such that its output relevance scores of to-be-forgotten samples mimic those of low-ranking, non-retrievable samples; (2) enables correction by fine-tuning the relevance scores for the substitute samples to match those of corresponding to-be-forgotten samples closely; (3) seeks to preserve performance on samples that are not targeted for forgetting. We evaluate CuRD on four neural IR models (BERTcat, BERTdot, ColBERT, PARADE) using MS MARCO and TREC CAR datasets. Experiments with forget set sizes from 1 % and 20 % of the training dataset demonstrate that CuRD outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in terms of forgetting and correction while maintaining model retention and generalisation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Rethinking negative sampling in content-based news recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: News recommender systems are hindered by the brief lifespan of articles, as they undergo rapid relevance decay. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of content-based neural techniques in tackling this problem. However, these models often involve complex neural architectures and often lack consideration for negative examples. In this study, we posit that the careful sampling of negative examples has a big impact on the model's outcome. We devise a negative sampling technique that not only improves the accuracy of the model but also facilitates the decentralization of the recommendation system. The experimental results obtained using the MIND dataset demonstrate that the accuracy of the method under consideration can compete with that of State-of-the-Art models. The utilization of the sampling technique is essential in reducing model complexity and accelerating the training process, while maintaining a high level of accuracy. Finally, we discuss how decentralized models can help improve privacy and scalability.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multimodal Query Representation via Visual Dialogues for End-to-End Knowledge Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval systems often rely on disjointed models for image comprehension, such as object detectors and caption generators, leading to cumbersome implementations and training processes. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end retrieval system, Ret-XKnow, to endow a text retriever with the ability to understand multimodal queries via dynamic modality interaction. Ret-XKnow leverages a partial convolution mechanism to focus on visual information relevant to the given textual query, thereby enhancing multimodal query representations. To effectively learn multimodal interaction, we also introduce the Visual Dialogue-to-Retrieval (ViD2R) dataset automatically constructed from visual dialogue datasets. Our dataset construction process ensures that the dialogues are transformed into suitable information retrieval tasks using a text retriever. We demonstrate that our approach not only significantly improves retrieval performance in zero-shot settings but also achieves substantial improvements in fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available: https://github.com/yeongjoonJu/Ret_XKnow.</description>

      <title>Scholarly Wikidata: Population and Exploration of Conference Data in Wikidata using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several initiatives have been undertaken to conceptually model the domain of scholarly data using ontologies and to create respective Knowledge Graphs. Yet, the full potential seems unleashed, as automated means for automatic population of said ontologies are lacking, and respective initiatives from the Semantic Web community are not necessarily connected: we propose to make scholarly data more sustainably accessible by leveraging Wikidata's infrastructure and automating its population in a sustainable manner through LLMs by tapping into unstructured sources like conference Web sites and proceedings texts as well as already existing structured conference datasets. While an initial analysis shows that Semantic Web conferences are only minimally represented in Wikidata, we argue that our methodology can help to populate, evolve and maintain scholarly data as a community within Wikidata. Our main contributions include (a) an analysis of ontologies for representing scholarly data to identify gaps and relevant entities/properties in Wikidata, (b) semi-automated extraction -- requiring (minimal) manual validation -- of conference metadata (e.g., acceptance rates, organizer roles, programme committee members, best paper awards, keynotes, and sponsors) from websites and proceedings texts using LLMs. Finally, we discuss (c) extensions to visualization tools in the Wikidata context for data exploration of the generated scholarly data. Our study focuses on data from 105 Semantic Web-related conferences and extends/adds more than 6000 entities in Wikidata. It is important to note that the method can be more generally applicable beyond Semantic Web-related conferences for enhancing Wikidata's utility as a comprehensive scholarly resource.

      <title>Feature Interaction Fusion Self-Distillation Network For CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction plays a vital role in recommender systems, online advertising, and search engines. Most of the current approaches model feature interactions through stacked or parallel structures, with some employing knowledge distillation for model compression. However, we observe some limitations with these approaches: (1) In parallel structure models, the explicit and implicit components are executed independently and simultaneously, which leads to insufficient information sharing within the feature set. (2) The introduction of knowledge distillation technology brings about the problems of complex teacher-student framework design and low knowledge transfer efficiency. (3) The dataset and the process of constructing high-order feature interactions contain significant noise, which limits the model's effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose FSDNet, a CTR prediction framework incorporating a plug-and-play fusion self-distillation module. Specifically, FSDNet forms connections between explicit and implicit feature interactions at each layer, enhancing the sharing of information between different features. The deepest fusion layer is then used as the teacher model, utilizing self-distillation to guide the training of shallow layers. Empirical evaluation across four benchmark datasets validates the framework's efficacy and generalization capabilities. The code is available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FSDNet.</description>

      <title>Explainable Enrichment-Driven GrAph Reasoner (EDGAR) for Large Knowledge Graphs with Applications in Drug Repurposing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) represent connections and relationships between real-world entities. We propose a link prediction framework for KGs named Enrichment-Driven GrAph Reasoner (EDGAR), which infers new edges by mining entity-local rules. This approach leverages enrichment analysis, a well-established statistical method used to identify mechanisms common to sets of differentially expressed genes. EDGAR's inference results are inherently explainable and rankable, with p-values indicating the statistical significance of each enrichment-based rule.
  We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on a large-scale biomedical KG, ROBOKOP, focusing on drug repurposing for Alzheimer disease (AD) as a case study. Initially, we extracted 14 known drugs from the KG and identified 20 contextual biomarkers through enrichment analysis, revealing functional pathways relevant to shared drug efficacy for AD. Subsequently, using the top 1000 enrichment results, our system identified 1246 additional drug candidates for AD treatment. The top 10 candidates were validated using evidence from medical literature.
  EDGAR is deployed within ROBOKOP, complete with a web user interface. This is the first study to apply enrichment analysis to large graph completion and drug repurposing.</description>

      <title>DM4Steal: Diffusion Model For Link Stealing Attack On Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph has become increasingly integral to the advancement of recommendation systems, particularly with the fast development of graph neural network(GNN). By exploring the virtue of rich node features and link information, GNN is designed to provide personalized and accurate suggestions. Meanwhile, the privacy leakage of GNN in such contexts has also captured special attention. Prior work has revealed that a malicious user can utilize auxiliary knowledge to extract sensitive link data of the target graph, integral to recommendation systems, via the decision made by the target GNN model. This poses a significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of data used in recommendation system. Though important, previous works on GNN's privacy leakage are still challenged in three aspects, i.e., limited stealing attack scenarios, sub-optimal attack performance, and adaptation against defense. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion model based link stealing attack, named DM4Steal. It differs previous work from three critical aspects. (i) Generality: aiming at six attack scenarios with limited auxiliary knowledge, we propose a novel training strategy for diffusion models so that DM4Steal is transferable to diverse attack scenarios. (ii) Effectiveness: benefiting from the retention of semantic structure in the diffusion model during the training process, DM4Steal is capable to learn the precise topology of the target graph through the GNN decision process. (iii) Adaptation: when GNN is defensive (e.g., DP, Dropout), DM4Steal relies on the stability that comes from sampling the score model multiple times to keep performance degradation to a minimum, thus DM4Steal implements successful adaptive attack on defensive GNN.</description>

      <title>Query Optimization for Parametric Knowledge Refinement in Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Extract-Refine-Retrieve-Read (ERRR) framework, a novel approach designed to bridge the pre-retrieval information gap in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through query optimization tailored to meet the specific knowledge requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike conventional query optimization techniques used in RAG, the ERRR framework begins by extracting parametric knowledge from LLMs, followed by using a specialized query optimizer for refining these queries. This process ensures the retrieval of only the most pertinent information essential for generating accurate responses. Moreover, to enhance flexibility and reduce computational costs, we propose a trainable scheme for our pipeline that utilizes a smaller, tunable model as the query optimizer, which is refined through knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. Our evaluations on various question-answering (QA) datasets and with different retrieval systems show that ERRR consistently outperforms existing baselines, proving to be a versatile and cost-effective module for improving the utility and accuracy of RAG systems.</description>
