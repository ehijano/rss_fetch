      <title>Domain Structure and Interface Control of Mechanical Stiffness in Sustainable Cellulose Bio-nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renewable and biodegradable plastics derived from soy protein isolate (SPI) offer a promising alternative to conventional petroleum-based plastics, particularly for film-grade bioplastics applications such as plastic bags. However, even with reinforcement from cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), their mechanical properties including stiffness lag behind those of petroleum-based plastics. To identify pathways for improving CNC-reinforced SPI composites, we studied stiffening mechanisms by interpreting experimental data using homogenization models that accounted for CNC agglomeration and the formation of CNC/SPI interphases. To model effects of surface modification of CNCs with polydopamine (polyDOPA), we incorporated two key mechanisms: enhanced CNC dispersion and modified CNC-SPI interfacial interactions. Models accounted for interphases surrounding CNCs, arising from physicochemical interactions with the polyDOPA-modified CNC surfaces. Consistent wih experimental observations of polyDOPA modification enhancing mechanical properties through both increased spatial distribution of CNCs and matrix-filler interactions, results demonstrated that improved dispersion and interfacial bonding contribute to increased composite stiffness. Results highlight the potential of biodegradable CNC/SPI bio-nanocomposites as sustainable plastic alternatives, and suggest pathways for further enhancing their mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Fool's gold: ligand-receptor interactions and the origins of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of life is a question that continues to intrigue scientists across disciplines. One theory - the iron-sulphur theory - suggests that reactions essential to the synthesis of biological materials got their catalytic 'spark' from mineral surfaces such as iron pyrite, commonly known as fool's gold. Additionally, the binding affinity of the ligands synthesised in this 'surface metabolism' acted as an early version of natural selection: more strongly-binding ligands were accumulated into further autocatalytic reactions and the aggregation of complex biological materials. Ligand-receptor binding is thus fundamental to the origins of life. In this paper, we use the iron-sulphur theory as a lens through which to review ligand-receptor interactions as they are more commonly understood today. In particular we focus on the electron tunnelling theory of receptor activation that has emerged from research into quantum biology. We revisit criticism against this theory, particularly the lack of evidence for electron transfer in receptors, to see what insights might be offered by ligand-receptor interactions mediated by iron pyrite at the origins of life. What emerges from this comparison is the central importance of redox activity in receptors, in particular with respect to the recurring presence of the disulphide bond. While the paper is a speculative exercise, we conclude that conductivity in biomolecules, particularly the selective conductivity conferred by appropriate ligand-receptor binding, is a powerful tool for understanding diverse phenomena such as pharmacological potency and viral infection. As such it deserves further investigation.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Biophysical T Cell Receptor Co-specificity Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The biophysical interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) and its ligands determine the specificity of the cellular immune response. However, the immense diversity of receptors and ligands has made it challenging to discover generalizable rules across the distinct binding affinity landscapes created by different ligands. Here, we present an optimization framework for discovering biophysical rules that predict whether TCRs share specificity to a ligand. Applying this framework to TCRs associated with a collection of SARS-CoV-2 peptides we establish how co-specificity depends on the type and position of amino-acid differences between receptors. We also demonstrate that the inferred rules generalize to ligands not seen during training. Our analysis reveals that matching of steric properties between substituted amino acids is important for receptor co-specificity, in contrast with the hydrophobic properties that more prominently determine evolutionary substitutability. We furthermore find that positions not in direct contact with the peptide still significantly impact specificity. These findings highlight the potential for data-driven approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning the specificity of adaptive immune responses.</description>

      <title>Combined selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) and full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) for in vivo imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), also known as light sheet fluorescence microscopy, provides high specificity through fluorescence labeling. However, it lacks complementary structural information from the surrounding context, which is essential for the comprehensive analysis of biological samples. Here, we present a high-resolution, multimodal imaging system that integrates SPIM with full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT), without requiring modifications to the existing SPIM setup. Both SPIM and FF-OCT offer low phototoxicity and intrinsic optical sectioning, making them well-suited for in vivo imaging. Their shared detection path enables seamless and efficient co-registration of fluorescence and structural data. We demonstrate the functionality of this combined system by performing in vivo imaging of zebrafish larvae.</description>

      <title>Predicting Mesoscopic Larmor Frequency Shifts in White Matter with Diffusion MRI -- A Monte-Carlo Study in axonal phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to validate if MRI can measure anisotropic mesoscopic Larmor frequency shifts from white matter axonal microstructure relative to the B0 direction and if dMRI can estimate this anisotropy. Recent models describe how mesoscopic Larmor frequency shifts depend on induced magnetic fields by axons, described by an orientation distribution function. Using Monte-Carlo simulations of MRI signals in mesoscopic white matter axon substrates, we show MRI can estimate this mesoscopic frequency shift and dMRI can estimate its orientation dependence.</description>
