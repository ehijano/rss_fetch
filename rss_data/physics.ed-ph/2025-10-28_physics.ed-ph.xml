      <title>UC2-ESP: A General-Purpose Framework for Open-Source Microscopy Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building the optical setup for investigating biological questions comes with challenges. A major such challenge is setting up and synchronizing the control of multiple hardware components such as stages, cameras and lasers. With UC2-ESP we present a compact electronics system powered by the ESP32 microcontroller, designed to provide general-purpose control for various components in microscopy setups. Our system can interface with stepper motors, directed current (DC) motors, lasers (transistor-transistor logics, TTL or pulse width modulation, PWM), light emitting diodes (LEDs), and analog voltage outputs (galvo mirrors, led current control), allowing precise control over microscopy hardware. The platform is highly flexible, supporting custom pin configurations and multiple communication interfaces such as Bluetooth, universal serial bus (USB-serial), and HTTP via a built-in Webserver. A PlayStation controller can be used for haptic hardware manipulation, while commands are transmitted in a human-readable JSON format to ensure modularity and extensibility. The firmware is designed to receive parameters and execute actions dynamically, supporting complex control loops such as motor homing, stage scanning and temperature regulation via integrated controllers. Furthermore, the system integrates seamlessly with ImSwitch as well as MicroManager and offers a browser-based control tool using Web Serial. This open-source firmware enables microscopy research groups to develop custom setups and expand functionality efficiently, at low cost and high flexibility.</description>

      <title>Creating a customisable Socratic AI physics tutor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores role engineering as an effective paradigm for customizing Large Language Models (LLMs) into specialized AI tutors for physics education. We demonstrate this methodology by designing a Socratic physics problem-solving tutor using Google's Gemini Gems feature, defining its pedagogical behavior through a detailed 'script' that specifies its role and persona. We present two illustrative use cases: the first demonstrates the Gem's multimodal ability to analyze a student's hand-drawn force diagram and apply notational rules from a 'Knowledge' file; the second showcases its capacity to guide conceptual reasoning in electromagnetism using its pre-trained knowledge without using specific documents provided by the instructor. Our findings show that the 'role-engineered' Gem successfully facilitates a Socratic dialogue, in stark contrast to a standard Gemini model, which tends to immediately provide direct solutions. We conclude that role engineering is a pivotal and accessible method for educators to transform a general-purpose 'solution provider' into a reliable pedagogical tutor capable of engaging students in an active reflection process. This approach offers a powerful tool for both instructors and students, while also highlighting the importance of addressing the technology's inherent limitations, such as the potential for occasional inaccuracies.</description>
