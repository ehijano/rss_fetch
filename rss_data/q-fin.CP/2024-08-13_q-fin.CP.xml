      <title>Stochastic Calculus for Option Pricing with Convex Duality, Logistic Model, and Numerical Examination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores the historical progression and theoretical constructs of financial mathematics, with an in-depth exploration of Stochastic Calculus as showcased in the Binomial Asset Pricing Model and the Continuous-Time Models. A comprehensive survey of stochastic calculus principles applied to option pricing is offered, highlighting insights from Peter Carr and Lorenzo Torricelli's ``Convex Duality in Continuous Option Pricing Models". This manuscript adopts techniques such as Monte-Carlo Simulation and machine learning algorithms to examine the propositions of Carr and Torricelli, drawing comparisons between the Logistic and Bachelier models. Additionally, it suggests directions for potential future research on option pricing methods.</description>

      <title>Why Groups Matter: Necessity of Group Structures in Attributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable machine learning methods have been accompanied by substantial development. Despite their success, the existing approaches focus more on the general framework with no prior domain expertise. High-stakes financial sectors have extensive domain knowledge of the features. Hence, it is expected that explanations of models will be consistent with domain knowledge to ensure conceptual soundness.
  In this work, we study the group structures of features that are naturally formed in the financial dataset. Our study shows the importance of considering group structures that conform to the regulations. When group structures are present, direct applications of explainable machine learning methods, such as Shapley values and Integrated Gradients, may not provide consistent explanations; alternatively, group versions of the Shapley value can provide consistent explanations. We contain detailed examples to concentrate on the practical perspective of our framework.</description>

      <title>A forward differential deep learning-based algorithm for solving high-dimensional nonlinear backward stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel forward differential deep learning-based algorithm for solving high-dimensional nonlinear backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). Motivated by the fact that differential deep learning can efficiently approximate the labels and their derivatives with respect to inputs, we transform the BSDE problem into a differential deep learning problem. This is done by leveraging Malliavin calculus, resulting in a system of BSDEs. The unknown solution of the BSDE system is a triple of processes $(Y, Z, \Gamma)$, representing the solution, its gradient, and the Hessian matrix. The main idea of our algorithm is to discretize the integrals using the Euler-Maruyama method and approximate the unknown discrete solution triple using three deep neural networks. The parameters of these networks are then optimized by globally minimizing a differential learning loss function, which is novelty defined as a weighted sum of the dynamics of the discretized system of BSDEs. Through various high-dimensional examples, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme is more efficient in terms of accuracy and computation time compared to other contemporary forward deep learning-based methodologies.</description>

      <title>Reinsurance with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an insurance company which faces financial risk in the form of insurance claims and market-dependent surplus fluctuations. The company aims to simultaneously control its terminal wealth (e.g. at the end of an accounting period) and the ruin probability in a finite time interval by purchasing reinsurance. The target functional is given by the expected utility of terminal wealth perturbed by a modified Gerber-Shiu penalty function. We solve the problem of finding the optimal reinsurance strategy and the corresponding maximal target functional via neural networks. The procedure is illustrated by a numerical example, where the surplus process is given by a Cram\'er-Lundberg model perturbed by a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Expansion for the Pricing of Asian and Basket Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present closed analytical approximations for the pricing of basket options, also applicable to Asian options with discrete averaging under the Black-Scholes model with time-dependent parameters. The formulae are obtained by using a stochastic Taylor expansion around a log-normal proxy model and are found to be highly accurate for Asian options in practice as well as for vanilla options with discrete dividends.</description>
