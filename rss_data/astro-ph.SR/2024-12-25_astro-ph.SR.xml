      <title>Comparison of Relative Magnetic Helicity Flux Calculation Results Based on the Line-of-Sight Magnetograms of ASO-S/FMG and SDO/HMI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic helicity is a key geometrical parameter to describe the structure and evolution of solar coronal magnetic fields. The accumulation of magnetic helicity is correlated with the non-potential magnetic field energy, which is released in the solar eruptions. Moreover, the relative magnetic helicity fluxes can be estimated only relying on the line-of-sight magnetic field (e.g., Demoulin and Berger Sol. Phys. 215, 203, 2003). The payload Full-disk MagnetoGraph (FMG) on the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) currently has been supplying the continuous evolution of line-of-sight magnetograms for the solar active regions, which can be used to estimate the magnetic helicity flux. In this study, we useeight hours line-of-sight magnetograms of NOAA 13273, when at which the Sun-Earth direction speed of the satellite is zero to avoid the oscillation of the magnetic field caused by the Doppler effect on polarization measurements. We obtain the helicity flux by applying Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and local correlation tracking (LCT) methods to obtain the horizontal vector potential field and the motions of the ine-sf-sight polarities. We also compare the helicity flux derived using data from the Heliosesmic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the same method. It is found that the flux has the same sign and the correlation between measurements is 0.98. The difference of the absolute magnetic helicity normalized to themagnetic flux is less than 4%. This comparison demonstrates the reliability of ASO-S/FMG data and that it can be reliably used in future studies</description>

      <title>Relative Alpha in the Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics (MHD) with open magnetic field boundary and its application to the solar eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An instability criterion in the MHD with the open boundary of magnetic field is proposed in this paper. We use a series of linear force-free extrapolation field, in which the normal part of magnetic field is fixed, to obtain the linear fitting coefficient called relative alpha by using the co-joined value of magnetic free energy and magnetic flux at the open boundary ($E_f \Phi ^2$) and the square of relative magnetic helicity ($H_R^2$). We calculate this coefficient of the magnetic field above active regions NOAA~8210 and NOAA~11429 obtained by the photospheric-data-driven magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model. It is found that the fitting coefficient is a good proxy of the criterion to indicate the occurrence of instability after which the magnetic reconnection happens and caused the fast release of magnetic energy. We also applied this method to the continuous evolution of three-dimension magnetic field of NOAA~11158 based on the measurement of photospheric vector magnetic field of SDO/HMI by the Non-linear Force-Free (NLFF) extrapolation method. The calculated coefficient when the major flare happened based on the extrapolation data is very close to the expected ones, which perfectly reflects the occurrence of instability and the difference is even less than 7\%. This relative alpha is very helpful to evaluate how far it is from the instability in the MHD and quantitatively estimate the occurrence of solar eruption in the space weather forecast.</description>

      <title>Examination of the Relationship Between Spectral Type and Stellar Rotational Velocity in $\sim$50,000 Single Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present the results of the relationship between spectral type (ST) and the projected stellar rotational velocity ($vsini$), utilising a sample of approximately 50,000 single stars across a range of evolutionary stages. The STs of the stars included in this study span a broad range, from O0 to M9. We examine the stars in our data set, which has been divided into two groups according to ST and luminosity class (LC). The groups were conducted an investigation into the relationship between the mean $vsini$ ($\langle vsini \rangle$) and STs, as well as the dependence of $\langle vsini \rangle$ on STs and LCs. The rationale for investigating the two subgroups separately is to take into account for the evolutionary status of the stars and ascertain the impact on stellar rotation. The results demonstrate a notable decline in $\langle vsini \rangle$ as the spectral type progresses from early to late types. In particular, we found a significant decrease in $\langle vsini \rangle$ values, amounting to approximately 100 km/s, between hot stars (STs O0 to F2) and cool stars (STs F2 to M9). Moreover, a reduction in $\langle vsini \rangle$ is discernible as stars evolve, with this trend being most pronounced in evolutionary stages beyond the subgiant phase.</description>

      <title>Red supergiant stars in binary systems II. Confirmation of B-type companions of red supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud using Hubble ultra-violet spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red supergiant stars (RSGs) represent the final evolutionary phase of the majority of massive stars and hold a unique role in testing the physics of stellar models. Eighty eight RSGs in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) were recently found to have an ultra-violet excess that was attributed to a B-type companion. We present follow-up Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) ultra-violet (1700 -- 3000\,\AA) spectroscopy for 16 of these stars to investigate the nature of the UV excess and confirm the presence of a hot companion. In all cases we are able to confirm that the companion is a main-sequence B-type star based on the near-UV continuum. We determine effective temperatures, radii and luminosities from fitting the UV continuum with TLUSTY models and find stellar parameters in the expected range of SMC B-type stars. We display these results on a Hertzsprung--Russell diagram and assess the previously determined stellar parameters using UV photometry alone. From this comparison we conclude that UV photometric surveys are vital to identify such companions and UV spectroscopy is similarly vital to characterise the hot companions. From a comparison with IUE spectra of 32 Cyg, a well known RSG binary system in the Galaxy, four targets display evidence of being embedded in the wind of the RSG, like 32 Cyg, although none to the more extreme extent of VV Cep. The ages of six targets, determined via the stellar parameters of the hot companions, are found to be in tension with the ages determined for the RSG. A solution to this problem could be binary mass-transfer or red straggler stars.</description>

      <title>Diverse dust populations in the near-Sun environment characterized by PSP/IS$\bigodot$IS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS$\bigodot$IS) energetic particle instrument suite on Parker Solar Probe is dedicated to measuring energetic ions and electrons in the near-Sun environment. It includes a half-sky-viewing time-of-flight mass spectrometer (EPI-Lo) and five high-energy silicon solid-state detector-telescopes (EPI-Hi). To August 2024, eight of EPI-Lo's eighty separate telescope foils have experienced direct dust puncture events, most of which occurred inside 40 solar radii (0.19 au). These impacts represent the closest ever direct dust detections to the Sun. While there is limited information about the size/mass of each impact due to the lack of a dedicated dust instrument, we can determine the impact direction for six punctures, allowing us to partially constrain the inner zodiacal abundance. Remarkably, one of six unambiguous dust impacters was likely on a retrograde orbit, suggesting long-period cometary material may survive within 20 solar radii (0.09 au). We discuss observations in the context of improving our understanding of the inner zodiacal dust environment, highlighting multiple dust populations responsible for these events, and refining hazard assessment for near-Sun spacecraft.</description>

      <title>The massive fast spinning white dwarf in the HD 49798/RX J0648.0-4418 binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I review the properties and discuss some of the puzzling aspects of the unique binary system composed of the luminous hot subdwarf HD 49798 and a white dwarf with mass of 1.2 solar masses and spin period of 13.2 s. This is one of the few massive white dwarfs with a dynamically measured mass and the one with the shortest spin period. It emits pulsed X-rays with a very soft spectrum, powered by accretion from the tenuous stellar wind of its companion of sdO spectral type. The current level of mass accretion cannot provide enough angular momentum to explain the small, but precisely measured, spin-up rate of 72 nanoseconds per year, which is instead best interpreted as the result of the radial contraction of this young white dwarf. The higher mass transfer rate expected during the future evolutionary stages of HD 49798 will drive the white dwarf above the Chandrasekhar limit, but the final fate, a type Ia SN explosion or the collapse to a millisecond pulsar, is uncertain.</description>

      <title>Semblance study of force-field and convection-diffusion solutions with observations of solar magnetic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantitative model using the semblance method to evaluate differences in transport equation solutions and Local Interstellar Spectra (LIS) for Cosmic Ray (CR) modulation. The semblance method quantitatively compares transport solutions convection-diffusion and force field-and LIS, providing insights into CR behavior. By integrating these solutions into the atmospheric yield function (Caballero-Lopez &amp; Moraal 2012), the model identifies a correlation between the modulation factor and sunspots, and an anti-correlation with the mean magnetic field. The force field solution shows stronger semblance values, aligning better with neutron detector data. Among LIS, models by Lagner, Potgieter &amp; Webber (2003), and Ghelfi et al. (2017) are most consistent, while the Garcia-Munoz et al. (1975) LIS reveals notable variations. This study underscores the semblance method as a critical tool for comparing CR modulation models, advancing predictive models of cosmic ray behavior influenced by solar and interstellar conditions.</description>

      <title>Photometric Stellar Parameters for 195,478 Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar atmospheric parameters and physical properties of stars in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) are of great significance for the study of exoplanets, stellar activity, and asteroseismology. However, despite extensive effort over the past decades, accurate spectroscopic estimates of these parameters are available for only about half of the stars in the full KIC catalog. In our work, by training relationships between photometric colors and spectroscopic stellar parameters from Gaia DR3, the Kepler Issac-Newton Survey, LAMOST DR10, and APOGEE DR17, we have obtained atmospheric-parameter estimates for over 195,000 stars, accounting for 97% of the total sample of KIC stars. We obtain 1{\sigma} uncertainties of 0.1 dex on metallicity [Fe/H], 100 K on effective temperature $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ , and 0.2 dex on surface gravity log $g$. In addition, based on these atmospheric parameters, we estimated the ages, masses, radii, and surface gravities of these stars using the commonly adopted isochrone-fitting approach. The resulting precisions are 20% for ages, 0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for masses, 0.01 $R_{\odot}$ for radii and 0.1 dex for surface gravities. These accurate parameters are expected to provide valuable insights for future studies on various fields.</description>

      <title>Portability of Fortran's `do concurrent' on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a continuing interest in using standard language constructs for accelerated computing in order to avoid (sometimes vendor-specific) external APIs. For Fortran codes, the {\tt do concurrent} (DC) loop has been successfully demonstrated on the NVIDIA platform. However, support for DC on other platforms has taken longer to implement. Recently, Intel has added DC GPU offload support to its compiler, as has HPE for AMD GPUs. In this paper, we explore the current portability of using DC across GPU vendors using the in-production solar surface flux evolution code, HipFT. We discuss implementation and compilation details, including when/where using directive APIs for data movement is needed/desired compared to using a unified memory system. The performance achieved on both data center and consumer platforms is shown.</description>
