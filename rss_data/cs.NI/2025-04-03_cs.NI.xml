      <title>FastFlow: Early Yet Robust Network Flow Classification using the Minimal Number of Time-Series Packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network traffic classification is of great importance for network operators in their daily routines, such as analyzing the usage patterns of multimedia applications and optimizing network configurations. Internet service providers (ISPs) that operate high-speed links expect network flow classifiers to accurately classify flows early, using the minimal number of necessary initial packets per flow. These classifiers must also be robust to packet sequence disorders in candidate flows and capable of detecting unseen flow types that are not within the existing classification scope, which are not well achieved by existing methods. In this paper, we develop FastFlow, a time-series flow classification method that accurately classifies network flows as one of the known types or the unknown type, which dynamically selects the minimal number of packets to balance accuracy and efficiency. Toward the objectives, we first develop a flow representation process that converts packet streams at both per-packet and per-slot granularity for precise packet statistics with robustness to packet sequence disorders. Second, we develop a sequential decision-based classification model that leverages LSTM architecture trained with reinforcement learning. Our model makes dynamic decisions on the minimal number of time-series data points per flow for the confident classification as one of the known flow types or an unknown one. We evaluated our method on public datasets and demonstrated its superior performance in early and accurate flow classification. Deployment insights on the classification of over 22.9 million flows across seven application types and 33 content providers in a campus network over one week are discussed, showing that FastFlow requires an average of only 8.37 packets and 0.5 seconds to classify the application type of a flow with over 91% accuracy and over 96% accuracy for the content providers.</description>

      <title>Lifecycle Management of Trustworthy AI Models in 6G Networks: The REASON Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to play a key role in 6G networks including optimising system management, operation, and evolution. This requires systematic lifecycle management of AI models, ensuring their impact on services and stakeholders is continuously monitored. While current 6G initiatives introduce AI, they often fall short in addressing end-to-end intelligence and crucial aspects like trust, transparency, privacy, and verifiability. Trustworthy AI is vital, especially for critical infrastructures like 6G. This paper introduces the REASON approach for holistically addressing AI's native integration and trustworthiness in future 6G networks. The approach comprises AI Orchestration (AIO) for model lifecycle management, Cognition (COG) for performance evaluation and explanation, and AI Monitoring (AIM) for tracking and feedback. Digital Twin (DT) technology is leveraged to facilitate real-time monitoring and scenario testing, which are essential for AIO, COG, and AIM. We demonstrate this approach through an AI-enabled xAPP use case, leveraging a DT platform to validate, explain, and deploy trustworthy AI models.</description>

      <title>Digital Twins for Internet of Battlespace Things (IoBT) Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for integrating Digital Twins (DTs) within Internet of battlespace Things (IoBT) coalitions. We introduce a novel three-tier architecture that enables efficient coordination and management of DT models across coalition partners while addressing key challenges in interoperability, security, and resource allocation. The architecture comprises specialized controllers at each tier: Digital Twin Coalition Partner (DTCP) controllers managing individual coalition partners' DT resources, a central Digital Twin Coalition(DTC) controller orchestrating cross-partner coordination, and Digital Twin Coalition Mission (DTCP) controllers handling mission-specific DT interactions. We propose a hybrid approach for DT model placement across edge devices, tactical nodes, and cloud infrastructure, optimizing performance while maintaining security and accessibility. The architecture leverages software-defined networking principles for dynamic resource allocation and slice management, enabling efficient sharing of computational and network resources between DT operations and primary IoBT functions. Our proposed framework aims to provide a robust foundation for deploying and managing Digital Twins in coalition warfare, enhancing situational awareness, decision-making capabilities, and operational effectiveness while ensuring secure and interoperable operations across diverse coalition partners.</description>

      <title>Medium Access for Push-Pull Data Transmission in 6G Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medium access in 5G systems was tailored to accommodate diverse traffic classes through network resource slicing. 6G wireless systems are expected to be significantly reliant on Artificial Intelligence (AI), leading to data-driven and goal-oriented communication. This leads to augmentation of the design space for Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, which is the focus of this article. We introduce a taxonomy based on push-based and pull-based communication, which is useful to categorize both the legacy and the AI-driven access schemes. We provide MAC protocol design guidelines for pull- and push-based communication in terms of goal-oriented criteria, such as timing and data relevance. We articulate a framework for co-existence between pull and push-based communications in 6G systems, combining their advantages. We highlight the design principles and main tradeoffs, as well as the architectural considerations for integrating these designs in Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) and 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Handover and SINR-Aware Path Optimization in 5G-UAV mmWave Communication using DRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path planning and optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted next-generation wireless networks is critical for mobility management and ensuring UAV safety and ubiquitous connectivity, especially in dense urban environments with street canyons and tall buildings. Traditional statistical and model-based techniques have been successfully used for path optimization in communication networks. However, when dynamic channel propagation characteristics such as line-of-sight (LOS), interference, handover, and signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) are included in path optimization, statistical and model-based path planning solutions become obsolete since they cannot adapt to the dynamic and time-varying wireless channels, especially in the mmWave bands. In this paper, we propose a novel model-free actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (AC-DRL) framework for path optimization in UAV-assisted 5G mmWave wireless networks, which combines four important aspects of UAV communication: \textit{flight time, handover, connectivity and SINR}. We train an AC-RL agent that enables a UAV connected to a gNB to determine the optimal path to a desired destination in the shortest possible time with minimal gNB handover, while maintaining connectivity and the highest possible SINR. We train our model with data from a powerful ray tracing tool called Wireless InSite, which uses 3D images of the propagation environment and provides data that closely resembles the real propagation environment. The simulation results show that our system has superior performance in tracking high SINR compared to other selected RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Directional Routing of Freight in the Physical Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Physical Internet (PI) envisions an interconnected, modular, and dynamically managed logistics system inspired by the Digital Internet. It enables open-access networks where shipments traverse a hyperconnected system of hubs, adjusting routes based on real-time conditions. A key challenge in scalable and adaptive freight movement is routing determining how shipments navigate the network to balance service levels, consolidation, and adaptability. This paper introduces directional routing, a dynamic approach that flexibly adjusts shipment paths, optimizing efficiency and consolidation using real-time logistics data. Unlike shortest-path routing, which follows fixed routes, directional routing dynamically selects feasible next-hop hubs based on network conditions, consolidation opportunities, and service level constraints. It consists of two phases: area discovery, which identifies candidate hubs, and node selection, which determines the next hub based on real-time parameters. This paper advances the area discovery phase by introducing a Reduced Search Space Breadth-First Search (RSS-BFS) method to systematically identify feasible routing areas while balancing service levels and consolidation. The proposed approach enhances network fluidity, scalability, and adaptability in PI-based logistics, advancing autonomous and sustainable freight movement.</description>

      <title>Toward a Sustainable Low-Altitude Economy: A Survey of Energy-Efficient RIS-UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of RIS into UAV networks presents a transformative solution for achieving energy-efficient and reliable communication, particularly within the rapidly expanding low-altitude economy (LAE). As UAVs facilitate diverse aerial services-spanning logistics to smart surveillance-their limited energy reserves create significant challenges. RIS effectively addresses this issue by dynamically shaping the wireless environment to enhance signal quality, reduce power consumption, and extend UAV operation time, thus enabling sustainable and scalable deployment across various LAE applications. This survey provides a comprehensive review of RIS-assisted UAV networks, focusing on energy-efficient design within LAE applications. We begin by introducing the fundamentals of RIS, covering its operational modes, deployment architectures, and roles in both terrestrial and aerial environments. Next, advanced EE-driven strategies for integrating RIS and UAVs. Techniques such as trajectory optimization, power control, beamforming, and dynamic resource management are examined. Emphasis is placed on collaborative solutions that incorporate UAV-mounted RIS, wireless energy harvesting (EH), and intelligent scheduling frameworks. We further categorize RIS-enabled schemes based on key performance objectives relevant to LAE scenarios. These objectives include sum rate maximization, coverage extension, QoS guarantees, secrecy rate improvement, latency reduction, and age of information (AoI) minimization. The survey also delves into RIS-UAV synergy with emerging technologies like MEC, NOMA, V2X communication, and WPT. These technologies are crucial to the LAE ecosystem. Finally, we outline open research challenges and future directions, emphasizing the critical role of energy-aware, RIS-enhanced UAV networks in shaping scalable, sustainable, and intelligent infrastructures within the LAE.</description>

      <title>Sustainable broadcasting in Blockchain Networks with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent estimates put the carbon footprint of Bitcoin and Ethereum at an average of 64 and 26 million tonnes of CO2 per year, respectively. To address this growing problem, several possible approaches have been proposed in the literature: creating alternative blockchain consensus mechanisms, applying redundancy reduction techniques, utilizing renewable energy sources, and employing energy-efficient devices, etc. In this paper, we follow the second avenue and propose an efficient approach based on reinforcement learning that improves the block broadcasting scheme in blockchain networks. The analysis and experimental results confirmed that the proposed improvement of the block propagation scheme could cleverly handle network dynamics and achieve better results than the default approach. Additionally, our technical integration of the simulator and developed RL environment can be used as a complete solution for further study of new schemes and protocols that use RL or other ML techniques.</description>

      <title>Reverse Engineering the ESP32-C3 Wi-Fi Drivers for Static Worst-Case Analysis of Intermittently-Powered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Internet of Batteryless Things revolutionizes sustainable communication as it operates on harvested energy. This harvested energy is dependent on unpredictable environmental conditions; therefore, device operations, including those of its networking stack, must be resilient to power failures. Reactive intermittent computing provides an approach for solving this by notifications of impending power failures, which is implemented by monitoring the harvested energy buffered in a capacitor. However, to use this power-failure notification and guarantee forward progress, systems must break down tasks into atomic transactions that can be predictably finished before the energy runs out. Thus, static program-code analysis must determine the worst-case energy consumption (WCEC) of all transactions. In Wi-Fi-capable devices, drivers are often closed-source, which avoids the determination of WCEC bounds for transactions since static analysis requires all code along with its semantics.
  In this work, we integrate an energy-aware networking stack with reverse-engineered Wi-Fi drivers to enable full-stack WCEC analysis for physical transmission and reception of packets. Further, we extended a static worst-case analysis tool with a resource-consumption model of our Wi-Fi driver. Our evaluation with the RISC-V-based ESP32-C3 platform gives worst-case bounds with our static analysis approach for the transactions of the full communication stack, therefore showing that Wi-Fi-based reactive intermittent computing is feasible.</description>

      <title>A Slicing Model for Transport Networks with Traffic Burst Control and QoS Compliance for Traffic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network slicing has emerged as a key network technology, providing network operators with the means to offer virtual networks to vertical users over a single physical network infrastructure. Recent research has resulted mainly in techniques for managing and deploying network slices, but the implementation of network slices on a real physical transport network infrastructure has received much less attention. Standardization bodies, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), have provided some implementation recommendations. Still, there is a lack of mechanisms to implement network slices capable of handling traffic bursts while simultaneously meeting the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the traffic flows associated with the slices. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained resource control mechanism to implement transport network slices that meet traffic QoS requirements while both accepting limited traffic bursts, and enabling efficient bandwidth sharing within and across slices. The mechanism is executed at the edge of the transport network. The proposed model aligns with current standards on network slicing and has been tested on an experimental platform. Using this platform, we have conducted an extensive experimental campaign that demonstrates that our proposal can effectively control traffic bursts generated within the network slices while maximizing bandwidth utilization across the network.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Framework for Multi-Service Multi-Modal Devices in NextG ORAN Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven efficient RAN management framework is proposed. This framework introduces the concept of the multi-service-modal UE (MSMU) system, which allows a single UE to handle both eMBB and uRLLC services. The proposed framework integrates traffic demand prediction, route optimization, RAN slicing, service identification, and radio resource management under uncertainty. The challenge of dynamic environments in such a system is addressed by decomposing the optimization problem into long-term (L-SP) and short-term (S-SP) subproblems. Using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, the proposed approach allows the prediction of eMBB and uRLLC traffic demands and optimal routes for RAN slicing in the L-SP. For the S-SP, another LSTM model is employed to handle real-time service type identification and resource management based on long-term predictions. To support continuous adaptation, continual learning is incorporated into the S-SP framework, allowing the model to learn new service types while retaining prior knowledge. Experimental results show that the proposed framework efficiently manages dual-mode UEs, achieving low mean square error for traffic demand (0.003), resource block prediction (0.003), and power prediction (0.002), with 99\% accuracy in service type and route selection and over 95\% average accuracy for continual service adaptation across seven tasks.</description>

      <title>Safety-Aware Multi-Agent Learning for Dynamic Network Bridging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing complex cooperative tasks in safety-critical environments poses significant challenges for multi-agent systems, especially under conditions of partial observability. We focus on a dynamic network bridging task, where agents must learn to maintain a communication path between two moving targets. To ensure safety during training and deployment, we integrate a control-theoretic safety filter that enforces collision avoidance through local setpoint updates. We develop and evaluate multi-agent reinforcement learning safety-informed message passing, showing that encoding safety filter activations as edge-level features improves coordination. The results suggest that local safety enforcement and decentralized learning can be effectively combined in distributed multi-agent tasks.</description>

      <title>Network Intrusion Datasets: A Survey, Limitations, and Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven cyberthreat detection has become a crucial defense technique in modern cybersecurity. Network defense, supported by Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs), has also increasingly adopted data-driven approaches, leading to greater reliance on data. Despite the importance of data, its scarcity has long been recognized as a major obstacle in NIDS research. In response, the community has published many new datasets recently. However, many of them remain largely unknown and unanalyzed, leaving researchers uncertain about their suitability for specific use cases.
  In this paper, we aim to address this knowledge gap by performing a systematic literature review (SLR) of 89 public datasets for NIDS research. Each dataset is comparatively analyzed across 13 key properties, and its potential applications are outlined. Beyond the review, we also discuss domain-specific challenges and common data limitations to facilitate a critical view on data quality. To aid in data selection, we conduct a dataset popularity analysis in contemporary state-of-the-art NIDS research. Furthermore, the paper presents best practices for dataset selection, generation, and usage. By providing a comprehensive overview of the domain and its data, this work aims to guide future research toward improving data quality and the robustness of NIDS solutions.</description>
