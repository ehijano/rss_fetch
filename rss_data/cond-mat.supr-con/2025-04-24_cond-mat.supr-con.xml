      <title>Indirect Tunneling Enabled Spontaneous Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking and Josephson Diode Effect in TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$/Hf$_{0.8}$Zr$_{0.2}$O$_2$/Nb tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson diode (JD) effect found in Josephson tunnel junctions (JTJs) has attracted a great deal of attention due to its importance for developing superconducting circuitry based quantum technologies. So far, the highly desirable electrical control of the JD effect has not been demonstrated in any JTJ prepared by techniques used in semiconductor industry. We report the fabrication of JTJs featuring a composite tunnel barrier of Al$_2$O$_3$ and Hf$_{\mathrm{0.8}}$Zr$_\mathrm{0.2}$O$_2$ prepared by complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD). These JTJs were found to show the JD effect in nominally zero magnetic fields with the nonreciprocity controllable using an electric training current, yielding a surprisingly large diode efficiency not achieved previously. The quasiparticle tunneling, through which the Josephson coupling in a JTJ is established, was found to show no nonreciprocity. We attribute these observations to the simultaneous presence of positive and negative Josephson couplings, with the latter originating from indirect tunneling. The resulted spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking and the double-minima washboard potential for the ensemble averaged phase difference in the resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model are shown to fully account for the experimentally observed JD effect.</description>

      <title>Fluxoid Valve Effect in Full-Shell Nanowire Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of supercurrent valve based on full-shell nanowires. These hybrid wires consist of a semiconductor core fully wrapped in a thin superconductor shell and subjected to an axial magnetic field. Due to the tubular shape of the shell, the superconductor phase acquires an integer number $n$ of $2\pi$ twists or fluxoids that increases in steps with applied flux. By connecting two such hybrid wires, forming a Josephson junction (JJ), a flux-modulated supercurrent develops. If the two superconducting sections of the JJ have different radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, they can develop equal or different fluxoid numbers $n_1,n_2$ depending on the field. If $n_1\neq n_2$ the supercurrent is blocked, while it remains finite for $n_1=n_2$. This gives rise to a fluxoid valve effect controlled by the applied magnetic field. We define a fluxoid-valve quality factor that is perfect for cylindrically symmetric systems and decreases as this symmetry is reduced. We further discuss the role of Majorana zero modes at the junction when the full shell-nanowires are in topological superconducting regime.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field oscillations of the critical temperature in ultraclean, two-dimensional Type-I superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of Landau Levels (LLs) and Zeeman energy, induced by an applied magnetic field ${\bf B}$, on the critical temperature $T_c$ for two-dimensional (2D) ultraclean metals using a fully quantum mechanical approach within the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. In contrast to standard BCS theory, it allows for Cooper pair formation between electrons with opposite spins and momenta along the ${\bf B}$ direction, both on the same or on neighboring LLs. Our quantum mechanical treatment of LLs reveals that $T_c({\bf B})$ for electrons paired on the same LLs exhibits oscillations around the BCS critical temperature at lower magnetic fields, a phenomenon analogous to the de Haas-van Alphen effect. The Zeeman energy leads to a decrease in $T_c({\bf B})$ with increasing ${\bf B}$ for electrons paired both on the same and on neighboring LLs. Notably, as the $g$-factor increases, the amplitude of the ${\bf B}$ oscillations gradually diminishes until they vanish at higher magnetic fields. Conversely, for small $g$-factors, electron pairing on the same or on neighboring LLs can result in a re-entrant superconducting phase at very high magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Scalable Synthesis of Alkali Metal-Intercalated C$_{60}$ Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkali metal-intercalated C$_{60}$, $A_3$$C_{60}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs, and their combinations), holds significant potential for practical applications due to its high superconducting transition temperature (33 K), high upper critical field (900 kOe), and isotropic superconductivity. However, application-oriented research has been limited by the lack of an efficient $A_3$$C_{60}$ synthesis process. In this study, we demonstrate a rapid and scalable synthesis of $A_3$$C_{60}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs$_{1/3}$Rb$_{2/3}$) via direct mixing of $A$ and C$_{60}$, realizing the fabrication of high-quality sintered $A_3$$C_{60}$ pellets within just 1 hour of heating at 200-300{\deg}C. The pellets exhibited large superconducting shielding volume fractions with sharp transitions, and the relationship between the lattice constant and transition temperature was in good agreement with previous reports. This direct mixing method enables simple and rapid production of large quantities of $A_3$$C_{60}$, which is expected to accelerate research into applications such as superconducting wires and bulk magnets.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the logarithmic average phonon frequency in the superconducting critical temperature formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically demonstrate the essential role of the logarithmic average phonon frequency in describing the superconducting critical temperature, directly from a predictive function. The current study assumes that the Eliashberg spectral function follows the Debye model in the low frequency spectrum, whereas contributions from optical phonons dominate outside this range. Our findings confirm that, under a specific condition, we obtained a formula for superconducting transition temperature. Furthermore, we compared our formula with the Allen-Dynes formula and its modified version, and the exact solutions. They reveal notable correlations.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall conductivity in the strongest cuprate superconductor: Estimate of the mean free path in the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8 + \delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal Hall conductivity of the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) - the superconductor with the highest critical temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure - was measured at temperatures down to 2 K for three dopings in the underdoped regime ($p$ = 0.09, 0.10, 0.11). By combining a previously introduced simple model and prior theoretical results, we derive a formula for the inverse mean free path, $1 / \ell$, which allows us to estimate the mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in Hg1223 below $T_c$. We find that $1 / \ell$ grows as $T^3$, in agreement with the theoretical expectation for a clean $d$-wave superconductor. Measurements were also conducted on the single layer mercury-based cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Hg1201), revealing that the mean free path in this compound is roughly half that of its three-layered counterpart at the same doping ($p$ = 0.10). This observation can be attributed to the protective role of the outer planes in Hg1223, which results in a more pristine inner plane. We also report data in an ultraclean crystal of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (YBCO) with full oxygen content $p$ = 0.18, believed to be the cleanest of any cuprate, and find that $\ell$ is not longer than in Hg1223.</description>

      <title>Real-space superconducting properties in the atomically-thin limit: Ab initio approach and its application to Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-space superconducting properties are increasingly important to characterize low-dimensional, layered, and nanostructured materials. Here, we present a method to extract the real-space superconducting order parameter from the superconducting gap spectrum obtained via anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg calculations, using the Bloch wave functions of the Fermi states. We apply this approach to a selection of atomically thin material systems. Our analysis of gallenene, a monolayer of gallium atoms, shows that its planar and buckled phases exhibit distinct superconducting order parameter behaviors, shaped by their structural and electronic properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our real-space approach is exceptionally suited to identify and characterize Josephson junctions made from van der Waals materials. Our examination of a bilayer of NbSe$_2$ reveals that the van der Waals gap acts as an intrinsic weak link between the superconducting NbSe$_2$ layers. Therefore, a bilayer of NbSe$_2$ represents one of the thinnest and most tunable Josephson junction architectures, with potential applications in quantum devices. Our findings underscore the utility of transformation into real-space in understanding superconducting properties through ab initio calculations.</description>

      <title>Josephson anomalous vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that vortices with circulating current, related with odd-frequency triplet pairing, appear in Josephson junctions where the barrier is a weak ferromagnet with strong spin-orbit coupling. By both symmetry analysis and microscopic methods we show that there is an additional term - a rotary invariant - in the superconducting free energy which allows for magnetoelectric effects even when the previously considered Lifshitz invariant vanishes. We show that the size, shape, and position of these vortices can be controlled by manipulating Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the weak link, via gates, and we suggest that these vortices could be detected via scanning magnetometry techniques. We also show that the transverse triplet components of the superconducting correlations can form a texture.</description>

      <title>Fluctuated lattice-driven charge density wave far above the condensation temperature in kagome superconductor KV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, Fc, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of Tc = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at Fc were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at Tc. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near Tc, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Current phase relation in a planar graphene Josephson junction with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a graphene Josephson junction where the inner graphene layer is subjected to spin-orbit coupling by proximity effect. This could be achieved, for example, by growing the graphene layer on top of a transition metal dichalcogenide, such as WS$_2$. Here, we focus on the ballistic, wide, and short junction limits and study the effects of the spin-orbit interaction on the supercurrent. In particular, we analyze the current phase relation using an analytical approach based on the continuum model. We find combinations of types of spin-orbit coupling that significantly suppress the supercurrent by opening a gap in the graphene band structure. At the same time, other combinations enhance it, acting as an effective spin-valley resolved chemical potential. Moreover, we find that a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling leads to a junction with a highly voltage tunable harmonic content.</description>

      <title>Quasi-particle residue and charge of the one-dimensional Fermi polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a mobile impurity coupled to an ideal Fermi gas in one spatial dimension through an attractive contact interaction. We calculate the quasi-particle residue $Z$ exactly, based on Bethe Ansatz and diagrammatic Monte Carlo methods, and with varational Ansatz up to one particle-hole excitation of the Fermi sea. We find that the exact quasi-particle residue vanishes in the thermodynamic limit as a power law in the number of particles, consistent with the Luttinger-liquid paradigm and the breakdown of Fermi-liquid theory. The variational Ansatz, however, predicts a finite value of $Z$, even in the thermodynamic limit. We also study how the presence of the impurity affects the density of the spin-up sea by calculating the pair correlation function. Subtracting the homogeneous background and integrating over all distances gives the charge $Q$. This charge turns out to grow continuously from 0 at zero coupling to 1 in the strong-coupling limit. The varational Ansatz predicts $Q=0$ at all couplings. So, although the variational Ansatz has been shown to be remarkably accurate for the energy and the effective mass, it fails even qualitatively when predicting $Z$ and the pair correlation function in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Flux tube clustering from magnetic coupling of adjacent type-I and -II superconductors in a neutron star: persistent gravitational radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adjacent type-I and -II proton superconductors in a rotation-powered pulsar are predicted to exist in a metastable state containing macroscopic and quantized flux tubes, respectively. Previous studies show that the type-I and -II regions are coupled magnetically, when macroscopic flux tubes divide dendritically into quantized flux tubes near the type-I-II interface, through a process known as flux branching. The studies assume that the normal-superconducting boundary is sharp, and the quantized flux tubes do not repel mutually. Here the sharp-interface approximation is refined by accounting for magnetic repulsion. It is found that flux tubes in the same flux tree cluster with a minimum-energy separation two to seven times less than that of isolated flux tubes. Neutron vortices pin and cluster about flux trees. We find that the maximum characteristic wave strain $h_0$ of the current quadrupole gravitational radiation emitted by a rectilinear array of clustered vortices exceeds by $(1+N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ the strain $h_0 \sim 10^{-32}(f/30 {\rm Hz})^{5/2} (D/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$ emitted by uniformly distributed vortices, where $N_{\rm v,t}$ is the mean number of pinned vortices per flux tree, $f$ is the star's spin frequency, and $D$ is the star's distance from Earth. The factor $(1 + N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ brings $h_0$ close to the sensitivity limit of the current generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors under certain circumstances, specifically when flux branching forms relatively few (and hence relatively large) flux trees.</description>

      <title>Ambient pressure growth of bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity over 90 K under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate $La_3Ni_2O_7$ has emerged as a superconductor with a transition temperature ($T_c$) of ~ 80 K above 14 GPa$^{[1-4]}$. Efforts to search for nickelate superconductors with higher $T_c$$^{[5,6]}$, to grow reproducible high-quality single crystals$^{[2,7-10]}$, and to eliminate reliance on demanding high gas pressure synthesis conditions$^{[11]}$, remain significant challenges. Here we report superconductivity up to 92 K under high pressure in single crystals of bilayer nickelates synthesized at ambient pressure using flux methods. High quality $La_2SmNi_2O_{7-{\delta}}$ single crystals with dimensions up to 220 {\mu}m on edge were successfully grown. At ~ 15 GPa, these crystals exhibit superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c^{onset}$) of 68 K and zero-resistance temperature ($T_c^{zero}$) of 47 K. Increasing pressure further enhances both transition temperatures, reaching record values for nickelates: $T_{c,max}^{onset}$ = 92 K and $T_{c,max}^{zero}$ = 73 K @ 21 GPa. Notably, higher $T_c$ correlates with larger in-plane lattice distortion at ambient conditions for bilayer nickelates. Furthermore, we observed a structural transition from monoclinic $P2_1/a$ to tetragonal $I4/mmm$ at ~ 18 GPa, indicating that tetragonal structure is not a prerequisite for superconductivity to appear in this bilayer nickelate. This study provides an easy-to-access method for growing reproducible high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals and offers new insights into achieving higher Tc superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Floating zone growth as a tool for phase formation exploration at high oxygen pressures in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate Y$_{y}$Sr$_{3-y}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>

Abstract: With the discovery of superconductivity under pressure in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer La$_3$Ni$^{2.5+}_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$^{2.66+}_3$O$_{10}$, a new field of nickelate superconductors opened up. In this respect, Sr-Ni-O RP-type phases represent alternative systems that exist with partial cation substitution. We demonstrate that by Y-doping in Sr$_{3}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (SNAO), as Y$_{y}$Sr$_{3-y}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (YSNAO), the drawback of an insulating ground state is overcome, and a significant decrease in resistivity is achieved with crystals exhibiting semiconducting behavior. We employ optical floating zone (OFZ) growth at 10 bar oxygen partial pressure to explore the phase formation in a narrow region of Y-Sr-Ni-Al-O and investigate via DFT the general stability of the pure Sr-Ni-O scenario. Using extensive diffraction and spectroscopy, as well as transport and magnetization measurements, the structural, chemical, electrical, and magnetic properties of the as-grown and reduced compounds were investigated. The optimal growth of YSNAO allows for large high quality crystals suitable for neutron studies. In the Al-free growth, a known $n=1$ RP system with Sr$_{1.66}$Y$_{0.33}$NiO$_{4-\delta}$, from which the first single crystals were obtained, was further confirmed, opening the door for future exploration of \textit{A}-site substituted RP-type phases without Ni-site disorder.</description>

      <title>Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proposed recently by the author Q-ball mechanism of the pseudogap state and high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates (2022) was supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ (2023). In the present paper it is demonstrated that T-linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity arises naturally in the Q-ball gas phase, that may explain corresponding experimental data in the "strange metal" phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates, as reviewed by Barisic et al. (2013). In the present theory it arises due to scattering of electrons on the Q-balls gas of condensed charge/spin fluctuations. Close to the lowest temperature boundary of the "strange metal" phase, at which Q-ball radius diverges, electrical resistivity caused by a slide of the Q-balls as a whole is calculated using fluctuation paraconductivity calculation method by Alex Abrikosov (1987). The diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas is calculated as well and shows good accord with experimental data by L.Li et al. (2010) in the "strange metal" phase. In total, obtained results demonstrate different properties of the correlated electrons systems that arise due to formation of Q-balls possessing internal bosonic frequency $\Omega=2\pi nT$ in Matsubara time and, thus, forming the quantum thermodynamic time polycrystals. Presented theory may give a clue concerning a possible mechanism of the experimentally measured properties of high-T$_c$ cuprates in the "strange metal" phase of their phase diagram. We believe , these results provide support to the quantum thermodynamic time crystal model of the Euclidean Q-balls considered in the present paper.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of compressively strained thin film La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$</title>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in the bulk nickelates under high pressure is a major advance in physics. The recent observation of superconductivity at ambient pressure in compressively strained bilayer nickelate thin films has now enabled direct characterization of the superconducting phase through angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Here we present an in-situ ARPES study of compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ films grown by oxide molecular beam epitaxy, and the ozone treated counterparts with an onset T$_c$ of 40 K, supplemented with results from pulsed laser deposition films with similar T$_c$. We resolve a systematic strain-driven electronic band shift with respect to that of bulk crystals, in qualitative agreement with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, the strongly renormalized flat 3$d_{z2}$ band shifts a factor of 5-10 smaller than anticipated by DFT. Furthermore, it stays ~70 meV below the Fermi level, contradicting the expectation that superconductivity results from the high density of states of this band at the Fermi level. We also observed a non-trivial k$_z$ dispersion of the cuprate-like 3$d_{x2-y2}$ band. Combined with results from both X-ray diffraction and DFT, we suggest that the strained films are under ~5 GPa effective pressure, considerably larger than the na\"ive expectation from the DFT relaxed structure. Finally, the ~70 meV energy position is intriguingly close to the collective mode coupling more prominently seen in thin films, in the energy range of both oxygen related phonons and the maximum of the spin excitation spectrum.</description>
