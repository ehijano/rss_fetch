      <title>Spatial verification of global precipitation forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial verification of global high-resolution weather forecasts remains a considerable challenge. Most existing spatial verification techniques either do not properly account for the non-planar geometry of a global domain or their computation complexity becomes too large. We present an adaptation of the recently developed Precipitation Attribution Distance (PAD) metric, designed for verifying precipitation, enabling its use on the Earth's spherical geometry. PAD estimates the magnitude of location errors in the forecasts and is related to the mathematical theory of Optimal Transport as it provides a close upper bound for the Wasserstein distance. The method is fast and flexible with time complexity $O(n \log(n))$. Its behavior is analyzed using a set of idealized cases and 7 years of operational global high-resolution deterministic 6-hourly precipitation forecasts from the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The summary results for the whole period show how location errors in the IFS model grow steadily with increasing lead time for all analyzed regions. Moreover, by examining the time evolution of the results, we can determine the trends in the score's value and identify the regions where there is a statistically significant improvement (or worsening) of the forecast performance. The results can also be analyzed separately for different intensities of precipitation. Overall, the PAD provides meaningful results for estimating location errors in global high-resolution precipitation forecasts at an affordable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for a Spring Peak in East Asian Cyclone Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency of extratropical cyclones in East Asia, including those traveling along the Kuroshio off the south coast of Japan, maximizes climatologically in spring in harmony with local enhancement of precipitation. The springtime cyclone activity is of great socioeconomic importance for East Asian countries. However, mechanisms for the spring peak in the East Asian cyclone activity have been poorly understood. This study aims to unravel the mechanisms, focusing particularly on favorable conditions for relevant cyclogenesis. Through a composite analysis based on atmospheric reanalysis data, we show that cyclogenesis enhanced around the East China Sea under anomalously strengthened cyclonic wind shear and temperature gradient, in addition to enhanced moisture flux from the south, is important for the spring peak in the cyclone activity in East Asia. In spring, climatologically strengthened cyclonic shear north of the low-level jet axis and associated frequent atmospheric frontogenesis in southern China and the East China Sea serve as favorable background conditions for low-level cyclogenesis. We also demonstrate that climatologically enhanced diabatic heating around East Asia is pivotal in strengthening of the low-level jet through a set of linear baroclinic model experiments. Our findings suggest the importance of the seasonal evolution of diabatic heating in East Asia for that of the climate system around East Asia from winter to spring, encompassing the spring peak in the cyclone activity and climatological precipitation.</description>

      <title>Spatial Temporal Approach for High-Resolution Gridded Wind Forecasting across Southwest Western Australia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate wind speed and direction forecasting is paramount across many sectors, spanning agriculture, renewable energy generation, and bushfire management. However, conventional forecasting models encounter significant challenges in precisely predicting wind conditions at high spatial resolutions for individual locations or small geographical areas (&lt; 20 km2) and capturing medium to long-range temporal trends and comprehensive spatio-temporal patterns. This study focuses on a spatial temporal approach for high-resolution gridded wind forecasting at the height of 3 and 10 metres across large areas of the Southwest of Western Australia to overcome these challenges. The model utilises the data that covers a broad geographic area and harnesses a diverse array of meteorological factors, including terrain characteristics, air pressure, 10-metre wind forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and limited observation data from sparsely distributed weather stations (such as 3-metre wind profiles, humidity, and temperature), the model demonstrates promising advancements in wind forecasting accuracy and reliability across the entire region of interest. This paper shows the potential of our machine learning model for wind forecasts across various prediction horizons and spatial coverage. It can help facilitate more informed decision-making and enhance resilience across critical sectors.</description>
