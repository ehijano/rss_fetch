      <title>Complexity of the Virtual Network Embedding with uniform demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the Virtual Network Embedding Problem (VNE), which is the combinatorial core of several telecommunication problems related to the implementation of virtualization technologies, such as Network Slicing. VNE is to find an optimal assignment of virtual demands to physical resources, encompassing simultaneous placement and routing decisions. The problem is known to be strongly NP-hard, even when the virtual network is a uniform path, but is polynomial in some practical cases. This article aims to draw a cohesive frontier between easy and hard instances for VNE. For this purpose, we consider uniform demands to focus on structural aspects, rather than packing ones. To this end, specific topologies are studied for both virtual and physical networks that arise in practice, such as trees, cycles, wheels and cliques. Some polynomial greedy or dynamic programming algorithms are proposed, when the physical network is a tree or a cycle, whereas other close cases are shown NP-hard.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Permutation Iteration Using a Singly Linked List</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for iterating over all permutations of a sequence. The algorithm leverages elementary operations on recursive lists. Within each recursive call, only two operations are required to generate all permutations (albeit in an unusual order): swapping the first two elements of the list or moving the last element to the front. As a result, no new nodes are allocated during the computation. Instead, all elements are rearranged within the original nodes of the singly linked list throughout the process. A proof of concept written in the Lisp programming language is proposed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Bounded twin-width graphs are polynomially $\chi$-bounded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every graph with twin-width $t$ has chromatic number $O(\omega ^{k_t})$ for some integer $k_t$, where $\omega$ denotes the clique number. This extends a quasi-polynomial bound from Pilipczuk and Soko{\l}owski and generalizes a result for bounded clique-width graphs by Bonamy and Pilipczuk. The proof uses the main ideas of the quasi-polynomial approach, with a different treatment of the decomposition tree. In particular, we identify two types of extensions of a class of graphs: the delayed-extension (which preserves polynomial $\chi$-boundedness) and the right-extension (which preserves polynomial $\chi$-boundedness under bounded twin-width condition). Our main result is that every bounded twin-width graph is a delayed extension of simpler classes of graphs, each expressed as a bounded union of right extensions of lower twin-width graphs.</description>

      <title>Cycles in graphs and in hypergraphs: towards homology theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this expository paper we present some ideas of algebraic topology (more precisely, of homology theory) in a language accessible to non-specialists in the area. A $1$-cycle in a graph is a set $C$ of edges such that every vertex is contained in an even number of edges from $C$. It is easy to check that the sum (modulo $2$) of $1$-cycles is a $1$-cycle. We start from the following problems: to find
  $\bullet$ the number of all $1$-cycles in a given graph;
  $\bullet$ a small number of $1$-cycles in a given graph such that any $1$-cycle is the sum of some of them.
  We consider generalizations (of these problems) to graphs with symmetry, to $2$-cycles in $2$-dimensional hypergraphs, and to certain configuration spaces of graphs (namely, to the square and the deleted square).</description>
