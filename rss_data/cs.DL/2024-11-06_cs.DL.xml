      <title>Empowering Library Users: Creative Strategies for Engagement and Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigated the integration of cutting-edge technologies and methodologies for creating dynamic, user-centered library environments. In creative strategies for engagement and innovation, library users must be empowered to undertake the new role of modernizing library services and enhancing user experiences. It also enhances the information management and user engagement. This can be attained from personalized approaches, such as recommendation systems to interactive platforms that will have effective experiences tailored to users of different natures. It investigates the consumer engagement practices of enthusiasm, sharing, and learning about their roles in cognitive, affective, and behavioural engagements. Combined, these new approaches will help promote learning, interaction, and growth, add value, and have a more positive impact on users. The challenge for libraries in this rapidly changing, technologically advancing, and digitally networked world, with a base of expectant users, is to remain relevant and engaging. This study discusses innovative strategies for empowering library users and enhancing their engagement through creative and technological approaches. This investigation was conducted to integrate cutting-edge technologies and methodologies into creating dynamic library settings that are user-centered and foster learning, interaction, and personal growth.</description>

      <title>Specification uncertainty: What the disruption index tells us about the (hidden) multiverse of bibliometric indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following Funk and Owen-Smith (2017), Wu et al. (2019) proposed the disruption index (DI1) as a bibliometric indicator that measures disruptive and consolidating research. When we summarized the literature on the disruption index for our recently published review article (Leibel &amp; Bornmann, 2024), we noticed that the calculation of disruption scores comes with numerous (hidden) degrees of freedom. In this Letter to the Editor, we explain based on the DI1 (as an example) why the analytical flexibility of bibliometric indicators potentially endangers the credibility of research and advertise the application of multiverse-style methods to increase the transparency of the research.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Interdisciplinary Knowledge Transfer with Research Paper Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the extensive recommender systems literature, novelty and diversity have been identified as key properties of useful recommendations. However, these properties have received limited attention in the specific sub-field of research paper recommender systems. In this work, we argue for the importance of offering novel and diverse research paper recommendations to scientists. This approach aims to reduce siloed reading, break down filter bubbles, and promote interdisciplinary research. We propose a novel framework for evaluating the novelty and diversity of research paper recommendations that leverages methods from network analysis and natural language processing. Using this framework, we show that the choice of representational method within a larger research paper recommendation system can have a measurable impact on the nature of downstream recommendations, specifically on their novelty and diversity. We highlight a novel paper embedding method, which we demonstrate offers more innovative and diverse recommendations without sacrificing precision, compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.</description>
