      <title>Quantitative uniform exponential acceleration of averages along decaying waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, utilizing a specific exponential weighting function, we investigate the uniform exponential convergence of weighted Birkhoff averages along decaying waves and delve into several related variants. A key distinction from traditional scenarios is evident here: despite reduced regularity in observables, our method still maintains exponential convergence. In particular, we develop new techniques that yield very precise rates of exponential convergence, as evidenced by numerical simulations. Furthermore, this innovative approach extends to quantitative analyses involving different weighting functions employed by others, surpassing the limitations inherent in prior research. It also enhances the exponential convergence rates of weighted Birkhoff averages along quasi-periodic orbits via analytic observables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the uniform exponential acceleration beyond averages along quasi-periodic or almost periodic orbits, particularly from a quantitative perspective.</description>

      <title>Forcing Minimal Interval Patterns as Interval Exchange Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any over-twist pattern is conjugate to an interval exchange transformation with bounded number of segments of isometry, restricted on one of its cycles. The bound is independent of the period and over-rotation number of the over-twist pattern and depends only on its modality.</description>

      <title>Avoshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An avoshift is a subshift where for each set $C$ from a suitable family of subsets of the shift group, the set of all possible valid extensions of a globally valid pattern on $C$ to the identity element is determined by a bounded subpattern. This property is shared (for various families of sets $C$) by for example cellwise quasigroup shifts, TEP subshifts, and subshifts of finite type with a safe symbol. In this paper we concentrate on avoshifts on polycyclic groups, when the sets $C$ are what we call ``inductive intervals''. We show that then avoshifts are a recursively enumerable subset of subshifts of finite type. Furthermore, we can effectively compute lower-dimensional projective subdynamics and certain factors (avofactors), and we can decide equality and inclusion for subshifts in this class. These results were previously known for group shifts, but our class also covers many non-algebraic examples as well as many SFTs without dense periodic points. The theory also yields new proofs of decidability of inclusion for SFTs on free groups, and SFTness of subshifts with the topological strong spatial mixing property.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of rotating rank-one strange attractors families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a two-parameter family of rotating rank-one maps defined on $\textbf{S}^1\times [1, 1+b]\times \textbf{S}^1$, with $b\gtrsim 0$, whose dynamics is characterised by a coupling of a family of planar maps exhibiting rank-one strange attractors and an Arnold family of circle maps. The main result is about the dynamics on the skew-product, which is governed by the existence and prevalence of strange attractors in the corresponding resonance tongues of the Arnold family. The strange attractors carry the unique physical measure of the system, which determines the behaviour of Lebesgue-almost all initial conditions. This phenomenon can be considered as the transition dynamics from a strange attractor with one positive Lyapunov exponent to hyperchaos. Besides an analytical rigorous proof, we illustrate the main results with numerical simulations. We also conjecture how persistent hyperchaos can be obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between thermodynamic formalism and ergodic optimization. It has been known that the Bousch operator $\mathcal{L}_A$ is tropical linear and corresponds to the Ruelle operator $\mathcal{R}_A$. In this paper, we present general idempotent analysis (tropical algebra) results, define the tropical adjoint operator $\mathcal{L}_A^{\ostar}$ which corresponds to $\mathcal{R}_A^{*}$, and study the existence and generic uniqueness of tropical eigen-densities of $\mathcal{L}_A^{\ostar}$. We also investigate the Logarithmic type zero temperature limit of equilibrium states which implies the large deviation principle. It turns out that the rate function is the tropical product of a calibrated sub-action and a tropical eigen-density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known theorem of Assouad states that metric spaces satisfying the doubling property can be snowflaked and bi-Lipschitz embedded into Euclidean spaces. Due to the invariance of many geometric properties under bi-Lipschitz maps, this result greatly facilitates the study of such spaces. We prove a non-injective analog of this embedding theorem for spaces of finite Minkowski dimension. This allows for non-doubling spaces to be weakly embedded and studied in the usual Euclidean setting. Such spaces often arise in the context of random geometry and mathematical physics with the Brownian continuum tree and Liouville quantum gravity metrics being prominent examples.</description>

      <title>Silent Orbits and Cancellations in the Wave Trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that the wave trace of a bounded and strictly convex planar domain may be arbitrarily smooth in a neighborhood of some point in the length spectrum. In other words, the Poisson relation, which asserts that the singular support of the wave trace is contained in the closure of $\pm$ the length spectrum, can almost be made into a strict inclusion. To do so, we construct large families of domains for which there exist multiple periodic billiard orbits having the same length but different Maslov indices. Using the microlocal Balian-Bloch-Zelditch parametrix for wave invariants developed in our previous paper, we solve a large system of equations for the boundary curvature jets, which leads to the required cancellations. We call such periodic orbits silent, since they are undetectable from the ostensibly audible wave trace. Such cancellations show that there are potential limitations in using the wave trace for inverse spectral problems and more fundamentally, that the Laplace spectrum and length spectrum are inherently different mathematical objects, at least insofar as the wave trace is concerned.</description>

      <title>Spectral Approximation for substitution systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study periodic approximations of aperiodic Schr\"odinger operators on lattices in Lie groups with dilation structure. The potentials arise through symbolic substitution systems that have been recently introduced in this setting. We characterize convergence of spectra of associated Schr\"odinger operators in the Hausdorff distance via properties of finite graphs. As a consequence, new examples of periodic approximations are obtained. We further prove that there are substitution systems that do not admit periodic approximations in higher dimensions, in contrast to the one-dimensional case. On the other hand, if the spectra converge, then we show that the rate of convergence is necessarily exponentially fast. These results are new even for substitutions over $\mathbb{Z}^d$.</description>

Abstract: We give examples of Anosov actions of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ on the $d$-torus $T^d$ that cannot be homotoped to a smooth action on $T^d\#\Sigma$, for certain exotic $d$-spheres $\Sigma$. This is deduced using work of Krannich, Kupers, and the authors that, in particular, computes the mapping class group of $T^d\#\Sigma$.</description>

      <title>Fredholm Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09484v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the family of explainable machine-learning, we present Fredholm neural networks (Fredholm NNs), deep neural networks (DNNs) which replicate fixed point iterations for the solution of linear and nonlinear Fredholm Integral Equations (FIE) of the second kind. Applications of FIEs include the solution of ordinary, as well as partial differential equations (ODEs, PDEs) and many more. We first prove that Fredholm NNs provide accurate solutions. We then provide insight into the values of the hyperparameters and trainable/explainable weights and biases of the DNN, by directly connecting their values to the underlying mathematical theory. For our illustrations, we use Fredholm NNs to solve both linear and nonlinear problems, including elliptic PDEs and boundary value problems. We show that the proposed scheme achieves significant numerical approximation accuracy across both the domain and boundary. The proposed methodology provides insight into the connection between neural networks and classical numerical methods, and we posit that it can have applications in fields such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Thus, we believe that it will trigger further advances in the intersection between scientific machine learning and numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Periodic Trading Activities in Financial Markets: Mean-field Liquidation Game with Major-Minor Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent empirical findings on the periodic phenomenon of aggregated market volumes in equity markets, we aim to understand the causes and consequences of periodic trading activities through a game-theoretic perspective, examining market interactions among different types of participants. Specifically, we introduce a new mean-field liquidation game involving major and minor traders, where the major trader evaluates her strategy against a periodic targeting strategy while a continuum of minor players trade against her. We establish the existence and uniqueness of an open-loop Nash equilibrium. In addition, we prove an O(1/sqrt N) approximation rate of the mean-field solution to the Nash equilibrium in a major-minor game with N minor players. In equilibrium, minor traders exhibit front-running behaviors in both the periodic and trend components of their strategies, reducing the major trader's profit. Such strategic interactions diminish the strength of periodicity in both overall trading volume and asset prices. Our model rationalizes observed periodic trading activities in the market and offers new insights into market dynamics.</description>

      <title>31 Lectures on Geometric Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This textbook for learning geometric mechanics is written in the format of lecture notes. These lecture notes in geometric mechanics are meant to convey insight through clear definitions and workable examples. The lecture format adopted here is intended to convey the immediacy of the taught course and to be useful as a basis for other courses. The lecture notes comprise:
  AP = Applications of Pure maths, e.g., Noether's theorem: Lie group symmetry of Hamilton's variational principle implies conservation laws for its equations of motion.\smallskip
  PA = Purifications of Applied maths, e.g., Euler fluid dynamics describes geodesic flow on the manifold of smooth invertible maps acting on the domain of flow. \smallskip
  Both AP and PA appear here, though the difference is not mentioned. It is left to the reader to decide whether it was AP or PA in each of the lectures containing well over sixty solved exercises.
  An aspect of modern applications emphasised here is the use of the composition of evolutionary maps for multi-physics, multi-timescale interactions including waves interacting with flows in the Euler--Poincar\'e framework in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) for ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for applications in plasma physics such as magnetic confinement fusion (MFC) and astrophysical processes such as Alfv\'en waves and gravity waves propagating on the Solar tachocline. The topics covered in each lecture can also be gleaned from its table of contents listed at the onset of each lecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that shift equivalence of essential adjacency matrices coincides with gauge-equivariant homotopy equivalence of their stabilized graph C*-algebras. This provide the first equivalent formulation of shift equivalence of essential matrices in terms of gauge actions on graph C*-algebras. Our proof uses bicategory theory for C*-bimodules developed by Meyer and Sehnem, allowing us to avoid the use of K-theory classification of C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Generalised Skew-Symmetric Replicator Equations via Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that there is a one-to-one mapping between oriented directed graphs and zero-sum replicator dynamics (Lotka-Volterra equations) and that furthermore these dynamics are Hamiltonian in an appropriately defined nonlinear Poisson bracket. In this paper, we investigate the problem of determining whether these dynamics are Liouville-Arnold integrable, building on prior work graph in graph decloning by Evripidou et al. [J. Phys. A., 55:325201, 2022] and graph embedding by Paik and Griffin [Phys. Rev. E. 107(5): L052202, 2024]. Using the embedding procedure from Paik and Griffin, we show (with certain caveats) that when a graph producing integrable dynamics is embedded in another graph producing integrable dynamics, the resulting graph structure also produces integrable dynamics. We also construct a new family of graph structures that produces integrable dynamics that does not arise either from embeddings or decloning. We use these results to classify the dynamics generated by almost all oriented directed graphs on six vertices, with three hold-out graphs that generate integrable dynamics and are not part of a natural taxonomy arising from known families and graph operations. These hold-out graphs suggest more structure is available to be found. Moreover, the work suggests that oriented directed graphs leading to integrable dynamics may be classifiable in an analogous way to the classification of finite simple groups, creating the possibility that there is a deep connection between integrable dynamics and combinatorial structures in graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we resolve a question of D'Achille, Curien, Enriquez, Lyons, and \"Unel by showing that the cells of the ideal Poisson Voronoi tessellation are indistinguishable. This follows from an application of the Howe-Moore theorem and a theorem of Meyerovitch about the nonexistence of thinnings of the Poisson point process. We also give an alternative proof of Meyerovitch's theorem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We associate a $C^*$-algebra to a partial action of the integers acting on the base space of a vector bundle, using the framework of Cuntz--Pimsner algebras. We investigate the structure of the fixed point algebra under the canonical gauge action, and show that it arises from a continuous field of $C^*$-algebras over the base space, generalising results of Vasselli. We also analyse the ideal structure, and show that for a free action, ideals correspond to open invariant subspaces of the base space. This shows that if the action is free and minimal, then the Cuntz--Pimsner algebra is simple. Finally we establish a bijective corrrespondence between tracial states and invariant measures on the base space, thereby calculating part of the Elliott invariant. This generalizes results about the $C^*$-algebras associated to homeomorphisms twisted by vector bundles of Adamo, Archey, Forough, Georgescu, Jeong, Strung and Viola.</description>

Abstract: Fast-slow systems with three slow variables and gradient structure in the fast variables have, generically, hyperbolic umbilic, elliptic umbilic or swallowtail singularities. In this article we provide a detailed local analysis of a fast-slow system near a hyperbolic umbilic singularity. In particular, we show that under some appropriate non-degeneracy conditions on the slow flow, the attracting slow manifolds jump onto the fast regime and fan out as they cross the hyperbolic umbilic singularity. The analysis is based on the blow-up technique, in which the hyperbolic umbilic point is blown up to a 5-dimensional sphere. Moreover, the reduced slow flow is also blown up and embedded into the blown-up fast formulation. Further, we describe how our analysis is related to classical theories such as catastrophe theory and constrained differential equations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a finite-range potential on a bidimensional full shift on a finite alphabet that exhibits a zero-temperature chaotic behavior as introduced by van Enter and Ruszel. This is the phenomenon where there exists a sequence of temperatures that converges to zero for which the whole set of equilibrium measures at these given temperatures oscillates between two sets of ground states. Br\'emont's work shows that the phenomenon of non-convergence does not exist for finite-range potentials in dimension one for finite alphabets; Leplaideur obtained a different proof for the same fact. Chazottes and Hochman provided the first example of non-convergence in higher dimensions $d\geq3$; we extend their result for $d=2$ and highlight the importance of two estimates of recursive nature that are crucial for this proof: the relative complexity and the reconstruction function of an extension.
  We note that a different proof of this result was found by Chazottes and Shinoda, at around the same time that this article was initially submitted and that a strong generalization has been found by Gayral, Sablik and Taati.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient flocking with nonlinear navigational feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05181v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling collective motion in multi-agent systems has gained significant attention. Of particular interest are sufficient conditions for flocking dynamics. We present a generalization of the multi-agent model of Olfati--Saber with nonlinear navigational feedback forces. Unlike the original model, ours is not generally dissipative and lacks an obvious Lyapunov function. We address this by proposing a method to prove the existence of an attractor without relying on LaSalle's principle. Other contributions are as follows. We prove that, under mild conditions, agents' velocities approach the center of mass velocity exponentially, with the distance between the center of mass and the virtual leader being bounded. In the dissipative case, we show existence of a broad class of nonlinear control forces for which the attractor does not contain periodic trajectories, which cannot be ruled out by LaSalle's principle. Finally, we conduct a computational investigation of the problem of reducing propulsion energy consumption by selecting appropriate navigational feedback forces.</description>

      <title>Almost 1-1 extensions of Furstenberg-Weiss type and test for amenability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite residually finite group. We show that for every minimal equicontinuous Cantor system $(Z,G)$ with a free orbit, and for every minimal extension $(Y,G)$ of $(Z,G)$, there exist a minimal almost 1-1 extension $(X,G)$ of $(Z,G)$ and a Borel equivariant map $\psi:Y\to X$ that induces an affine bijection $\psi^*$ between $M(Y,G)$ and $M(X,G)$, the spaces of invariant probability measures of $(Y,G)$ and $(X,G)$, respectively. If $Y$ is a Cantor set, then $(Y,G)$ and $(X,G)$ are Borel isomorphic, i.e., $\psi^*$ is also a homeomorphism. As an application, we show that the family of Toeplitz subshifts is a test for amenability for residually finite groups, i.e., a residually finite group $G$ is amenable if and only if every Toeplitz $G$-subshift has invariant probability measures.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Delayed Predator-Prey Model for Puma Concolor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a mathematical model that describes the relationship between the Puma concolor and its prey using delay differential equations, a Holling type III functional response, logistic growth for the prey, and a Ricker-type function to model intraspecific competition of the pumas. For positive equilibrium, conditions guaranteeing absolute stability are established, based on the delay value and model parameters. The analysis demonstrates the existence of a unique maximal solution for the proposed model, which remains non-negative for nonnegative initial conditions and is well-defined for all $t$ greater than zero. Furthermore, numerical simulations with different parameter values were performed to investigate the effects of systematically removing a percentage of predators or prey. Numerical simulations attempt to exemplify and put into practice the theorems proved in this article.</description>

      <title>Learning Noise-Robust Stable Koopman Operator for Control with Physics-Informed Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel learning framework for Koopman operator of nonlinear dynamical systems that is informed by the governing equation and guarantees long-time stability and robustness to noise. In contrast to existing frameworks where either ad-hoc observables or blackbox neural networks are used to construct observables in the extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD), our observables are informed by governing equations via Polyflow. To improve the noise robustness and guarantee long-term stability, we designed a stable parameterization of the Koopman operator together with a progressive learning strategy for roll-out recurrent loss. To further improve model performance in the phase space, a simple iterative strategy of data augmentation was developed. Numerical experiments of prediction and control of classic nonlinear systems with ablation study showed the effectiveness of the proposed techniques over several state-of-the-art practices.</description>

Abstract: We study the entropy of Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measure of the geodesic flow on convex real projective surfaces, and shows that the Hilbert area tends to infinity if the entropy tends to zero. For the Blaschke metric, the area tends to infinity if and only if the entropy tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Non-autonomous iteration of polynomials in the complex plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a sequence $(p_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ of polynomials with uniformly bounded zeros and $\deg p_1\geq 1$, $\deg p_n\geq 2$ for $n\geq 2$, satisfying certain asymptotic conditions. We prove that the function sequence $\left(\frac{1}{\deg p_n\cdot...\cdot \deg p_1}\log^+|p_n\circ...\circ p_1|\right)_{n=1}^\infty$ is uniformly convergent in $\mathbb{C}$. The non-autonomous filled Julia set $\mathcal{K}[(p_{n})_{n=1}^\infty]$ generated by the polynomial sequence $(p_{n})_{n=1}^\infty$ is defined and shown to be compact and regular with respect to the Green function. Our toy example is generated by $t_n=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}T_n,\ n\in\{1,2,...\}$, where $T_n$ is the classical Chebyshev polynomial of degree $n$.</description>

      <title>Computational symplectic topology and symmetric orbits in the restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a computational approach to proving the Birkhoff conjecture on the restricted three-body problem, which asserts the existence of a disk-like global surface of section. Birkhoff had conjectured this surface of section as a tool to prove existence of a direct periodic orbit. Using techniques from validated numerics we prove the existence of an approximately circular direct orbit for a wide range of mass parameters and Jacobi energies. We also provide methods to rigorously compute the Conley-Zehnder index of periodic Hamiltonian orbits using computational tools, thus giving some initial steps for developing computational Floer homology and providing the means to prove the Birkhoff conjecture via symplectic topology. We apply this method to various symmetric orbits in the restricted three-body problem.</description>
