      <title>The Innovation Tax: Generative AI Adoption, Productivity Paradox, and Systemic Risk in the U.S. Banking Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the causal impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) adoption on productivity and systemic risk in the U.S. banking sector. Using a novel dataset linking SEC 10-Q filings to Federal Reserve regulatory data for 809 financial institutions over 2018--2025, we employ two complementary identification strategies: Dynamic Spatial Durbin Models (DSDM) to capture network spillovers and Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SDID) for causal inference using the November 2022 ChatGPT release as an exogenous shock. Our findings reveal a striking ``Productivity Paradox'': while DSDM estimates show that AI-adopting banks are high performers ($\beta &gt; 0$), the causal SDID analysis documents a significant ``Implementation Tax'' -- adopting banks experience a 428-basis-point decline in ROE as they absorb GenAI integration costs. This tax falls disproportionately on smaller institutions, with bottom-quartile banks suffering a 517-basis-point ROE decline compared to 129 basis points for larger banks, suggesting that economies of scale provide significant advantages in AI implementation. Most critically, our DSDM analysis reveals significant positive spillovers ($\theta = 0.161$ for ROA, $p &lt; 0.01$; $\theta = 0.679$ for ROE, $p &lt; 0.05$), with spillovers among large banks reaching $\theta = 3.13$ for ROE, indicating that the U.S. banking system is becoming ``algorithmically coupled.'' This synchronization of AI-driven decision-making creates a new channel for systemic contagion: a technical failure in widely-adopted AI models could trigger correlated shocks across the entire financial network.</description>

      <title>A Novel approach to portfolio construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for asset selection and portfolio construction, termed the Best-Path Algorithm Sparse Graphical Model (BPASGM). The method extends the Best-Path Algorithm (BPA) by mapping linear and non-linear dependencies among a large set of financial assets into a sparse graphical model satisfying a structural Markov property. Based on this representation, BPASGM performs a dependence-driven screening that removes positively or redundantly connected assets, isolating subsets that are conditionally independent or negatively correlated. This step is designed to enhance diversification and reduce estimation error in high-dimensional portfolio settings. Portfolio optimization is then conducted on the selected subset using standard mean-variance techniques. BPASGM does not aim to improve the theoretical mean-variance optimum under known population parameters, but rather to enhance realized performance in finite samples, where sample-based Markowitz portfolios are highly sensitive to estimation error. Monte Carlo simulations show that BPASGM-based portfolios achieve more stable risk-return profiles, lower realized volatility, and superior risk-adjusted performance compared to standard mean-variance portfolios. Empirical results for U.S. equities, global stock indices, and foreign exchange rates over 1990-2025 confirm these findings and demonstrate a substantial reduction in portfolio cardinality. Overall, BPASGM offers a statistically grounded and computationally efficient framework that integrates sparse graphical modeling with portfolio theory for dependence-aware asset selection.</description>

      <title>ESG Risk: Lessons Learned from Utility Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new class of monetary risk measures for assessing financial and ESG risk. The construction is based on classical shortfall risk measures with loss function replaced by a multi-attribute utility function. We present an extensive theoretical analysis of these risk measures, showing specifically how properties of the utility function translate into properties of the associated risk measure. We furthermore discuss how these multi-attribute risk measures can be used to compute minimum risk portfolios and show in a numerical study that accounting for ESG risk in optimal portfolio choice has a significant influence on the composition of portfolios.</description>
