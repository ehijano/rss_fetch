      <title>Black-Hole Cartography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes (QNMs) are usually characterized by their time dependence; oscillations at specific frequencies predicted by black hole (BH) perturbation theory. QNMs are routinely identified in the ringdown of numerical relativity waveforms, are widely used in waveform modeling, and underpin key tests of general relativity and of the nature of compact objects; a program sometimes called BH spectroscopy. Perturbation theory also predicts a specific spatial shape for each QNM perturbation. For the Kerr metric, these are the ($s=-2$) spheroidal harmonics. Spatial information can be extracted from numerical relativity by fitting a feature with known time dependence to all of the spherical harmonic modes, allowing the shape of the feature to be reconstructed; a program initiated here and that we call BH cartography. Accurate spatial reconstruction requires fitting to many spherical harmonics and is demonstrated using highly accurate Cauchy-characteristic numerical relativity waveforms. The loudest QNMs are mapped, and their reconstructed shapes are found to match the spheroidal harmonic predictions. The cartographic procedure is also applied to the quadratic QNMs - nonlinear features in the ringdown - and their reconstructed shapes are compared with predictions from second-order perturbation theory. BH cartography allows us to determine the viewing angles that maximize the amplitude of the quadratic QNMs, an important guide for future searches, and is expected to lead to an improved understanding of nonlinearities in BH ringdown.</description>

      <title>Structure, maximum mass, and stability of compact stars in f(Q,T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physically based changes to general relativity (GR) often predict significant differences in how spacetime behaves near massive neutron stars. One of these modifications is represented by $f(\mathcal{Q}, { \mathcal{T}})$, with $\mathcal{Q}$ being the non-metricity and ${ \mathit{T}}$ representing the energy-momentum tensor trace. This theory is viewed as a neutral expansion of GR. Neutron stars weighing more than 1.8 times the mass of the Sun, when observed as radio pulsars, provide valuable opportunities to test fundamental physics under extreme conditions that are rare in the observable universe and cannot be replicated in experiments conducted on land. We derive an exact solution through utilizing the form $f(\mathcal{Q}, { \mathcal{T}})=\mathcal{Q}+\psi { \mathcal{T}}$, where $\psi$ represents a dimensional expression. We elucidate that all physical quantities within the star can be expressed using the dimensional parameter $\psi$ and the compactness, which is defined as $C=\frac{ 2GM}{Rc^2}$. We set $\psi$ to a maximum value of $\psi_1=\frac{\psi}{\kappa^2}=-0.04$ in the negative range, based on observational constraints related to radius and mass of the pulsar ${\textit SAX J1748.9-2021}$. Here, ${\mathrm \kappa^2}$ represents the coupling constant of Einstein, defined as ${\mathrm \kappa^2=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}}$. Unlike in GR, the solution we derived results in a stable compact object without violating the conjectured sound speed condition $c_s^2\leq\frac{c^2}3$.It is crucial to mention that no equations of state were assumed in this investigation. Nevertheless, our model fits nicely with linear form. Generally, when $\psi$ is negative, the theory predicts a star with a slightly larger size than GR for the same mass. The difference in predicted size between the theory with a negative $\psi$ and GR for the same mass is attributed to an additional force.</description>

      <title>Probing hidden topology with quantum detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the transition rate of a static Unruh-DeWitt detector in two $(2+1)$-dimensional black hole spacetimes that are isometric to the static Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole outside the horizon but have no asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter exterior behind the horizon. The spacetimes are the $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}$ geon, with spatial topology $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}\setminus\{\text{point at infinity}\}$, and the Swedish geon of \AA{}minneborg et al, with spatial topology $T^{2}\setminus\{\text{point at infinity}\}$. For a conformal scalar field, prepared in the Hartle-Hawking-type state that is induced from the global vacuum on the anti-de Sitter covering space, we show numerically that the detector's transition rate distinguishes the two spacetimes, particularly at late exterior times, and we trace this phenomenon to the differences in the isometries that are broken by the quotient construction from the universal covering space. Our results provide an example in which information about the interior topology of a black hole is accessible to a quantum observer outside the black hole.</description>

      <title>Existence of Vacuum Wormholes in Einsteinian Cubic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wormhole solutions in gravitational theories typically require exotic matter. Here we present a wormhole solution to the field equations of Einsteinian Cubic Gravity -- a phenomenological competitor to general relativity that includes terms cubic in the curvature -- that has no matter, exotic or otherwise. These purely gravitational wormhole geometries are asymptotically AdS but contain a geometric deficit at infinity. The deficit, interpreted as a global monopole, plays an essential role in our construction. We find that our wormhole solution satisfies traversablility criteria. We also find, for different parameters, a range of possible wormhole solutions.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in Gauss-Bonnet extended Starobinsky gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a class of Gauss-Bonnet extended Starobinsky gravity was proposed, allowing black holes to carry ghost-free massive scalar hair for the first time without requiring additional matter fields. This intriguing feature offers a new perspective for understanding higher-curvature pure gravity and highlights the importance of further studying the potential effects of Gauss-Bonnet extensions in gravitational systems beyond black holes. In this study, we investigate the properties of neutron stars within this model, focusing on how the higher-curvature terms, particularly the coupling between the Gauss-Bonnet term and the curvature-squared term, impact the stellar structure. We present a detailed analysis of these effects and compute the moment of inertia for rotating neutron stars under the slow-rotation approximation. The substantial differences in the moment of inertia between general relativity and Gauss-Bonnet extended Starobinsky gravity are expected to be detectable through future high-precision observations.</description>

      <title>Thin accretion disk around black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the accretion process in a thin disk surrounding a supermassive black hole within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar (EMS) gravity. Our investigation aims to elucidate how variations in model parameters affect different physical properties of the disk. When keeping EMS parameters $\beta$ and $q$ constant, we observe a reduction in radiation flux and temperature as $\alpha$ increases. However, the luminosity and radiative efficiency exhibit relatively minor variation. Conversely, under fixed $\alpha$ and $q$, an escalation in $\beta$ leads to heightened levels of radiation flux, temperature, luminosity, and radiative efficiency. These results underscore the diverse influences of model parameters on observable metrics, providing valuable insights for the astronomical study of distinct black holes.</description>

      <title>Weak Gravity Conjecture Validation with Photon Spheres of Quantum Corrected AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom Black Holes in Kiselev Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) in the context of quantum-corrected AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom (AdS-RN) black holes within Kiselev spacetime. Our focus is on photon spheres, which serve as markers for stable and unstable photon spheres. We confirm the validity of the WGC by demonstrating that quantum corrections do not alter the essential charge-to-mass ratio, thereby supporting the conjecture's universality. Our analysis reveals that black holes with a charge greater than their mass ($Q &gt; M$) possess photon spheres or exhibit a total topological charge of the photon sphere (PS = -1), which upholds the WGC. This finding is significant as it reinforces the conjecture's applicability even in the presence of quantum corrections. Furthermore, we examine various parameter configurations to understand their impact on the WGC. Specifically, we find that configurations with $\omega = -\frac{1}{3}$ and $\omega = -1$ maintain the conjecture, indicating that these values do not disrupt the charge-to-mass ratio required by the WGC. However, for $\omega = -\frac{4}{3}$, the conjecture does not hold, suggesting that this particular parameter value leads to deviations from the expected behavior. These results open new directions for research in quantum gravity, as they highlight the importance of specific parameter values in maintaining the WGC. The findings suggest that while the WGC is robust under certain conditions, there are scenarios where it may be challenged, prompting further investigation into the underlying principles of quantum gravity</description>

      <title>Characterization of non-Gaussian stochastic signals with heavier-tailed likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future Gravitational Wave observatories will give us the opportunity to search for stochastic signals of astrophysical, or even cosmological origins. However, parameter estimation and search will be challenging, mostly due to the overlap of multiple signal components, as well as the potentially partially unknown properties of the instrumental noise. In this work, we propose a robust statistical framework based on heavier-tailed likelihoods for the characterization of stochastic gravitational-wave signals. In particular, we use the symmetric hyperbolic likelihood, which allows us to probe the signal spectral properties and simultaneously test for any departures from Gaussianity. We demonstrate this methodology with synthetic data from the future LISA mission, where we estimate the potential non-Gaussianities induced by the unresolved Ultra Compact Galactic Binaries.</description>

      <title>Observational imprints from Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology assumes a homogeneous and isotropic universe that undergoes a period of exponential expansion very early on, named inflation. This stretches quantum fluctuations from the onset of inflation to cosmological scales, which seed the temperature, polarization and matter anisotropies that we observe. However, this paradigm ignores pre-inflationary physics, as shortly before inflation there is the initial big-bang singularity. Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) is a promising approach to quantum cosmology. Its most outstanding result is that of the resolution of the classical initial singularity in terms of a quantum bounce that connects a contracting branch of the Universe with an expanding one. Consequently, it provides singularity-free pre-inflationary dynamics. Within this context, it is no longer justified to consider that every mode of the cosmological perturbations reaches the onset of inflation in the natural vacuum state of standard cosmology. In fact, some modes might reach it in an excited state, which may leave imprints in their power spectra at the end of inflation and therefore in observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The goal of this thesis is to search for such imprints from LQC in the CMB. We work in the hybrid approach to cosmological perturbations in LQC.</description>

      <title>Probing the massive scalar mode in the levitated sensor detector of gravitational wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the mass scale associated with the scalar longitudinal mode signal of gravitational wave predicted by modified theories of gravity, it should propagate at a subluminal speed and with a different frequency compared to the massless tensor mode signals which moves at the speed of light and are present in both standard general relativity and modified theories. This is ensured by the massless and massive dispersion relations obeyed respectively by the tensor and scalar modes of gravitational wave coming from a given source and thus having the same propagation vector. We show that because of its wider operational frequency band the recently designed levitated sensor detector \cite{Aggarwal} of gravitational wave has a better chance of detecting both the scalar and tensor modes at these different frequencies and thus can provide observational evidence in favour of modified theories of gravity over general relativity. This detector works on the principle of optical trapping \cite{Ashkin_1970} of a dielectric nanosphere sensor\cite{Geraci}. By adjusting the intensity of the optical beam the frequency of the harmonic potential trap can be varied widely so that the nanosphere sensor can undergo distinct resonant transitions induced by the tensor and scalar modes. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the sensor mass obeys a geodesic deviation equation in the proper detector frame and construct a quantum mechanical description of this system in modified gravity framework to compute the probabilities of resonant transitions in response to incoming gravitational wave signals of both periodic and aperiodic kind.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Mode Couplings in Rotating Black Holes and Their Detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic quasinormal modes encode fundamental properties of black hole spacetimes. They are also one of the key ingredients of nonlinearities of General Relativity in the ringdown stage of binary black hole coalescence. In this work, we classify all possible quadratic coupling channels of quasinormal modes for a generic Kerr black hole, and use a frequency-domain pseudospectral code with hyperboloidal slicing to calculate these couplings. After accounting for all the channels in systems with reflection symmetry, our results become consistent with those extracted from numerical simulations and time-domain fits. We explore several observationally relevant quadratic modes and their detectability with third-generation ground-based detectors like Cosmic Explorer, as well as the space-borne detector LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna). We find that several quadratic modes are detectable by both detectors. In addition, we make a theoretical prediction for how the signal-to-noise ratio of a quadratic quasinormal mode depends on the properties of progenitor binaries, offering insight into selecting golden events in future ringdown data analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the Quantum Brownian motion of a point particle induced by the quantum vacuum fluctuations of a real massless scalar field in Einstein universe under Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions is studied. Using the Wightman functions, general expressions for the renormalized dispersion of the physical momentum are derived. Distinct expressions are found for the dispersion associated with each component of the particle physical momentum, indicating that the global properties of homogeneity and isotropy of space are lost, as a consequence of the introduced boundary conditions. Divergences also arise and are related to the compact nature of Einstein universe and the introduced boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>The Equivalence Principle is NOT a Noether Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between the Equivalence Principle and Noether's theorem was discussed in S. Capozziello and C. Ferrara, Int. J. Geom. Meth. Mod. Phys. 21, 2440014 (2024). However, it is known that the Noether symmetry condition is independent of the equations of motions as follows from Hamilton's Principle. In this paper, we critically examine the analysis presented in the aforementioned work, highlighting its flaws, and provide a detailed demonstration that there is no connection between Noether's theorem and the Equivalence Principle. Furthermore, we offer various insights on symmetry analysis to prevent the perpetuation of inaccuracies regarding Noether's work.</description>

      <title>Effects of waveform systematics on inferences of neutron star population properties and the nuclear equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from inspiralling neutron stars carry information about matter at extreme gravity and density. The binary neutron star (BNS) event GW170817 provided, for the first time, insight into dense matter through this window. Since then, another BNS (GW190425) and several neutron star-black hole events have been detected, although the tidal measurements were not expected to be well-constrained from them. Collective information regarding the behavior of nuclear matter at extreme densities can be done by performing a joint population inference for the masses, spins, and equation-of-state [1] to enable better understanding. This population inference, in turn, relies on accurate estimates of intrinsic parameters of individual events. In this study, we investigate how the differences in parameter inference of BNS events using different waveform models can affect the eventual inference of the nuclear equation-of-state. We use the state-of-the-art model TEOBResumS with IMRPhenomD NRTidalv2 as a comparison model.</description>

      <title>Distinguishability of a naked singularity from a black hole in dynamics and radiative signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can a naked singularity (NkS) be distinguished from a black hole (BH)? We have investigated it with cutting-edge general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, followed by general relativistic radiation transfer (GRRT) calculation for magnetized accretion flow around NkS and BH. Based on our simulations, the accreting matter close enough to the singularity repels due to effective potential. This prevents matter from reaching a NkS and forms a quasi-spherical symmetric density distribution around it, unlike the accretion flows around a BH. We observe an order of magnitude higher mass flux through the jet and much stronger wind from a NkS than a BH. We found that the jet launching mechanism in a NkS differs significantly from that in a BH. In the horizon-scale images, a NKs shows a photon arc instead of a photon ring that is shown around a BH. In summary, the flow dynamics and radiative properties around an NkS are distinctly different from a BH. These properties would be useful to either confirm or rule out such exotic compact objects through future observations.</description>

      <title>To stealth or not to stealth: Thermodynamics of stealth black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Euclidean methods we investigate the thermodynamics of stealth black hole solutions, which are solutions that geometrically are indistinguishable from those of general relativity, however they are accompanied by a non-trivial additional field that does not back-react to the metric. We find that in general, one can observe shifts in the mass and/or the entropy of such black holes, hence, at least at the thermodynamic level, the stealth solutions may be distinguished by the those of general relativity. We also point out an example, the {\it{bona fide stealth}}, where a non-trivial scalar field can accompany an (A)dS-Schwarzschild black hole without altering the thermodynamic quantities. We point out that thermodynamic discrepancies arise due to the additional boundary terms emanating from the stealth fields, where care should be given in order for the theory at hand to possess a well-defined variational procedure.</description>

      <title>On the use of galaxy catalogs in gravitational-wave parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in gravitational-wave multi-messenger astrophysics is the imprecise localization of gravitational-wave compact binary mergers. We investigate the use of a method to include galaxy catalog information in performing parameter estimation of these events. We test its effectiveness with the gravitational-wave events GW170817, GW190425, and GW190814, as well as with simulated binary neutron star mergers. For GW170817, we recover the true host galaxy as the most probable galaxy after a straightforward mass reweighting, with significantly decreased localization area and volume. On the simulated sample, however, we do not find improvement compared to performing a simple galaxy catalog crossmatch with a regular gravitational wave localization. Future investigations into sampling methods may yield improvements that increase the viability of this method.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background anisotropies from inflation with non-Bunch-Davies states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been known that stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) have anisotropies generated by squeezed-type tensor non-Gaussianities originating from scalar-tensor-tensor (STT) and tensor-tensor-tensor cubic interactions. While the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities in the standard slow-roll inflation with the Bunch-Davies vacuum state are suppressed due to the so-called consistency relation, those in extended models with the violation of the consistency relation can be enhanced. Among such extended models, we consider the inflation model with the non-Bunch-Davies state that has been known to enhance the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities. We explicitly formulate the primordial STT bispectrum induced during inflation in the context of Horndeski theory with the non-Bunch-Davies state and show that the induced SGWB anisotropies can be enhanced. We then discuss the detectability of those anisotropies in future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Alleviation of anomalies from the non-oscillatory vacuum in loop quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate observational signatures of a primordial power spectrum with exponential infrared suppression, motivated by the choice of a non-oscillatory vacuum in a bouncing and inflationary geometry within Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). We leave the parameter that defines the scale at which suppression occurs free and perform a Bayesian analysis, comparing with CMB data. The data shows a preference for some of the suppression to be within the observable window. Guided by this analysis, we choose concrete illustrative values for this parameter. We show that the model affects only slightly the parity anomaly, but it is capable of alleviating the lensing and power suppression anomalies.</description>

      <title>Real particle geodesics and thermodynamics of a black hole in Regular Schwarzschild-Anti de Sitter space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regular Schwarzschild Anti-de-Sitter (RSch-AdS) spacetime, which is a maximally symmetric and Lorentzian manifold of negative curvature, is a solution of Einstein's field equations with a negative cosmological constant and a matter source with a Gaussian distribution. Studying of black hole (BH) in such a spacetime, known as RSch-AdS black hole, can be instructive from various aspects and lead to a better understanding of them. In this regard, geodesics of real particles around RSch-AdS black holes and RSch-AdS thermodynamics of BH are two important issues that we are going to evaluate in this research. For this purpose, we first obtain the geodesics of real particles based on the changes in the values of effective parameters such as mass distribution, angular momentum and cosmological constant numerically according to boundary conditions and interpret their behavior. Second, using the laws of thermodynamics, some aspects of BH, defined in this spacetime, such as temperature, entropy, heat capacity and Gibbs free energy are studied and discussed</description>

Abstract: We consider the bending of light around a compact astrophysical object with both the electric field and the magnetic field in Einstein-Born-Infeld theory. From the null geodesic of a light ray passing a massive object with electric charge and magnetic dipole, the effective metric was obtained from the light cone condition reflecting the nonlinear electromagnetic effects. We found the asymptotic form of the effective metric up to the first order in gravitational constant $G$ and Born-Infeld parameter $1/\beta^2$ on the equatorial plane. Then we compute the bending angle of light from the geodesic equation. The result includes particular cases where only one type of field is present taking the appropriate limits.</description>

Abstract: We re-consider the graviton self-energy induced by a loop of massless, minimally coupled scalars on de Sitter background. On flat space background it can be represented as a sum of two tensor differential operators acting on scalar structure functions. On a general background these tensor differential operators can be constructed from the linearized Ricci scalar and the linearized Weyl tensor. However, in cosmology one requires a third contribution which we derive here.</description>

Abstract: We propose that moments of time arise through the failed emergence of the temporal diffeomorphism as gauge symmetry, and that the passage of time is a continual process of an instantaneous state collapsing toward a gauge-invariant state. Unitarity and directedness of the resulting time evolution are demonstrated for a minisuperspace model of cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates whether phantom scalar fields combined with nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) can serve as sources for generalized Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole (GEB) spacetimes. This generalization of the Ellis-Bronnikov metric holds significant relevance in the literature and introduces a free parameter $m \geq 2$, recovering the original case when $m=2$. We derive analytical expressions for the scalar field, potential, and NED Lagrangian in magnetic and electric cases. Notably, we explicitly express the Lagrangian as a function of the electromagnetic invariant $\mathcal{F}$ for the magnetic solution. These results provide new insights into the field sources for more general wormhole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Bulk-local dS$_3$ holography: the Matter with $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which builds a concrete dual for large-radius 3d de Sitter with a timelike York boundary for both gravity and bulk effective fields. This generalizes the solvable $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ deformation, whose finite real spectrum accounts for the refined Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a microstate count while reproducing the radial static patch geometry. The required generalization to produce approximately local boundary conditions for bulk quantum fields requires a scheme for defining double-trace operators dual to deformed boundary conditions to realize the finite timelike boundary, valid at finite N. By starting with a small stint of a pure $T\bar T$ trajectory, the theory becomes finite, enabling well-defined subtractions to define the double-trace deformation so as to match the large-N prescription of Hartman, Kruthoff, Shaghoulian, and Tajdini to good approximation. We incorporate the matter effecting an uplift from negative to positive cosmological constant, and analyze the effect of matter on the energy spectrum of the theory arising from time-dependent bulk excitations. This validates the cosmic horizon $dS_3$ microstate count for large-radius $dS_3$ holography, embedding $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ concretely into a larger theory consistent with bulk locality for matter fields. We comment briefly on potential upgrades to four dimensions and other future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) have revealed surprising properties of binary black hole (BBH) populations, but there is still mystery surrounding how these compact objects evolve. We apply Bayesian inference and an efficient method to calculate the BBH merger rates in the Shark host galaxies, to determine the combination of COMPAS parameters that outputs a population most like the GW sources from the LVK transient catalogue. For our COMPAS models, we calculate the likelihood with and without the dependence on the predicted number of BBH merger events. We find strong correlations between hyper-parameters governing the specific angular momentum (AM) of mass lost during mass transfer, the mass-loss rates of Wolf-Rayet stars via winds and the chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) formation channel. We conclude that analysing the marginalised and unmarginalised likelihood is a good indicator of whether the population parameters distribution and number of observed events reflect the LVK data. In doing so, we see that the majority of the models preferred in terms of the population-level parameters of the BBHs greatly overpredict the number of events we should have observed to date. Looking at the smaller number of models which perform well with both likelihoods, we find that those with no CHE, AM loss occurring closer to the donor during the first mass-transfer event, and/or higher rates of mass-loss from Wolf-Rayet winds are generally preferred by current data. We find these conclusions to be robust to our choice of selection criteria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Robinson-Trautman solution in the Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ system admits a shear-free and twist-free null geodesic congruence with a nonvanishing expansion. Restricting to the case where the Maxwell field is aligned, i.e., the spacetime is algebraically special, we provide an exhaustive classification of supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman spacetimes in the four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity. The differential constraints that arise from the integrability conditions of the Killing spinor equation enable us to systematically reconstruct the metric. We derive the explicit form of the Killing spinor either by directly integrating the Killing spinor equation or by casting the solution into the canonical form of supersymmetric solutions given in hep-th/0307022. In any case, the supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman solution generically exhibits a naked singularity.</description>

      <title>Beltrami fields, dispersive electromagnetic waves and gravitational spheromaks from chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly modifies conserved currents, introducing new contributions. For Maxwell gauge fields, this leads to a contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field, a phenomenon known as the chiral magnetic effect, which is widely discussed in the literature. In the case of gravitational fields, as we demonstrate, the anomaly induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the potential manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and hydrodynamics in chiral media, and we also comment on backreaction effects in electrodynamics. In each case, we observe the systematic appearance of Beltrami-type fields. In electrodynamics and hydrodynamics, a Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector parallel to its own curl. We propose a generalization of Beltrami fields for tensorial gravitational perturbations, calling the respective solutions to the gravitational equations gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics of chiral media, vorticity asymptotically forms a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>
