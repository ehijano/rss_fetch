      <title>Diagrammatic Negative Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow of information through a complex system can be readily understood with category theory. However, negative information (e.g., what is not possible) does not have an immediately evident categorical representation. The formalization of nategories using unconventional composition addresses this issue, and lets imposed limitations on categories be considered. However, traditional nategories abandon core categorical constructs and rely on extensive mathematical development. This creates a divide between the consideration of positive and negative information composition. In this work, we show that negative information can be considered in a natural categorical manner. This is aided by functor string diagrams, a novel flexible diagrammatic approach that can intuitively show the operation of hom-functors and natural transformations in expressions. This insight reveals how to consider the composition of negative information with foundational categorical constructs without relying on enrichment. We present diagrammatic means to consider not only nategories, but preorders more broadly. This paper introduces diagrammatic methods for the consideration of triangle inequalities and co-designs $\mathbf{DP/Feas_{Bool}}$, showing how important cases of negative information composition can be categorically and diagrammatically approached. In particular, we develop systematic tools to rigorously consider imposed limitations on systems, advancing our mathematical understanding, and present intuitive diagrams which motivate widespread adoption and usage for various applications.</description>

      <title>A classification of well-behaved graph clustering schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection in graphs is a problem that is likely to be relevant whenever network data appears, and consequently the problem has received much attention with many different methods and algorithms applied. However, many of these methods are hard to study theoretically, and they optimise for somewhat different goals. A general and rigorous account of the problem and possible methods remains elusive.
  We study the class of all clustering methods that are monotone under addition of vertices and edges, phrasing this as a functoriality notion. We show that if additionally we require the methods to have no resolution limit in a strong sense, this is equivalent to a notion of representability, which requires them to be explainable and determined by a representing set of graphs. We show that representable clustering methods are always computable in polynomial time, and in any nowhere dense class they are computable in roughly quadratic time.
  Finally, we extend our definitions to the case of hierarchical clustering, and give a notion of representability for hierarchical clustering schemes.</description>

      <title>Amortized Analysis via Coalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amortized analysis is a cost analysis technique for data structures in which cost is studied in aggregate, rather than considering the maximum cost of a single operation. Traditionally, amortized analysis has been phrased inductively, in terms of finite sequences of operations. Connecting to prior work on coalgebraic semantics for data structures, we develop the perspective that amortized analysis is naturally viewed coalgebraically in the category of algebras for a cost monad, where a morphism of coalgebras serves as a first-class generalization of potential function suitable for integrating cost and behavior. Using this simple definition, we consider amortization of other effects, such as randomization, and we compose amortization arguments in the indexed category of coalgebras. We generalize this to parallel data structure usage patterns by using coalgebras for an endoprofunctor instead of an endofunctor, combining potential using a monoidal structure on the underlying category. Finally, we adapt our discussion to the bicategorical setting, supporting imprecise amortized upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Abstract Excision and $\ell^1$-Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the abstract setting of excisive functors in the language of $\infty$-categories to show that the best approximation to the $\ell^1$-homology functor by an excisive functor is trivial.
  Then we make an effort to explain the used language on a conceptual level for those who do not feel at home with $\infty$-categories, prove that the singular chain complex functor is indeed excisive in the abstract sense, and show how the latter leads to classical excision statements in the form of Mayer-Vietoris sequences.</description>
