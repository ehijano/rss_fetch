      <title>Types of elements in non-commutative Poisson algebras and Dixmier Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-commutative Poisson algebras are the algebras having an associative algebra structure and a Lie algebra structure together with the Leibniz law. Let $P$ be a non-commutative Poisson algebra over some algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. For any $z\in P$, there exist four subalgebras of $P$ associated with the inner derivation $ad_z$ on $P$. Based on the relationships between these four subalgebras, elements of $P$ can be divided into eight types. We will mainly focus on two types of non-commutative Poisson algebras: the usual Poisson algebras and the associative algebras with the commutator as the Poisson bracket. The following problems are studied for such non-commutative Poisson algebras: how the type of an element changes under homomorphisms between non-commutative Poisson algebras, how the type of an element changes after localization, and what the type of the elements of the form $z_1 \otimes z_2$ and $z_1 \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes z_2$ is in the tensor product of non-commutative Poisson algebras $P_1\otimes P_2$. As an application of above results, one knows that Dixmier Conjecture for $A_1$ holds under certain conditions. Some properties of the Weyl algebras are also obtained, such as the commutativity of certain subalgebras.</description>

      <title>Affineness on Noetherian graded rings, algebras and Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that every Noetherian graded ring with an affine degree zero part is affine. As a result, a Noetherian graded Hopf algebra whose degree zero component is a commutative or a cocommutative Hopf subalgebra is affine. Moreover, we show that the braided Hopf algebra of a Noetherian graded Hopf algebra is affine.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of solution of systems of generalized Sylvester and conjugate-Sylvester equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a characterization for a periodic system of generalized Sylvester and conjugate-Sylvester equations, with at most one generalized conjugate-Sylvester equation, to have a unique solution when all coefficient matrices are square and all unknown matrices of the system have the same size. We also present a procedure to reduce an arbitrary system of generalized Sylvester and conjugate-Sylvester equations to periodic systems having at most one generalized conjugate-Sylvester equation. Therefore, the obtained characterization for the uniqueness of solution of periodic systems provides a characterization for general systems of generalized Sylvester and conjugate-Sylvester equations.</description>

      <title>Non-existence of symmetric biderivations on finite-dimensional perfect Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there are no symmetric non-zero biderivations on perfect Lie algebras of finite dimension over a field of characteristic zero. We show that this is equivalent to show that every symmetric biderivation on a finite-dimensional perfect Lie algebra over such a field with values in a finite-dimensional module vanishes identically. This answers an open question posed by M. Bre\v{s}ar and K. Zhao.</description>

      <title>On the formal ribbon extension of a quasitriangular Hopf algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20339v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any finite-dimensional quasitriangular Hopf algebra $H$ can be formally extended to a ribbon Hopf algebra $\tilde H$ of twice the dimension. We investigate this extension and its representations. We show that every indecomposable $H$-module has precisely two compatible $\tilde H$-actions. We investigate the behavior of simple, projective, and M\"uger central $\tilde H$-modules in terms of these $\tilde H$-actions. We also observe that, in the semisimple case, this construction agrees with the pivotalization/sphericalization construction introduced by Etingof, Nikshych, and Ostrik (2003). As an example, we investigate the formal ribbon extension of odd-index doubled Nichols Hopf algebras $D\mathcal K_n$.</description>

      <title>Cusps and fundamental domains for congruence subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the cusp classes and their widths for the congruence subgroups $\Gamma(N), \Gamma_1(N)$ and $\Gamma_0(N)$. We relate the cusp classes of $\Gamma_0(N)$ with those produced by the connected fundamental domain in the previous work of Nie and Parent. By further studying the interesting functions $M$ and $W$ on ${\mathbb Z}/N$, we establish an identity relating the widths.</description>

      <title>Schur Rank, Compatibility Degree, and the Canonical Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of denominator vectors can be extended to all generic basis elements of upper cluster algebras in a natural way. Under a weakened version of generic pairing assumption, we provide a representation-theoretic interpretation for this extended notion. We derive several consequences in this generality. We present a counterexample to the conjecture that distinct cluster monomials have distinct denominator vectors. Utilizing a new rank function called the Schur rank, we extend the notion of compatibility degree. As an application, we find a tropical method to compute the multiplicity of a real component in the canonical decomposition of $\delta$-vectors.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Summation of Multivariate Rational Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic summation as an active research topic of symbolic computation provides efficient algorithmic tools for evaluating and simplifying different types of sums arising from mathematics, computer science, physics and other areas. Most of existing algorithms in symbolic summation are mainly applicable to the problem with univariate inputs. A long-term project in symbolic computation is to develop theories, algorithms and software for the symbolic summation of multivariate functions. This paper will give complete solutions to two challenging problems in symbolic summation of multivariate rational functions, namely the rational summability problem and the existence problem of telescopers for multivariate rational functions. Our approach is based on the structure of Sato's isotropy groups of polynomials, which enables us to reduce the problems to testing the shift equivalence of polynomials. Our results provide a complete solution to the discrete analogue of Picard's problem on differential forms and can be used to detect the applicability of the Wilf-Zeilberger method to multivariate rational functions.</description>

      <title>The algebra $\mathcal{D}(W)$ via strong Darboux transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Matrix Bochner Problem aims to classify weight matrices $W$ such that the algebra $\mathcal D(W)$, of all differential operators that have a sequence of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials for $W$ as eigenfunctions, contains a second-order differential operator. In \cite{CY18} it is proven that, under certain assumptions, the solutions to the Matrix Bochner Problem can be obtained through a noncommutative bispectral Darboux transformation of some classical scalar weights.
  The main aim of this paper is to introduce the concept of strong Darboux transformation among weight matrices and explore the relationship between the algebras $\mathcal{D}(W)$ and $\mathcal{D}(\widetilde{W})$ when $\widetilde{W}$ is a strong Darboux transformation of $W$. Starting from a direct sum of classical scalar weights $\widetilde W$, and leveraging our complete knowledge of the algebra of $\mathcal D(\widetilde W)$, we can easily determine the algebra $\mathcal D(W)$ of a weight $W$ that is a strong Darboux transformation of $\widetilde W$.</description>
