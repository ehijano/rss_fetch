      <title>Building Bridges between Users and Content across Multiple Platforms during Natural Disasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media is a primary medium for information diffusion during natural disasters. The social media ecosystem has been used to identify destruction, analyze opinions and organize aid. While the overall picture and aggregate trends may be important, a crucial part of the picture is the connections on these sites. These bridges are essential to facilitate information flow within the network. In this work, we perform a multi-platform analysis (X, Reddit, YouTube) of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which occurred in quick session to each other in the US in late 2024. We construct network graphs to understand the properties of effective bridging content and users. We find that bridges tend to exist on X, that bridging content is complex, and that bridging users have relatable affiliations related to gender, race and job. Public organizations can use these characteristics to manage their social media personas during natural disasters more effectively.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Homophily in Social Media via Inverse Reinforcement Learning: A Reddit Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online communities play a critical role in shaping societal discourse and influencing collective behavior in the real world. The tendency for people to connect with others who share similar characteristics and views, known as homophily, plays a key role in the formation of echo chambers which further amplify polarization and division. Existing works examining homophily in online communities traditionally infer it using content- or adjacency-based approaches, such as constructing explicit interaction networks or performing topic analysis. These methods fall short for platforms where interaction networks cannot be easily constructed and fail to capture the complex nature of user interactions across the platform. This work introduces a novel approach for quantifying user homophily. We first use an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework to infer users' policies, then use these policies as a measure of behavioral homophily. We apply our method to Reddit, conducting a case study across 5.9 million interactions over six years, demonstrating how this approach uncovers distinct behavioral patterns and user roles that vary across different communities. We further validate our behavioral homophily measure against traditional content-based homophily, offering a powerful method for analyzing social media dynamics and their broader societal implications. We find, among others, that users can behave very similarly (high behavioral homophily) when discussing entirely different topics like soccer vs e-sports (low topical homophily), and that there is an entire class of users on Reddit whose purpose seems to be to disagree with others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency network analysis consists of applying the tools and methods of social network analysis to transactional data issued from cryptocurrencies. The main difference with most online social networks is that users do not exchange textual content but instead value -- in systems designed mainly as cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin -- or digital items and services in more permissive systems based on smart contracts such as Ethereum.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Political Discourse on Discord during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media networks have amplified the reach of social and political movements, but most research focuses on mainstream platforms such as X, Reddit, and Facebook, overlooking Discord. As a rapidly growing, community-driven platform with optional decentralized moderation, Discord offers unique opportunities to study political discourse. This study analyzes over 30 million messages from political servers on Discord discussing the 2024 U.S. elections. Servers were classified as Republican-aligned, Democratic-aligned, or unaligned based on their descriptions. We tracked changes in political conversation during key campaign events and identified distinct political valence and implicit biases in semantic association through embedding analysis. We observed that Republican servers emphasized economic policies, while Democratic servers focused on equality-related and progressive causes. Furthermore, we detected an increase in toxic language, such as sexism, in Republican-aligned servers after Kamala Harris's nomination. These findings provide a first look at political behavior on Discord, highlighting its growing role in shaping and understanding online political engagement.</description>

      <title>Higher-order shortest paths in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the defining features of complex networks is the connectivity properties that we observe emerging from local interactions. Recently, hypergraphs have emerged as a versatile tool to model networks with non-dyadic, higher-order interactions. Nevertheless, the connectivity properties of real-world hypergraphs remain largely understudied. In this work we introduce path size as a measure to characterise higher-order connectivity and quantify the relevance of non-dyadic ties for efficient shortest paths in a diverse set of empirical networks with and without temporal information. By comparing our results with simple randomised null models, our analysis presents a nuanced picture, suggesting that non-dyadic ties are often central and are vital for system connectivity, while dyadic edges remain essential to connect more peripheral nodes, an effect which is particularly pronounced for time-varying systems. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the structural organisation of systems with higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>At the Mahakumbh, Faith Met Tragedy: Computational Analysis of Stampede Patterns Using Machine Learning and NLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employs machine learning, historical analysis, and natural language processing (NLP) to examine recurring lethal stampedes at Indias mass religious gatherings, focusing on the 2025 Mahakumbh tragedy in Prayagraj (48+ deaths) and its 1954 predecessor (700+ casualties). Through computational modeling of crowd dynamics and administrative records, it investigates how systemic vulnerabilities contribute to these disasters. Temporal trend analysis identifies persistent choke points, with narrow riverbank access routes linked to 92% of past stampede sites and lethal crowd densities (eight or more persons per square meter) recurring during spiritually significant moments like Mauni Amavasya. NLP analysis of seven decades of inquiry reports reveals cyclical administrative failures, where VIP route prioritization diverted safety resources in both 1954 and 2025, exacerbating fatalities. Statistical modeling demonstrates how ritual urgency overrides risk perception, leading to panic propagation patterns that mirror historical incidents. Findings support the Institutional Amnesia Theory, highlighting how disaster responses remain reactionary rather than preventive. By correlating archival patterns with computational crowd behavior analysis, this study frames stampedes as a collision of infrastructure limitations, socio spiritual urgency, and governance inertia, challenging disaster discourse to address how spiritual economies normalize preventable mortality.</description>

      <title>DiversityOne: A Multi-Country Smartphone Sensor Dataset for Everyday Life Behavior Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding everyday life behavior of young adults through personal devices, e.g., smartphones and smartwatches, is key for various applications, from enhancing the user experience in mobile apps to enabling appropriate interventions in digital health apps. Towards this goal, previous studies have relied on datasets combining passive sensor data with human-provided annotations or self-reports. However, many existing datasets are limited in scope, often focusing on specific countries primarily in the Global North, involving a small number of participants, or using a limited range of pre-processed sensors. These limitations restrict the ability to capture cross-country variations of human behavior, including the possibility of studying model generalization, and robustness. To address this gap, we introduce DiversityOne, a dataset which spans eight countries (China, Denmark, India, Italy, Mexico, Mongolia, Paraguay, and the United Kingdom) and includes data from 782 college students over four weeks. DiversityOne contains data from 26 smartphone sensor modalities and 350K+ self-reports. As of today, it is one of the largest and most diverse publicly available datasets, while featuring extensive demographic and psychosocial survey data. DiversityOne opens the possibility of studying important research problems in ubiquitous computing, particularly in domain adaptation and generalization across countries, all research areas so far largely underexplored because of the lack of adequate datasets.</description>

      <title>Advancing Network Securing Strategies with Network Algorithms for Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) Missile Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) has become vital for the defense system as the military defense system is vital for national security. Placing Integrated Air Defense System batteries among locations to protect locations assets is a crucial problem because optimal solutions are needed for interceptor missiles to intercept attacker missiles for maximizing protection of assets across locations or places. In this research, the procedures of using network algorithms along with developing several network algorithms are going to be demonstrated to develop a model for sequential development of seven network securing strategies of placing Surface to Air Missile (SAM) batteries to maximize the protection of assets across locations (based on given asset values) by generating optimal solutions through computation to destroy maximum attacker missiles by using minimum interceptor missiles with given intercept probability. This network securing strategies can be implemented not only for Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) planning but also Counter Air (CA) planning as Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) is conducted with defensive counter air supported by attack operations in offensive counter air.</description>

      <title>Transition Network Analysis: A Novel Framework for Modeling, Visualizing, and Identifying the Temporal Patterns of Learners and Learning Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning analytics method: Transition Network Analysis (TNA), a method that integrates Stochastic Process Mining and probabilistic graph representation to model, visualize, and identify transition patterns in the learning process data. Combining the relational and temporal aspects into a single lens offers capabilities beyond either framework, including centralities to capture important learning events, community detection to identify behavior patterns, and clustering to reveal temporal patterns. Furthermore, TNA introduces several significance tests that go beyond either method and add rigor to the analysis. Here, we introduce the theoretical and mathematical foundations of TNA and we demonstrate the functionalities of TNA with a case study where students (n=191) engaged in small-group collaboration to map patterns of group dynamics using the theories of co-regulation and socially-shared regulated learning. The analysis revealed that TNA can map the regulatory processes as well as identify important events, patterns, and clusters. Bootstrap validation established the significant transitions and eliminated spurious transitions. As such, TNA can capture learning dynamics and provide a robust framework for investigating the temporal evolution of learning processes. Future directions include -- inter alia -- expanding estimation methods, reliability assessment, and building longitudinal TNA.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cross-domain Link Prediction via Evolution Process Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes DyExpert, a dynamic graph model for cross-domain link prediction. It can explicitly model historical evolving processes to learn the evolution pattern of a specific downstream graph and subsequently make pattern-specific link predictions. DyExpert adopts a decode-only transformer and is capable of efficiently parallel training and inference by \textit{conditioned link generation} that integrates both evolution modeling and link prediction. DyExpert is trained by extensive dynamic graphs across diverse domains, comprising 6M dynamic edges. Extensive experiments on eight untrained graphs demonstrate that DyExpert achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain link prediction. Compared to the advanced baseline under the same setting, DyExpert achieves an average of 11.40% improvement Average Precision across eight graphs. More impressive, it surpasses the fully supervised performance of 8 advanced baselines on 6 untrained graphs.</description>

      <title>An Exposition of Pathfinding Strategies Within Lightning Network Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lightning Network is a peer-to-peer network designed to address Bitcoin's scalability challenges, facilitating rapid, cost-effective, and instantaneous transactions through bidirectional, blockchain-backed payment channels among network peers. Due to a source-based routing of payments, different pathfinding strategies are used in practice, trading off different objectives for each other such as payment reliability and routing fees. This paper explores differences within pathfinding strategies used by prominent Lightning Network node implementations, which include different underlying cost functions and different constraints, as well as different greedy algorithms of shortest path-type. Surprisingly, we observe that the pathfinding problems that most LN node implementations attempt to solve are NP-complete, and cannot be guaranteed to be optimally solved by the variants of Dijkstra's algorithm currently deployed in production. Through comparative analysis and simulations, we evaluate efficacy of different pathfinding strategies across metrics such as success rate, fees, path length, and timelock. Our experiments indicate that the strategies used by Eclair are advantageous in terms of payment reliability and result in paths with low fees. LND exhibits moderate success rates, while LDK results in paths with higher fee levels for smaller payment amounts; furthermore, CLN stands out for its minimal timelock paths. Additionally, we investigate the impact of Lightning node connectivity levels on routing efficiency. The findings of our analysis provide insights towards future improvements of pathfinding strategies and algorithms used within the Lightning Network.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Assist Annotators in Identifying Morality Frames? -- Case Study on Vaccination Debate on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, social media is pivotal in shaping public discourse, especially on polarizing issues like vaccination, where diverse moral perspectives influence individual opinions. In NLP, data scarcity and complexity of psycholinguistic tasks, such as identifying morality frames, make relying solely on human annotators costly, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency due to cognitive load. To address these issues, we leverage large language models (LLMs), which are adept at adapting new tasks through few-shot learning, utilizing a handful of in-context examples coupled with explanations that connect examples to task principles. Our research explores LLMs' potential to assist human annotators in identifying morality frames within vaccination debates on social media. We employ a two-step process: generating concepts and explanations with LLMs, followed by human evaluation using a "think-aloud" tool. Our study shows that integrating LLMs into the annotation process enhances accuracy, reduces task difficulty, lowers cognitive load, suggesting a promising avenue for human-AI collaboration in complex psycholinguistic tasks.</description>

      <title>Beyond English: Evaluating Automated Measurement of Moral Foundations in Non-English Discourse with a Chinese Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores computational approaches for measuring moral foundations (MFs) in non-English corpora. Since most resources are developed primarily for English, cross-linguistic applications of moral foundation theory remain limited. Using Chinese as a case study, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of applying English resources to machine translated text, local language lexicons, multilingual language models, and large language models (LLMs) in measuring MFs in non-English texts. The results indicate that machine translation and local lexicon approaches are insufficient for complex moral assessments, frequently resulting in a substantial loss of cultural information. In contrast, multilingual models and LLMs demonstrate reliable cross-language performance with transfer learning, with LLMs excelling in terms of data efficiency. Importantly, this study also underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation of automated MF assessment, as the most advanced models may overlook cultural nuances in cross-language measurements. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs for cross-language MF measurements and other complex multilingual deductive coding tasks.</description>
