      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Exploring RNA Branching Conformations under the Nearest-Neighbor Thermodynamic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: In the Nearest-Neighbor Thermodynamic Model, a standard approach for RNA secondary structure prediction, the energy of the multiloops is modeled using a linear entropic penalty governed by three branching parameters. Although these parameters are typically fixed, recent work has shown that reparametrizing the multiloop score and considering alternative branching conformations can lead to significantly better structure predictions. However, prior approaches for exploring the alternative branching structures were computationally inefficient for long sequences.
  Results: We present a novel algorithm that partitions the parameter space, identifying all distinct branching structures (optimal under different branching parameters) for a given RNA sequence using the fewest possible minimum free energy computations. Our method efficiently computes the full parameter-space partition and the associated optimal structures, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of the structural landscape across parameter choices. We apply this algorithm to the Archive II benchmarking dataset, assessing the maximum attainable prediction accuracy for each sequence under the reparameterized multiloop model. We find that the potential for improvement over default predictions is substantial in many cases, and that the optimal prediction accuracy is highly sensitive to auxiliary modeling decisions, such as the treatment of lonely base pairs and dangling ends.
  Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that the conventional choice of multiloop parameters may limit prediction accuracy and that exploring alternative parameterizations is both tractable and worthwhile. The efficient partitioning algorithm we introduce makes this exploration feasible for longer sequences and larger datasets. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges in identifying the optimal structure.</description>

      <title>HelixVS: Deep Learning-Enhanced Structure-Based Platform for Screening and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drug discovery through virtual screening (VS) has become a popular strategy for identifying hits against protein targets. Alongside VS, molecular design further expands accessible chemical space. Together, these approaches have the potential to reduce the cost and time needed for manual selection and wet-laboratory experiments, thereby accelerating drug discovery pipelines. Improving the cost-effectiveness of virtual screening is a significant challenge, aiming to explore larger compound libraries while maintaining lower screening costs. Here, we present HelixVS, a structure-based VS platform enhanced by deep learning models. HelixVS integrates a precise deep learning-based pose-scoring model and a pose-screening module into a multi-stage VS process, enabling more effective screening of active compounds. Compared to classic molecular docking tools like Vina, HelixVS demonstrated significantly improved screening performance across nearly a hundred targets, achieving an average 2.6-fold higher enrichment factor (EF) and more than 10 times faster screening speed. We applied HelixVS in four drug development pipelines, targeting both traditional competitive drug-binding pockets and novel protein-protein interaction interfaces. Wet-lab validations across these pipelines consistently identified active compounds, with over 10% of the molecules tested in wet labs demonstrating activity at uM or even nM levels. This demonstrates the ability of HelixVS to identify high-affinity ligands for various targets and pockets.In addition, the HelixVS platform has been extended with HelixVS-Syn, which enables design of novel compounds from reference scaffolds. These designed molecules are seamlessly integrated into the HelixVS screening workflow, allowing researchers to explore both existing chemical libraries and novel chemical space with high affinity, synthetic accessibility, and structural novelty.</description>

      <title>Protein Design with Dynamic Protein Vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein design is a fundamental challenge in biotechnology, aiming to design novel sequences with specific functions within the vast space of possible proteins. Recent advances in deep generative models have enabled function-based protein design from textual descriptions, yet struggle with structural plausibility. Inspired by classical protein design methods that leverage natural protein structures, we explore whether incorporating fragments from natural proteins can enhance foldability in generative models. Our empirical results show that even random incorporation of fragments improves foldability. Building on this insight, we introduce ProDVa, a novel protein design approach that integrates a text encoder for functional descriptions, a protein language model for designing proteins, and a fragment encoder to dynamically retrieve protein fragments based on textual functional descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively designs protein sequences that are both functionally aligned and structurally plausible. Compared to state-of-the-art models, ProDVa achieves comparable function alignment using less than 0.04% of the training data, while designing significantly more well-folded proteins, with the proportion of proteins having pLDDT above 70 increasing by 7.38% and those with PAE below 10 increasing by 9.6%.</description>
