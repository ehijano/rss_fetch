      <title>On the emergence of numerical instabilities in Next Generation Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NGRC) is a low-cost machine learning method for forecasting chaotic time series from data. However, ensuring the dynamical stability of NGRC models during autonomous prediction remains a challenge. In this work, we uncover a key connection between the numerical conditioning of the NGRC feature matrix -- formed by polynomial evaluations on time-delay coordinates -- and the long-term NGRC dynamics. Merging tools from numerical linear algebra and ergodic theory of dynamical systems, we systematically study how the feature matrix conditioning varies across hyperparameters. We demonstrate that the NGRC feature matrix tends to be ill-conditioned for short time lags and high-degree polynomials. Ill-conditioning amplifies sensitivity to training data perturbations, which can produce unstable NGRC dynamics. We evaluate the impact of different numerical algorithms (Cholesky, SVD, and LU) for solving the regularized least-squares problem.</description>

      <title>DOLCE: Decomposing Off-Policy Evaluation/Learning into Lagged and Current Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) and off-policy learning (OPL) for contextual bandit policies leverage historical data to evaluate and optimize a target policy. Most existing OPE/OPL methods--based on importance weighting or imputation--assume common support between the target and logging policies. When this assumption is violated, these methods typically require unstable extrapolation, truncation, or conservative strategies for individuals outside the common support assumption. However, such approaches can be inadequate in settings where explicit evaluation or optimization for such individuals is required. To address this issue, we propose DOLCE: Decomposing Off-policy evaluation/learning into Lagged and Current Effects, a novel estimator that leverages contextual information from multiple time points to decompose rewards into lagged and current effects. By incorporating both past and present contexts, DOLCE effectively handles individuals who violate the common support assumption. We show that the proposed estimator is unbiased under two assumptions--local correctness and conditional independence. Our experiments demonstrate that DOLCE achieves substantial improvements in OPE and OPL, particularly as the proportion of individuals outside the common support assumption increases.</description>

      <title>Characterization and Learning of Causal Graphs from Hard Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in the empirical sciences involves uncovering causal structure through observation and experimentation. Causal discovery entails linking the conditional independence (CI) invariances in observational data to their corresponding graphical constraints via d-separation. In this paper, we consider a general setting where we have access to data from multiple experimental distributions resulting from hard interventions, as well as potentially from an observational distribution. By comparing different interventional distributions, we propose a set of graphical constraints that are fundamentally linked to Pearl's do-calculus within the framework of hard interventions. These graphical constraints associate each graphical structure with a set of interventional distributions that are consistent with the rules of do-calculus. We characterize the interventional equivalence class of causal graphs with latent variables and introduce a graphical representation that can be used to determine whether two causal graphs are interventionally equivalent, i.e., whether they are associated with the same family of hard interventional distributions, where the elements of the family are indistinguishable using the invariances from do-calculus. We also propose a learning algorithm to integrate multiple datasets from hard interventions, introducing new orientation rules. The learning objective is a tuple of augmented graphs which entails a set of causal graphs. We also prove the soundness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Differential Private Bootstrap by Subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bootstrap is a common tool for quantifying uncertainty in data analysis. However, besides additional computational costs in the application of the bootstrap on massive data, a challenging problem in bootstrap based inference under Differential Privacy consists in the fact that it requires repeated access to the data. As a consequence, bootstrap based differentially private inference requires a significant increase of the privacy budget, which on the other hand comes with a substantial loss in statistical accuracy.
  A potential solution to reconcile the conflicting goals of statistical accuracy and privacy is to analyze the data under parametric model assumptions and in the last decade, several parametric bootstrap methods for inference under privacy have been investigated. However, uncertainty quantification by parametric bootstrap is only valid if the the quantities of interest can be identified as the parameters of a statistical model and the imposed model assumptions are (at least approximately) satisfied. An alternative to parametric methods is the empirical bootstrap that is a widely used tool for non-parametric inference and well studied in the non-private regime. However, under privacy, less insight is available. In this paper, we propose a private empirical $m$ out of $n$ bootstrap and validate its consistency and privacy guarantees under Gaussian Differential Privacy. Compared to the the private $n$ out of $n$ bootstrap, our approach has several advantages. First, it comes with less computational costs, in particular for massive data. Second, the proposed procedure needs less additional noise in the bootstrap iterations, which leads to an improved statistical accuracy while asymptotically guaranteeing the same level of privacy. Third, we demonstrate much better finite sample properties compared to the currently available procedures.</description>

      <title>Provable Efficiency of Guidance in Diffusion Models for General Data Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, with guidance techniques playing a crucial role in enhancing sample quality. Despite their empirical success, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the guidance effect remains limited. Existing studies only focus on case studies, where the distribution conditioned on each class is either isotropic Gaussian or supported on a one-dimensional interval with some extra conditions. How to analyze the guidance effect beyond these case studies remains an open question. Towards closing this gap, we make an attempt to analyze diffusion guidance under general data distributions. Rather than demonstrating uniform sample quality improvement, which does not hold in some distributions, we prove that guidance can improve the whole sample quality, in the sense that the average reciprocal of the classifier probability decreases with the existence of guidance. This aligns with the motivation of introducing guidance.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression for Active Sensing Probabilistic Structural Health Monitoring: Experimental Assessment Across Multiple Damage and Loading Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.14841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the near future, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) technologies will be capable of overcoming the drawbacks in the current maintenance and life-cycle management paradigms, namely: cost, increased downtime, less-than-optimal safety management paradigm and the limited applicability of fully-autonomous operations. In the context of SHM, one of the most challenging tasks is damage quantification. Current methods face accuracy and/or robustness issues when it comes to varying operating and environmental conditions. In addition, the damage/no-damage paradigm of current frameworks does not offer much information to maintainers on the ground for proper decision-making. In this study, a novel structural damage quantification framework is proposed based on widely-used Damage Indices (DIs) and Gaussian Process Regression Models (GPRMs). The novelty lies in calculating the probability of an incoming test DI point originating from a specific state, which allows for probability-educated decision-making. This framework is applied to three test cases: a Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) coupon with attached weights as simulated damage, an aluminum coupon with a notch, and an aluminum coupon with attached weights as simulated damage under varying loading states. The state prediction method presented herein is applied to single-state quantification in the first two test cases, as well as the third one assuming the loading state is known. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the third test case assuming neither the damage size nor the load is known in order to predict both simultaneously from incoming DI test points. In applying this framework, two forms of GPRMs (standard and variational heteroscedastic) are used in order to critically assess their performances with respect to the three test cases.</description>

      <title>Scalable Meta-Learning via Mixed-Mode Differentiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based bilevel optimisation is a powerful technique with applications in hyperparameter optimisation, task adaptation, algorithm discovery, meta-learning more broadly, and beyond. It often requires differentiating through the gradient-based optimisation process itself, leading to "gradient-of-a-gradient" calculations with computationally expensive second-order and mixed derivatives. While modern automatic differentiation libraries provide a convenient way to write programs for calculating these derivatives, they oftentimes cannot fully exploit the specific structure of these problems out-of-the-box, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we analyse such cases and propose Mixed-Flow Meta-Gradients, or MixFlow-MG -- a practical algorithm that uses mixed-mode differentiation to construct more efficient and scalable computational graphs yielding over 10x memory and up to 25% wall-clock time improvements over standard implementations in modern meta-learning setups.</description>

      <title>Q-Learning with Clustered-SMART (cSMART) Data: Examining Moderators in the Construction of Clustered Adaptive Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A clustered adaptive intervention (cAI) is a pre-specified sequence of decision rules that guides practitioners on how best - and based on which measures - to tailor cluster-level intervention to improve outcomes at the level of individuals within the clusters. A clustered sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (cSMART) is a type of trial that is used to inform the empirical development of a cAI. The most common type of secondary aim in a cSMART focuses on assessing causal effect moderation by candidate tailoring variables. We introduce a clustered Q-learning framework with the M-out-of-N Cluster Bootstrap using data from a cSMART to evaluate whether a set of candidate tailoring variables may be useful in defining an optimal cAI. This approach could construct confidence intervals (CI) with near-nominal coverage to assess parameters indexing the causal effect moderation function. Specifically, it allows reliable inferences concerning the utility of candidate tailoring variables in constructing a cAI that maximizes a mean end-of-study outcome even when "non-regularity", a well-known challenge exists. Simulations demonstrate the numerical performance of the proposed method across varying non-regularity conditions and investigate the impact of varying number of clusters and intra-cluster correlation coefficient on CI coverage. Methods are applied on ADEPT dataset to inform the construction of a clinic-level cAI for improving evidence-based practice in treating mood disorders.</description>

      <title>Multi-site modelling and reconstruction of past extreme skew surges along the French Atlantic coast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Appropriate modelling of extreme skew surges is crucial, particularly for coastal risk management. Our study focuses on modelling extreme skew surges along the French Atlantic coast, with a particular emphasis on investigating the extremal dependence structure between stations. We employ the peak-over-threshold framework, where a multivariate extreme event is defined whenever at least one location records a large value, though not necessarily all stations simultaneously. A novel method for determining an appropriate level (threshold) above which observations can be classified as extreme is proposed. Two complementary approaches are explored. First, the multivariate generalized Pareto distribution is employed to model extremes, leveraging its properties to derive a generative model that predicts extreme skew surges at one station based on observed extremes at nearby stations. Second, a novel extreme regression framework is assessed for point predictions. This specific regression framework enables accurate point predictions using only the "angle" of input variables, i.e. input variables divided by their norms. The ultimate objective is to reconstruct historical skew surge time series at stations with limited data. This is achieved by integrating extreme skew surge data from stations with longer records, such as Brest and Saint-Nazaire, which provide over 150 years of observations.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Conformal Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large datasets is critical in applications such as drug discovery, precision medicine, and alignment of large language models (LLMs). While Conformal Selection (CS) provides rigorous uncertainty quantification, it is limited to univariate responses and scalar criteria. To address this issue, we propose Multivariate Conformal Selection (mCS), a generalization of CS designed for multivariate response settings. Our method introduces regional monotonicity and employs multivariate nonconformity scores to construct conformal p-values, enabling finite-sample False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. We present two variants: mCS-dist, using distance-based scores, and mCS-learn, which learns optimal scores via differentiable optimization. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that mCS significantly improves selection power while maintaining FDR control, establishing it as a robust framework for multivariate selection tasks.</description>

      <title>How Transformers Learn Regular Language Recognition: A Theoretical Study on Training Dynamics and Implicit Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language recognition tasks are fundamental in natural language processing (NLP) and have been widely used to benchmark the performance of large language models (LLMs). These tasks also play a crucial role in explaining the working mechanisms of transformers. In this work, we focus on two representative tasks in the category of regular language recognition, known as `even pairs' and `parity check', the aim of which is to determine whether the occurrences of certain subsequences in a given sequence are even. Our goal is to explore how a one-layer transformer, consisting of an attention layer followed by a linear layer, learns to solve these tasks by theoretically analyzing its training dynamics under gradient descent. While even pairs can be solved directly by a one-layer transformer, parity check need to be solved by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT), either into the inference stage of a transformer well-trained for the even pairs task, or into the training of a one-layer transformer. For both problems, our analysis shows that the joint training of attention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase, the attention layer grows rapidly, mapping data sequences into separable vectors. In the second phase, the attention layer becomes stable, while the linear layer grows logarithmically and approaches in direction to a max-margin hyperplane that correctly separates the attention layer outputs into positive and negative samples, and the loss decreases at a rate of $O(1/t)$. Our experiments validate those theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Compact Recurrent Transformer with Persistent Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture has shown significant success in many language processing and visual tasks. However, the method faces challenges in efficiently scaling to long sequences because the self-attention computation is quadratic with respect to the input length. To overcome this limitation, several approaches scale to longer sequences by breaking long sequences into a series of segments, restricting self-attention to local dependencies between tokens within each segment and using a memory mechanism to manage information flow between segments. However, these approached generally introduce additional compute overhead that restricts them from being used for applications where limited compute memory and power are of great concern (such as edge computing). We propose a novel and efficient Compact Recurrent Transformer (CRT), which combines shallow Transformer models that process short local segments with recurrent neural networks to compress and manage a single persistent memory vector that summarizes long-range global information between segments. We evaluate CRT on WordPTB and WikiText-103 for next-token-prediction tasks, as well as on the Toyota Smarthome video dataset for classification. CRT achieves comparable or superior prediction results to full-length Transformers in the language datasets while using significantly shorter segments (half or quarter size) and substantially reduced FLOPs. Our approach also demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Toyota Smarthome video dataset.</description>

      <title>Multi-Step Consistency Models: Fast Generation with Theoretical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consistency models have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional SDE based diffusion models, offering a significant acceleration in generation by producing high quality samples in very few steps. Despite their empirical success, a proper theoretic justification for their speed up is still lacking. In this work, we provide the analysis which bridges this gap, showing that given a consistency model which can map the input at a given time to arbitrary timestamps along the reverse trajectory, one can achieve KL divergence of order $ O(\varepsilon^2) $ using only $ O\left(\log\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\right) $ iterations with constant step size, where d is the data dimension. Additionally, under minimal assumptions on the data distribution an increasingly common setting in recent diffusion model analyses we show that a similar KL convergence guarantee can be obtained, with the number of steps scaling as $ O\left(d \log\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\right) $. Going further, we also provide a theoretical analysis for estimation of such consistency models, concluding that accurate learning is feasible using small discretization steps, both in smooth and non smooth settings. Notably, our results for the non smooth case yield best in class convergence rates compared to existing SDE or ODE based analyses under minimal assumptions.</description>

      <title>Integration Matters for Learning PDEs with Backwards SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE)-based deep learning methods provide an alternative to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), offering algorithmic advantages in settings such as stochastic optimal control, where the PDEs of interest are tied to an underlying dynamical system. However, existing BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to short-horizon self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step sizes or longer self-consistency horizons. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. Our findings highlight the critical role of integration schemes in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an algorithmic detail that has received little attention thus far in the literature.</description>

      <title>CoCoAFusE: Beyond Mixtures of Experts via Model Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many learning problems involve multiple patterns and varying degrees of uncertainty dependent on the covariates. Advances in Deep Learning (DL) have addressed these issues by learning highly nonlinear input-output dependencies. However, model interpretability and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) have often straggled behind. In this context, we introduce the Competitive/Collaborative Fusion of Experts (CoCoAFusE), a novel, Bayesian Covariates-Dependent Modeling technique. CoCoAFusE builds on the very philosophy behind Mixtures of Experts (MoEs), blending predictions from several simple sub-models (or "experts") to achieve high levels of expressiveness while retaining a substantial degree of local interpretability. Our formulation extends that of a classical Mixture of Experts by contemplating the fusion of the experts' distributions in addition to their more usual mixing (i.e., superimposition). Through this additional feature, CoCoAFusE better accommodates different scenarios for the intermediate behavior between generating mechanisms, resulting in tighter credible bounds on the response variable. Indeed, only resorting to mixing, as in classical MoEs, may lead to multimodality artifacts, especially over smooth transitions. Instead, CoCoAFusE can avoid these artifacts even under the same structure and priors for the experts, leading to greater expressiveness and flexibility in modeling. This new approach is showcased extensively on a suite of motivating numerical examples and a collection of real-data ones, demonstrating its efficacy in tackling complex regression problems where uncertainty is a key quantity of interest.</description>

      <title>Risk Analysis and Design Against Adversarial Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning models capable of providing reliable predictions in the face of adversarial actions has become a central focus of the machine learning community in recent years. This challenge arises from observing that data encountered at deployment time often deviate from the conditions under which the model was trained. In this paper, we address deployment-time adversarial actions and propose a versatile, well-principled framework to evaluate the model's robustness against attacks of diverse types and intensities. While we initially focus on Support Vector Regression (SVR), the proposed approach extends naturally to the broad domain of learning via relaxed optimization techniques. Our results enable an assessment of the model vulnerability without requiring additional test data and operate in a distribution-free setup. These results not only provide a tool to enhance trust in the model's applicability but also aid in selecting among competing alternatives. Later in the paper, we show that our findings also offer useful insights for establishing new results within the out-of-distribution framework.</description>

      <title>Overview and practical recommendations on using Shapley Values for identifying predictive biomarkers via CATE modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, two parallel research trends have emerged in machine learning, yet their intersections remain largely unexplored. On one hand, there has been a significant increase in literature focused on Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) modeling, particularly targeting the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) using meta-learner techniques. These approaches often aim to identify causal effects from observational data. On the other hand, the field of Explainable Machine Learning (XML) has gained traction, with various approaches developed to explain complex models and make their predictions more interpretable. A prominent technique in this area is Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), which has become mainstream in data science for analyzing supervised learning models. However, there has been limited exploration of SHAP application in identifying predictive biomarkers through CATE models, a crucial aspect in pharmaceutical precision medicine. We address inherent challenges associated with the SHAP concept in multi-stage CATE strategies and introduce a surrogate estimation approach that is agnostic to the choice of CATE strategy, effectively reducing computational burdens in high-dimensional data. Using this approach, we conduct simulation benchmarking to evaluate the ability to accurately identify biomarkers using SHAP values derived from various CATE meta-learners and Causal Forest.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Temporal Difference Learning via Implicit Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal Difference (TD) learning is a foundational algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL). For nearly forty years, TD learning has served as a workhorse for applied RL as well as a building block for more complex and specialized algorithms. However, despite its widespread use, it is not without drawbacks, the most prominent being its sensitivity to step size. A poor choice of step size can dramatically inflate the error of value estimates and slow convergence. Consequently, in practice, researchers must use trial and error in order to identify a suitable step size -- a process that can be tedious and time consuming. As an alternative, we propose implicit TD algorithms that reformulate TD updates into fixed-point equations. These updates are more stable and less sensitive to step size without sacrificing computational efficiency. Moreover, our theoretical analysis establishes asymptotic convergence guarantees and finite-time error bounds. Our results demonstrate their robustness and practicality for modern RL tasks, establishing implicit TD as a versatile tool for policy evaluation and value approximation.</description>

Abstract: The set of local modes and density ridge lines are important summary characteristics of the data-generating distribution. In this work, we focus on estimating local modes and density ridges from point cloud data in a product space combining two or more Euclidean and/or directional metric spaces. Specifically, our approach extends the (subspace constrained) mean shift algorithm to such product spaces, addressing potential challenges in the generalization process. We establish the algorithmic convergence of the proposed methods, along with practical implementation guidelines. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate density estimation is of great interest in various scientific and engineering disciplines. In this work, we introduce a new framework called Variance-Reduced Sketching (VRS), specifically designed to estimate multivariate density functions with a reduced curse of dimensionality. Our VRS framework conceptualizes multivariate functions as infinite-size matrices/tensors, and facilitates a new sketching technique motivated by the numerical linear algebra literature to reduce the variance in density estimation problems. We demonstrate the robust numerical performance of VRS through a series of simulated experiments and real-world data applications. Notably, VRS shows remarkable improvement over existing neural network density estimators and classical kernel methods in numerous distribution models. Additionally, we offer theoretical justifications for VRS to support its ability to deliver density estimation with a reduced curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17412v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP and t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a model introduced in Ravuri et al. (2023), that describes the graph Laplacian (an estimate of the data precision matrix) using a Wishart distribution, with a mean given by a non-linear covariance function evaluated on the latents. This interpretation offers deeper theoretical and semantic insights into such algorithms, and forging a connection to Gaussian process latent variable models by showing that well-known kernels can be used to describe covariances implied by graph Laplacians. We also introduce tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied.</description>

      <title>Deep Kernel Posterior Learning under Infinite Variance Prior Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neal (1996) proved that infinitely wide shallow Bayesian neural networks (BNN) converge to Gaussian processes (GP), when the network weights have bounded prior variance. Cho &amp; Saul (2009) provided a useful recursive formula for deep kernel processes for relating the covariance kernel of each layer to the layer immediately below. Moreover, they worked out the form of the layer-wise covariance kernel in an explicit manner for several common activation functions. Recent works, including Aitchison et al. (2021), have highlighted that the covariance kernels obtained in this manner are deterministic and hence, precludes any possibility of representation learning, which amounts to learning a non-degenerate posterior of a random kernel given the data. To address this, they propose adding artificial noise to the kernel to retain stochasticity, and develop deep kernel inverse Wishart processes. Nonetheless, this artificial noise injection could be critiqued in that it would not naturally emerge in a classic BNN architecture under an infinite-width limit. To address this, we show that a Bayesian deep neural network, where each layer width approaches infinity, and all network weights are elliptically distributed with infinite variance, converges to a process with $\alpha$-stable marginals in each layer that has a conditionally Gaussian representation. These conditional random covariance kernels could be recursively linked in the manner of Cho &amp; Saul (2009), even though marginally the process exhibits stable behavior, and hence covariances are not even necessarily defined. We also provide useful generalizations of the recent results of Lor\'ia &amp; Bhadra (2024) on shallow networks to multi-layer networks, and remedy the computational burden of their approach. The computational and statistical benefits over competing approaches stand out in simulations and in demonstrations on benchmark data sets.</description>

      <title>I-trustworthy Models. A framework for trustworthiness evaluation of probabilistic classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As probabilistic models continue to permeate various facets of our society and contribute to scientific advancements, it becomes a necessity to go beyond traditional metrics such as predictive accuracy and error rates and assess their trustworthiness. Grounded in the competence-based theory of trust, this work formalizes I-trustworthy framework -- a novel framework for assessing the trustworthiness of probabilistic classifiers for inference tasks by linking local calibration to trustworthiness. To assess I-trustworthiness, we use the local calibration error (LCE) and develop a method of hypothesis-testing. This method utilizes a kernel-based test statistic, Kernel Local Calibration Error (KLCE), to test local calibration of a probabilistic classifier. This study provides theoretical guarantees by offering convergence bounds for an unbiased estimator of KLCE. Additionally, we present a diagnostic tool designed to identify and measure biases in cases of miscalibration. The effectiveness of the proposed test statistic is demonstrated through its application to both simulated and real-world datasets. Finally, LCE of related recalibration methods is studied, and we provide evidence of insufficiency of existing methods to achieve I-trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>Learning the hub graphical Lasso model with the structured sparsity via an efficient algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical models have exhibited their performance in numerous tasks ranging from biological analysis to recommender systems. However, graphical models with hub nodes are computationally difficult to fit, particularly when the dimension of the data is large. To efficiently estimate the hub graphical models, we introduce a two-phase algorithm. The proposed algorithm first generates a good initial point via a dual alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and then warm starts a semismooth Newton (SSN) based augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to compute a solution that is accurate enough for practical tasks. We fully excavate the sparsity structure of the generalized Jacobian arising from the hubs in the graphical models, which ensures that the algorithm can obtain a nice solution very efficiently. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic data and real data show that it obviously outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, in some high dimensional tasks, it can save more than 70\% of the execution time, meanwhile still achieves a high-quality estimation.</description>

Abstract: Introducing training-time augmentations is a key technique to enhance generalization and prepare deep neural networks against test-time corruptions. Inspired by the success of generative diffusion models, we propose a novel approach of coupling data mollification, in the form of image noising and blurring, with label smoothing to align predicted label confidences with image degradation. The method is simple to implement, introduces negligible overheads, and can be combined with existing augmentations. We demonstrate improved robustness and uncertainty quantification on the corrupted image benchmarks of CIFAR, TinyImageNet and ImageNet datasets.</description>

      <title>Tree-Sliced Wasserstein Distance: A Geometric Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many variants of Optimal Transport (OT) have been developed to address its heavy computation. Among them, notably, Sliced Wasserstein (SW) is widely used for application domains by projecting the OT problem onto one-dimensional lines, and leveraging the closed-form expression of the univariate OT to reduce the computational burden. However, projecting measures onto low-dimensional spaces can lead to a loss of topological information. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we propose to replace one-dimensional lines with a more intricate structure, called tree systems. This structure is metrizable by a tree metric, which yields a closed-form expression for OT problems on tree systems. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis to formally define tree systems with their topological properties, introduce the concept of splitting maps, which operate as the projection mechanism onto these structures, then finally propose a novel variant of Radon transform for tree systems and verify its injectivity. This framework leads to an efficient metric between measures, termed Tree-Sliced Wasserstein distance on Systems of Lines (TSW-SL). By conducting a variety of experiments on gradient flows, image style transfer, and generative models, we illustrate that our proposed approach performs favorably compared to SW and its variants.</description>

      <title>MoDeGPT: Modular Decomposition for Large Language Model Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09632v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Stochastic Normalizing Flows in $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Markov Chain Monte Carlo (NE-MCMC) simulations provide a well-understood framework based on Jarzynski's equality to sample from a target probability distribution. By driving a base probability distribution out of equilibrium, observables are computed without the need to thermalize. If the base distribution is characterized by mild autocorrelations, this approach provides a way to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions share the same framework of flow-based approaches and they can be naturally combined into a novel architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this work we present the first implementation of SNFs for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions, defined by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates. The core of our analysis is focused on the promising scaling properties of this architecture with the degrees of freedom of the system, which are directly inherited from NE-MCMC. Finally, we discuss how systematic improvements of this approach can realistically lead to a general and yet efficient sampling strategy at fine lattice spacings for observables affected by long autocorrelation times.</description>

      <title>A Causal World Model Underlying Next Token Prediction: Exploring GPT in a Controlled Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07446</link>

Abstract: Do generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, trained only to predict the next token, implicitly learn a world model from which a sequence is generated one token at a time? We address this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT, and suggesting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for input sequences and present a confidence score. Empirical evaluation is conducted in a controlled environment using the setup and rules of the Othello and Chess strategy games. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, is tested on out-of-distribution synthetic data consisting of sequences of random legal moves. We find that the GPT model is likely to generate legal next moves for out-of-distribution sequences for which a causal structure is encoded in the attention mechanism with high confidence. In cases for which the GPT model generates illegal moves it also fails to capture any causal structure.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Spontaneous Topic Changes in Next Token Prediction with Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human cognition is punctuated by abrupt, spontaneous shifts between topics-driven by emotional, contextual, or associative cues-a phenomenon known as spontaneous thought in neuroscience. In contrast, self-attention based models depend on structured patterns over their inputs to predict each next token, lacking spontaneity. Motivated by this distinction, we characterize spontaneous topic changes in self-attention architectures, revealing both their similarities and their divergences from spontaneous human thought. First, we establish theoretical results under a simplified, single-layer self-attention model with suitable conditions by defining the topic as a set of Token Priority Graphs (TPGs). Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) the model maintains the priority order of tokens related to the input topic, (2) a spontaneous topic change can occur only if lower-priority tokens outnumber all higher-priority tokens of the input topic, and (3) unlike human cognition, the longer context length or the more ambiguous input topic reduces the likelihood of spontaneous change. Second, we empirically validate that these dynamics persist in modern, state-of-the-art LLMs, underscoring a fundamental disparity between human cognition and AI behaviour in the context of spontaneous topic changes. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explored these questions with a focus as closely aligned to human thought.</description>

      <title>Test-time regression: a unifying framework for designing sequence models with associative memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence models lie at the heart of modern deep learning. However, rapid advancements have produced a diversity of seemingly unrelated architectures, such as Transformers and recurrent alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework to understand and derive these sequence models, inspired by the empirical importance of associative recall, the capability to retrieve contextually relevant tokens. We formalize associative recall as a two-step process, memorization and retrieval, casting memorization as a regression problem. Layers that combine these two steps perform associative recall via ``test-time regression'' over its input tokens. Prominent layers, including linear attention, state-space models, fast-weight programmers, online learners, and softmax attention, arise as special cases defined by three design choices: the regression weights, the regressor function class, and the test-time optimization algorithm. Our approach clarifies how linear attention fails to capture inter-token correlations and offers a mathematical justification for the empirical effectiveness of query-key normalization in softmax attention. Further, it illuminates unexplored regions within the design space, which we use to derive novel higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work bridges sequence modeling with classic regression methods, a field with extensive literature, paving the way for developing more powerful and theoretically principled architectures.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Combinatorial Semi-bandits with Graph Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In combinatorial semi-bandits, a learner repeatedly selects from a combinatorial decision set of arms, receives the realized sum of rewards, and observes the rewards of the individual selected arms as feedback. In this paper, we extend this framework to include \emph{graph feedback}, where the learner observes the rewards of all neighboring arms of the selected arms in a feedback graph $G$. We establish that the optimal regret over a time horizon $T$ scales as $\widetilde{\Theta}(S\sqrt{T}+\sqrt{\alpha ST})$, where $S$ is the size of the combinatorial decisions and $\alpha$ is the independence number of $G$. This result interpolates between the known regrets $\widetilde\Theta(S\sqrt{T})$ under full information (i.e., $G$ is complete) and $\widetilde\Theta(\sqrt{KST})$ under the semi-bandit feedback (i.e., $G$ has only self-loops), where $K$ is the total number of arms. A key technical ingredient is to realize a convexified action using a random decision vector with negative correlations. We also show that online stochastic mirror descent (OSMD) that only realizes convexified actions in expectation is suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Technical Insights and Legal Considerations for Advancing Federated Learning in Bioinformatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning leverages data across institutions to improve clinical discovery while complying with data-sharing restrictions and protecting patient privacy. As the evolution of biobanks in genetics and systems biology has proved, accessing more extensive and varied data pools leads to a faster and more robust exploration and translation of results. More widespread use of federated learning may have the same impact in bioinformatics, allowing access to many combinations of genotypic, phenotypic and environmental information that are undercovered or not included in existing biobanks. This paper reviews the methodological, infrastructural and legal issues that academic and clinical institutions must address before implementing it. Finally, we provide recommendations for the reliable use of federated learning and its effective translation into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust: Task Sampling with Posterior and Diversity Synergies for Adaptive Decision-Makers in Randomized Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task robust adaptation is a long-standing pursuit in sequential decision-making. Some risk-averse strategies, e.g., the conditional value-at-risk principle, are incorporated in domain randomization or meta reinforcement learning to prioritize difficult tasks in optimization, which demand costly intensive evaluations. The efficiency issue prompts the development of robust active task sampling to train adaptive policies, where risk-predictive models are used to surrogate policy evaluation. This work characterizes the optimization pipeline of robust active task sampling as a Markov decision process, posits theoretical and practical insights, and constitutes robustness concepts in risk-averse scenarios. Importantly, we propose an easy-to-implement method, referred to as Posterior and Diversity Synergized Task Sampling (PDTS), to accommodate fast and robust sequential decision-making. Extensive experiments show that PDTS unlocks the potential of robust active task sampling, significantly improves the zero-shot and few-shot adaptation robustness in challenging tasks, and even accelerates the learning process under certain scenarios.
