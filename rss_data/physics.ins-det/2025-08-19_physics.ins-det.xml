      <title>Controlling the recovery time of the superconducting nanowire single-photon detector with a voltage-controlled cryogenic tunable resistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD), owing to their unique performance, are currently the standard detector in most demanding single-photon experiments. One important metric for any single-photon detector is the deadtime (or recovery time), defined as the minimum temporal separation between consecutive detection events. In SNSPDs, the recovery time is more subtle, as the detection efficiency does not abruptly drop to zero when the temporal separation between detection events gets smaller, instead, it increases gradually as the SNSPD current recovers. SNSPD's recovery time is dominated by its kinetic inductance, the readout impedance, and the degree of saturation of internal efficiency. Decreasing the kinetic inductance or increasing the readout impedance can accelerate the recovery process. Significant reduction of the SNSPD recovery time, by, for example, adding a series resistor in the readout circuitry, is possible but can lead to detector latching which hinders further detector operation or enforces underbiasing and hence a reduction in detection efficiency. Previous research has demonstrated passive resistive networks for the reduction of recovery time that rely on trial and error to find the appropriate resistance values. Here we show, using a novel, cryogenically compatible, and tunable resistor technology, one can find the optimized impedance values, delivering fast SNSPD recovery time, while maintaining maximum internal detection efficiency. Here we show an increase of more than 2 folds in both maximum achievable detection rates and the achievable detection efficiency at high photon fluxes, demonstrating detection rates as high as 120 Mcps with no loss of internal detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Annihilation Vertex Reconstruction Algorithm with Single-Layer Timepix4 Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of antiproton-nucleus annihilations at rest on a variety of thin solid targets using slow extracted antiprotons is being prepared. To detect the charged annihilation products, the experiment will employ seven Timepix4 ASICs coupled to 500 um thick silicon sensors. These will be arranged in a cuboid geometry that covers the majority of the full solid angle around the target, enabling precise tracking of outgoing particles using only one layer of detectors. With these novel chips, the annihilation will be studied by measuring the total multiplicity, energy, and angular distribution of various prongs produced in a number of targets. A 3D reconstruction algorithm for determining the annihilation vertex from particle tracks in the single-plane detectors has been developed using Monte Carlo simulations. This allows for event-by-event reconstruction, making it possible to distinguish antiproton annihilations on the target from those occurring elsewhere. The measurements will also enable a study of possible final state interactions triggered by the primary annihilation mesons, their evolution with the nuclear mass and their branching ratios.</description>

      <title>Real-time alpha-ray track imaging using a synthetic diamond scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrated real-time imaging of alpha-ray tracks using a high-pressure, high-temperature synthetic diamond scintillator. The optical microscopy system consisted of a magnification objective lens and an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) to detect luminescence from the diamond substrate irradiated with alpha-rays from a 241Am source. Optical images of alpha-ray tracks were successfully captured under ambient conditions, and image processing methods were performed to enable automatic event recognition and track length detection. These results demonstrate that diamond is a promising scintillator material for alpha-ray imaging, representing an important step toward exploiting the potential of diamond scintillators</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CosmicWatch Desktop Muon Detector (v3X) is a compact, low-cost, and portable device designed for detecting ionizing radiation, including cosmic-ray muons. Building on previous iterations, the v3X introduces significant hardware and firmware improvements that enhance sensitivity, usability, and data acquisition capabilities. The detector integrates a plastic scintillator and silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), custom designed electronics for signal processing, onboard data storage, OLED display, environmental sensors, and USB connectivity. With a total component cost under \$100 and a build time suitable for high school students, the v3X is ideal for education, outreach, and introductory research applications in particle and astroparticle physics. This paper details the design, performance, and potential use cases of the v3X, supported by example measurements demonstrating its functionality.</description>

      <title>Inverse Weak measurement in SERF magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak measurement techniques have been extensively applied in the field of quantum precision measurement to detect ultra-small signals due to the amplification effect. In this work, we propose an optical detection system for a spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer based on the inverse weak measurement (IWM) framework. By using the spatial pattern of a probe laser as the measurement pointer, we successfully detect ultra-weak magnetic fields. In our model, the spatial pattern of the probe laser is weakly coupled to its polarization, which is sensitive to external magnetic fields. Through post-selection on the optical polarization, the ultra-small magnetic field is significantly amplified with the amplification factor inversely proportional to the coupling strength, as reflected in the measured displacement of the final spatial pattern. By analysing the response curve of the probe laser displacement to the magnetic field, we identify the point of maximum sensitivity, achieving a magnetic field sensitivity of 182.8 fT/Hz1/2. Furthermore, in the IWM scheme, the detected signals depend only on the internal degrees of freedom of the probe laser, making the system robust against the fluctuations in laser power. To demonstrate this advantage, we compute the Allan standard deviation of the output signals for both conventional and IWM detection methods. The results indicate that the IWM-based method improves stability of detection by one to two orders of magnitude. This work presents a novel detection approach that integrates weak measurement techniques, offering a significant enhancement in the performance of SERF magnetometers.</description>

      <title>Fast silicon detectors as proton therapy beam monitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are fast silicon sensors with potential for high-resolution proton beam monitoring. In this work, we investigated their response in a 60 MeV proton beam from an AIC-144 cyclotron. Several features of the pulse structure of the cyclotron were observed for the first time. The detector and acquisition system tested was shown to provide accurate flux measurements up to an instantaneous dose rate of about 7.5 Gy/s. Above this, there is an efficiency loss due to multiple protons crossing the detector, which could be addressed through a redesign of the sensors and electronics. LGADs therefore offer a viable alternative for proton therapy beam diagnostics.</description>

      <title>A lab-on-a-silicon-chip platform for all-electrical antibiotic susceptibility tests with a sample-to-results time within 20 minutes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid antibiotic susceptibility tests (ASTs) are essential for quick selection of effective drugs to treat bacterial infections at an early stage. However, the most widely used phenotypic ASTs in clinical practice often require 24 - 48 hours of pre-culture enrichment and 8 - 20 hours of testing. They are too slow for patients to wait for therapy, even with the most rapid protocol. Here, we report a lab-on-a-silicon chip (LOSC) system, which integrates arrays of silicon nanowire field-effect transistor (SiNWFET) sensors with high-throughput cell-collection microfluidics for rapid ASTs. The microfluidics concentrate bacteria into picoliter-scale chambers within minutes, eliminating the need for any pre-cultivation. Embedded SiNWFETs sensitively track antibiotic-induced metabolic pH shifts. Using an unbuffered culturing medium, LOSC achieves sample-to-result times within 20 minutes for clinically isolated E. coli strains. With its electrical readout and compact design, LOSC offers a low-cost, rapid, and portable AST solution for point-of-care diagnostics.</description>

      <title>IsoDAR@Yemilab: Preliminary Design Report -- Volume II: Medium Energy Beam Transport, Neutrino Source, and Shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Preliminary Design Report (PDR) describes the IsoDAR electron-antineutrino source in two volumes which are mostly site-independent and describe the cyclotron driver providing a 60 MeV, 10 mA proton beam (Volume I); and the medium energy beam transport line (MEBT) and target (this Volume). The IsoDAR driver and target will produce about $1.15\cdot10^{23}$ electron-antineutrinos over five calendar years. Paired with a kton-scale liquid scintillator detector, this will enable a broad particle physics program including searches for new symmetries, new interactions and new particles. Here in Volume II, we describe the medium energy beam transport line, the antineutrino source beam-target and surrounding sleeve, shielding, and plans for monitoring and installation.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable miniaturized computational spectrometer enabled by photoelastic effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miniatured computational spectrometers, distinguished by their compact size and lightweight, have shown great promise for on-chip and portable applications in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, food safety, and industrial process monitoring. However, the common miniaturization strategies predominantly rely on advanced micro-nano fabrication and complex material engineering, limiting their scalability and affordability. Here, we present a broadband miniaturized computational spectrometer (ElastoSpec) by leveraging the photoelastic effect for easy-to-prepare and reconfigurable implementations. A single computational photoelastic spectral filter, with only two polarizers and a plastic sheet, is designed to be integrated onto the top of a CMOS sensor for snapshot spectral acquisition. The different spectral modulation units are directly generated from different spatial locations of the filter, due to the photoelastic-induced chromatic polarization effect of the plastic sheet. We experimentally demonstrate that ElastoSpec offers excellent reconstruction accuracy for the measurement of both simple narrowband and complex spectra. It achieves a full width at half maximum (FWHM) error of approximately 0.2 nm for monochromatic inputs, and maintains a mean squared error (MSE) value on the order of 10^-3 with only 10 spectral modulation units. Furthermore, we develop a reconfigurable strategy for enhanced spectra sensing performance through the flexibility in optimizing the modulation effectiveness and the number of spectral modulation units. This work avoids the need for complex micro-nano fabrication and specialized materials for the design of computational spectrometers, thus paving the way for the development of simple, cost-effective, and scalable solutions for on-chip and portable spectral sensing devices.</description>

      <title>A Neural-Network Framework for Tracking and Identification of Cosmic-Ray Nuclei in the RadMap Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a neural-network framework designed to reconstruct the properties of cosmic-ray nuclei traversing the scintillating-fiber tracking calorimeter of the RadMap Telescope. Employing the Geant4 simulation toolkit and a simplified model of the detector to generate training and test data, we achieve the spectroscopic capabilities required for an accurate determination of the biologically relevant dose that astronauts receive in space. We can reconstruct a particle's trajectory with an angular resolution of better than $1.4^\circ$ and achieve a charge separation of better than $95\%$ for nuclei with $Z\leq8$; specifically, we reach an accuracy of $99.8\%$ for hydrogen. The energy resolution is $&lt;20\%$ for energies below 1 GeV/n and elements up to iron. We also discuss the limitations of our detector, the reconstruction framework, and this feasibility study, as well as possible improvements.</description>

      <title>SPLENDOR: a novel detector platform to search for light dark matter with narrow-gap semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter direct detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Malter-Driven Electron Emission as a Source of Noise in LXe TPCs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01023v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent single-electron emission ("hot spots") has been observed in multiple liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), often persisting long after ionizing events. Although typically discussed in operational terms, the behavior is consistent with Malter-type emission triggered by ion accumulation on resistive oxide surfaces. In this note, we discuss such effects and recommend material choices and design strategies to mitigate them in future detectors. This mechanism is especially relevant to experiments targeting ultra-low energy thresholds, where even small background emissions can limit sensitivity.</description>

      <title>A High-Granularity Proton CT Enhanced by Track Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proton Computed Tomography (pCT) provides a promising solution to enhance the accuracy of Relative Stopping Power (RSP) required for proton therapy planning. This research introduces a novel high-granularity pCT architecture that incorporates a silicon pixel tracking system and a calorimetric range telescope, which uniquely integrates range telescope functionality with track discrimination capabilities. The Bortfeld function fitting and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier algorithms are developed and applied for discrimination. In simulation studies, both approaches demonstrate the capability to reduce uncertainty in Water Equivalent Path Length (WEPL) determination for individual proton tracks to below 3~mm. The standard imaging protocol (3.2~mGy, $4\times10^{8}$ protons) achieves sub-millimeter spatial resolution ($\sim$0.5 mm) with sub-1\% RSP accuracy. With proton count requirements reduced by track discrimination, an ultra-low-dose protocol (0.16~mGy, $2\times10^{7}$~protons) is proposed with achieved sub-1\% RSP accuracy and $\sim$1.1~mm spatial resolution in simulation. This low-dose performance significantly expands clinical applicability, particularly for pediatric imaging or frequent imaging scenarios. Furthermore, the target 10 MHz proton detection rate suggests potential for real-time image guidance during radiotherapy. By circumventing the need for ultra-precise energy measurements, this design minimizes hardware complexity and provides a scalable foundation for future pCT systems.</description>
