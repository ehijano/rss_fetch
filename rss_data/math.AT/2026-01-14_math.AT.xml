      <title>Binomial rings, and integral homology of complements of compact toric arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An \emph{affine subtorus} of the compact torus $T=(S^1)^n$ is a translated copy of a Lie subgroup. Given a finite collection $T_1,\ldots, T_k$ of such subtori, and a prime $p$, we describe an explicit chain complex that calculates the group $H_*(T-\bigcup_{i=1}^k T_i,\mathbb{Z}_{(p)})$. %The complex is determined by the integral homology maps induced by the inclusions $T_J\subset T_I$ where $I\subset J\subset\{1,\ldots, k\}$ and $T_I$ denotes $\bigcap_{i\in I} T_i$. Our main tool is the binomial models for spaces constructed by T.~Ekedahl. We use these results to express the groups $H_*(T-\bigcup_{i=1}^k T_i,\mathbb{Z})$. We also show that the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence that converges to the homology of $T-\bigcup_{i=1}^k T_i$ collapses at the second page rationally, and also integrally under some assumptions on the arrangement $T_1,\ldots, T_k$, with all extension problems being trivial in the latter case.</description>

      <title>Unstable synthetic deformations I: Malcev theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series of articles devoted to the construction and study of synthetic deformations of $\infty$-categories in the unstable context: that is, deformations of $\infty$-categories that categorify spectral sequence or obstruction-theoretic information.
  This paper sets up the foundations of our study. We introduce and study various classes of $\infty$-categorical and infinitary algebraic theories. We establish many basic properties of the $\infty$-categories of the models of different classes of theories, as well as recognition theorems identifying the $\infty$-categories that arise this way.
  We give an intrinsic definition of a Malcev theory in higher universal algebra. We establish that the $\infty$-category of models of a Malcev theory may be characterized as freely adjoining geometric realizations to the theory. This leads to the notion of a derived functor between $\infty$-categories of models of Malcev theories, and we study the behavior of these derived functors with respect to connectivity and limits.
  We recall the notion of a loop theory and study in detail the interaction between functors and derived functors of $\infty$-categories of loop models and models, establishing that a large class of comonads on the $\infty$-category of loop models deform canonically to the $\infty$-category of all models.
  In the last part of the paper, we show that by considering the coalgebras for these deformed comonads over $\infty$-categories of models, one can recover various stable deformations considered in the literature, such as filtered models or Postnikov-complete synthetic spectra. We then expand on these results by constructing $\infty$-categories of synthetic spaces and synthetic $\mathbf{E}_k$-rings.</description>

      <title>Unstable synthetic deformations II: Infinitesimal extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series devoted to the study of unstable synthetic deformations through the lens of Malcev theories: certain $\infty$-categorical algebraic theories $\mathcal{P}$ with well-behaved $\infty$-categories $\mathrm{Model}_{\mathcal{P}}$ of models. In this paper, we show that Malcev theories and their models admit a well-behaved deformation theory, generalizing the classical deformation theory of rings and modules.
  As our main example, we prove that the Postnikov tower of a Malcev theory $\mathcal{P}$ is a tower of square-zero extensions, and that all of this structure is preserved by passage to $\infty$-categories of models. This allows us to control the difference between the $\infty$-categories $\mathrm{Model}_{h_{n+r}\mathcal{P}}$ and $\mathrm{Model}_{h_n\mathcal{P}}$ for $r \leq n$, and forms the basis of a ``cofibre of $\tau$'' formalism in our approach to unstable synthetic homotopy theory. As an application, we derive from this a variety of new Blanc--Dwyer--Goerss style decompositions of moduli spaces of lifts along the tower $\mathrm{Model}_{\mathcal{P}}\to\cdots\to\mathrm{Model}_{h\mathcal{P}}$.</description>

      <title>Brunnian links and Kontsevich graph complex I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a natural chain map from the Kontsevich graph complex to the rational singular chain complex of $B\mathrm{Diff}_\partial(D^{2k})$ when the dimension $2k$ is sufficiently large, generalizing Goussarov and Habiro's theories of surgery on 3-valent graphs in 3-manifolds. Our construction can be considered as a topological realization of the Kontsevich graph complex. We also give new constructions of elements in the rational homotopy groups of $B\mathrm{Diff}_\partial(D^{2k})$ which are determined by well-known cycles in the graph complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We spectrally lift Ganatra-Pomerleano's low-energy log PSS morphism to compute the associated graded of Floer homotopy types of ample smooth divisor complements. Moreover, we show the obstruction to splitting into the associated graded is encoded in a stable homotopy class defined via (higher-dimensional) genus 0 relative Gromov-Witten moduli spaces. We compute numerous examples of splittings, including the affine part of all smooth projective hypersurfaces of degree at least 2.</description>

      <title>An introduction to the geometric and combinatorial group theory of Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a brief introduction to the geometric and combinatorial group theory of Artin groups. In particular we introduce the $K(\pi,1)$ conjecture for Artin groups and survey known results as of January 2024. These notes were written as companion notes for the MFO mini-workshop 2405a "Artin groups meet triangulated categories" alongside Edmund Heng's notes "Introduction to stability conditions and its relation to the $K(\pi,1)$ conjecture for Artin groups".</description>

      <title>PROPs associated to Lawvere theories and their relation to polynomial functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several adjunctions between functor categories have been studied and applied previously. These include Powell's adjunction between functor categories on free groups and on the linear PROP associated with the Lie operad, as well as those implicit in the equivalence of Pirashvili between functors on projective modules and modules over wreath products. In this paper, for a Lawvere theory $\mathcal{C}$ with a zero object, we construct a natural linear PROP $\tilde{\Phi}_{\mathcal{C}}$, which carries a canonical adjunction between functor categories over $\mathcal{C}$ and $\tilde{\Phi}_{\mathcal{C}}$. The adjunction is compatible with polynomial degree, in the sense that it gives a correspondence between polynomial $\mathcal{C}$-modules and truncated $\tilde{\Phi}_{\mathcal{C}}$-modules. We suggest that this framework provides a useful step toward studying polynomial $\mathcal{C}$-modules. To support this perspective, a large part of this paper is devoted to explicit calculations of $\tilde{\Phi}_{\mathcal{C}}$ for a specific Lawvere theory $\mathcal{C}$. This construction unifies the previously known examples, and also yields new ones, including adjunctions for functor categories on modules over a ring, as well as on free nilpotent groups and, more generally, on free $\mathcal{R}$-semisimple groups, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a radical functor for groups.</description>

      <title>Configuration spaces of circles in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the space of all configurations of finitely many (potentially nested) circles in the plane. We prove that this space is aspherical, and compute the fundamental group of each of its connected components. It turns out these fundamental groups are obtained as iterated semidirect products of subgroups of braid groups, with the structure for each component dictated by a finite rooted tree. These groups can be viewed as "braided" versions of the automorphism groups of such trees. We also discuss connections to statistical mechanics, topological data analysis, and geometric group theory.</description>
