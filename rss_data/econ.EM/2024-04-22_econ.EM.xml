      <title>Axiomatic modeling of fixed proportion technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding input substitution and output transformation possibilities is critical for efficient resource allocation and firm strategy. There are important examples of fixed proportion technologies where certain inputs are non-substitutable and/or certain outputs are non-transformable. However, there is widespread confusion about the appropriate modeling of fixed proportion technologies in data envelopment analysis. We point out and rectify several misconceptions in the existing literature, and show how fixed proportion technologies can be correctly incorporated into the axiomatic framework. A Monte Carlo study is performed to demonstrate the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Two-step Estimation of Network Formation Models with Unobserved Heterogeneities and Strategic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I characterize the network formation process as a static game of incomplete information, where the latent payoff of forming a link between two individuals depends on the structure of the network, as well as private information on agents' attributes. I allow agents' private unobserved attributes to be correlated with observed attributes through individual fixed effects. Using data from a single large network, I propose a two-step estimator for the model primitives. In the first step, I estimate agents' equilibrium beliefs of other people's choice probabilities. In the second step, I plug in the first-step estimator to the conditional choice probability expression and estimate the model parameters and the unobserved individual fixed effects together using Joint MLE. Assuming that the observed attributes are discrete, I showed that the first step estimator is uniformly consistent with rate $N^{-1/4}$, where $N$ is the total number of linking proposals. I also show that the second-step estimator converges asymptotically to a normal distribution at the same rate.</description>

      <title>The modified conditional sum-of-squares estimator for fractionally integrated models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the influence of estimating a constant term on the bias of the conditional sum-of-squares (CSS) estimator in a stationary or non-stationary type-II ARFIMA ($p_1$,$d$,$p_2$) model. We derive expressions for the estimator's bias and show that the leading term can be easily removed by a simple modification of the CSS objective function. We call this new estimator the modified conditional sum-of-squares (MCSS) estimator. We show theoretically and by means of Monte Carlo simulations that its performance relative to that of the CSS estimator is markedly improved even for small sample sizes. Finally, we revisit three classical short datasets that have in the past been described by ARFIMA($p_1$,$d$,$p_2$) models with constant term, namely the post-second World War real GNP data, the extended Nelson-Plosser data, and the Nile data.</description>

      <title>On the Asymmetric Volatility Connectedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connectedness measures the degree at which a time-series variable spills over volatility to other variables compared to the rate that it is receiving. The idea is based on the percentage of variance decomposition from one variable to the others, which is estimated by making use of a VAR model. Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2014) suggested estimating this simple and useful measure of percentage risk spillover impact. Their method is symmetric by nature, however. The current paper offers an alternative asymmetric approach for measuring the volatility spillover direction, which is based on estimating the asymmetric variance decompositions introduced by Hatemi-J (2011, 2014). This approach accounts explicitly for the asymmetric property in the estimations, which accords better with reality. An application is provided to capture the potential asymmetric volatility spillover impacts between the three largest financial markets in the world.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Identification of Monetary Policy Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new Bayesian heteroskedastic Markov-switching structural vector autoregression with data-driven time-varying identification. The model selects alternative exclusion restrictions over time and, as a condition for the search, allows to verify identification through heteroskedasticity within each regime. Based on four alternative monetary policy rules, we show that a monthly six-variable system supports time variation in US monetary policy shock identification. In the sample-dominating first regime, systematic monetary policy follows a Taylor rule extended by the term spread, effectively curbing inflation. In the second regime, occurring after 2000 and gaining more persistence after the global financial and COVID crises, it is characterized by a money-augmented Taylor rule. This regime's unconventional monetary policy provides economic stimulus, features the liquidity effect, and is complemented by a pure term spread shock. Absent the specific monetary policy of the second regime, inflation would be over one percentage point higher on average after 2008.</description>

      <title>CP Factor Model for Dynamic Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations in various applications are frequently represented as a time series of multidimensional arrays, called tensor time series, preserving the inherent multidimensional structure. In this paper, we present a factor model approach, in a form similar to tensor CP decomposition, to the analysis of high-dimensional dynamic tensor time series. As the loading vectors are uniquely defined but not necessarily orthogonal, it is significantly different from the existing tensor factor models based on Tucker-type tensor decomposition. The model structure allows for a set of uncorrelated one-dimensional latent dynamic factor processes, making it much more convenient to study the underlying dynamics of the time series. A new high order projection estimator is proposed for such a factor model, utilizing the special structure and the idea of the higher order orthogonal iteration procedures commonly used in Tucker-type tensor factor model and general tensor CP decomposition procedures. Theoretical investigation provides statistical error bounds for the proposed methods, which shows the significant advantage of utilizing the special model structure. Simulation study is conducted to further demonstrate the finite sample properties of the estimators. Real data application is used to illustrate the model and its interpretations.</description>

      <title>Maximal Inequalities for Empirical Processes under General Mixing Conditions with an Application to Strong Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a bound for the supremum of sample averages over a class of functions for a general class of mixing stochastic processes with arbitrary mixing rates. Regardless of the speed of mixing, the bound is comprised of a concentration rate and a novel measure of complexity. The speed of mixing, however, affects the former quantity implying a phase transition. Fast mixing leads to the standard root-n concentration rate, while slow mixing leads to a slower concentration rate, its speed depends on the mixing structure. Our findings are applied to derive strong approximation results for a general class of mixing processes with arbitrary mixing rates.</description>
