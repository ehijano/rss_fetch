      <title>SceneMotifCoder: Example-driven Visual Program Learning for Generating 3D Object Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in text-to-3D generation methods, generation of multi-object arrangements remains challenging. Current methods exhibit failures in generating physically plausible arrangements that respect the provided text description. We present SceneMotifCoder (SMC), an example-driven framework for generating 3D object arrangements through visual program learning. SMC leverages large language models (LLMs) and program synthesis to overcome these challenges by learning visual programs from example arrangements. These programs are generalized into compact, editable meta-programs. When combined with 3D object retrieval and geometry-aware optimization, they can be used to create object arrangements varying in arrangement structure and contained objects. Our experiments show that SMC generates high-quality arrangements using meta-programs learned from few examples. Evaluation results demonstrates that object arrangements generated by SMC better conform to user-specified text descriptions and are more physically plausible when compared with state-of-the-art text-to-3D generation and layout methods.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Spatial Dependence: Interactive Visualizations for Interpreting Local Spatial Autocorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Local Moran's I statistic is a valuable tool for identifying localized patterns of spatial autocorrelation. Understanding these patterns is crucial in spatial analysis, but interpreting the statistic can be difficult. To simplify this process, we introduce three novel visualizations that enhance the interpretation of Local Moran's I results. These visualizations can be interactively linked to one another, and to established visualizations, to offer a more holistic exploration of the results. We provide a JavaScript library with implementations of these new visual elements, along with a web dashboard that demonstrates their integrated use.</description>

      <title>Img2CAD: Reverse Engineering 3D CAD Models from Images through VLM-Assisted Conditional Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reverse engineering 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models from images is an important task for many downstream applications including interactive editing, manufacturing, architecture, robotics, etc. The difficulty of the task lies in vast representational disparities between the CAD output and the image input. CAD models are precise, programmatic constructs that involves sequential operations combining discrete command structure with continuous attributes -- making it challenging to learn and optimize in an end-to-end fashion. Concurrently, input images introduce inherent challenges such as photo-metric variability and sensor noise, complicating the reverse engineering process. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that conditionally factorizes the task into two sub-problems. First, we leverage large foundation models, particularly GPT-4V, to predict the global discrete base structure with semantic information. Second, we propose TrAssembler that conditioned on the discrete structure with semantics predicts the continuous attribute values. To support the training of our TrAssembler, we further constructed an annotated CAD dataset of common objects from ShapeNet. Putting all together, our approach and data demonstrate significant first steps towards CAD-ifying images in the wild. Our project page: https://anonymous123342.github.io/</description>

      <title>GPUDrive: Data-driven, multi-agent driving simulation at 1 million FPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent learning algorithms have been successful at generating superhuman planning in a wide variety of games but have had little impact on the design of deployed multi-agent planners. A key bottleneck in applying these techniques to multi-agent planning is that they require billions of steps of experience. To enable the study of multi-agent planning at this scale, we present GPUDrive, a GPU-accelerated, multi-agent simulator built on top of the Madrona Game Engine that can generate over a million steps of experience per second. Observation, reward, and dynamics functions are written directly in C++, allowing users to define complex, heterogeneous agent behaviors that are lowered to high-performance CUDA. We show that using GPUDrive we are able to effectively train reinforcement learning agents over many scenes in the Waymo Motion dataset, yielding highly effective goal-reaching agents in minutes for individual scenes and generally capable agents in a few hours. We ship these trained agents as part of the code base at https://github.com/Emerge-Lab/gpudrive.</description>

      <title>Geometric Algebra Meets Large Language Models: Instruction-Based Transformations of Separate Meshes in 3D, Interactive and Controllable Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) to revolutionize controllable 3D scene editing, particularly for object repositioning tasks, which traditionally requires intricate manual processes and specialized expertise. These conventional methods typically suffer from reliance on large training datasets or lack a formalized language for precise edits. Utilizing CGA as a robust formal language, our system, shenlong, precisely models spatial transformations necessary for accurate object repositioning. Leveraging the zero-shot learning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, shenlong translates natural language instructions into CGA operations which are then applied to the scene, facilitating exact spatial transformations within 3D scenes without the need for specialized pre-training. Implemented in a realistic simulation environment, shenlong ensures compatibility with existing graphics pipelines. To accurately assess the impact of CGA, we benchmark against robust Euclidean Space baselines, evaluating both latency and accuracy. Comparative performance evaluations indicate that shenlong significantly reduces LLM response times by 16% and boosts success rates by 9.6% on average compared to the traditional methods. Notably, shenlong achieves a 100% perfect success rate in common practical queries, a benchmark where other systems fall short. These advancements underscore shenlong's potential to democratize 3D scene editing, enhancing accessibility and fostering innovation across sectors such as education, digital entertainment, and virtual reality.</description>

      <title>MeshAnything V2: Artist-Created Mesh Generation With Adjacent Mesh Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MeshAnything V2, an autoregressive transformer that generates Artist-Created Meshes (AM) aligned to given shapes. It can be integrated with various 3D asset production pipelines to achieve high-quality, highly controllable AM generation. MeshAnything V2 surpasses previous methods in both efficiency and performance using models of the same size. These improvements are due to our newly proposed mesh tokenization method: Adjacent Mesh Tokenization (AMT). Different from previous methods that represent each face with three vertices, AMT uses a single vertex whenever possible. Compared to previous methods, AMT requires about half the token sequence length to represent the same mesh in average. Furthermore, the token sequences from AMT are more compact and well-structured, fundamentally benefiting AM generation. Our extensive experiments show that AMT significantly improves the efficiency and performance of AM generation. Project Page: https://buaacyw.github.io/meshanything-v2/</description>

      <title>Does empirical evidence from healthy aging studies predict a practical difference between visualizations for different age groups?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When communicating critical information to decision-makers, one of the major challenges in visualization is whether the communication is affected by different perceptual or cognitive abilities, one major influencing factor is age. We review both visualization and psychophysics literature to understand where quantitative evidence exists on age differences in visual perception. Using contrast sensitivity data from the literature we show how the differences between visualizations for different age groups can be predicted using a new model of visible frequency range with age. The model assumed that at threshold values some visual data will not be visible to older people (spatial frequency &gt; 2 and contrast &lt;=0.01). We apply this result to a practical visualization and show an example that at higher levels of contrast, the visual signal should be perceivable by all viewers over 20. Universally usable visualization should use a contrast of 0.02 or higher and be designed to avoid spatial frequencies greater than eight cycles per degree to accommodate all ages. There remains much research to do on to translate psychophysics results to practical quantitative guidelines for visualization producers.</description>

      <title>Emu Video: Factorizing Text-to-Video Generation by Explicit Image Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Emu Video, a text-to-video generation model that factorizes the generation into two steps: first generating an image conditioned on the text, and then generating a video conditioned on the text and the generated image. We identify critical design decisions--adjusted noise schedules for diffusion, and multi-stage training that enable us to directly generate high quality and high resolution videos, without requiring a deep cascade of models as in prior work. In human evaluations, our generated videos are strongly preferred in quality compared to all prior work--81% vs. Google's Imagen Video, 90% vs. Nvidia's PYOCO, and 96% vs. Meta's Make-A-Video. Our model outperforms commercial solutions such as RunwayML's Gen2 and Pika Labs. Finally, our factorizing approach naturally lends itself to animating images based on a user's text prompt, where our generations are preferred 96% over prior work.</description>

Abstract: We introduce DrawTalking, an approach to building and controlling interactive worlds by sketching and speaking while telling stories. It emphasizes user control and flexibility, and gives programming-like capability without requiring code.

      <title>HaLo-NeRF: Learning Geometry-Guided Semantics for Exploring Unconstrained Photo Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internet image collections containing photos captured by crowds of photographers show promise for enabling digital exploration of large-scale tourist landmarks. However, prior works focus primarily on geometric reconstruction and visualization, neglecting the key role of language in providing a semantic interface for navigation and fine-grained understanding. In constrained 3D domains, recent methods have leveraged vision-and-language models as a strong prior of 2D visual semantics. While these models display an excellent understanding of broad visual semantics, they struggle with unconstrained photo collections depicting such tourist landmarks, as they lack expert knowledge of the architectural domain. In this work, we present a localization system that connects neural representations of scenes depicting large-scale landmarks with text describing a semantic region within the scene, by harnessing the power of SOTA vision-and-language models with adaptations for understanding landmark scene semantics. To bolster such models with fine-grained knowledge, we leverage large-scale Internet data containing images of similar landmarks along with weakly-related textual information. Our approach is built upon the premise that images physically grounded in space can provide a powerful supervision signal for localizing new concepts, whose semantics may be unlocked from Internet textual metadata with large language models. We use correspondences between views of scenes to bootstrap spatial understanding of these semantics, providing guidance for 3D-compatible segmentation that ultimately lifts to a volumetric scene representation. Our results show that HaLo-NeRF can accurately localize a variety of semantic concepts related to architectural landmarks, surpassing the results of other 3D models as well as strong 2D segmentation baselines.

      <title>BlenderAlchemy: Editing 3D Graphics with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphics design is important for various applications, including movie production and game design. To create a high-quality scene, designers usually need to spend hours in software like Blender, in which they might need to interleave and repeat operations, such as connecting material nodes, hundreds of times. Moreover, slightly different design goals may require completely different sequences, making automation difficult. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs), like GPT-4V, to intelligently search the design action space to arrive at an answer that can satisfy a user's intent. Specifically, we design a vision-based edit generator and state evaluator to work together to find the correct sequence of actions to achieve the goal. Inspired by the role of visual imagination in the human design process, we supplement the visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs with "imagined" reference images from image-generation models, providing visual grounding of abstract language descriptions. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence suggesting our system can produce simple but tedious Blender editing sequences for tasks such as editing procedural materials and geometry from text and/or reference images, as well as adjusting lighting configurations for product renderings in complex scenes.</description>
