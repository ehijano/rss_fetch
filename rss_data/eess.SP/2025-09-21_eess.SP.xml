      <title>(SP)$^2$-Net: A Neural Spatial Spectrum Method for DOA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) of multiple sources from a single snapshot of an antenna array, a task with many practical applications. In such settings, the classical Bartlett beamformer is commonly used, as maximum likelihood estimation becomes impractical when the number of sources is unknown or large, and spectral methods based on the sample covariance are not applicable due to the lack of multiple snapshots. However, the accuracy and resolution of the Bartlett beamformer are fundamentally limited by the array aperture. In this paper, we propose a deep learning technique, comprising a novel architecture and training strategy, for generating a high-resolution spatial spectrum from a single snapshot. Specifically, we train a deep neural network that takes the measurements and a hypothesis angle as input and learns to output a score consistent with the capabilities of a much wider array. At inference time, a heatmap can be produced by scanning an arbitrary set of angles. We demonstrate the advantages of our trained model, named (SP)$^2$-Net, over the Bartlett beamformer and sparsity-based DOA estimation methods.</description>

      <title>CSIT-Free Downlink Transmission for mmWave MU-MISO Systems in High-Mobility Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the downlink (DL) transmission in millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems especially focusing on a high speed mobile scenario. To complete the DL transmission within an extremely short channel coherence time, we propose a novel DL transmission framework that eliminates the need for channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), of which acquisition process requires a substantial overhead, instead fully exploiting the given channel coherence time. Harnessing the characteristic of mmWave channel and uniquely designed CSIT-free unitary precoding, we propose a symbol detection method along with the simultaneous CSI at the receiver (CSIR) and Doppler shift estimation method to completely cancel the interferences while achieving a full combining gain. Via simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing with the existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Twisting Signals for Joint Radar-Communications: An OAM Vortex Beam Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) technology has attracted much research interest in recent years because of its characteristic helical phase front twisting around the propagation axis and natural orthogonality among different OAM states to encode more degrees of freedom than classical planar beams. Leveraging upon these features, OAM technique has been applied to wireless communication systems to enhance spectral efficiency and radar systems to distinguish spatial targets without beam scanning. Leveraging upon these unique properties, we propose an OAM-based millimeter-wave joint radar-communications (JRC) system comprising a bi-static automotive radar and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Different from existing uniform circular array (UCA) based OAM systems where each element is an isotropic antenna, an OAM spatial modulation scheme utilizing a uniform linear array (ULA) is adopted with each element being a traveling-wave antenna, producing multiple Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) vortex beams simultaneously. Specifically, we first build a novel bi-static automotive OAM-JRC model that embeds communication messages in a radar signal, following which a target position and velocity parameters estimation algorithm is designed with only radar frames. Then, an OAM-based mode-division multiplexing (MDM) strategy between radar and JRC frames is presented to ensure the JRC parameters identifiability and recovery. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the JRC system through deriving recovery guarantees and Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of radar target parameters and evaluating the bit error rate (BER) of communication, respectively. Our numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed OAM-based JRC system and parameter estimation method.</description>

      <title>Blind Source Separation of Radar Signals in Time Domain Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification and further analysis of radar emitters in a contested environment requires detection and separation of incoming signals. If they arrive from the same direction and at similar frequencies, deinterleaving them remains challenging. A solution to overcome this limitation becomes increasingly important with the advancement of emitter capabilities. We propose treating the problem as blind source separation in time domain and apply supervisedly trained neural networks to extract the underlying signals from the received mixture. This allows us to handle highly overlapping and also continuous wave (CW) signals from both radar and communication emitters. We make use of advancements in the field of audio source separation and extend a current state-of-the-art model with the objective of deinterleaving arbitrary radio frequency (RF) signals. Results show, that our approach is capable of separating two unknown waveforms in a given frequency band with a single channel receiver.</description>

      <title>Wireless Sensing with Movable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless networks are envisioned to deliver not only gigabit communications but also ubiquitous sensing. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged to reshape radio propagation, recently showing considerable promise for wireless sensing. Still, their per-element electronic tuning incurs prohibitive hardware cost and power consumption. Motivated by the concept of fluid antenna system (FAS), this paper introduces a low-cost movable intelligent surface (MIS) for wireless sensing, which replaces element-wise electronic phase tuning with panel-wise mechanical reconfiguration. The MIS stacks a large fixed and a smaller movable pre-phased metasurface layers, whose differential position shifts synthesize distinct composite phase patterns, enabling multiple beam patterns for multi-target detection. We characterize a MIS-enabled multi-hop echo signal model with multi-target interference and then formulate a worst-case sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) maximization problem that jointly designs MIS phase shifts and schedules MS2's position. A Riemannian Augmented Lagrangian Method (RALM)-based algorithm is developed to solve the formulated mixed-integer non-convex problem. We also derive a heuristic MIS beam steering design with closed-form phase distribution and position scheduling. Simulations validate MIS's beam pattern reconfiguration capability, show that the RALM-based scheme significantly outperforms the closed-form scheme in improving sensing SINR, and uncover a gain-diversity trade-off in beam patterns that informs the optimal choice of MIS configuration.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sparse Antenna Arrays for Localization and Sensing using Vector Spherical Wave Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In increasing number of electronic devices implement wideband radio technologies for localization and sensing purposes, like ultra-wideband (UWB). Such radio technologies benefit from a large number of antennas, but space for antennas is often limited, especially in devices for mobile and IoT applications. A common challenge is therefore to optimize the placement and orientations of a small number of antenna elements inside a device, leading to the best localization performance. We propose a method for systematically approaching the optimization of such sparse arrays by means of Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) and vector spherical wave functions (VSWFs). The VSWFs form the basis of a wideband signal model considering frequency, direction and polarization-dependent characteristics of the antenna array under test (AUT), together with mutual coupling and distortions from surrounding obstacles. We derive the CRLBs for localization parameters like delay and angle-of-arrival for this model under additive white Gaussian noise channel conditions, and formulate optimization problems for determining optimal antenna positions and orientations via minimization of the CRLBs. The proposed optimization procedure is demonstrated by means of an exemplary arrangement of three Crossed Exponentially Tapered Slot (XETS) antennas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor localization with chirp sequence radar at millimeter wavelength offers high localization accuracy at low system cost. We propose a hybrid radar baseband signal simulator for our novel single-channel radar-based indoor localization system consisting of an active radar and passive reflectors as references. By combining ray tracing channel simulations with real measurements of the two-way antenna gain of the radar and accurate simulation of the radar cross section of chosen reflectors, realistic modeling of the baseband receive signal in complex scenarios is achieved.</description>

      <title>Extended k-u Fading Model in mmWave Communication: Statistical Properties and Performance Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a small-scale fading model, named the extended k-u model, which incorporates the imbalance of multipath clusters by adding a new parameter based on the original k-u model. The extended k-u model outperforms the k-u model in characterizing small-scale fading in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band and has more accurate modeling capability than the extended n-u model in scenarios with line-of-sight (LoS) paths. And it is mathematically more tractable than the a-k-n-u model. Experiments are conducted for mmWave communication scenarios with LoS paths, covering the outdoor 28 GHz band, the indoor 65 GHz band, and the indoor 92 GHz band. The results demonstrate that the extended k-u model achieves a smaller mean square error in fitting the measured data compared to both the k-u model and the extended n-u model across all scenarios. In addition, through theoretical derivations, closed-form expressions are obtained for the key statistical characteristics of the extended k-u model, including the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, moments of arbitrary order, and moment generating function. Based on these statistics, this study further derives and analyzes the expressions for some performance metrics of the communication system, including the amount of fading, the probability of outage, and the average bit error rate.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multi-Task Learning for Joint Wireless Signal Enhancement and Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless signal recognition (WSR) is crucial in modern and future wireless communication networks since it aims to identify the properties of the received signal in a no-collaborative manner. However, it is challenging to accurately classify signals in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions and distributed network settings. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed multi-task learning framework for joint wireless signal enhancement and recognition (WSER), addressing the crucial need for non-collaborative signal identification in modern wireless networks. Our approach integrates a wireless signal enhancement and recognition network (WSERNet) with FedProx+, an enhanced federated learning algorithm designed for heterogeneous data distributions. Specifically, WSERNet leverages an asymmetric convolution block (ACBlock) to capture long-range dependencies in the input signal and improve the performance of the deep learning model. FedProx+ introduces a proximal term to the loss function to encourage the model updates to be closer to the previous model, enhancing the convergence speed and robustness of federated learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for joint WSER, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under both centralized and distributed settings including independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data distributions.</description>

      <title>Explainable Deep Learning Based Adversarial Defense for Automatic Modulation Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been widely applied to enhance automatic modulation classification (AMC). However, the elaborate AMC neural networks are susceptible to various adversarial attacks, which are challenging to handle due to the generalization capability and computational cost. In this article, an explainable DL based defense scheme, called SHapley Additive exPlanation enhanced Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SHAP-AFT), is developed in the perspective of disclosing the attacking impact on the AMC network. By introducing the concept of cognitive negative information, the motivation of using SHAP for defense is theoretically analyzed first. The proposed scheme includes three stages, i.e., the attack detection, the information importance evaluation, and the AFT. The first stage indicates the existence of the attack. The second stage evaluates contributions of the received data and removes those data positions using negative Shapley values corresponding to the dominating negative information caused by the attack. Then the AMC network is fine-tuned based on adversarial adaptation samples using the refined received data pattern. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the Shapley value as the key indicator as well as the superior defense performance of the proposed SHAP-AFT scheme in face of different attack types and intensities.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of THz Inter-Satellite ISAC Under Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a theoretical framework for analyzing the fundamental performance limits of terahertz (THz) Low Earth Orbit (LEO) inter-satellite link (ISL) Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) systems. We develop a unified, end-to-end signal model that, jointly captures the effects of extreme orbital dynamics, cascaded non-ideal hardware impairments, and micro-radian beam pointing errors. Through Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (BCRLB) analysis, we derive the ultimate sensing accuracy for range and range-rate, revealing a quadratic ($1/f_c^2$) improvement in estimation variance with carrier frequency, which is ultimately floored by signal-dependent hardware distortion. For communication, we show that system performance is not power-limited but hardware-limited, deriving a closed-form capacity ceiling under the joint effect of phase noise and PA nonlinearity: $C_{\text{sat}} = \log_2(1 + e^{-\sigma_\phi^2}/\Gamma_{\text{eff}})$, where $\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$ is a proposed hardware quality factor. Our numerical results, based on state-of-the-art component data and the identified trade-offs, suggest that favorable operational conditions may exist in the sub-THz frequency range (200-600 GHz) where the quadratic sensing gain with frequency is balanced against hardware quality degradation. Power Amplifier (PA) nonlinearity emerges as the dominant performance bottleneck, exceeding other impairments by one to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>MoE-CE: Enhancing Generalization for Deep Learning based Channel Estimation via a Mixture-of-Experts Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable channel estimation (CE) is fundamental for robust communication in dynamic wireless environments, where models must generalize across varying conditions such as signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the number of resource blocks (RBs), and channel profiles. Traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods struggle to generalize effectively across such diverse settings, particularly under multitask and zero-shot scenarios. In this work, we propose MoE-CE, a flexible mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework designed to enhance the generalization capability of DL-based CE methods. MoE-CE provides an appropriate inductive bias by leveraging multiple expert subnetworks, each specialized in distinct channel characteristics, and a learned router that dynamically selects the most relevant experts per input. This architecture enhances model capacity and adaptability without a proportional rise in computational cost while being agnostic to the choice of the backbone model and the learning algorithm. Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets generated under diverse SNRs, RB numbers, and channel profiles, including multitask and zero-shot evaluations, we demonstrate that MoE-CE consistently outperforms conventional DL approaches, achieving significant performance gains while maintaining efficiency.</description>

      <title>Scalable Hessian-free Proximal Conjugate Gradient Method for Nonconvex and Nonsmooth Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies a composite minimization problem involving a differentiable function q and a nonsmooth function h, both of which may be nonconvex. This problem is ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning yet remains challenging to solve efficiently, particularly when large-scale instances, poor conditioning, and nonconvexity coincide. To address these challenges, we propose a proximal conjugate gradient method (PCG) that matches the fast convergence of proximal (quasi-)Newton algorithms while reducing computation and memory complexity, and is especially effective for spectrally clustered Hessians. Our key innovation is to form, at each iteration, an approximation to the Newton direction based on CG iterations to build a majorization surrogate. We define this surrogate in a curvature-aware manner and equip it with a CG-derived isotropic weight, guaranteeing majorization of a local second-order model of q along the given direction. To better preserve majorization after the proximal step and enable further approximation refinement, we scale the CG direction by the ratio between the Cauchy step length and a step size derived from the largest Ritz value of the CG tridiagonal. All curvature is accessed via Hessian-vector products computed by automatic differentiation, keeping the method Hessian-free. Convergence to first-order critical points is established. Numerical experiments on CS-MRI with nonconvex regularization and on dictionary learning, against benchmark methods, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Wireless Channel Foundation Model with Embedded Noise-Plus-Interference Suppression Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless channel foundation model (WCFM) is a task-agnostic AI model that is pretrained on large-scale wireless channel datasets to learn a universal channel feature representation that can be used for a wide range of downstream tasks related to communications and sensing. While existing works on WCFM have demonstrated its great potentials in various tasks including beam prediction, channel prediction, localization, etc, the models are all trained using perfect (i.e., error-free and complete) channel information state (CSI) data which are generated with simulation tools. However, in practical systems where the WCFM is deployed, perfect CSI is not available. Instead, channel estimation needs to be first performed based on pilot signals over a subset of the resource elements (REs) to acquire a noisy version of the CSI (termed as degraded CSI), which significantly differs from the perfect CSI in some real-world environments with severe noise and interference. As a result, the feature representation generated by the WCFM is unable to reflect the characteristics of the true channel, yielding performance degradation in downstream tasks. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an enhanced wireless channel foundation model architecture with noise-plus-interference (NPI) suppression capability. In our approach, coarse estimates of the CSIs are first obtained. With these information, two projection matrices are computed to extract the NPI terms in the received signals, which are further processed by a NPI estimation and subtraction module. Finally, the resultant signal is passed through a CSI completion network to get a clean version of the CSI, which is used for feature extraction. Simulation results demonstrated that compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, WCFM with NPI suppression structure achieves improved performance on channel prediction task.</description>

      <title>Secure Multicast Communications with Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates secure multicast communications in pinching-antenna systems (PASS), where pinching beamforming is enabled by adaptively adjusting pinching antenna (PAs) positions along waveguides to improve multicast security. Specifically, a PASS-based secure multicast framework is proposed, in which joint optimization of transmit and pinching beamforming is conducted to maximize the secrecy multicast rate. i) For the single-group multicast scenario, an alternating optimization (AO) framework is employed, where the pinching beamformer is updated via an element-wise sequential optimization method. The transmit beamformer is designed via a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) formulation for an upper-bound solution, while a Dinkelbach-alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) offers a low-complexity alternative. ii) For the multi-group multicast scenario, transmit and pinching beamformers are alternately optimized under a majorization-minimization (MM) framework. The transmit beamformer is obtained via SDR or an efficient second-order cone programming (SOCP) method, while the pinching beamformer is updated through MM-based element-wise sequential update strategy. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that: (i) PASS consistently outperform conventional fixed-location antenna architectures in terms of secrecy performance across various configurations; and (ii) the performance advantage of PASS over fixed-location architectures becomes more significant with increased service region, larger antenna arrays, and higher user and eavesdropper densities.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Fault Detection of Submerged Pump Impellers Using Encapsulated Accelerometers and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical turbine pumps in oil and gas operations rely on motor-mounted accelerometers for condition monitoring. However, these sensors cannot detect faults at submerged impellers exposed to harsh downhole environments. We present the first study deploying encapsulated accelerometers mounted directly on submerged impeller bowls, enabling in-situ vibration monitoring. Using a lab-scale pump setup with 1-meter oil submergence, we collected vibration data under normal and simulated fault conditions. The data were analyzed using a suite of machine learning models -- spanning traditional and deep learning methods -- to evaluate sensor effectiveness. Impeller-mounted sensors achieved 91.3% average accuracy and 0.973 AUC-ROC, outperforming the best non-submerged sensor. Crucially, encapsulation caused no statistically significant performance loss in sensor performance, confirming its viability for oil-submerged environments. While the lab setup used shallow submergence, real-world pump impellers operate up to hundreds of meters underground -- well beyond the range of surface-mounted sensors. This first-of-its-kind in-situ monitoring system demonstrates that impeller-mounted sensors -- encapsulated for protection while preserving diagnostic fidelity -- can reliably detect faults in critical submerged pump components. By capturing localized vibration signatures that are undetectable from surface-mounted sensors, this approach enables earlier fault detection, reduces unplanned downtime, and optimizes maintenance for downhole systems in oil and gas operations.</description>

      <title>Xona Pulsar Compatibility with GNSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At least ten emerging providers are developing satellite navigation systems for low Earth orbit (LEO). Compatibility with existing GNSS in L-band is critical to their successful deployment and for the larger ecosystem. Xona is deploying Pulsar, a near 260-satellite LEO constellation offering dual L-band navigation services near L1 and L5. Designed for interoperability, Pulsar provides centimeter-level accuracy, resilience, and authentication, while maintaining a format that existing GNSS receivers can support through a firmware update. This study examines Pulsar's compatibility with GPS and Galileo by evaluating C/N0 degradation caused by the introduction of its X1 and X5 signals. Using spectrally compact QPSK modulation, Pulsar minimizes interference despite higher signal power. Theoretical analysis is supported by hardware testing across a range of commercial GNSS receivers in both lab-based simulation and in-orbit live-sky conditions. The study confirms Pulsar causes no adverse interference effects to existing GNSS, supporting coexistence and integration within the global PNT ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Meets Wireless Sensing: Towards Wireless Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has made significant advancements in fields such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating its capability to synthesize high-fidelity data and improve generalization. Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating GenAI into wireless sensing systems. By leveraging generative techniques such as data augmentation, domain adaptation, and denoising, wireless sensing applications, including device localization, human activity recognition, and environmental monitoring, can be significantly improved. This survey investigates the convergence of GenAI and wireless sensing from two complementary perspectives. First, we explore how GenAI can be integrated into wireless sensing pipelines, focusing on two modes of integration: as a plugin to augment task-specific models and as a solver to directly address sensing tasks. Second, we analyze the characteristics of mainstream generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and diffusion models, and discuss their applicability and unique advantages across various wireless sensing tasks. We further identify key challenges in applying GenAI to wireless sensing and outline a future direction toward a wireless foundation model: a unified, pre-trained design capable of scalable, adaptable, and efficient signal understanding across diverse sensing tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Physical Layer Security in IoT-Based RF-FSO Integrated Networks: Multi-RIS Structures and their Impact on Secure Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their ability to dynamically control the propagation environment, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a promising solution to address the challenges of $6$G wireless communication, especially in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This paper investigates a mixed communication model with multi-RIS-aided radio frequency (RF)-free space optics (FSO) to enhance the performance of IoT applications in complex environments. An eavesdropper is assumed to be present, attempting to intercept confidential information transmitted over the RF link. All RF links are modeled using Rician fading, while the FSO link accounts for M\'alaga turbulence with pointing errors, capturing real-world propagation conditions. Closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the secrecy outage probability, average secrecy capacity, and effective secrecy throughput in terms of Meijer's G function. To gain further insight, high signal-to-noise approximations of these metrics are also presented. Numerical results highlight the importance of heterodyne detection in mitigating the adverse effects of pointing errors on the FSO link. Moreover, integrating a multi-RIS structure into the proposed model significantly increases secrecy performance, achieving up to a $47.67\%$ improvement in SOP compared to conventional methods. Finally, the derived analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>In-Ear Electrode EEG for Practical SSVEP BCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) methods for brain computer interfaces (BCI) are popular due to higher information transfer rate and easier setup with minimal training, compared to alternative methods. With precisely generated visual stimulus frequency, it is possible to translate brain signals into external actions or signals. Traditionally, SSVEP data is collected from the occipital region using electrodes with or without gel, normally mounted on a head cap. In this experimental study, we develop an in ear electrode to collect SSVEP data for four different flicker frequencies and compare against occipital scalp electrode data. Data from five participants demonstrates the feasibility of in-ear electrode based SSVEP, significantly enhancing the practicability of wearable BCI applications.</description>

      <title>Direct Estimation of Eigenvalues of Large Dimensional Precision Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider directly estimating the eigenvalues of precision matrix, without inverting the corresponding estimator for the eigenvalues of covariance matrix. We focus on a general asymptotic regime, i.e., the large dimensional regime, where both the dimension $N$ and the sample size $K$ tend to infinity whereas their quotient $N/K$ converges to a positive constant. By utilizing tools from random matrix theory, we construct an improved estimator for eigenvalues of precision matrix. We prove the consistency of the new estimator under large dimensional regime. In order to obtain the asymptotic bias term of the proposed estimator, we provide a theoretical result that characterizes the convergence rate of the expected Stieltjes transform (with its derivative) of the spectra of the sample covariance matrix. Using this result, we prove that the asymptotic bias term of the proposed estimator is of order $O(1/K^2)$. Additionally, we establish a central limiting theorem (CLT) to describe the fluctuations of the new estimator. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to validate the excellent performance of the new estimator and to verify the accuracy of the CLT.</description>

      <title>Bench-RNR: Dataset for Benchmarking Repetitive and Non-repetitive Scanning LiDAR for Infrastructure-based Vehicle Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle localization using roadside LiDARs can provide centimeter-level accuracy for cloud-controlled vehicles while simultaneously serving multiple vehicles, enhanc-ing safety and efficiency. While most existing studies rely on repetitive scanning LiDARs, non-repetitive scanning LiDAR offers advantages such as eliminating blind zones and being more cost-effective. However, its application in roadside perception and localization remains limited. To address this, we present a dataset for infrastructure-based vehicle localization, with data collected from both repetitive and non-repetitive scanning LiDARs, in order to benchmark the performance of different LiDAR scanning patterns. The dataset contains 5,445 frames of point clouds across eight vehicle trajectory sequences, with diverse trajectory types. Our experiments establish base-lines for infrastructure-based vehicle localization and compare the performance of these methods using both non-repetitive and repetitive scanning LiDARs. This work offers valuable insights for selecting the most suitable LiDAR scanning pattern for infrastruc-ture-based vehicle localization. Our dataset is a signifi-cant contribution to the scientific community, supporting advancements in infrastructure-based perception and vehicle localization. The dataset and source code are publicly available at: https://github.com/sjtu-cyberc3/BenchRNR.</description>

Abstract: We extend our work on a novel indoor positioning system (IPS) for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) based on radar sensing of local, passive radar reflectors. Through the combination of simple reflectors and a single-channel frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar, high positioning accuracy at low system cost can be achieved. Further, a multi-objective (MO) particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented that optimizes the 2D placement of radar reflectors in complex room settings.</description>

      <title>Rec-RIR: Monaural Blind Room Impulse Response Identification via DNN-based Reverberant Speech Reconstruction in STFT Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Room impulse response (RIR) characterizes the complete propagation process of sound in an enclosed space. This paper presents Rec-RIR for monaural blind RIR identification. Rec-RIR is developed based on the convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation, which models reverberation effect within narrow-band filter banks in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. Specifically, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) with cross-band and narrow-band blocks to estimate the CTF filter. The DNN is trained through reconstructing the noise-free reverberant speech spectra. This objective enables stable and straightforward supervised training. Subsequently, a pseudo intrusive measurement process is employed to convert the CTF filter estimate into time-domain RIR by simulating a common intrusive RIR measurement procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-RIR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both RIR identification and acoustic parameter estimation. Open-source codes are available online at https://github.com/Audio-WestlakeU/Rec-RIR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a short double-stranded RNA molecule (about 21-23 nucleotides) with the potential to cure diseases by silencing the function of target genes. Due to its well-understood mechanism, many siRNA-based drugs have been evaluated in clinical trials. However, selecting effective binding regions and designing siRNA sequences requires extensive experimentation, making the process costly. As genomic resources and publicly available siRNA datasets continue to grow, data-driven models can be leveraged to better understand siRNA-mRNA interactions. To fully exploit such data, curating high-quality siRNA datasets is essential to minimize experimental errors and noise. We propose siDPT: siRNA efficacy Prediction via Debiased Preference-Pair Transformer, a framework that constructs a preference-pair dataset and designs an siRNA-mRNA interactive transformer with debiased ranking objectives to improve siRNA inhibition prediction and generalization. We evaluate our approach using two public datasets and one newly collected patent dataset. Our model demonstrates substantial improvement in Pearson correlation and strong performance across other metrics.</description>

      <title>SolarCrossFormer: Improving day-ahead Solar Irradiance Forecasting by Integrating Satellite Imagery and Ground Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance are required for the large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the power grid. However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</description>

Abstract: Geometric acoustics is an efficient approach to room acoustics modeling, governed by the canonical time-dependent rendering equation. Acoustic radiance transfer (ART) solves the equation through discretization, modeling the time- and direction-dependent energy exchange between surface patches given with flexible material properties. We introduce DART, a differentiable and efficient implementation of ART that enables gradient-based optimization of material properties. We evaluate DART on a simpler variant of the acoustic field learning task, which aims to predict the energy responses of novel source-receiver settings. Experimental results show that DART exhibits favorable properties, e.g., better generalization under a sparse measurement scenario, compared to existing signal processing and neural network baselines, while remaining a simple, fully interpretable system.</description>

We extend the prior works to reflect the compositional nature of mixing and search for a graph of audio processors. First, we construct a mixing console, applying all available processors to every track and subgroup. With differentiable processor implementations, we optimize their parameters with gradient descent. Then, we repeat the process of removing negligible processors and fine-tuning the remaining ones. This way, the quality of the full mixing console can be preserved while removing approximately two-thirds of the processors. The proposed method can be used not only to analyze individual music mixes but also to collect large-scale graph data that can be used for downstream tasks, e.g., automatic mixing. Especially for the latter purpose, efficient implementation of the search is crucial. To this end, we present an efficient batch-processing method that computes multiple processors in parallel. We also exploit the "dry/wet" parameter of the processors to accelerate the search. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses are conducted to evaluate the proposed method's performance, behavior, and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Targeted Fine-Tuning of DNN-Based Receivers via Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first use of influence functions for deep learning-based wireless receivers. Applied to DeepRx, a fully convolutional receiver, influence analysis reveals which training samples drive bit predictions, enabling targeted fine-tuning of poorly performing cases. We show that loss-relative influence with capacity-like binary cross-entropy loss and first-order updates on beneficial samples most consistently improves bit error rate toward genie-aided performance, outperforming random fine-tuning in single-target scenarios. Multi-target adaptation proved less effective, underscoring open challenges. Beyond experiments, we connect influence to self-influence corrections and propose a second-order, influence-aligned update strategy. Our results establish influence functions as both an interpretability tool and a basis for efficient receiver adaptation.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Beam Training Through Beam Diverging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates beam training techniques for near-field (NF) extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs). Existing NF beam training methods predominantly rely on beam focusing, where the base station (BS) transmits highly spatially selective beams to locate the user equipment (UE). However, these beam-focusing-based schemes suffer from both high beam sweeping overhead and limited accuracy in the NF, primarily due to the narrow beams' high susceptibility to misalignment. To address this, we propose a novel NF beam training paradigm using diverging beams. Specifically, we introduce the beam diverging effect and exploit it for low-overhead, high-accuracy beam training. First, we design a diverging codeword to induce the beam diverging effect with a single radio frequency (RF) chain. Next, we develop a diverging polar-domain codebook (DPC) along with a hierarchical method that enables angular-domain localization of the UE with only 2 log_2(N) pilots, where N denotes the number of antennas. Finally, we enhance beam training performance through two additional techniques: a DPC angular range reduction strategy to improve the effectiveness of beam diverging, and a pilot set expansion method to increase overall beam training accuracy. Numerical results show that our algorithm achieves near-optimal accuracy with a small pilot overhead, outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>3D Near-Field Beam Training for Uniform Planar Arrays through Beam Diverging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In future 6G communication systems, large-scale antenna arrays promise enhanced signal strength and spatial resolution, but they also increase the complexity of beam training. Moreover, as antenna counts grow and carrier wavelengths shrink, the channel model transits from far-field (FF) planar waves to near-field (NF) spherical waves, further complicating the beam training process. This paper focuses on millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems equipped with large-scale uniform planar arrays (UPAs), which produce 3D beam patterns and introduce additional challenges for NF beam training. Existing methods primarily rely on either FF steering or NF focusing codewords, both of which are highly sensitive to mismatches in user equipment (UE) location, leading to high sensitivity to even slight mismatch and excessive training overhead. In contrast, we introduce a novel beam training approach leveraging the beam-diverging effect, which enables adjustable wide-beam coverage using only a single radio frequency (RF) chain. Specifically, we first analyze the spatial characteristics of this effect in UPA systems and leverage them to construct hierarchical codebooks for coarse UE localization. Then, we develop a 3D sampling mechanism to build an NF refinement codebook for precise beam training. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior beam training performance while maintaining low training overhead.</description>

      <title>MIMO Detection with Spatial Sigma-Delta ADCs: A Variational Bayesian Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial Sigma-Delta ($\Sigma\Delta$) architecture can be leveraged to reduce the quantization noise and enhance the effective resolution of few-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at certain spatial frequencies of interest. Utilizing the variational Bayesian (VB) inference framework, this paper develops novel data detection algorithms tailored for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with few-bit $\Sigma\Delta$ ADCs and angular channel models, where uplink signals are confined to a specific angular sector. We start by modeling the corresponding Bayesian networks for the $1^{\mathrm{st}}$- and $2^{\mathrm{nd}}$-order $\Sigma\Delta$ receivers. Next, we propose an iterative algorithm, referred to as Sigma-Delta variational Bayes (SD-VB), for MIMO detection, offering low-complexity updates through closed-form expressions of the variational densities of the latent variables. We also study the impact of mutual coupling on the performance of the proposed SD-VB algorithms when the antenna spacing is reduced. Simulation results show that the proposed $2^{\mathrm{nd}}$-order SD-VB algorithm delivers the best symbol error rate (SER) performance while maintaining the same computational complexity as in unquantized systems, matched-filtering VB with conventional quantization, and linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) methods. Moreover, the $1^{\mathrm{st}}$- and $2^{\mathrm{nd}}$-order SD-VB algorithms achieve their lowest SER at an antenna separation of one-fourth wavelength for a fixed number of antenna elements. The effects of mutual coupling, the steering angle of the $\Sigma\Delta$ architecture, the number of ADC resolution bits, and the number of antennas and users are also extensively analyzed.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal Beyond Diagonal RIS: Sum-Rate Maximization in Full-Duplex Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been envisioned as a key technology in future wireless communication networks to enable smart radio environment. To further enhance the passive beamforming capability of RIS, beyond diagonal (BD)-RIS has been proposed considering reconfigurable interconnections among different RIS elements. BD-RIS has a unique feature that cannot be enabled by conventional diagonal RIS; it can be realized by non-reciprocal circuits and thus enables an asymmetric scattering matrix. This feature provides the capability to break the wireless channel reciprocity, and has the potential to benefit full-duplex (FD) systems. In this paper, we model the BD RIS-assisted FD systems, where the impact of BD-RIS non-reciprocity and that of structural scattering, which refers to the specular reflection generated by RIS when the RIS is turned OFF, are explicitly captured. To assess the benefits of non-reciprocal BD-RIS, we optimise the scattering matrix, precoder and combiner to maximize the DL and UL sum-rates in the FD system. To tackle this optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordination descent (BCD) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD). Numerical results demonstrate surprising benefits of non-reciprocal BD-RIS that it can achieve much higher DL and UL sum-rates in the FD scenario than reciprocal BD-RIS and conventional diagonal RIS.</description>

      <title>SuPreME: A Supervised Pre-training Framework for Multimodal ECG Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME is pre-trained using structured diagnostic labels derived from ECG report entities through a one-time offline extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs), which help denoise, standardize cardiac concepts, and improve clinical representation learning. By fusing ECG signals with textual cardiac queries instead of fixed labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen conditions without further fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 106 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance of $77.20\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art eSSLs by $4.98\%$. Results demonstrate SuPreME's effectiveness in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Joint Sensing and Communications via Fractionally Constrained Fractional Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies an uplink dual-functional sensing and communication system aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), whose reflection pattern is configured to trade-off sensing and communication functionalities. Specifically, the Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) for estimating the azimuth angle of a sensing user is minimized while ensuring the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints for communication users. We show that this problem can be formulated as a novel fractionally constrained fractional programming (FCFP) problem. To deal with this nontrivial optimization problem, we extend a quadratic transform technique, originally proposed to handle optimization problems containing fractional structures only in objectives, to the scenario where the constraints also include ratios. First, we consider the case where the fading coefficient is known. Using the quadratic transform, the FCFP problem can be turned into a sequence of subproblems that are convex except for the constant-modulus constraints which can be tackled using a penalty-based approach. To further reduce the computational complexity, we leverage the constant-modulus conditions and propose a novel linear transform. This new transform enables the FCFP problem to be turned into a sequence of linear programming (LP) subproblems, which can be solved efficiently. Then, we consider the case where the fading coefficient is unknown. A modified BCRLB is used to make the problem more tractable, and the proposed quadratic transform based algorithm is used to solve the problem. Numerical results unveil nontrivial and effective reflection patterns that can be synthesized by the RIS to facilitate both communication and sensing functionalities.</description>

      <title>A Unified Foundation Model for Wireless Technology Recognition and Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless Technology Recognition (WTR) and localization are essential in modern communication systems, enabling efficient spectrum management, seamless coexistence of diverse technologies, and accurate positioning in dynamic environments. In real-world conditions, solutions must handle signals from various resources with different sampling rates, capturing devices, frequency bands, and propagation conditions. Traditional methods, such as energy detection and conventional Deep Learning (DL) models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), often lack the robustness to generalize across unseen technologies, environments, or tasks. In this work, we introduce a Transformer-based foundation model for both WTR and localization, pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on large-scale, unlabeled datasets of In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) and Channel Impulse Response (CIR) timeseries. The model leverages input patching for computational efficiency and employs a two-stage pipeline: self-supervised pre-training to learn general-purpose representations, followed by lightweight fine-tuning for task-specific adaptation. This enables the model to generalize to new wireless technologies and unseen environments using minimal labeled samples. Evaluations across short-range and long-range datasets show superior accuracy in WTR (up to 99.99%), Line-Of-Sight (LOS) detection (up to 100%), and ranging error correction (reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by up to 50%), all while maintaining low computational complexity. These results underscore the potential of a reusable wireless foundation model for multi-task applications with minimal retraining.</description>

      <title>Full-Dimensional Beamforming for Multi-User MIMO-OFDM ISAC for Low-Altitude UAV with Zero Sensing Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play an important role for low-altitude economy with a wide range of applications like precise agriculture, aerial delivery and surveillance. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key technology to enable the large-scale deployment and routine usage of UAVs by providing both communication and sensing services efficiently. For UAV ISAC systems, as UAV often acts as both a communication user equipment (UE) and a sensing target, traditional ISAC systems that usually allocate dedicated TF resources for sensing are inefficient due to the severe degradation of communication spectral efficiency. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC framework for UAVs that eliminates the need for dedicated sensing TF resources, achieving zero TF sensing overhead. By designing the transmit beamforming to meet the requirements for both communication and sensing tasks, our proposed approach enables the communication TF resources to be fully reused for sensing, thereby enhancing both the communication sum rate and the sensing performance in terms of resolution, unambiguous range, and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a low-complexity target searching beamforming algorithm and a two-stage super-resolution sensing algorithm, which ensure efficient implementation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MIMO-OFDM-ISAC framework not only improves the communication sum rate but also outperforms traditional ISAC systems in sensing performance, making it a promising solution for future ISAC systems to support low-altitude UAVs.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the Number of Degrees of Freedom ($N_{\rm DoF}$) of the field in deterministic and stochastic source models within Electromagnetic Information Theory (EIT). Our findings demonstrate a fundamental connection between these two approaches. Specifically, we show that a deterministic model and a stochastic model with a spatially incoherent and homogeneous source yield not only the same $N_{\rm DoF}$ but also identical eigenvalues and basis functions for field representation. This key equivalence not only explains the effectiveness of deterministic approaches in EIT but also corroborates the use of classical electromagnetic methods within this new discipline.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantization-Aware Neural Receivers: Beyond Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As wireless communication systems advance toward Sixth Generation (6G) Radio Access Networks (RAN), Deep Learning (DL)-based neural receivers are emerging as transformative solutions for Physical Layer (PHY) processing, delivering superior Block Error Rate (BLER) performance compared to traditional model-based approaches. Practical deployment on resource-constrained hardware, however, requires efficient quantization to reduce latency, energy, and memory without sacrificing reliability. In this paper, we extend Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) by focusing on Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), which incorporates low-precision simulation during training for robustness at ultra-low bitwidths. In particular, we develop a QAT methodology for a neural receiver architecture and benchmark it against a PTQ approach across diverse 3GPP Clustered Delay Line (CDL) channel profiles under both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-LoS (NLoS) conditions, with user velocities up to 40 m/s. Results show that 4-bit and 8-bit QAT models achieve BLERs comparable to FP32 models at a 10% target BLER. Moreover, QAT models succeed in NLoS scenarios where PTQ models fail to reach the 10% BLER target, while also yielding an 8x compression. These results with respect to full-precision demonstrate that QAT is a key enabler of low-complexity and latency-constrained inference at the PHY layer, facilitating real-time processing in 6G edge devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces face challenges from neural signal instability and memory constraints for real-time implantable applications. We introduce an online SNN decoder using local three-factor learning rules with dual-timescale eligibility traces that avoid backpropagation through time while maintaining competitive performance. Our approach combines error-modulated Hebbian updates, fast/slow trace consolidation, and adaptive learning rate control, requiring only O(1) memory versus O(T) for BPTT methods. Evaluations on two primate datasets achieve comparable decoding accuracy (Pearson $R \geq 0.63$ Zenodo, $R \geq 0.81$ MC Maze) with 28-35% memory reduction and faster convergence than BPTT-trained SNNs. Closed-loop simulations with synthetic neural populations demonstrate adaptation to neural disruptions and learning from scratch without offline calibration. This work enables memory-efficient, continuously adaptive neural decoding suitable for resource-constrained implantable BCI systems.</description>

      <title>FOVAL: Calibration-Free and Subject-Invariant Fixation Depth Estimation Across Diverse Eye-Tracking Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate fixation depth estimation is essential for applications in extended reality (XR), robotics, and human-computer interaction. However, current methods heavily depend on user-specific calibration, which limits their scalability and usability. We introduce FOVAL, a robust calibration-free approach that combines spatiotemporal sequence modelling via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with subject-invariant feature engineering and normalisation. Compared to Transformers, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), and CNNs, FOVAL achieves superior performance, particularly in scenarios with limited and noisy gaze data. Evaluations across three benchmark datasets using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) and cross-dataset validation show a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.1 cm and strong generalisation without calibration. We further analyse inter-subject variability and domain shifts, providing insight into model robustness and adaptation. FOVAL's scalability and accuracy make it highly suitable for real-world deployment.</description>

Abstract: Simulating the long-term dynamics of multi-scale and multi-physics systems poses a significant challenge in understanding complex phenomena across science and engineering. The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes, which manifest in PDEs through coupled, nonlinear terms that govern the evolution of multiple physical fields across scales. Neural operators have shown potential in short-term prediction of such complex spatio-temporal dynamics; however, achieving stable high-fidelity predictions and providing robust uncertainty quantification over extended time horizons remains an open and unsolved area of research. These limitations often lead to stability degradation with rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by multi-scale behaviors involving dynamics of different orders. To address these challenges, we propose an autoregressive Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn the system dynamics at a distinct scale through a dual-path architecture that integrates frequency-domain and spatio-temporal representations. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of \ours blocks, the resulting model explicitly captures the underlying dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is introduced to learn a probabilistic refinement temporally while simultaneously quantifying prediction uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term probabilistic forecasting. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Direct Analytics on Semantic-aware Time Series Data Compression</title>

Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to tackle the challenges of massive growing data traffic and sustainable data communication. It shifts the focus from data fidelity to goal-oriented or task-oriented semantic transmission. While deep learning-based methods are commonly used for semantic encoding and decoding, they struggle with the sequential nature of time series data and high computation cost, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments. Data compression plays a crucial role in reducing transmission and storage costs, yet traditional data compression methods fall short of the demands of goal-oriented communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct analytics on time series data compressed by the SHRINK compression algorithm. Through experimentation using outlier detection as a case study, we show that our method outperforms baselines running on uncompressed data in multiple cases, with merely 1% difference in the worst case. Additionally, it achieves four times lower runtime on average and accesses approximately 10% of the data volume, which enables edge analytics with limited storage and computation power. These results demonstrate that our approach offers reliable, high-speed outlier detection analytics for diverse IoT applications while extracting semantics from time-series data, achieving high compression, and reducing data transmission.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Sensing: CRB Scaling Laws over Time and Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14905</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new wireless sensing system utilizing a movable antenna (MA) that continuously moves and receives sensing signals to enhance sensing performance over the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) sensing. We show that the angle estimation performance is fundamentally determined by the MA trajectory, and derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square error (MSE) for angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the trajectory for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) antenna movement. For the 1D case, a globally optimal trajectory that minimizes the CRB is derived in closed form. Notably, the resulting CRB decreases cubically with sensing time in the time-constrained regime, whereas it decreases linearly with sensing time and quadratically with the movement line segment's length in the space-constrained regime. For the 2D case, we aim to achieve the minimum of maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes. To this end, we design an efficient alternating optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the MA's horizontal or vertical coordinates with the other being fixed, yielding a locally optimal trajectory. Numerical results show that the proposed 1D/2D MA-based sensing schemes significantly reduce both the CRB and actual AoA estimation MSE compared to conventional FPA-based sensing with uniform linear/planar arrays (ULAs/UPAs) as well as various benchmark MA trajectories. Moreover, it is revealed that the steering vectors of our designed 1D/2D MA trajectories have low correlation in the angular domain, thereby effectively increasing the angular resolution for achieving higher AoA estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Watermarking and Anomaly Detection in Machine Learning Models for LORA RF Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) distinguishes wireless devices by the small variations in their analog circuits, avoiding heavy cryptographic authentication. While deep learning on spectrograms improves accuracy, models remain vulnerable to copying, tampering, and evasion. We present a stronger RFFI system combining watermarking for ownership proof and anomaly detection for spotting suspicious inputs. Using a ResNet-34 on log-Mel spectrograms, we embed three watermarks: a simple trigger, an adversarially trained trigger robust to noise and filtering, and a hidden gradient/weight signature. A convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Kullback-Leibler (KL) warm-up and free-bits flags off-distribution queries. On the LoRa dataset, our system achieves 94.6% accuracy, 98% watermark success, and 0.94 AUROC, offering verifiable, tamper-resistant authentication.</description>
