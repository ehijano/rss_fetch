      <title>Mechanically Regulated Cranial Growth in Infancy: A Computational Approach to Predicting Craniosynostosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In early years of life, the cranium rapidly changes in size and shape to accommodate brain growth, primarily driven by mechanical stress from brain expansion. Developmental disorders such as premature fusion of sutures in craniosynostosis, disrupts normal growth process, leading to abnormal skull shapes. Thus, understanding the interplay between biomechanical forces, soft tissues, and individual bone plates is crucial for understanding their role in shaping infant skulls. This study develops a mechanically-driven growth model to simulate healthy cranial growth in the first year. The algorithm considers simultaneous and coupled growth of brain, cranial bones, sutures, with volumetric brain expansion as the primary driver, with strain-based feedback governing growth in bone and suture tissues. A bulk bone formation approach accounts for evolving mechanical properties, with elastic moduli of bone and sutures increasing monthly. The model was applied on individual fused sutures and skull dysmorphologies due to craniosynostosis were predicted, and results showed good agreement with clinically observations. Stress at bone-suture interfaces and elevated intracranial pressure under fused sutures highlighted biomechanical impacts due to the disorders. Sensitivity analysis explored how material properties and growth rates affect skull shape. This framework enhances understanding of cranial growth and supports treatment planning for craniosynostosis.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Timescale Barrier: Generative Discovery of Conformational Free-Energy Landscapes and Transition Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular transitions -- such as protein folding, allostery, and membrane transport -- are central to biology yet remain notoriously difficult to simulate. Their intrinsic rarity pushes them beyond reach of standard molecular dynamics, while enhanced-sampling methods are costly and often depend on arbitrary variables that bias outcomes. We introduce Gen-COMPAS, a generative committor-guided path sampling framework that reconstructs transition pathways without predefined variables and at a fraction of the cost. Gen-COMPAS couples a generative diffusion model, which produces physically realistic intermediates, with committor-based filtering to pinpoint transition states. Short unbiased simulations from these intermediates rapidly yield full transition-path ensembles that converge within nanoseconds, where conventional methods require orders of magnitude more sampling. Applied to systems from a miniprotein to a ribose-binding protein to a mitochondrial carrier, Gen-COMPAS retrieves committors, transition states, and free-energy landscapes efficiently, uniting machine learning and molecular dynamics for broad mechanistic and practical insight.</description>

      <title>Octopus-like Reaching Motion: A Perspective Inspired by Whipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stereotypical reaching motion of the octopus arm has drawn growing attention for its efficient control of a highly deformable body. Previous studies suggest that its characteristic bend propagation may share underlying principles with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates whether whip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce the kinematic features observed in biological reaching and their similarities and differences. Platform-based whipping tests were performed in water and air while systematically varying material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based quantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor speed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus reaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than exhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus reaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of propagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding medium in forming octopus-like reaching motion. This study provides a new perspective for understand biological reaching movement, and offers a potential platform for future hydrodynamic research.</description>

      <title>Confined floating active carpets generate coherent vortical flows that enhance transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slicks are thin viscous films that can be found at the air--water interface of water bodies such as lakes, rivers and oceans. These micro-layers are enriched in surfactants, organic matter, and microorganisms, and exhibit steep physical and chemical gradients across only tens to hundreds of micrometers. In such geometrically confined environments, the hydrodynamics and transport of nutrients, pollutants, and microorganisms are constrained, yet they collectively sustain key biogenic processes. It remains however largely unexplored how the hydrodynamic flows and transport are affected by the vertical extent of slicks relative to the size of microbial colonies. Here, we study this question by combining analytical and numerical approaches to model a microbial colony as an active carpet: a two-dimensional distribution of micro-swimmers exerting dipolar forces. We show that there exists a ratio between the carpet size and the confinement height that is optimal for the enhancement of particle transport toward the colony edges through advective flows that recirculate in 3D vortex-ring-like patterns with a characteristic length comparable to the confinement height. Our results demonstrate that finite, coherent vortex-ring-like structures can arise solely from the geometrical confinement ratio of slick thickness to microbial colony size. These findings shed light on the interplay between collective activity and out-of-equilibrium transport, and on how microbial communities form, spread, and persist in geometrically constrained environments such as surface slicks.</description>

      <title>Topology of the simplest gene switch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here, we show how a topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm would fail. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized multimodal stationary phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the single-mode and bimodal phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of the steady-state peaks.</description>

      <title>The random walk of intermittently self-propelled particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by various recent experimental findings, we propose a dynamical model of intermittently self-propelled particles: active particles that recurrently switch between two modes of motion, namely an active run-state and a turn state, in which self-propulsion is absent. The durations of these motility modes are derived from arbitrary waiting-time distributions. We derive the expressions for exact forms of transport characteristics like mean-square displacements and diffusion coefficients to describe such processes. Furthermore, the conditions for the emergence of sub- and superdiffusion in the long-time limit are presented. We give examples of some important processes that occur as limiting cases of our system, including run-and-tumble motion of bacteria, L\'evy walks, hop-and-trap dynamics, intermittent diffusion and continuous time random walks.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Caudal Fin Swimmers Incorporating Hydrodynamics, Kinematics, Morphology, and Scale Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many species of fish, as well as biorobotic underwater vehicles, employ body caudal fin propulsion, in which a wave-like body motion culminates in high-amplitude caudal fin oscillations to generate thrust. This study uses high fidelity simulations of a mackerel-inspired caudal fin swimmer across a wide range of Reynolds and Strouhal numbers to analyze the relationship between swimming kinematics and hydrodynamic forces. Central to this work is the derivation and use of a model for the leading edge vortex on the caudal fin. This vortex dominates the thrust production from the fin and the LEV model forms the basis for the derivation of scaling laws grounded in flow physics. Scaling laws are derived for thrust, power, efficiency, cost-of-transport, and swimming speed, and are parameterized using data from high fidelity simulations. These laws are validated against published simulation and experimental data, revealing several new kinematic and morphometric parameters that critically influence hydrodynamic performance. The results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding thrust generation, optimizing swimming performance, and assessing the effects of scale and morphology in aquatic locomotion of both fish and biorobotic underwater vehicles.</description>

      <title>Self-organized epithelial reticulum inhibits cell proliferation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As epithelial development or wound closure approaches completion, cell proliferation progressively slows via contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) - a mechanism understood as being strictly local. Here we report the discovery of inhibition of proliferation through an unanticipated mechanism that is non-local. Within the epithelial layer arises a self-organized reticulum comprising two interpenetrating multiscale networks: islands of mechanically compressed non-cycling cells embedded within an ocean of mechanically tensed cycling cells. The evolution of these networks was found to be susceptible to specific mechanical and molecular stimuli. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that is well-captured by network theory, and implies self-organization and proximity to criticality. Thus, the findings demonstrate a completely new biological paradigm - reticular inhibition of proliferation (RIP).</description>
