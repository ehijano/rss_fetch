      <title>The asymptotic Samuel functions and applications to resolution of singularities techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the asymptotic Samuel function to define the Samuel slope of a Noetherian local ring, and we prove that it characterizes local regular excellent rings. In addition, we introduce a second invariant that refines the Samuel slope using generic linear cuts, the refined Samuel slope.
  We show that both, the Samuel slope and the refined Samuel slope, are connected to invariants coming from resolution of singularities.</description>

      <title>Ideal-theoretic non-noetherianity of polynomial functors in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing open problem in representation stability is whether every finitely generated commutative algebra in the category of strict polynomial functors satisfies the noetherian property. In this paper, we resolve this problem negatively over fields of positive characteristic using ideas from invariant theory. Specifically, we consider the algebra $P$ of polarizations of elementary symmetric polynomials inside the ring of all multisymmetric polynomials in $p \times \infty$ variables. We show $P$ is not noetherian based on two key facts: (1) the $p$-th power of every multisymmetric polynomial is in $P$ (our main technical result) and (2) the ring of multisymmetric polynomials is Frobenius split.</description>

      <title>General symmetric ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure and properties of symmetric ideals generated by general forms in the polynomial ring under the natural action of the symmetric group. This work significantly broadens the framework established in our earlier collaboration with Harada on principal symmetric ideals. A novel aspect of our approach is the construction of a bijective parametrization of general symmetric ideals using Macaulay-Matlis duality, which is asymptotically independent of the number of variables of the ambient ring. We establish that general symmetric ideals exhibit extremal behavior in terms of Hilbert functions and Betti numbers, and satisfy the Weak Lefschetz Property. We also demonstrate explicit asymptotic stability in their algebraic and homological invariants under increasing numbers of variables, showing that such ideals form well-behaved $\mathfrak{S}_\infty$-invariant chains.</description>

      <title>Structured and Punctured Nullstellens\"atze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Nullstellensatz is a theorem providing information on polynomials that vanish on a certain set: David Hilbert's Nullstellensatz (1893) is a cornerstone of algebraic geometry, and Noga Alon's Combinatorial Nullstellensatz (1999) is a powerful tool in the "Polynomial Method", a technique used in combinatorics. Alon's Theorem excludes that a polynomial vanishing on a grid contains a monomial with certain properties. This theorem has been generalized in several directions, two of which we will consider in detail: Terence Tao and Van H. Vu (2006), Uwe Schauz (2008) and Micha\l{} Laso\'n (2010) exclude more monomials, and recently, Bogdan Nica (2023) improved the result for grids with additional symmetries in their side edges. Simeon Ball and Oriol Serra (2009) incorporated the multiplicity of zeros and gave Nullstellens\"atze for punctured grids, which are sets of the form $X \setminus Y$ with both $X,Y$ grids.
  We generalize some of these results; in particular, we provide a common generalization to the results of Schauz and Nica. To this end, we establish that during multivariate polynomial division, certain monomials are unaffected. This also allows us to generalize Pete L. Clark's proof of the nonzero counting theorem by Alon and F\"uredi to punctured grids.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of moment-angle complexes associated to almost linear resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hurewicz image in the homology of a moment-angle complex, when passed through an isomorphism with the Ext-module of the corresponding Stanley-Reisner ideal, contains the linear strand of this ideal. This recovers and refines results of various authors identifying the homotopy type of a moment-angle complex as a wedge of spheres when the underlying ideal satisfies certain linearity properties. Going further, we study the homotopy types of moment-angle manifolds associated to Gorenstein Stanley-Reisner ideals with (componentwise) almost linear resolutions. The simplicial complexes that give rise to these manifolds are part of an even larger class that we introduce, which generalises the homological behaviour of cyclic polytopes, stacked polytopes and odd-dimensional neighbourly sphere triangulations. For these simplicial complexes the associated moment-angle manifolds are shown to be formal, having the rational homotopy type of connected sums of sphere products, and the (integral) loop space homotopy type of products of spheres and loop spaces of spheres. Along the way we establish a number of purely algebraic results, in particular generalising a result of R\"omer characterising Koszul modules so that it can be applied to modules with almost linear resolutions.</description>

      <title>$p$-local decompositions of looped polyhedral products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that localised away from a finite set of primes, the loop space of a moment-angle complex is homotopy equivalent to a product of loops on spheres. This verifies a conjecture of Anick for such spaces. We also develop a method to reduce the study of the loops of more general polyhedral products to that of the loops on a moment-angle complex. As a consequence, we give $p$-local loop space decompositions of a wide family of polyhedral products, quasitoric manifolds and simply connected toric orbifolds. We also describe the additive structure of loop homology of simply connected polyhedral products in terms of polynomials studied by Backelin and Berglund.</description>

      <title>Powers of Edge Ideals with Linear Quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that second and higher powers of the edge ideals of anticycles admit linear quotient orderings, although the edge ideals themselves do not, thus resolving an open question of Hoefel and Whieldon in the affirmative and providing the first class of gap-free graphs whose edge ideals satisfy this property on their powers. We also construct an explicit and straightforward linear quotient ordering for any power of a quadratic monomial ideal which admits linear quotients. This expands on a well-known result of Herzog, Hibi, and Zheng. As a consequence, we give explicit formulas for the projective dimension and Betti numbers of the edge ideals of whisker graphs.</description>
