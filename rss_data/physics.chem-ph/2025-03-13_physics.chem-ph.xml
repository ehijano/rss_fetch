      <title>Uncertainty in the era of machine learning for atomistic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning surrogate models has significantly improved the scale and complexity of systems and processes that can be explored accurately and efficiently using atomistic modeling. However, the inherently data-driven nature of machine learning models introduces uncertainties that must be quantified, understood, and effectively managed to ensure reliable predictions and conclusions. Building upon these premises, in this Perspective, we first overview state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation methods, from Bayesian frameworks to ensembling techniques, and discuss their application in atomistic modeling. We then examine the interplay between model accuracy, uncertainty, training dataset composition, data acquisition strategies, model transferability, and robustness. In doing so, we synthesize insights from the existing literature and highlight areas of ongoing debate.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Accurate Semi-Empirical Approach for Hydrogen-Exchange Kinetic Isotope Effect Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is essential in various chemical applications from reaction mechanism studies to tritium removal from water. Traditional KIE evaluation relies on experimental measurements or computational approaches like density functional theory (DFT), which are often costly and inaccurate. Here, we present a novel semi-empirical method for rapid and precise KIE estimation in proton-exchange reactions. By refining transition state identification through an iterative surface scan, our approach significantly improves accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Benchmarking against experimental data demonstrates superior performance compared to both DFT and conventional semi-empirical methods. Additionally, validation with tritium exchange reactions confirms its robustness. The computational implementation is freely available, facilitating its integration into future research.</description>

      <title>Towards Excitations and Dynamical Quantities in Correlated Lattices with Density Matrix Embedding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density matrix embedding theory (DMET) provides a framework to describe ground-state expectation values in strongly correlated systems, but its extension to dynamical quantities is still an open problem. We demonstrate one route to obtaining excitations and dynamical spectral functions by using the techniques of DMET to approximate the matrix elements that arise in a single-mode inspired excitation ansatz. We demonstrate this approach in the 1D Hubbard model, comparing the neutral excitations, single-particle density of states, charge, and spin dynamical structure factors to benchmarks from the Bethe ansatz and density matrix renormalization group. Our work highlights the potential of these ideas in building computationally efficient approaches for dynamical quantities.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine Coupling Constants on Quantum Computers: Performance, Errors, and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first implementation and computation of electron spin resonance isotropic hyperfine coupling constants (HFCs) on quantum hardware. As illustrative test cases, we compute the HFCs for the hydroxyl radical (OH$^{\bullet}$), nitric oxide (NO$^{\bullet}$), and the triplet hydroxyl cation (OH$^{+}$). Our approach integrates the qubit-ADAPT method with unrestricted orbital optimization in an active space framework. To accurately measure the necessary spin one-electron reduced density matrices on current hardware, we employ a combination of error mitigation, error suppression, and post-selection, including our in-house developed ansatz-based readout and gate error mitigation. The HFCs obtained from the quantum hardware experiments align with results from unrestricted complete active space self-consistent field calculations on classical hardware. These results mark a significant step towards leveraging quantum computing for chemically relevant molecular properties and highlight the critical role of multi-method error strategies in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>The Role of Quantum Vibronic Effects in the Spin Polarization of Charge Transport through Molecular Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between molecular vibrations and spin polarization in charge transport through molecular junctions is currently a topic of high interest, with important consequences for a variety of phenomena, such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this work, we follow this theme by exploring the relationship between vibronic dynamics and the corresponding spin polarization of the nonequilibrium charge current in a molecular junction. We employ the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach, which, since it is numerically exact and treats the vibrational degrees of freedom quantum mechanically, extends previous analyses of similar models that relied on approximate transport methods. We find significant spin polarization of the charge current in the off-resonant, low-voltage regime, where the vibrations must be treated quantum mechanically. Furthermore, we are able to connect the spin polarization in the charge transport to a corresponding polarization of the vibrational dynamics, which manifests itself in the vibrational angular momentum and excitation. Our analysis covers multiple molecule-lead couplings, temperatures, orbital energies, and spin-orbit couplings, demonstrating that the vibrationally assisted spin polarization is robust across a broad range of parameters.</description>

      <title>The coupled-cluster self-energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10451v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled-cluster and Green's function theories are highly successful in treating many-body electron correlation and there has been significant interest in identifying and leveraging connections between them. Here we present a diagrammatic definition of the irreducible coupled-cluster self-energy that directly embeds coupled-cluster theory within the framework of many-body field theory. The EOM-CC treatment emerges naturally from our definition via the Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations, providing a unified description of RPA, $GW$-BSE and CC theory for ground state and excitation energies. This clarifies the origin of previously established connections between RPA, $GW$-BSE and coupled-cluster theory, and exposes the relationship between vertex corrections and the coupled-cluster amplitude equations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Chemistry in First Quantization with any Basis Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation of the energy of molecules and materials is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. Practical applications require development of quantum algorithms with reduced resource requirements. Previous work has mainly focused on quantum algorithms where the Hamiltonian is represented in second quantization with compact basis sets while existing methods in first quantization are limited to a grid-based basis. In this work, we present a new method to solve the generic ground-state chemistry problem in first quantization using any basis set. We achieve asymptotic speedup in Toffoli count for molecular orbitals, and orders of magnitude improvement using dual plane waves as compared to the second quantization counterparts. In some instances, our approach provides similar or even lower resources compared to previous first quantization plane wave algorithms that, unlike our approach, avoids the loading of the classical data. The developed methodology can be applied to variety of applications, where the matrix elements of a first quantized Hamiltonian lack simple circuit representation.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Polaron-Polariton Dispersion and Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytical microscopic theory to describe the polaron-polariton dispersion, formed by hybridizing excitons, photons, and phonons, and their coherent dynamics inside optical cavities. Starting from a microscopic light-matter Hamiltonian, we derive a simple analytical model by pursuing a non-perturbative treatment of the phonon and photon couplings to excitons. Within our theoretical framework, the phonons are treated as classical fields that are then quantized via the Floquet formalism. We show that, to a good approximation, the entire polaron-polariton system can be described using a band picture despite the phonons breaking translational symmetry. Our theory also sheds light on the long-lived coherent ballistic motion of exciton-polaritons with high excitonic character that propagate with group velocities lower than is expected from pure exciton-polariton bands, offering a microscopic explanation for these puzzling experimental observations.</description>
