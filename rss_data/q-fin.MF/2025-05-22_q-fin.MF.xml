      <title>Liquidity provision with $\tau$-reset strategies: a dynamic historical liquidity approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the launch of Uniswap and other AMM protocols, the DeFi industry has evolved from simple constant product functions with uniform liquidity distribution across the entire price axis to more advanced mechanisms that allow Liquidity Providers (LPs) to concentrate capital within selected price ranges. This evolution has introduced new research challenges focused on optimizing capital allocation in Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) under dynamic market conditions. In this paper, we present a methodology for finding optimal liquidity provision strategies in DEXs within a specific family of $\tau$-reset strategies. The approach is detailed step by step and includes an original method for approximating historical liquidity within active pool ranges using a parametric model that does not rely on historical liquidity data. We find optimal LP strategies using a machine learning approach, evaluate performance over an out-of-time period, and compare the resulting strategies against a uniform benchmark. All experiments were conducted using a custom backtesting framework specifically developed for Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs). The effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed methodology are demonstrated across various Uniswap v3 trading pairs, and also benchmarked against an alternative backtesting and strategy development tool.</description>

      <title>Shortermism and excessive risk taking in optimal execution with a target performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with the optimal execution problem when the broker's goal is to reach a performance barrier avoiding a downside barrier. The performance is provided by the wealth accumulated by trading in the market, the shares detained by the broker evaluated at the market price plus a slippage cost yielding a quadratic inventory cost. Over a short horizon, this type of remuneration leads, at the same time, to a more aggressive and less risky strategy compared to the classical one, and over a long horizon the performance turns to be poorer and more dispersed.</description>

      <title>Consumption-investment optimization with Epstein-Zin utility in unbounded non-Markovian markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper investigates the consumption-investment problem for an investor with Epstein-Zin utility in an incomplete market. A non-Markovian environment with unbounded parameters is considered, which is more realistic in practical financial scenarios compared to the Markovian setting. The optimal consumption and investment strategies are derived using the martingale optimal principle and quadratic backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) whose solutions admit some exponential moment. This integrability property plays a crucial role in establishing a key martingale argument. In addition, the paper also examines the associated dual problem and several models within the specified parameter framework.</description>
