      <title>Adaptive Command: Real-Time Policy Adjustment via Language Models in StarCraft II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Adaptive Command, a novel framework integrating large language models (LLMs) with behavior trees for real-time strategic decision-making in StarCraft II. Our system focuses on enhancing human-AI collaboration in complex, dynamic environments through natural language interactions. The framework comprises: (1) an LLM-based strategic advisor, (2) a behavior tree for action execution, and (3) a natural language interface with speech capabilities. User studies demonstrate significant improvements in player decision-making and strategic adaptability, particularly benefiting novice players and those with disabilities. This work contributes to the field of real-time human-AI collaborative decision-making, offering insights applicable beyond RTS games to various complex decision-making scenarios.</description>

      <title>Increasing Interaction Fidelity: Training Routines for Biomechanical Models in HCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomechanical forward simulation holds great potential for HCI, enabling the generation of human-like movements in interactive tasks. However, training biomechanical models with reinforcement learning is challenging, particularly for precise and dexterous movements like those required for touchscreen interactions on mobile devices. Current approaches are limited in their interaction fidelity, require restricting the underlying biomechanical model to reduce complexity, and do not generalize well. In this work, we propose practical improvements to training routines that reduce training time, increase interaction fidelity beyond existing methods, and enable the use of more complex biomechanical models. Using a touchscreen pointing task, we demonstrate that curriculum learning, action masking, more complex network configurations, and simple adjustments to the simulation environment can significantly improve the agent's ability to learn accurate touch behavior. Our work provides HCI researchers with practical tips and training routines for developing better biomechanical models of human-like interaction fidelity.</description>

      <title>Predicting User Grasp Intentions in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting user intentions in virtual reality (VR) is crucial for creating immersive experiences, particularly in tasks involving complex grasping motions where accurate haptic feedback is essential. In this work, we leverage time-series data from hand movements to evaluate both classification and regression approaches across 810 trials with varied object types, sizes, and manipulations. Our findings reveal that classification models struggle to generalize across users, leading to inconsistent performance. In contrast, regression-based approaches, particularly those using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate more robust performance, with timing errors within 0.25 seconds and distance errors around 5-20 cm in the critical two-second window before a grasp. Despite these improvements, predicting precise hand postures remains challenging. Through a comprehensive analysis of user variability and model interpretability, we explore why certain models fail and how regression models better accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of user behavior in VR. Our results underscore the potential of machine learning models to enhance VR interactions, particularly through adaptive haptic feedback, and lay the groundwork for future advancements in real-time prediction of user actions in VR.</description>

      <title>Using Generative AI to Uncover What Drives Player Enjoyment in PC and VR Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As video games continue to evolve, understanding what drives player enjoyment remains a key challenge. Player reviews provide valuable insights, but their unstructured nature makes large-scale analysis difficult. This study applies generative AI and machine learning, leveraging Microsoft Phi-4 LLM and XGBoost, to quantify and analyze game reviews from Steam and Meta Quest stores. The approach converts qualitative feedback into structured data, enabling comprehensive evaluation of key game design elements, monetization models, and platform-specific trends. The findings reveal distinct patterns in player preferences across PC and VR games, highlighting factors that contribute to higher player satisfaction. By integrating Google Cloud for largescale data storage and processing, this study establishes a scalable framework for game review analysis. The study's insights offer actionable guidance for game developers, helping optimize game mechanics, pricing strategies, and player engagement.</description>

      <title>Humans Perceive Wrong Narratives from AI Reasoning Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new generation of AI models generates step-by-step reasoning text before producing an answer. This text appears to offer a human-readable window into their computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and interpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this text matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we investigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to identify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We evaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual measurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only 29.3%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating the majority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a fundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use it, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool. We argue that reasoning texts should be treated as an artifact to be investigated, not taken at face value, and that understanding the non-human ways these models use language is a critical research direction.</description>

      <title>An Embodied AR Navigation Agent: Integrating BIM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Language Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delivering intelligent and adaptive navigation assistance in augmented reality (AR) requires more than visual cues, as it demands systems capable of interpreting flexible user intent and reasoning over both spatial and semantic context. Prior AR navigation systems often rely on rigid input schemes or predefined commands, which limit the utility of rich building data and hinder natural interaction. In this work, we propose an embodied AR navigation system that integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with a multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to support flexible, language-driven goal retrieval and route planning. The system orchestrates three language agents, Triage, Search, and Response, built on large language models (LLMs), which enables robust interpretation of open-ended queries and spatial reasoning using BIM data. Navigation guidance is delivered through an embodied AR agent, equipped with voice interaction and locomotion, to enhance user experience. A real-world user study yields a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 80.5, indicating excellent usability, and comparative evaluations show that the embodied interface can significantly improves users' perception of system intelligence. These results underscore the importance and potential of language-grounded reasoning and embodiment in the design of user-centered AR navigation systems.</description>

      <title>WHAR Datasets: An Open Source Library for Wearable Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of standardization across Wearable Human Activity Recognition (WHAR) datasets limits reproducibility, comparability, and research efficiency. We introduce WHAR datasets, an open-source library designed to simplify WHAR data handling through a standardized data format and a configuration-driven design, enabling reproducible and computationally efficient workflows with minimal manual intervention. The library currently supports 9 widely-used datasets, integrates with PyTorch and TensorFlow, and is easily extensible to new datasets. To demonstrate its utility, we trained two state-of-the-art models, TinyHar and MLP-HAR, on the included datasets, approximately reproducing published results and validating the library's effectiveness for experimentation and benchmarking. Additionally, we evaluated preprocessing performance and observed speedups of up to 3.8x using multiprocessing. We hope this library contributes to more efficient, reproducible, and comparable WHAR research.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Appearance based Gaze-Controlled Virtual Keyboard with Synchronous Asynchronous Interaction for Low-Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the demand for communication devices has increased among individuals with mobility and speech impairments. Eye-gaze tracking has emerged as a promising solution for hands-free communication; however, traditional appearance-based interfaces often face challenges such as accuracy issues, involuntary eye movements, and difficulties with extensive command sets. This work presents a multimodal appearance-based gaze-controlled virtual keyboard that utilises deep learning in conjunction with standard camera hardware, incorporating both synchronous and asynchronous modes for command selection. The virtual keyboard application supports menu-based selection with nine commands, enabling users to spell and type up to 56 English characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, punctuation, and a delete function for corrections. The proposed system was evaluated with twenty able-bodied participants who completed specially designed typing tasks using three input modalities: (i) a mouse, (ii) an eye-tracker, and (iii) an unmodified webcam. Typing performance was measured in terms of speed and information transfer rate (ITR) at both command and letter levels. Average typing speeds were 18.3+-5.31 letters/min (mouse), 12.60+-2.99letters/min (eye-tracker, synchronous), 10.94 +- 1.89 letters/min (webcam, synchronous), 11.15 +- 2.90 letters/min (eye-tracker, asynchronous), and 7.86 +- 1.69 letters/min (webcam, asynchronous). ITRs were approximately 80.29 +- 15.72 bits/min (command level) and 63.56 +- 11 bits/min (letter level) with webcam in synchronous mode. The system demonstrated good usability and low workload with webcam input, highlighting its user-centred design and promise as an accessible communication tool in low-resource settings.</description>

      <title>"Accessibility people, you go work on that thing of yours over there": Addressing Disability Inclusion in AI Product Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of generative AI has changed the way that technology is designed, constructed, maintained, and evaluated. Decisions made when creating AI-powered systems may impact some users disproportionately, such as people with disabilities. In this paper, we report on an interview study with 25 AI practitioners across multiple roles (engineering, research, UX, and responsible AI) about how their work processes and artifacts may impact end users with disabilities. We found that practitioners experienced friction when triaging problems at the intersection of responsible AI and accessibility practices, navigated contradictions between accessibility and responsible AI guidelines, identified gaps in data about users with disabilities, and gathered support for addressing the needs of disabled stakeholders by leveraging informal volunteer and community groups within their company. Based on these findings, we offer suggestions for new resources and process changes to better support people with disabilities as end users of AI.</description>

      <title>To Explain Or Not To Explain: An Empirical Investigation Of AI-Based Recommendations On Social Media Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI based social media recommendations have great potential to improve the user experience. However, often these recommendations do not match the user interest and create an unpleasant experience for the users. Moreover, the recommendation system being a black box creates comprehensibility and transparency issues. This paper investigates social media recommendations from an end user perspective. For the investigation, we used the popular social media platform Facebook and recruited regular users to conduct a qualitative analysis. We asked participants about the social media content suggestions, their comprehensibility, and explainability. Our analysis shows users mostly require explanation whenever they encounter unfamiliar content and to ensure their online data security. Furthermore, the users require concise, non-technical explanations along with the facility of controlled information flow. In addition, we observed that explanations impact the users perception of transparency, trust, and understandability. Finally, we have outlined some design implications and presented a synthesized framework based on our data analysis.</description>

      <title>Negative Shanshui: Real-time Interactive Ink Painting Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Negative Shanshui, a real-time interactive AI synthesis approach that reinterprets classical Chinese landscape ink painting, i.e., shanshui, to engage with ecological crises in the Anthropocene. Negative Shanshui optimizes a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model for real-time inferences and integrates it with gaze-driven inpainting, frame interpolation; it enables dynamic morphing animations in response to the viewer's gaze and presents as an interactive virtual reality (VR) experience. The paper describes the complete technical pipeline, covering the system framework, optimization strategies, gaze-based interaction, and multimodal deployment in an art festival. Further analysis of audience feedback collected during its public exhibition highlights how participants variously engaged with the work through empathy, ambivalence, and critical reflection.</description>

      <title>Seeing Isn't Believing: Addressing the Societal Impact of Deepfakes in Low-Tech Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfakes, AI-generated multimedia content that mimics real media, are becoming increasingly prevalent, posing significant risks to political stability, social trust, and economic well-being, especially in developing societies with limited media literacy and technological infrastructure. This work aims to understand how these technologies are perceived and impact resource-limited communities. We conducted a survey to assess public awareness, perceptions, and experiences with deepfakes, leading to the development of a comprehensive framework for prevention, detection, and mitigation in tech-limited environments. Our findings reveal critical knowledge gaps and a lack of effective detection tools, emphasizing the need for targeted education and accessible verification solutions. This work offers actionable insights to support vulnerable populations and calls for further interdisciplinary efforts to tackle deepfake challenges globally, particularly in the Global South.</description>

      <title>Observations of atypical users from a pilot deployment of a public-space social robot in a church</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though a goal of HRI is the natural integration of social robots into everyday public spaces, real-world studies still occur mostly within controlled environments with predetermined participants. True public spaces present an environment which is largely unconstrained and unpredictable, frequented by a diverse range of people whose goals can often conflict with those of the robot. When combined with the general unfamiliarity most people have with social robots, this leads to unexpected human-robot interactions in these public spaces that are rarely discussed or detected in other contexts. In this paper, we describe atypical users we observed interacting with our robot, and those who did not, during a three-day pilot deployment within a large working church and visitor attraction. We then discuss theoretical future advances in the field that could address these challenges, as well as immediate practical mitigations and strategies to help improve public space human-robot interactions in the present. This work contributes empirical insights into the dynamics of human-robot interaction in public environments and offers actionable guidance for more effective future deployments for social robot designers.</description>

      <title>A Minimalistic Approach to Predict and Understand the Relation of App Usage with Students' Academic Performances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to usage of self-reported data which may contain biasness, the existing studies may not unveil the exact relation between academic grades and app categories such as Video. Additionally, the existing systems' requirement for data of prolonged period to predict grades may not facilitate early intervention to improve it. Thus, we presented an app that retrieves past 7 days' actual app usage data within a second (Mean=0.31s, SD=1.1s). Our analysis on 124 Bangladeshi students' real-time data demonstrates app usage sessions have a significant (p&lt;0.05) negative association with CGPA. However, the Productivity and Books categories have a significant positive association whereas Video has a significant negative association. Moreover, the high and low CGPA holders have significantly different app usage behavior. Leveraging only the instantly accessed data, our machine learning model predicts CGPA within 0.36 of the actual CGPA. We discuss the design implications that can be potential for students to improve grades.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Visual Segmentation on Lexical Word Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a reader encounters a word in English, they split the word into smaller orthographic units in the process of recognizing its meaning. For example, "rough", when split according to phonemes, is decomposed as r-ou-gh (not as r-o-ugh or r-ough), where each group of letters corresponds to a sound. Since there are many ways to segment a group of letters, this constitutes a computational operation that has to be solved by the reading brain, many times per minute, in order to achieve the recognition of words in text necessary for reading. We hypothesized that providing segmentation information in the text itself could help the reading process by reducing its computational cost. In this paper we explore whether and how different visual interventions could communicate segmentation information for reading and word recognition. We ran a series of pre-registered lexical decision experiments with 192 participants that tested five types of visual segmentations: outlines, spacing, connections, underlines and color. The evidence indicates that, even with a moderate amount of training, these visual interventions always slow down word identification, but each to a different extent. These findings are important because they indicate that, at least for typical adult readers with a moderate amount of specific training in these visual interventions, accelerating the lexical decision task is unlikely. The results also offer an empirical measurement of the cost of a common set of visual manipulations of text, which can be useful for practitioners seeking to visualize alongside or within text without impacting reading performance. Finally, the interaction between typographically encoded information and visual variables presented unique patterns that deviate from existing theories, suggesting new directions for future inquiry.</description>

      <title>TextOnly: A Unified Function Portal for Text-Related Functions on Smartphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text boxes serve as portals to diverse functionalities in today's smartphone applications. However, when it comes to specific functionalities, users always need to navigate through multiple steps to access particular text boxes for input. We propose TextOnly, a unified function portal that enables users to access text-related functions from various applications by simply inputting text into a sole text box. For instance, entering a restaurant name could trigger a Google Maps search, while a greeting could initiate a conversation in WhatsApp. Despite their brevity, TextOnly maximizes the utilization of these raw text inputs, which contain rich information, to interpret user intentions effectively. TextOnly integrates large language models(LLM) and a BERT model. The LLM consistently provides general knowledge, while the BERT model can continuously learn user-specific preferences and enable quicker predictions. Real-world user studies demonstrated TextOnly's effectiveness with a top-1 accuracy of 71.35%, and its ability to continuously improve both its accuracy and inference speed. Participants perceived TextOnly as having satisfactory usability and expressed a preference for TextOnly over manual executions. Compared with voice assistants, TextOnly supports a greater range of text-related functions and allows for more concise inputs.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and Challenges of Integrating ChatGPT in Education: Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its recent debut, ChatGPT has become a global sensation and significantly impacted the field of education. Both educational researchers and practitioners have identified opportunities as well as risks associated with the use of this novel tool in educational settings. Despite the ongoing debate, there is still no research exploring occupational differences in the perception of ChatGPT in education. In this paper, we analyzed Twitter data using topic modeling and sentiment analysis to investigate how ChatGPT is perceived and discussed differently in different occupations. Our study found diverse topics discussed including its use in schools, impact on exams, academic integrity concerns, and response accuracy evaluations. While most tweets were positive or neutral, concerns about integrity and response accuracy were evident. Analysis revealed sentiment and topic variations among users' occupations. These findings emphasize the opportunities and challenges of integrating ChatGPT in education, necessitating continued monitoring and informed policy-making for responsible utilization.</description>

      <title>SCENIC: A Location-based System to Foster Cognitive Development in Children During Car Rides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Car-riding is common for children in modern life. Given the repetitive nature of daily commutes, they often feel bored and turn to electronic devices for entertainment. Meanwhile, the rich and dynamic scenery outside the car naturally attracts children's curiosity and offers valuable resources for cognitive development. Our formative study reveals that parents' support during car rides is often fleeting, as accompanying adults may struggle to consistently guide children's exploration. To address this, we propose SCENIC, an interactive system that helps children aged 6 to 11 better perceive the external environment using location-based cognitive development strategies. SCENIC builds upon experiential approaches used by parents, resulting in six strategies embedded into the system. To improve engagement during routine rides, SCENIC also incorporates dynamic point-of-interest selection and journey gallery generation. We evaluated the generated content (N=21) and conducted an in-situ user study with seven families and ten children. Results suggest that SCENIC enhances the car-riding experience and helps children better connect with their surroundings.</description>

      <title>Measuring Large Language Models Dependency: Validating the Arabic Version of the LLM-D12 Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an urgent need for reliable, culturally validated instruments to assess psychological responses to AI in general and large language models (LLMs). This need is global issue, but it is especially urgent among Arabic-speaking populations, where AI and LLMs adoption is accelerating, yet psychometric tools remain limited. This study presents the first validation of the LLM-D12, a dual-dimensional scale assessing Instrumental and Relationship Dependency on LLMs, in an Arab sample. A total of 250 Arab participants completed the Arabic version of the LLM-D12. Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirms the original 2-factor structure of LLM-D12 with all items showing good loading of corresponding Instrumental and Relationship Dependency. The scale showed good to excellent internal reliability (Cronbach alpha is 0.90 for Total, 0.85 for Instrumental Dependency, and 0.90 for Relationship Dependency). External validation revealed that Instrumental Dependency was positively associated with AI acceptance and internet addiction, while Relationship Dependency was linked to lower need for cognition and greater trustworthiness of LLM, demonstrating sensitivity of this instrument to different use and personal factors. These findings confirm that Arabic LLM-D12 is a psychometrically sound, culturally appropriate instrument, offering a necessary tool for research, education, and policy concerning AI and LLMs engagement in Arab contexts.</description>

      <title>Towards Deeper Understanding of Natural User Interactions in Virtual Reality Based Assembly Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore natural user interactions using a virtual reality simulation of a robot arm for assembly tasks. Using a Wizard-of-Oz study, participants completed collaborative LEGO and instructive PCB assembly tasks, with the robot responding under experimenter control. We collected voice, hand tracking, and gaze data from users. Statistical analyses revealed that instructive and collaborative scenarios elicit distinct behaviors and adopted strategies, particularly as tasks progress. Users tended to use put-that-there language in spatially ambiguous contexts and more descriptive instructions in spatially clear ones. Our contributions include the identification of natural interaction strategies through analyses of collected data, as well as the supporting dataset, to guide the understanding and design of natural multimodal user interfaces for instructive interaction with systems in virtual reality.</description>

      <title>Virtual Reality in Sign Language Education: Opportunities, Challenges, and the Road Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential mode of communication for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals. Its education remains limited by the lack of qualified instructors, insufficient early exposure, and the inadequacy of traditional teaching methods. Recent advances in Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer promising new approaches to enhance sign language learning through immersive, interactive, and feedback-rich environments. This paper presents a systematic review of 55 peer-reviewed studies on VR-based sign language education, identifying and analyzing five core thematic areas: (1) gesture recognition and real-time feedback mechanisms; (2) interactive VR environments for communicative practice; (3) gamification for immersive and motivating learning experiences; (4) personalized and adaptive learning systems; and (5) accessibility and inclusivity for diverse DHH learners.
  The results reveal that AI-driven gesture recognition systems integrated with VR can provide real-time feedback, significantly improving learner engagement and performance. However, the analysis highlights critical challenges: hardware limitations, inconsistent accuracy in gesture recognition, and a lack of inclusive and adaptive design. This review contributes a comprehensive synthesis of technological and pedagogical innovations in the field, outlining current limitations and proposing actionable recommendations for developers and researchers. By bridging technical advancement with inclusive pedagogy, this review lays the foundation for next-generation VR systems that are equitable, effective, and accessible for sign language learners worldwide.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Visualization Perception with Psychological Phenomena: Uncovering the Role of Subitizing in Data Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how people perceive visualizations is crucial for designing effective visual data representations; however, many heuristic design guidelines are derived from specific tasks or visualization types, without considering the constraints or conditions under which those guidelines hold. In this work, we aimed to assess existing design heuristics for categorical visualization using well-established psychological knowledge. Specifically, we examine the impact of the subitizing phenomenon in cognitive psychology -- people's ability to automatically recognize a small set of objects instantly without counting -- in data visualizations. We conducted three experiments with multi-class scatterplots -- between 2 and 15 classes with varying design choices -- across three different tasks -- class estimation, correlation comparison, and clustering judgments -- to understand how performance changes as the number of classes (and therefore set size) increases. Our results indicate if the category number is smaller than six, people tend to perform well at all tasks, providing empirical evidence of subitizing in visualization. When category numbers increased, performance fell, with the magnitude of the performance change depending on task and encoding. Our study bridges the gap between heuristic guidelines and empirical evidence by applying well-established psychological theories, suggesting future opportunities for using psychological theories and constructs to characterize visualization perception.</description>

      <title>Visual Analytics for Causal Reasoning from Real-World Health Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing capture and analysis of large-scale longitudinal health data offer opportunities to improve healthcare and advance medical understanding. However, a critical gap exists between (a) -- the observation of patterns and correlations, versus (b) -- the understanding of true causal mechanisms that drive outcomes. An accurate understanding of the underlying mechanisms that cause various changes in medical status is crucial for decision-makers across various healthcare domains and roles, yet inferring causality from real-world observational data is difficult for both methodological and practical challenges. This Grand Challenge advocates increased Visual Analytics (VA) research on this topic to empower people with the tool for sound causal reasoning from health data. We note this is complicated by the complex nature of medical data -- the volume, variety, sparsity, and temporality of health data streams make the use of causal inference algorithms difficult. Combined with challenges imposed by the realities of health-focused settings, including time constraints and traditional medical work practices, existing causal reasoning approaches are valuable but insufficient. We argue that advances in research can lead to new VA tools that augment human expertise with intuitive and robust causal inference capabilities, which can help realize a new paradigm of data-driven, causality-aware healthcare practices that improve human health outcomes.</description>

      <title>SonoCraftAR: Towards Supporting Personalized Authoring of Sound-Reactive AR Interfaces by Deaf and Hard of Hearing Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) has shown promise for supporting Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) individuals by captioning speech and visualizing environmental sounds, yet existing systems do not allow users to create personalized sound visualizations. We present SonoCraftAR, a proof-of-concept prototype that empowers DHH users to author custom sound-reactive AR interfaces using typed natural language input. SonoCraftAR integrates real-time audio signal processing with a multi-agent LLM pipeline that procedurally generates animated 2D interfaces via a vector graphics library. The system extracts the dominant frequency of incoming audio and maps it to visual properties such as size and color, making the visualizations respond dynamically to sound. This early exploration demonstrates the feasibility of open-ended sound-reactive AR interface authoring and discusses future opportunities for personalized, AI-assisted tools to improve sound accessibility.</description>

      <title>I Can't Join, But I Will Send My Agent: Stand-in Enhanced Asynchronous Meetings (SEAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and explore the user experience of SEAM -- Stand-in Enhanced Asynchronous Meetings -- virtual reality meetings in which embodied virtual agents represent absent users. During the meeting, attendees can address the agent, and the absent user can later watch the recording from its perspective to respond. Through two mixed-method studies with 45 participants using the Wizard-of-Oz approach, we explored both the perspectives of the attendees in the original meeting and of the absent users later re-watching the meeting. We found that the stand-in can enhance meetings, benefiting both present and absent collaborators. Present attendees can easily access information that drives decision-making in the meeting perceive high social presence of absentees. Absentees also felt included when watching recordings because of the social interactions and attention towards them. Our contributions demonstrate a proof of concept for future asynchronous meetings in which collaborators can interact conversationally more akin to how they would if it had been synchronous.</description>

      <title>TRUCE-AV: A Multimodal dataset for Trust and Comfort Estimation in Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and estimating driver trust and comfort are essential for the safety and widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Existing works analyze user trust and comfort separately, with limited real-time assessment and insufficient multimodal data. This paper introduces a novel multimodal dataset called TRUCE-AV, focusing on trust and comfort estimation in autonomous vehicles. The dataset collects real-time trust votes and continuous comfort ratings of 31 participants during a simulator-based fully autonomous driving. Simultaneously, physiological signals, such as heart rate, gaze, and emotions, along with environmental data (e.g., vehicle speed, nearby vehicle positions, and velocity), are recorded throughout the drives. Standard pre- and post-drive questionnaires were also administered to assess participants' trust in automation and overall well-being, enabling the correlation of subjective assessments with real-time responses. To demonstrate the utility of our dataset, we evaluated various machine learning models for trust and comfort estimation using physiological data. Our analysis showed that tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost and non-linear models such as KNN and MLP regressor achieved the best performance for trust classification and comfort regression. Additionally, we identified key features that contribute to these estimations by using SHAP analysis on the top-performing models. Our dataset enables the development of adaptive AV systems capable of dynamically responding to user trust and comfort levels non-invasively, ultimately enhancing safety, user experience, and human-centered vehicle design.</description>

      <title>"Nobody should control the end user": Exploring Privacy Perspectives of Indian Internet Users in Light of DPDPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid increase in online interactions, concerns over data privacy and transparency of data processing practices have become more pronounced. While regulations like the GDPR have driven the widespread adoption of cookie banners in the EU, India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) promises similar changes domestically, aiming to introduce a framework for data protection. However, certain clauses within the DPDPA raise concerns about potential infringements on user privacy, given the exemptions for government accountability and user consent requirements. In this study, for the first time, we explore Indian Internet users' awareness and perceptions of cookie banners, online privacy, and privacy regulations, especially in light of the newly passed DPDPA. We conducted an online anonymous survey with 428 Indian participants, which addressed: (1) users' perspectives on cookie banners, (2) their attitudes towards online privacy and privacy regulations, and (3) their acceptance of 10 contentious DPDPA clauses that favor state authorities and may enable surveillance. Our findings reveal that privacy-conscious users often lack consistent awareness of privacy mechanisms, and their concerns do not always lead to protective actions. Our thematic analysis of 143 open ended responses shows that users' privacy and data protection concerns are rooted in skepticism towards the government, shaping their perceptions of the DPDPA and fueling demands for policy revisions. Our study highlights the need for clearer communication regarding the DPDPA, user-centric consent mechanisms, and policy refinements to enhance data privacy practices in India.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Silent Paralinguistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to speak is an inherent part of human nature and fundamental to our existence as a social species. Unfortunately, this ability can be restricted in certain situations, such as for individuals who have lost their voice or in environments where speaking aloud is unsuitable. Additionally, some people may prefer not to speak audibly due to privacy concerns. For such cases, silent speech interfaces have been proposed, which focus on processing biosignals corresponding to silently produced speech. These interfaces enable synthesis of audible speech from biosignals that are produced when speaking silently and recognition aka decoding of biosignals into text that corresponds to the silently produced speech. While recognition and synthesis of silent speech has been a prominent focus in many research studies, there is a significant gap in deriving paralinguistic information such as affective states from silent speech. To fill this gap, we propose Silent Paralinguistics, aiming to predict paralinguistic information from silent speech and ultimately integrate it into the reconstructed audible voice for natural communication. This survey provides a comprehensive look at methods, research strategies, and objectives within the emerging field of silent paralinguistics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User simulation is increasingly vital to develop and evaluate recommender systems (RSs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to simulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain alignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale simulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is the extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such feedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is often ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference alignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the efficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering mechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in RSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data. Our framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate cognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing ambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty estimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation samples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using such high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes. Extensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the alignment with human preferences and in-domain reasoning capabilities of fine-tuned LLMs, and provides more insightful and interpretable signals when interacting with RSs. We believe our work will advance the RS community and offer valuable insights for broader human-centric AI research.</description>

      <title>InReAcTable: LLM-Powered Interactive Visual Data Story Construction from Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insights in tabular data capture valuable patterns that help analysts understand critical information. Organizing related insights into visual data stories is crucial for in-depth analysis. However, constructing such stories is challenging because of the complexity of the inherent relations between extracted insights. Users face difficulty sifting through a vast number of discrete insights to integrate specific ones into a unified narrative that meets their analytical goals. Existing methods either heavily rely on user expertise, making the process inefficient, or employ automated approaches that cannot fully capture their evolving goals. In this paper, we introduce InReAcTable, a framework that enhances visual data story construction by establishing both structural and semantic connections between data insights. Each user interaction triggers the Acting module, which utilizes an insight graph for structural filtering to narrow the search space, followed by the Reasoning module using the retrieval-augmented generation method based on large language models for semantic filtering, ultimately providing insight recommendations aligned with the user's analytical intent. Based on the InReAcTable framework, we develop an interactive prototype system that guides users to construct visual data stories aligned with their analytical requirements. We conducted a case study and a user experiment to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the InReAcTable framework and the prototype system for interactively building visual data stories.</description>

      <title>Can AI Have a Personality? Prompt Engineering for AI Personality Simulation: A Chatbot Case Study in Gender-Affirming Voice Therapy Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can be guided to simulate a consistent personality through prompt engineering. The study explores this concept within the context of a chatbot designed for Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) student training, specifically focused on gender-affirming voice therapy. The chatbot, named Monae Jackson, was created to represent a 32-year-old transgender woman and engage in conversations simulating client-therapist interactions. Findings suggest that with prompt engineering, the chatbot maintained a recognizable and consistent persona and had a distinct personality based on the Big Five Personality test. These results support the idea that prompt engineering can be used to simulate stable personality characteristics in AI chatbots.</description>

      <title>Caregiver-in-the-Loop AI: A Simulation-Based Feasibility Study for Dementia Task Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Caregivers of people living with dementia (PLwD) experience stress when verifying whether tasks are truly completed, even with digital reminder systems. Generative AI, such as GPT-4, may help by automating task verification through follow-up questioning and decision support.
  This feasibility study evaluates an AI-powered task verification system integrated with digital reminders for PLwD. It examines (1) GPT-4's ability to generate effective follow-up questions, (2) the accuracy of an AI-driven response flagging mechanism, and (3) the role of caregiver feedback in refining system adaptability. A simulated pipeline was tested on 64 anonymized reminders. GPT-4 generated follow-up questions with and without contextual information about PLwD routines. Responses were classified into High, Medium, or Low concern, and simulated caregiver feedback was used to refine outputs.
  Results show that contextual information and caregiver input improved the clarity and relevance of AI-generated questions. The flagging system accurately identified concerns, particularly for safety-critical tasks, though subjective or non-urgent tasks remained challenging. Findings demonstrate the feasibility of AI-assisted task verification in dementia care. Context-aware AI prompts and caregiver feedback can enhance task monitoring, reduce caregiver stress, and strengthen PLwD support. Future work should focus on real-world validation and scalability.</description>

      <title>Interactive AI and Human Behavior: Challenges and Pathways for AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Generative AI systems increasingly engage in long-term, personal, and relational interactions, human-AI engagements are becoming significantly complex, making them more challenging to understand and govern. These Interactive AI systems adapt to users over time, build ongoing relationships, and even can take proactive actions on behalf of users. This new paradigm requires us to rethink how such human-AI interactions can be studied effectively to inform governance and policy development. In this paper, we draw on insights from a collaborative interdisciplinary workshop with policymakers, behavioral scientists, Human-Computer Interaction researchers, and civil society practitioners, to identify challenges and methodological opportunities arising within new forms of human-AI interactions. Based on these insights, we discuss an outcome-focused regulatory approach that integrates behavioral insights to address both the risks and benefits of emerging human-AI relationships. In particular, we emphasize the need for new methods to study the fluid, dynamic, and context-dependent nature of these interactions. We provide practical recommendations for developing human-centric AI governance, informed by behavioral insights, that can respond to the complexities of Interactive AI systems.</description>

      <title>Social Identity in Human-Agent Interaction: A Primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social identity theory (SIT) and social categorization theory (SCT) are two facets of the social identity approach (SIA) to understanding social phenomena. SIT and SCT are models that describe and explain how people interact with one another socially, connecting the individual to the group through an understanding of underlying psychological mechanisms and intergroup behaviour. SIT, originally developed in the 1970s, and SCT, a later, more general offshoot, have been broadly applied to a range of social phenomena among people. The rise of increasingly social machines embedded in daily life has spurned efforts on understanding whether and how artificial agents can and do participate in SIA activities. As agents like social robots and chatbots powered by sophisticated large language models (LLMs) advance, understanding the real and potential roles of these technologies as social entities is crucial. Here, I provide a primer on SIA and extrapolate, through case studies and imagined examples, how SIT and SCT can apply to artificial social agents. I emphasize that not all human models and sub-theories will apply. I further argue that, given the emerging competence of these machines and our tendency to be taken in by them, we experts may need to don the hat of the uncanny killjoy, for our own good.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Human Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research paper examines, from a multidimensional perspective (cognitive, social, ethical, and philosophical), how AI is transforming human thought. It highlights a cognitive offloading effect: the externalization of mental functions to AI can reduce intellectual engagement and weaken critical thinking. On the social level, algorithmic personalization creates filter bubbles that limit the diversity of opinions and can lead to the homogenization of thought and polarization. This research also describes the mechanisms of algorithmic manipulation (exploitation of cognitive biases, automated disinformation, etc.) that amplify AI's power of influence. Finally, the question of potential artificial consciousness is discussed, along with its ethical implications. The report as a whole underscores the risks that AI poses to human intellectual autonomy and creativity, while proposing avenues (education, transparency, governance) to align AI development with the interests of humanity.</description>

      <title>Enabling Multi-Agent Systems as Learning Designers: Applying Learning Sciences to AI Instructional Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: K-12 educators are increasingly using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create instructional materials. These systems excel at producing fluent, coherent content, but often lack support for high-quality teaching. The reason is twofold: first, commercial LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini which are among the most widely accessible to teachers, do not come preloaded with the depth of pedagogical theory needed to design truly effective activities; second, although sophisticated prompt engineering can bridge this gap, most teachers lack the time or expertise and find it difficult to encode such pedagogical nuance into their requests. This study shifts pedagogical expertise from the user's prompt to the LLM's internal architecture. We embed the well-established Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework into a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to act as a sophisticated instructional designer. We tested three systems for generating secondary Math and Science learning activities: a Single-Agent baseline simulating typical teacher prompts; a role-based MAS where agents work sequentially; and a collaborative MAS-CMD where agents co-construct activities through conquer and merge discussion. The generated materials were evaluated by 20 practicing teachers and a complementary LLM-as-a-judge system using the Quality Matters (QM) K-12 standards. While the rubric scores showed only small, often statistically insignificant differences between the systems, the qualitative feedback from educators painted a clear and compelling picture. Teachers strongly preferred the activities from the collaborative MAS-CMD, describing them as significantly more creative, contextually relevant, and classroom-ready. Our findings show that embedding pedagogical principles into LLM systems offers a scalable path for creating high-quality educational content.</description>

      <title>Situational Awareness as the Imperative Capability for Disaster Resilience in the Era of Complex Hazards and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disasters frequently exceed established hazard models, revealing blind spots where unforeseen impacts and vulnerabilities hamper effective response. This perspective paper contends that situational awareness (SA)-the ability to perceive, interpret, and project dynamic crisis conditions-is an often overlooked yet vital capability for disaster resilience. While risk mitigation measures can reduce known threats, not all hazards can be neutralized; truly adaptive resilience hinges on whether organizations rapidly detect emerging failures, reconcile diverse data sources, and direct interventions where they matter most. We present a technology-process-people roadmap, demonstrating how real-time hazard nowcasting, interoperable workflows, and empowered teams collectively transform raw data into actionable insight. A system-of-systems approach enables federated data ownership and modular analytics, so multiple agencies can share timely updates without sacrificing their distinct operational models. Equally crucial, structured sense-making routines and cognitive load safeguards help humans remain effective decision-makers amid data abundance. By framing SA as a socio-technical linchpin rather than a peripheral add-on, this paper spotlights the urgency of elevating SA to a core disaster resilience objective. We conclude with recommendations for further research-developing SA metrics, designing trustworthy human-AI collaboration, and strengthening inclusive data governance-to ensure that communities are equipped to cope with both expected and unexpected crises.</description>

      <title>Democratizing AI Development: Local LLM Deployment for India's Developer Ecosystem in the Era of Tokenized APIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: India's developer community faces significant barriers to sustained experimentation and learning with commercial Large Language Model (LLM) APIs, primarily due to economic and infrastructural constraints. This study empirically evaluates local LLM deployment using Ollama as an alternative to commercial cloud-based services for developer-focused applications. Through a mixed-methods analysis involving 180 Indian developers, students, and AI enthusiasts, we find that local deployment enables substantially greater hands-on development and experimentation, while reducing costs by 33% compared to commercial solutions. Developers using local LLMs completed over twice as many experimental iterations and reported deeper understanding of advanced AI architectures. Our results highlight local deployment as a critical enabler for inclusive and accessible AI development, demonstrating how technological accessibility can enhance learning outcomes and innovation capacity in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>EyeMulator: Improving Code Language Models by Mimicking Human Visual Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code language models (so-called CodeLLMs) are now commonplace in software development. As a general rule, CodeLLMs are trained by dividing training examples into input tokens and then learn importance of those tokens in a process called machine attention. Machine attention is based solely on input token salience to output token examples during training. Human software developers are different, as humans intuitively know that some tokens are more salient than others. While intuition itself is ineffable and a subject of philosophy, clues about salience are present in human visual attention, since people tend to look at more salient words more often. In this paper, we present EyeMulator, a technique for training CodeLLMs to mimic human visual attention while training for various software development tasks. We add special weights for each token in each input example to the loss function used during LLM fine-tuning. We draw these weights from observations of human visual attention derived from a previously-collected publicly-available dataset of eye-tracking experiments in software engineering tasks. These new weights ultimately induce changes in the attention of the subject LLM during training, resulting in a model that does not need eye-tracking data during inference. Our evaluation shows that EyeMulator outperforms strong LLM baselines on several tasks such as code translation, completion and summarization. We further show an ablation study that demonstrates the improvement is due to subject models learning to mimic human attention.</description>

      <title>Localization using Angle-of-Arrival Triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization is a long-standing challenge in mobile computing, with significant implications for enabling location-aware and intelligent applications within smart environments such as homes, offices, and retail spaces. As AI assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Nest become increasingly pervasive, microphone-equipped devices are emerging as key components of everyday life and home automation. This paper introduces a passive, infrastructure-light system for localizing human speakers using speech signals captured by two or more spatially distributed smart devices. The proposed approach, GCC+, extends the Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) method to estimate the Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of audio signals at each device and applies robust triangulation techniques to infer the speaker's two-dimensional position. To further improve temporal resolution and localization accuracy, feature-space expansion and subsample interpolation techniques are employed for precise Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) estimation. The system operates without requiring hardware modifications, prior calibration, explicit user cooperation, or knowledge of the speaker's signal content, thereby offering a highly practical solution for real-world deployment. Experimental evaluation in a real-world home environment yields a median AoA estimation error of 2.2 degrees and a median localization error of 1.25 m, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of audio-based localization for enabling context-aware, privacy-preserving ambient intelligence.</description>

      <title>The Power of Framing: How News Headlines Guide Search Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search engines play a central role in how people gather information, but subtle cues like headline framing may influence not only what users believe but also how they search. While framing effects on judgment are well documented, their impact on subsequent search behavior is less understood. We conducted a controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from headlines filtered by specific linguistic frames. Headline framing significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete queries than thematic ones. We also observed modest short-term frame persistence that declined over time. These results suggest that even brief exposure to framing can meaningfully alter the direction of users information-seeking behavior.</description>

Abstract: Educational games have been widely used to teach children about cyber security. This systematic literature review reveals evidence of positive learning outcomes, after analysing 91 such games reported in 68 papers published between 2010 and 2024. However, critical gaps have also been identified regarding the design processes and the methodological rigour, including lack of systematic design, misalignment between proposed and achieved learning outcomes, rare use of control groups, limited discussions on ethical considerations, and underutilisation of emerging technologies. We recommend multiple future research directions, e.g., a hybrid approach to game design and evaluation that combines bottom-up and top-down approaches.</description>

      <title>EEG-FM-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for the Systematic Evaluation of EEG Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models are poised to significantly advance brain signal analysis by learning robust representations from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. However, their rapid proliferation has outpaced the development of standardized evaluation benchmarks, which complicates direct model comparisons and hinders systematic scientific progress. This fragmentation fosters scientific inefficiency and obscures genuine architectural advancements. To address this critical gap, we introduce EEG-FM-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for the systematic and standardized evaluation of EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs). Our contributions are threefold: (1) we curate a diverse suite of downstream tasks and datasets from canonical EEG paradigms, implementing standardized processing and evaluation protocols within a unified open-source framework; (2) we benchmark prominent state-of-the-art foundation models to establish comprehensive baseline results for a clear comparison of the current landscape; (3) we perform qualitative analyses of the learned representations to provide insights into model behavior and inform future architectural design. Through extensive experiments, we find that fine-grained spatio-temporal feature interaction, multitask unified training and neuropsychological priors would contribute to enhancing model performance and generalization capabilities. By offering a unified platform for fair comparison and reproducible research, EEG-FM-Bench seeks to catalyze progress and guide the community toward the development of more robust and generalizable EEG-FMs. Code is released at https://github.com/xw1216/EEG-FM-Bench.</description>

      <title>Talking to Robots: A Practical Examination of Speech Foundation Models for HRI Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in real-world settings need to handle imperfect audio, often degraded by hardware limitations or environmental noise, while accommodating diverse user groups. In human-robot interaction (HRI), these challenges intersect to create a uniquely challenging recognition environment. We evaluate four state-of-the-art ASR systems on eight publicly available datasets that capture six dimensions of difficulty: domain-specific, accented, noisy, age-variant, impaired, and spontaneous speech. Our analysis demonstrates significant variations in performance, hallucination tendencies, and inherent biases, despite similar scores on standard benchmarks. These limitations have serious implications for HRI, where recognition errors can interfere with task performance, user trust, and safety.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Citizen Satisfaction with Saudi Arabia's E-Government Services: A Standards-Based, Theory-Informed Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As digital government platforms become central to public service delivery, understanding citizen assessment is crucial for enhancing usability, trust, and inclusivity. This study investigates citizen satisfaction with the e-government services in Saudi Arabia through a quality-in-use framework based on ISO/IEC 25010 and ISO/IEC 25022 standards, interpreted through the lens of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). A structured questionnaire was administered to 500 citizens, yielding 276 valid responses. Satisfaction was evaluated across four dimensions: overall satisfaction, feature satisfaction, trust, and emotional engagement (pleasure). The findings demonstrate consistently high levels of satisfaction regarding usability and trust, aligning with Saudi Arabia's top-tier global ranking in e-government development. However, the results also highlight persistent challenges related to service clarity and system responsiveness. Emotional engagement was limited, indicating that users perceive these services primarily as functional tools rather than as engaging digital experiences. The study offers valuable insights for policymakers and contributes to the theoretical integration of standards-based and behavioral adoption models in the context of citizenship.</description>

      <title>DiscussLLM: Teaching Large Language Models When to Speak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just $\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.</description>

      <title>Explain and Monitor Deep Learning Models for Computer Vision using Obz AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes. Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack analytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes observability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems.</description>

      <title>Legacy Learning Strategy Based on Few-Shot Font Generation Models for Automatic Text Design in Metaverse Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The metaverse consists of hardware, software, and content, among which text design plays a critical role in enhancing user immersion and usability as a content element. However, in languages such as Korean and Chinese that require thousands of unique glyphs, creating new text designs involves high costs and complexity. To address this, this study proposes a training strategy called Legacy Learning, which recombines and transforms structures based on existing text design models. This approach enables the generation of new text designs and improves quality without manual design processes. To evaluate Legacy Learning, it was applied to Korean and Chinese text designs. Additionally, we compared results before and after on seven state of the art text generation models. As a result, text designs generated using Legacy Learning showed over a 30% difference in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metrics compared to the originals, and also exhibited meaningful style variations in visual comparisons. Furthermore, the repeated learning process improved the structural consistency of the generated characters, and an OCR based evaluation showed increasing recognition accuracy across iterations, indicating improved legibility of the generated glyphs. In addition, a System Usability Scale (SUS) survey was conducted to evaluate usability among metaverse content designers and general users. The expert group recorded a score of 95.78 ("Best Imaginable"), while the non expert group scored 76.42 ("Excellent"), indicating an overall high level of usability. These results suggest that Legacy Learning can significantly improve both the production efficiency and quality of text design in the metaverse environment.</description>

      <title>MAVIL: Design of a Multidimensional Assessment of Visual Data Literacy and its Application in a Representative Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to read, interpret, and critique data visualizations has mainly been assessed using data visualization tasks like value retrieval. Although evidence on different facets of Visual Data Literacy (VDL) is well established in visualization research and includes numeracy, graph familiarity, or aesthetic elements, they have not been sufficiently considered in ability assessments. Here, VDL is considered a multidimensional ability whose facets can be partially self-assessed. We introduce an assessment in which VDL is deconstructed as a process of understanding, in reference to frameworks from the learning sciences. MAVIL, Multidimensional Assessment of Visual Data Literacy, is composed of six ability dimensions: General Impression/Abstract Thinking, Graph Elements/Familiarity, Aesthetic Perception, Visualization Criticism, Data Reading Tasks and Numeracy/Topic Knowledge. MAVIL was designed for general audiences and implemented in a survey (n=438), representative of Austria's age groups (18-74 years) and gender split. The survey mirrors the population's VDL and shows the perception of two climate data visualizations, a line and bar chart. We found that 48% of respondents make mistakes with the simple charts, while 5% believe that they cannot summarize the visualization content. About a quarter have deficits in comprehending simple data units, and 19-20% are unfamiliar with each displayed chart type.</description>

      <title>ImaginateAR: AI-Assisted In-Situ Authoring in Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While augmented reality (AR) enables new ways to play, tell stories, and explore ideas rooted in the physical world, authoring personalized AR content remains difficult for non-experts, often requiring professional tools and time. Prior systems have explored AI-driven XR design but typically rely on manually defined VR environments and fixed asset libraries, limiting creative flexibility and real-world relevance. We introduce ImaginateAR, the first mobile tool for AI-assisted AR authoring to combine offline scene understanding, fast 3D asset generation, and LLMs -- enabling users to create outdoor scenes through natural language interaction. For example, saying "a dragon enjoying a campfire" (P7) prompts the system to generate and arrange relevant assets, which can then be refined manually. Our technical evaluation shows that our custom pipelines produce more accurate outdoor scene graphs and generate 3D meshes faster than prior methods. A three-part user study (N=20) revealed preferred roles for AI, how users create in freeform use, and design implications for future AR authoring tools. ImaginateAR takes a step toward empowering anyone to create AR experiences anywhere -- simply by speaking their imagination.</description>

      <title>LLM-D12: A Dual-Dimensional Scale of Instrumental and Relational Dependencies on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06874v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing interest in understanding how people interact with large language models (LLMs) and whether such models elicit dependency or even addictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents MagicGUI, a foundational mobile GUI agent designed to address critical challenges in perception, grounding, and reasoning within real-world mobile GUI environments. The framework is underpinned by following six key components: (1) a comprehensive and accurate dataset, constructed via the scalable GUI Data Pipeline, which aggregates the largest and most diverse GUI-centric multimodal data to date from open-source repositories, automated crawling, and targeted manual annotation; (2) enhanced perception and grounding capabilities, facilitating fine-grained multimodal alignment for UI element referencing, grounding, and screen comprehension; (3) a comprehensive and unified action space, encompassing both fundamental UI operations and complex interactive intents to support human-agent interactions; (4) planning-oriented reasoning mechanisms that enable the model to decompose complex user instructions into sequential actions with explicit intermediate meta-paln reasoning; (5) an iterative two-stage training procedure, combining large-scale continue pre-training on 7.8M samples with reinforcement fine-tuning utilizing a spatially enhanced composite reward and dual filtering strategy; and (6) competitive performance on both the proprietary Magic-RICH benchmark and over a dozen public benchmarks, achieving superior performance across GUI perception and agent tasks, while demonstrating robust generalization and real-world deployment potential in practical mobile GUI scenarios, as detailed in Figure 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing Knowledge Management Systems (KMSs) for higher education requires addressing complex human-technology interactions, especially where staff turnover and changing roles create ongoing challenges for reusing knowledge. While advances in process mining and Generative AI enable new ways of designing features to support knowledge management, existing KMSs often overlook the realities of educators' workflows, leading to low adoption and limited impact. This paper presents findings from a two-year human-centred design study with 108 higher education teachers, focused on the iterative co-design and evaluation of GoldMind, a KMS supporting in-the-flow knowledge management during digital teaching tasks. Through three design-evaluation cycles, we examined how teachers interacted with the system and how their feedback informed successive refinements. Insights are synthesised across three themes: (1) Technology Lessons from user interaction data, (2) Design Considerations shaped by co-design and usability testing, and (3) Human Factors, including cognitive load and knowledge behaviours, analysed using Epistemic Network Analysis.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy AI Psychotherapy: Multi-Agent LLM Workflow for Counseling and Explainable Mental Disorder Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based agents have emerged as transformative tools capable of executing complex tasks through iterative planning and action, achieving significant advancements in understanding and addressing user needs. Yet, their effectiveness remains limited in specialized domains such as mental health diagnosis, where they underperform compared to general applications. Current approaches to integrating diagnostic capabilities into LLMs rely on scarce, highly sensitive mental health datasets, which are challenging to acquire. These methods also fail to emulate clinicians' proactive inquiry skills, lack multi-turn conversational comprehension, and struggle to align outputs with expert clinical reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose DSM5AgentFlow, the first LLM-based agent workflow designed to autonomously generate DSM-5 Level-1 diagnostic questionnaires. By simulating therapist-client dialogues with specific client profiles, the framework delivers transparent, step-by-step disorder predictions, producing explainable and trustworthy results. This workflow serves as a complementary tool for mental health diagnosis, ensuring adherence to ethical and legal standards. Through comprehensive experiments, we evaluate leading LLMs across three critical dimensions: conversational realism, diagnostic accuracy, and explainability. Our datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents Visual Evaluative AI, a decision aid that provides positive and negative evidence from image data for a given hypothesis. This tool finds high-level human concepts in an image and generates the Weight of Evidence (WoE) for each hypothesis in the decision-making process. We apply and evaluate this tool in the skin cancer domain by building a web-based application that allows users to upload a dermatoscopic image, select a hypothesis and analyse their decisions by evaluating the provided evidence. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Visual Evaluative AI on different concept-based explanation approaches.</description>

      <title>A Wearable Strain-Sensor-Based Shoulder Patch for Fatigue Detection in Bicep Curls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common challenge in home-based rehabilitation is muscle compensation induced by pain or fatigue, where patients with weakened primary muscles recruit secondary muscle groups to assist their movement, causing issues such as delayed rehabilitation progress or risk of further injury. In a home-based setting, the subtle compensatory actions may not be perceived since physiotherapists cannot directly observe patients. To address this problem, this study develops a novel wearable strain sensor-based shoulder patch to detect fatigue-induced muscle compensation during bicep curl exercises. Built on an observation that the amplitude of a strain sensor's resistance is correlated to the motion of a joint that the sensor is attached to, we develop an algorithm that can robustly detect the state when significant changes appear in the shoulder joint motion, which indicates fatigue-induced muscle compensation in bicep curls. The developed shoulder patch is tested on 13 subjects who perform bicep curl exercises with a 5 kg dumbbell until reaching fatigue. During the experiment, the performance of the shoulder patch is also benchmarked with optical tracking sensors and surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors. Results reveal that the proposed wearable sensor and detection methods effectively monitor fatigue-induced muscle compensation during bicep curl exercises in both Real-Time and Post Hoc modes. This development marks a significant step toward enhancing the effectiveness of home-based rehabilitation by providing physiotherapists with a tool to monitor and adjust treatment plans remotely.</description>

Abstract: The social robot's open API allows users to customize open-domain interactions. However, it remains inaccessible to those without programming experience. In this work, we introduce AutoMisty, the first multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs), to enable the seamless generation of executable Misty robot code from natural language instructions. AutoMisty incorporates four specialized agent modules to manage task decomposition, assignment, problem-solving, and result synthesis. Each agent incorporates a two-layer optimization mechanism, with self-reflection for iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop for better alignment with user preferences. AutoMisty ensures a transparent reasoning process, allowing users to iteratively refine tasks through natural language feedback for precise execution. To evaluate AutoMisty's effectiveness, we designed a benchmark task set spanning four levels of complexity and conducted experiments in a real Misty robot environment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoMisty not only consistently generates high-quality code but also enables precise code control, significantly outperforming direct reasoning with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o1. All code, optimized APIs, and experimental videos will be publicly released through the webpage: https://wangxiaoshawn.github.io/AutoMisty.html</description>

      <title>Navi-plus: Managing Ambiguous GUI Navigation Tasks with Follow-up Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical user interfaces (GUI) automation agents are emerging as powerful tools, enabling humans to accomplish increasingly complex tasks on smart devices. However, users often inadvertently omit key information when conveying tasks, which hinders agent performance in the current agent paradigm that does not support immediate user intervention. To address this issue, we introduce a $\textbf{Self-Correction GUI Navigation}$ task that incorporates interactive information completion capabilities within GUI agents. We developed the $\textbf{Navi-plus}$ dataset with GUI follow-up question-answer pairs, alongside a $\textbf{Dual-Stream Trajectory Evaluation}$ method to benchmark this new capability. Our results show that agents equipped with the ability to ask GUI follow-up questions can fully recover their performance when faced with ambiguous user tasks.</description>

      <title>Metacognition and Uncertainty Communication in Humans and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metacognition--the capacity to monitor and evaluate one's own knowledge and performance--is foundational to human decision-making, learning, and communication. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in both high-stakes and widespread low-stakes contexts, it is important to assess whether, how, and to what extent they exhibit metacognitive abilities. Here, we provide an overview of current knowledge of LLMs' metacognitive capacities, how they might be studied, and how they relate to our knowledge of metacognition in humans. We show that while humans and LLMs can sometimes appear quite aligned in their metacognitive capacities and behaviors, it is clear many differences remain; attending to these differences is important for enhancing human-AI collaboration. Finally, we discuss how endowing future LLMs with more sensitive and more calibrated metacognition may also help them develop new capacities such as more efficient learning, self-direction, and curiosity.</description>

      <title>Effort-aware Fairness: Incorporating a Philosophy-informed, Human-centered Notion of Effort into Algorithmic Fairness Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although popularized AI fairness metrics, e.g., demographic parity, have uncovered bias in AI-assisted decision-making outcomes, they do not consider how much effort one has spent to get to where one is today in the input feature space. However, the notion of effort is important in how Philosophy and humans understand fairness. We propose a philosophy-informed approach to conceptualize and evaluate Effort-aware Fairness (EaF), grounded in the concept of Force, which represents the temporal trajectory of predictive features coupled with inertia. Besides theoretical formulation, our empirical contributions include: (1) a pre-registered human subjects experiment, which shows that for both stages of the (individual) fairness evaluation process, people consider the temporal trajectory of a predictive feature more than its aggregate value; (2) pipelines to compute Effort-aware Individual/Group Fairness in the criminal justice and personal finance contexts. Our work may enable AI model auditors to uncover and potentially correct unfair decisions against individuals who have spent significant efforts to improve but are still stuck with systemic disadvantages outside their control.</description>

      <title>Documenting Deployment with Fabric: A Repository of Real-World AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into society, from financial services and traffic management to creative writing. Academic literature on the deployment of AI has mostly focused on the risks and harms that result from the use of AI. We introduce Fabric, a publicly available repository of deployed AI use cases to outline their governance mechanisms. Through semi-structured interviews with practitioners, we collect an initial set of 20 AI use cases. In addition, we co-design diagrams of the AI workflow with the practitioners. We discuss the oversight mechanisms and guardrails used in practice to safeguard AI use. The Fabric repository includes visual diagrams of AI use cases and descriptions of the deployed systems. Using the repository, we surface gaps in governance and find common patterns in human oversight of deployed AI systems. We intend for Fabric to serve as an extendable, evolving tool for researchers to study the effectiveness of AI governance.</description>

      <title>HOSt3R: Keypoint-free Hand-Object 3D Reconstruction from RGB images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object 3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen object categories.</description>
