      <title>A Uniform Framework for Problems on Context-Free Grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a paper published in Information Processing Letters in 2000, Bouajjani et al. presented an automata-based approach to a number of elementary problems on context-free grammars. This approach is of pedagogical interest since it provides a uniform solution to decision procedures usually solved by independent algorithms in textbooks. This paper improves upon the work by Bouajjani et al. in a number of ways. We present a new algorithm which not only has a better space complexity but is also (in our opinion) easier to read and understand. Moreover, a closer inspection reveals that the new algorithm is competitive to well-known solutions for most (but not all) standard problems.</description>

      <title>Completeness of FSM Test Suites Reconsidered</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fault domain that has been widely studied in black-box conformance testing is the class of finite state machines (FSMs) with at most $k$ extra states. Numerous methods for generating test suites have been proposed that guarantee fault coverage for this class. These test suites grow exponentially in $k$, so one can only run them for small $k$. But the assumption that $k$ is small is not realistic in practice. As a result, completeness for this fault domain has limited practical significance. As an alternative, we propose (much larger) fault domains that capture the assumption that when bugs in an implementation introduce extra states, these states can be reached via a few (at most $k$) transitions from states reachable via a set $A$ of common scenarios. Preliminary evidence suggests these fault domains, which contain FSMs with an exponential number of extra states (in $k$), are of practical use for testing network protocols. We present a sufficient condition for \emph{$k$-$A$-completeness} of test suites with respect to these fault domains, phrased entirely in terms of properties of their testing tree. Our condition implies $k$-$A$-completeness of two prominent test suite generation algorithms, the Wp and HSI methods. Counterexamples show that three other approaches, the H, SPY and SPYH methods, do not always generate $k$-$A$-complete test suites.</description>

      <title>Bayesian scaling laws for in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful technique for getting language models to perform complex tasks with no training updates. Prior work has established strong correlations between the number of in-context examples provided and the accuracy of the model's predictions. In this paper, we seek to explain this correlation by showing that ICL approximates a Bayesian learner. This perspective gives rise to a family of novel Bayesian scaling laws for ICL. In experiments with \mbox{GPT-2} models of different sizes, our scaling laws exceed or match existing scaling laws in accuracy while also offering interpretable terms for task priors, learning efficiency, and per-example probabilities. To illustrate the analytic power that such interpretable scaling laws provide, we report on controlled synthetic dataset experiments designed to inform real-world studies of safety alignment. In our experimental protocol, we use SFT to suppress an unwanted existing model capability and then use ICL to try to bring that capability back (many-shot jailbreaking). We then experiment on real-world instruction-tuned LLMs using capabilities benchmarks as well as a new many-shot jailbreaking dataset. In all cases, Bayesian scaling laws accurately predict the conditions under which ICL will cause the suppressed behavior to reemerge, which sheds light on the ineffectiveness of post-training at increasing LLM safety.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary-arity Tree Automata and QCTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of automata (which we coin EU-automata) running on infininte trees of arbitrary (finite) arity. We develop and study several algorithms to perform classical operations (union, intersection, complement, projection, alternation removal) for those automata, and precisely characterise their complexities. We also develop algorithms for solving membership and emptiness for the languages of trees accepted by EU-automata.
  We then use EU-automata to obtain several algorithmic and expressiveness results for the temporal logic QCTL (which extends CTL with quantification over atomic propositions) and for MSO. On the one hand, we obtain decision procedures with optimal complexity for QCTL satisfiability and model checking; on the other hand, we obtain an algorithm for translating any QCTL formula with k quantifier alternations to formulas with at most one quantifier alternation, at the expense of a $(k + 1)$-exponential blow-up in the size of the formulas. Using the same techniques, we prove that any MSO formula can be translated into a formula with at most four quantifier alternations (and only two second-order-quantifier alternations), again with a $(k + 1)$-exponential blow-up in the size of the formula.</description>
