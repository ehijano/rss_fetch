      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the saturation of pressure signals during various handwriting tasks, including drawings, cursive text, capital words text, and signature, under different levels of fatigue. Experimental results demonstrate a significant rise in the proportion of saturated samples following strenuous exercise in tasks performed without resting wrist. The analysis of saturation highlights significant differences when comparing the results to the baseline situation and strenuous fatigue.</description>

      <title>Efficient Position Determination of Highly Directional RF Emitters via Iterated Beampattern Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Received signal strength (RSS) information has seldom been incorporated in the direct position determination (DPD) method of passive radio emitter localization to date. Further, the common use of directional emitters modulates the RSS such that omnidirectional assumptions would dramatically decrease accuracy. This paper introduces a new DPD approach utilizing an RSS- enhanced adaptive beamforming method demonstrating on par or better than state-of-the-art performance at very low SNR for omnidirectional emitters. The technique is then applied to directional emitters taking the imposed RSS modulation into account using a beampattern library, significantly improving localization region confidence as compared to omnidirectional assumption approaches. This is the first approach to date in the open literature for localizing directional emitters.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Beyond Diagonal RIS: Multiport Network Models and Performance Benefits in Full-Duplex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) is a new advance in RIS techniques that introduces reconfigurable inter-element connections to generate scattering matrices not limited to being diagonal. BD-RIS has been recently proposed and proven to have benefits in enhancing channel gain and enlarging coverage in wireless communications. Uniquely, BD-RIS enables reciprocal and non-reciprocal architectures characterized by symmetric and non-symmetric scattering matrices. However, the performance benefits and new use cases enabled by non-reciprocal BD-RIS for wireless systems remain unexplored. This work takes a first step toward closing this knowledge gap and studies the non-reciprocal BD-RIS in full-duplex systems and its performance benefits over reciprocal counterparts. We start by deriving a general RIS aided full-duplex system model using a multiport circuit theory, followed by a simplified channel model based on physically consistent assumptions. With the considered channel model, we investigate the effect of BD-RIS non-reciprocity and identify the theoretical conditions for reciprocal and non-reciprocal BD-RISs to simultaneously achieve the maximum received power of the signal of interest in the uplink and the downlink. Simulation results validate the theories and highlight the significant benefits offered by non-reciprocal BD-RIS in full-duplex systems. The significant gains are achieved because of the non-reciprocity principle which implies that if a wave hits the non-reciprocal BD-RIS from one direction, the surface behaves differently than if it hits from the opposite direction. This enables an uplink user and a downlink user at different locations to optimally communicate with the same full-duplex base station via a non-reciprocal BD-RIS, which would not be possible with reciprocal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Holographic-Pattern Based Multi-User Beam Training in RHS-Aided Hybrid Near-Field and Far-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) have been suggested as an energy-efficient solution for extremely large-scale arrays. By controlling the amplitude of RHS elements, high-gain directional holographic patterns can be achieved. However, the complexity of acquiring real-time channel state information (CSI) for beamforming is exceedingly high, particularly in large-scale RHS-assisted communications, where users may distribute in the near-field region of RHS. This paper proposes a one-shot multi-user beam training scheme in large-scale RHS-assisted systems applicable to both near and far fields. The proposed beam training scheme comprises two phases: angle search and distance search, both conducted simultaneously for all users. For the angle search, an RHS angular codebook is designed based on holographic principles so that each codeword covers multiple angles in both near-field and far-field regions, enabling simultaneous angular search for all users. For the distance search, we construct the distance-adaptive codewords covering all candidate angles of users in a real-time way by leveraging the additivity of holographic patterns, which is different from the traditional phase array case. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves higher system throughput compared to traditional beam training schemes. The beam training accuracy approaches the upper bound of exhaustive search at a significantly reduced overhead.</description>

      <title>Radio-Based Passive Target Tracking by a Mobile Receiver with Unknown Transmitter Position</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a radio-based passive target tracking algorithm using multipath measurements, including the angle of arrival and relative distance. We focus on a scenario in which a mobile receiver continuously receives radio signals from a transmitter located at an unknown position. The receiver utilizes multipath measurements extracted from the received signal to jointly localize the transmitter and the scatterers over time, with scatterers comprising a moving target and stationary objects that can reflect signals within the environment. We develop a comprehensive probabilistic model for the target tracking problem, incorporating the localization of the transmitter and scatterers, the identification of false alarms and missed detections in the measurements, and the association between scatterers and measurements. We employ a belief propagation approach to compute the posterior distributions of the positions of the scatterers and the transmitter. Additionally, we introduce a particle implementation for the belief propagation method. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing benchmark methods in terms of target tracking accuracy.</description>

      <title>Joint Discrete Antenna Positioning and Beamforming Optimization in Movable Antenna Enabled Full-Duplex ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a full-duplex integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system enabled by a movable antenna (MA). By leveraging the characteristic of MA that can increase the spatial diversity gain, the performance of the system can be enhanced. We formulate a problem of minimizing the total transmit power consumption via jointly optimizing the discrete position of MA elements, beamforming vectors, sensing signal covariance matrix and user transmit power. Given the significant coupling of optimization variables, the formulated problem presents a non-convex optimization challenge that poses difficulties for direct resolution. To address this challenging issue, the discrete binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm framework is employed to solve the formulated problem. Specifically, the discrete positions of MA elements are first obtained by iteratively solving the fitness function. The difference-of-convex (DC) programming and successive convex approximation (SCA) are used to handle non-convex and rank-1 terms in the fitness function. Once the BPSO iteration is complete, the discrete positions of MA elements can be determined, and we can obtain the solutions for beamforming vectors, sensing signal covariance matrix and user transmit power. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in reducing the total transmit power consumption compared with fixed antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control Enabled UAV Trajectory Optimization and Secure Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a secure communication architecture based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which enhances the security performance of the communication system through UAV trajectory optimization. We formulate a control problem of minimizing the UAV flight path and power consumption while maximizing secure communication rate over infinite horizon by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, transmit beamforming vector, and artificial noise (AN) vector. Given the non-uniqueness of optimization objective and significant coupling of the optimization variables, the problem is a non-convex optimization problem which is difficult to solve directly. To address this complex issue, an alternating-iteration technique is employed to decouple the optimization variables. Specifically, the problem is divided into three subproblems, i.e., UAV trajectory, transmit beamforming vector, and AN vector, which are solved alternately. Additionally, considering the susceptibility of UAV trajectory to disturbances, the model predictive control (MPC) approach is applied to obtain UAV trajectory and enhance the system robustness. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed optimization algorithm in maintaining accurate UAV trajectory and high secure communication rate compared with other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communications with Foundation Models: Perception-Error Analysis and Semantic-Aware Power Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative foundation models can revolutionize the design of semantic communication (SemCom) systems allowing high fidelity exchange of semantic information at ultra low rates. In this work, a generative SemCom framework with pretrained foundation models is proposed, where both uncoded forward-with-error and coded discard-with-error schemes are developed for the semantic decoder. To characterize the impact of transmission reliability on the perceptual quality of the regenerated signal, their mathematical relationship is analyzed from a rate-distortion-perception perspective, which is proved to be non-decreasing. The semantic values are defined to measure the semantic information of multimodal semantic features accordingly. We also investigate semantic-aware power allocation problems aiming at power consumption minimization for ultra low rate and high fidelity SemComs. To solve these problems, two semantic-aware power allocation methods are proposed by leveraging the non-decreasing property of the perception-error relationship. Numerically, perception-error functions and semantic values of semantic data streams under both schemes for image tasks are obtained based on the Kodak dataset. Simulation results show that our proposed semanticaware method significantly outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in the channel-coded case (up to 90% power saving).</description>

      <title>URLLC Networks enabled by STAR-RIS, Rate Splitting, and Multiple Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenges in dense ultra-reliable low-latency communication networks to deliver the required service to multiple devices are addressed by three main technologies: multiple antennas at the base station (MISO), rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) with private and common message encoding, and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS). Careful resource allocation, encompassing beamforming and RIS optimization, is required to exploit the synergy between the three. We propose an alternating optimization-based algorithm, relying on minorization-maximization. Numerical results show that the achievable second-order max-min rates of the proposed scheme outperform the baselines significantly. MISO, RSMA, and STAR-RIS all contribute to enabling ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC).</description>

      <title>Compressive Spectrum Sensing with 1-bit ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient wideband spectrum sensing (WSS) is essential for managing spectrum scarcity in wireless communications. However, existing compressed sensing (CS)-based WSS methods require high sampling rates and power consumption, particularly with high-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Although 1-bit CS with low-precision ADCs can mitigate these demands, most approaches still depend on multi-user cooperation and prior sparsity information, which are often unavailable in WSS scenarios. This paper introduces a non-cooperative WSS method using multicoset sampling with 1-bit ADCs to achieve sub-Nyquist sampling without requiring sparsity knowledge. We analyze the impact of 1-bit quantization on multiband signals, then apply eigenvalue decomposition to isolate the signal subspace from noise, enabling spectrum support estimation without signal reconstruction. This approach provides a power-efficient solution for WSS that eliminates the need for cooperation and prior information.</description>

      <title>Advancing Multi-Connectivity in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Architectures, Challenges, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-connectivity (MC) in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), included in 3GPP standards, is regarded as a promising technology for future networks. The significant advantages of MC in improving coverage, communication, and sensing through satellite-terrestrial collaboration have sparked widespread interest. In this article, we first introduce three fundamental deployment architectures of MC systems in STINs, including multi-satellite, single-satellite single-base-station, and multi-satellite multi-base-station configurations. Considering the emerging but still evolving satellite networking, we explore system design challenges such as satellite networking schemes, e.g., cell-free and multi-tier satellite networks. Then, key technical challenges that severely influence the quality of mutual communications, including beamforming, channel estimation, and synchronization, are discussed subsequently. Furthermore, typical applications such as coverage enhancement, traffic offloading, collaborative sensing, and low-altitude communication are demonstrated, followed by a case study comparing coverage performance in MC and single-connectivity (SC) configurations. Several essential future research directions for MC in STINs are presented to facilitate further exploration.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air DPD and Reciprocity Calibration in Massive MIMO and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study an over-the-air (OTA) approach for digital pre-distortion (DPD) and reciprocity calibration in massive multiple-input-multiple-output systems. In particular, we consider a memory-less non-linearity model for the base station (BS) transmitters and propose a methodology to linearize the transmitters and perform the calibration by using mutual coupling OTA measurements between BS antennas. We show that by only using the OTA-based data, we can linearize the transmitters and design the calibration to compensate for both the non-linearity and non-reciprocity of BS transceivers effectively. This allows to alleviate the requirement to have dedicated hardware modules for transceiver characterization. Moreover, exploiting the results of the DPD linearization step, our calibration method may be formulated in terms of closed-form transformations, achieving a significant complexity reduction over state-of-the-art methods, which usually rely on costly iterative computations. Simulation results showcase the potential of our approach in terms of the calibration matrix estimation error and downlink data-rates when applying zero-forcing precoding after using our OTA-based DPD and calibration method.</description>

      <title>Large Intelligent Surfaces with Low-End Receivers: From Scaling to Antenna and Panel Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of large intelligent surface (LIS) with hardware distortion at its RX-chains. In particular, we consider the memory-less polynomial model for non-ideal hardware and derive analytical expressions for the signal to noise plus distortion ratio after applying maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the LIS. We also study the effect of back-off and automatic gain control on the RX-chains. The derived expressions enable us to evaluate the scalability of LIS when hardware impairments are present. We also study the cost of assuming ideal hardware by analyzing the minimum scaling required to achieve the same performance with a non-ideal hardware. Then, we exploit the analytical expressions to propose optimized antenna selection schemes for LIS and we show that such schemes can improve the performance significantly. In particular, the antenna selection schemes allow the LIS to have lower number of non-ideal RX-chains for signal reception while maintaining a good performance. We also consider a more practical case where the LIS is deployed as a grid of multi-antenna panels, and we propose panel selection schemes to optimize the complexity-performance trade-offs and improve the system overall efficiency.</description>

      <title>Efficient Channel Estimation With Shorter Pilots in RIS-Aided Communications: Using Array Geometries and Interference Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of the cascaded channel from a user equipment (UE) to a base station (BS) via each reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) element is critical to realizing the full potential of the RIS's ability to control the overall channel. The number of parameters to be estimated is equal to the number of RIS elements, requiring an equal number of pilots unless an underlying structure can be identified. In this paper, we show how the spatial correlation inherent in the different RIS channels provides this desired structure. We first optimize the RIS phase-shift pattern using a much-reduced pilot length (determined by the rank of the spatial correlation matrices) to minimize the mean square error (MSE) in the channel estimation under electromagnetic interference. In addition to considering the linear minimum MSE (LMMSE) channel estimator, we propose a novel channel estimator that requires only knowledge of the array geometry while not requiring any user-specific statistical information. We call this the reduced-subspace least squares (RS-LS) estimator and optimize the RIS phase-shift pattern for it. This novel estimator significantly outperforms the conventional LS estimator. For both the LMMSE and RS-LS estimators, the proposed optimized RIS configurations result in significant channel estimation improvements over the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Allocation of Pauli Measurements for Low-rank Quantum State Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of reconstructing quantum states from experimental measurements, accomplished through quantum state tomography (QST), plays a crucial role in verifying and benchmarking quantum devices. A key challenge of QST is to find out how the accuracy of the reconstruction depends on the number of state copies used in the measurements. When multiple measurement settings are used, the total number of state copies is determined by multiplying the number of measurement settings with the number of repeated measurements for each setting. Due to statistical noise intrinsic to quantum measurements, a large number of repeated measurements is often used in practice. However, recent studies have shown that even with single-sample measurements--where only one measurement sample is obtained for each measurement setting--high accuracy QST can still be achieved with a sufficiently large number of different measurement settings. In this paper, we establish a theoretical understanding of the trade-off between the number of measurement settings and the number of repeated measurements per setting in QST. Our focus is primarily on low-rank density matrix recovery using Pauli measurements. We delve into the global landscape underlying the low-rank QST problem and demonstrate that the joint consideration of measurement settings and repeated measurements ensures a bounded recovery error for all second-order critical points, to which optimization algorithms tend to converge. This finding suggests the advantage of minimizing the number of repeated measurements per setting when the total number of state copies is held fixed. Additionally, we prove that the Wirtinger gradient descent algorithm can converge to the region of second-order critical points with a linear convergence rate. We have also performed numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-Attention-based EEG State Transition Modeling for Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion decoding can objectively quantify people's emotional state and has broad application prospects in human-computer interaction and early detection of emotional disorders. Recently emerging deep learning architectures have significantly improved the performance of EEG emotion decoding. However, existing methods still fall short of fully capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of neural signals, which are crucial for representing emotion processing. This study proposes a Dynamic-Attention-based EEG State Transition (DAEST) modeling method to characterize EEG spatiotemporal dynamics. The model extracts spatiotemporal components of EEG that represent multiple parallel neural processes and estimates dynamic attention weights on these components to capture transitions in brain states. The model is optimized within a contrastive learning framework for cross-subject emotion recognition. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets: FACED, SEED, and SEED-V. It achieved 75.4% accuracy in the binary classification of positive and negative emotions and 59.3% in nine-class discrete emotion classification on the FACED dataset, 88.1% in the three-class classification of positive, negative, and neutral emotions on the SEED dataset, and 73.6% in five-class discrete emotion classification on the SEED-V dataset. The learned EEG spatiotemporal patterns and dynamic transition properties offer valuable insights into neural dynamics underlying emotion processing.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order GNNs Meet Efficiency: Sparse Sobolev Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling relationships between nodes in a graph, but capturing higher-order relationships remains a challenge for large-scale networks. Previous studies have primarily attempted to utilize the information from higher-order neighbors in the graph, involving the incorporation of powers of the shift operator, such as the graph Laplacian or adjacency matrix. This approach comes with a trade-off in terms of increased computational and memory demands. Relying on graph spectral theory, we make a fundamental observation: the regular and the Hadamard power of the Laplacian matrix behave similarly in the spectrum. This observation has significant implications for capturing higher-order information in GNNs for various tasks such as node classification and semi-supervised learning. Consequently, we propose a novel graph convolutional operator based on the sparse Sobolev norm of graph signals. Our approach, known as Sparse Sobolev GNN (S2-GNN), employs Hadamard products between matrices to maintain the sparsity level in graph representations. S2-GNN utilizes a cascade of filters with increasing Hadamard powers to generate a diverse set of functions. We theoretically analyze the stability of S2-GNN to show the robustness of the model against possible graph perturbations. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation of S2-GNN across various graph mining, semi-supervised node classification, and computer vision tasks. In particular use cases, our algorithm demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GNNs in terms of performance and running time.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Space Shift Keying with Non-Ideal Transceivers and Greedy Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and index modulation (IM) represent key technologies for enabling reliable wireless communication with high energy efficiency. However, to fully take advantage of these technologies in practical deployments, comprehending the impact of the non-ideal nature of the underlying transceivers is paramount. In this context, this paper introduces two RIS-assisted IM communication models, in which the RIS is part of the transmitter and space-shift keying (SSK) is employed for IM, and assesses their performance in the presence of hardware impairments. In the first model, the RIS acts as a passive reflector only, reflecting the oncoming SSK modulated signal intelligently towards the desired receive diversity branch/antenna. The second model employs RIS as a transmitter, employing M-ary phase-shift keying for reflection phase modulation (RPM), and as a reflector for the incoming SSK modulated signal. Considering transmissions subjected to Nakagami-m fading, and a greedy detection rule at the receiver, the performance of both the system configurations is evaluated. Specifically, the pairwise probability of erroneous index detection and the probability of erroneous index detection are adopted as performance metrics, and their closed-form expressions are derived for the RIS-assisted SSK and RIS-assisted SSK-RPM system models. Monte-Carlo simulation studies are carried out to verify the analytical framework, and numerical results are presented to study the dependency of the error performance on the system parameters. The findings highlight the effect of hardware impairment on the performance of the communication system under study.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Resource Management for C-V2X Platooning via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a semantic-aware multi-modal resource allocation (SAMRA) for multi-task using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), termed SAMRAMARL, utilizing in platoon systems where cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication is employed. The proposed approach leverages the semantic information to optimize the allocation of communication resources. By integrating a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm, SAMRAMARL enables autonomous decision-making for each vehicle, channel assignment optimization, power allocation, and semantic symbol length based on the contextual importance of the transmitted information. This semantic-awareness ensures that both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications prioritize data that is critical for maintaining safe and efficient platoon operations. The framework also introduces a tailored quality of experience (QoE) metric for semantic communication, aiming to maximize QoE in V2V links while improving the success rate of semantic information transmission (SRS). Extensive simulations has demonstrated that SAMRAMARL outperforms existing methods, achieving significant gains in QoE and communication efficiency in C-V2X platooning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup for Polar Maximum Likelihood Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional decoding algorithms for polar codes strive to balance achievable performance and computational complexity in classical computing. While maximum likelihood (ML) decoding guarantees optimal performance, its NP-hard nature makes it impractical for real-world systems. In this letter, we propose a novel ML decoding architecture for polar codes based on the Grover adaptive search, a quantum exhaustive search algorithm. Unlike conventional studies, our approach, enabled by a newly formulated objective function, uniquely supports Gray-coded multi-level modulation without expanding the search space size compared to the classical ML decoding. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed quantum decoding achieves ML performance while providing a pure quadratic speedup in query complexity.</description>

      <title>JC5A: Service Delay Minimization for Aerial MEC-assisted Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of the sixth generation (6G) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) drives the proliferation of sensor devices and computing-intensive tasks. To address the limited resources of IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and cost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs). However, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges, including the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources, stringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board energy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative aerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing capabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a service delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading, caching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a block successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for computation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method for communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Global Optimal Closed-Form Solutions for Intelligent Surfaces With Mutual Coupling: Is Mutual Coupling Detrimental or Beneficial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a breakthrough technology enabling the dynamic control of the propagation environment in wireless communications through programmable surfaces. To improve the flexibility of conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS), beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has emerged as a family of more general RIS architectures. However, D-RIS and BD-RIS have been commonly explored neglecting mutual coupling effects, while the global optimization of RIS with mutual coupling, its performance limits, and scaling laws remain unexplored. This study addresses these gaps by deriving global optimal closed-form solutions for BD-RIS with mutual coupling to maximize the channel gain, specifically fully- and tree-connected RISs. Besides, we provide the expression of the maximum channel gain achievable in the presence of mutual coupling and its scaling law in closed form. By using the derived scaling laws, we analytically prove that mutual coupling increases the channel gain on average under Rayleigh fading channels. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, shows that both fully- and tree-connected RISs with mutual coupling achieve the same channel gain upper bound when optimized with the proposed global optimal solutions. Furthermore, we observe that a mutual coupling-unaware optimization of RIS can cause a channel gain degradation of up to 5 dB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02046v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthesis of antenna arrays in presence of mutual coupling using generalized scattering matrices in terms of characteristic modes is proposed. For the synthesis, the array is built of synthetic elements that are described by their modal scattering and radiation behavior. In particular, the question of how to describe the degrees of freedom of such elements is addressed. The eigenvalues of the characteristic modes of the element geometry and the modal radiation behavior of the antenna are thereby selected as degrees of freedom for the model of the synthetic elements. Using this model and a modal coupling matrix, an approach to optimize the modal configuration of the elements within an array is proposed. Finally, a close to reality example shows how the proposed theory can be used to enhance the cross-polarization rejection of a circularly polarized patch antenna array with a fixed beam.</description>

      <title>Efficient Recovery of Sparse Graph Signals from Graph Filter Outputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the recovery of a node-domain sparse graph signal from the output of a graph filter. This problem, which is often referred to as the identification of the source of a diffused sparse graph signal, is seminal in the field of graph signal processing (GSP). Sparse graph signals can be used in the modeling of a variety of real-world applications in networks, such as social, biological, and power systems, and enable various GSP tasks, such as graph signal reconstruction, blind deconvolution, and sampling. In this paper, we assume double sparsity of both the graph signal and the graph topology, as well as a low-order graph filter. We propose three algorithms to reconstruct the support set of the input sparse graph signal from the graph filter output samples, leveraging these assumptions and the generalized information criterion (GIC). First, we describe the graph multiple GIC (GM-GIC) method, which is based on partitioning the dictionary elements (graph filter matrix columns) that capture information on the signal into smaller subsets. Then, the local GICs are computed for each subset and aggregated to make a global decision. Second, inspired by the well-known branch and bound (BNB) approach, we develop the graph-based branch and bound GIC (graph-BNB-GIC), and incorporate a new tractable heuristic bound tailored to the graph and graph filter characteristics. In addition, we propose the graph-based first order correction (GFOC) method, which improves existing sparse recovery methods by iteratively examining potential improvements to the GIC cost function by replacing elements from the estimated support set with elements from their one-hop neighborhood. In addition, we investigate the application of our graph-based sparse recovery methods in blind deconvolution scenarios where the graph filter is unknown.</description>

Abstract: The proliferation of drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has raised significant safety concerns due to their potential misuse in activities such as espionage, smuggling, and infrastructure disruption. This paper addresses the critical need for effective drone detection and classification systems that operate independently of UAV cooperation. We evaluate various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for their ability to detect and classify drones using spectrogram data derived from consecutive Fourier transforms of signal components. The focus is on model robustness in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, which is critical for real-world applications. A comprehensive dataset is provided to support future model development. In addition, we demonstrate a low-cost drone detection system using a standard computer, software-defined radio (SDR) and antenna, validated through real-world field testing. On our development dataset, all models consistently achieved an average balanced classification accuracy of &gt;= 85% at SNR &gt; -12dB. In the field test, these models achieved an average balance accuracy of &gt; 80%, depending on transmitter distance and antenna direction. Our contributions include: a publicly available dataset for model development, a comparative analysis of CNN for drone detection under low SNR conditions, and the deployment and field evaluation of a practical, low-cost detection system.</description>

Abstract: This letter investigates movable antenna (MA)-aided downlink (DL) multiuser communication systems under the near-field channel condition, where both the base station (BS) and the users are equipped with MAs to fully exploit the degrees of freedom (DoFs) in antenna position optimization. We develop a general channel model to accurately describe the channel characteristics in the near-field region and formulate an MA-position optimization problem to minimize the BS's transmit power subject to users' individual rate constraints. To solve this problem, we propose a two-loop dynamic neighborhood pruning particle swarm optimization (DNPPSO) algorithm that significantly reduces the computational complexity as compared to the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm while achieving similar performance. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed scheme in power-saving for near-field multiuser communications.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the investigation of the bistatic MIMO radar for estimating various multitarget parameters of interest in the presence of clutter and noise. The parameters of interest include Direction of Departure (DOD), Direction of Arrival (DOA), range and velocity and a novel algorithm is proposed for estimating these target parameters based on the concepts of the "array manifold" and "manifold extenders". The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Coded Many-User Multiple Access via Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05625v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider communication over the Gaussian multiple-access channel in the regime where the number of users grows linearly with the codelength. In this regime, schemes based on sparse superposition coding can achieve a near-optimal tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio. However, these schemes are feasible only for small values of user payload. This paper investigates efficient schemes for larger user payloads, focusing on coded CDMA schemes where each user's information is encoded via a linear code before being modulated with a signature sequence. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) decoder that can be tailored to the structure of the linear code, and provide an exact asymptotic characterization of its performance. Based on this result, we consider a decoder that integrates AMP and belief propagation and characterize its tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio, for a given target error rate. Simulation results show that the decoder achieves state-of-the-art performance at finite lengths, with a coded CDMA scheme defined using LDPC codes and a spatially coupled matrix of signature sequences.</description>

      <title>Spatially Non-Stationary XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: A Three-Layer Generalized Approximate Message Passing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02633v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems is investigated with the considerations of the spherical wavefront effect and the spatially non-stationary (SnS) property. Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</description>

      <title>C3T: Cross-modal Transfer Through Time for Human Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to unlock the potential of diverse sensors, we investigate a method to transfer knowledge between modalities using the structure of a unified multimodal representation space for Human Action Recognition (HAR). We formalize and explore an understudied cross-modal transfer setting we term Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA), where the modality used in testing is not used in supervised training, i.e. zero labeled instances of the test modality are available during training. We develop three methods to perform UMA: Student-Teacher (ST), Contrastive Alignment (CA), and Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T). Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets compare these methods to each other in the UMA setting, and to their empirical upper bound in the supervised setting. The results indicate C3T is the most robust and highest performing by at least a margin of 8%, and nears the supervised setting performance even in the presence of temporal noise. This method introduces a novel mechanism for aligning signals across time-varying latent vectors, extracted from the receptive field of temporal convolutions. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for multi-modal learning in various applications.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Based Active User Enumeration for Grant-Free Access Under Carrier Frequency Offsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) system in the presence of carrier frequency offsets. We propose two schemes for enumerating active users in such a GF-NOMA system, which is equivalent to estimating the sparsity level. Both schemes utilize a short common pilot and the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix of the received signal. The two schemes differ in their treatment of noise variance: one exploits known variance information, while the other is designed to function without this knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in terms of the normalized root-mean-squared error.</description>

      <title>GEM: A GEneral Memristive Transistor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic devices, with their distinct advantages in energy efficiency and parallel processing, are pivotal in advancing artificial intelligence applications. Among these devices, memristive transistors have attracted significant attention due to their superior stability and operation flexibility compared to two-terminal memristors. However, the lack of a robust model that accurately captures their complex electrical behavior has hindered further exploration of their potential. In this work, we introduce the GEneral Memristive transistor (GEM) model to address this challenge. The GEM model incorporates time-dependent differential equation, a voltage-controlled moving window function, and a nonlinear current output function, enabling precise representation of both switching and output characteristics in memristive transistors. Compared to previous models, the GEM model demonstrates a 300% improvement in modeling the switching behavior, while effectively capturing the inherent nonlinearities and physical limits of these devices. This advancement significantly enhances the realistic simulation of memristive transistors, thereby facilitating further exploration and application development.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Dynamic Neural Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent applications beyond the network edge, coupled with the need for sustainable operation, are driving the seamless integration of deep learning (DL) algorithms into energy-limited, and even energy-harvesting end-devices. However, the stochastic nature of ambient energy sources often results in insufficient harvesting rates, failing to meet the energy requirements for inference and causing significant performance degradation in energy-agnostic systems. To address this problem, we consider an on-device adaptive inference system equipped with an energy-harvester and finite-capacity energy storage. We then allow the device to reduce the run-time execution cost on-demand, by either switching between differently-sized neural networks, referred to as multi-model selection (MMS), or by enabling earlier predictions at intermediate layers, called early exiting (EE). The model to be employed, or the exit point is then dynamically chosen based on the energy storage and harvesting process states. We also study the efficacy of integrating the prediction confidence into the decision-making process. We derive a principled policy with theoretical guarantees for confidence-aware and -agnostic controllers. Moreover, in multi-exit networks, we study the advantages of taking decisions incrementally, exit-by-exit, by designing a lightweight reinforcement learning-based controller. Experimental results show that, as the rate of the ambient energy increases, energy- and confidence-aware control schemes show approximately 5% improvement in accuracy compared to their energy-aware confidence-agnostic counterparts. Incremental approaches achieve even higher accuracy, particularly when the energy storage capacity is limited relative to the energy consumption of the inference model.</description>
