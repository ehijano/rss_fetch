      <title>Random search with resetting in heterogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate random searches under stochastic position resetting at rate $r$, in a bounded 1D environment with space-dependent diffusivity $D(x)$. For arbitrary shapes of $D(x)$ and prescriptions of the associated multiplicative stochastic process, we obtain analytical expressions for the average time $T$ for reaching the target (mean first-passage time), given the initial and reset positions, in good agreement with stochastic simulations. For arbitrary $D(x)$, we obtain an exact closed-form expression for $T$, within Stratonovich scenario, while for other prescriptions, like It\^o and anti-It\^o, we derive asymptotic approximations for small and large rates $r$. Exact results are also obtained for particular forms of $D(x)$, such as the linear one, with arbitrary prescriptions, allowing to outline and discuss the main effects introduced by diffusive heterogeneity on a random search with resetting. We explore how the effectiveness of resetting varies with different types of heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Scaling and universality for percolation in random networks: a unified view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Percolation processes on random networks have been the subject of intense research activity over the last decades: the overall phenomenology of standard percolation on uncorrelated and unclustered topologies is well known. Still some critical properties of the transition, in particular for heterogeneous substrates, have not been fully elucidated and contradictory results appear in the literature. In this paper we present, by means of a generating functions approach, a thorough and complete investigation of percolation critical properties in random networks. We determine all critical exponents, the associated critical amplitude ratios and the form of the cluster size distribution for networks of any level of heterogeneity. We uncover, in particular for highly heterogeneous networks, subtle crossover phenomena, nontrivial scaling forms and violations of hyperscaling. In this way we clarify the origin of inconsistencies in the previous literature.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Progression of Cancerous Tumors in Mice: A Machine and Deep Learning Intuition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19277v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study explores Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered modeling to predict the evolution of cancer tumor cells in mice under different forms of treatment. The AI models are analyzed against varying ambient and systemic parameters, e.g. drug dosage, volume of the cancer cell mass, and time taken to destroy the cancer cell mass. The data required for the analysis have been synthetically extracted from plots available in both published and unpublished literature (primarily using a Matlab architecture called "Grabit"), that are then statistically standardized around the same baseline for comparison. Three forms of treatment are considered - saline (multiple concentrations used), magnetic nanoparticles (mNPs) and fluorodeoxyglycose iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (mNP-FDGs) - analyzed using three Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multilinear Regression (MLR), and a Deep Learning (DL) module, the Adaptive Neural Network (ANN). The AI models are trained on 60-80% data, the rest used for validation. Assessed over all three forms of treatment, ANN consistently outperforms other predictive models. Our models predict mNP-FDG as the most potent treatment regime that kills the cancerous tumor completely in ca 13 days from the start of treatment. The models can be generalized to other forms of cancer treatment regimens.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Foreign Players in the English Premier League: A Mathematical Analys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake extensive analysis of English Premier League data over the period 2009/10 to 2017/18 to identify and rank key factors affecting the economic and footballing performances of the teams. Alternative end-of-season league tables are generated by re-ranking the teams based on five different descriptors - total expenditure, total funds spent on players, total funds spent on foreign players, the ratio of foreign to British players and the overall profit. The unequal distribution of resources and expenditure between the clubs is analyzed through Lorenz curves. A comparative analysis of the differences between the alternative tables and the conventional end-of-season league table establishes the most likely factors to influence the performances of the teams that we also rank using Principal Component Analysis. We find that the top teams in the league are also those that tend to have the highest expenditure overall, for all players, including foreign players; they also have the highest ratios of foreign to British players. Our statistical and machine learning study also indicates that successful performance on the field may not guarantee healthy profits at the end of the season.</description>

      <title>Impact of directionality on the emergence of Turing patterns on m-directed higher-order structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We hereby develop the theory of Turing instability for reaction-diffusion systems defined on m-directed hypergraphs, the latter being generalization of hypergraphs where nodes forming hyperedges can be shared into two disjoint sets, the head nodes and the tail nodes. This framework encodes thus for a privileged direction for the reaction to occur: the joint action of tail nodes is a driver for the reaction involving head nodes. It thus results a natural generalization of directed networks. Based on a linear stability analysis we have shown the existence of two Laplace matrices, allowing to analytically prove that Turing patterns, stationary or wave-like, emerges for a much broader set of parameters in the m-directed setting. In particular directionality promotes Turing instability, otherwise absent in the symmetric case. Analytical results are compared to simulations performed by using the Brusselator model defined on a m-directed d-hyperring as well as on a m-directed random hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Ergotropy, bound energy and entanglement in 1D long range Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a linear relationship between product of bound energy, a thermodynamic quantity, of a ground state with system size and square of half-chain entanglement entropy has been established for free fermionic chain with nearest neighbor hopping and conjectured to be true for all 1D conformal field theories [Phys. Rev. B, 107,075116(20230]. We probe this relationship in domain where conformal symmetry is broken using 1D Kitaev model with pairing term which decays with distance as a power-law with exponent $\alpha$. We analytically show that for $\alpha=1$, this relationship persists with same slope as found in $\alpha \to \infty$ case where conformal symmetry is unbroken. We recall that conformal symmetry is broken for $\alpha&lt;3/2$ [Phys. Rev. Lett., 113,156402(2014)]. We numerically show that linearity persists for intermediate values of $\alpha$. The presence of long range pairing helps in extracting more energy for the work i.e. ergotropy. We show analytically that ergotropy increases logarithmically with system size for $\alpha=1$ and becomes proportional to system size for $\alpha=0$ (numerically).</description>

      <title>Uncontrolled learning: co-design of neuromorphic hardware topology for neuromorphic algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hardware-based neuromorphic computing remains an elusive goal with the potential to profoundly impact future technologies and deepen our understanding of emergent intelligence. The learning-from-mistakes algorithm is one of the few training algorithms inspired by the brain's simple learning rules, utilizing inhibition and pruning to demonstrate self-organized learning. Here we implement this algorithm in purely neuromorphic memristive hardware through a co-design process. This implementation requires evaluating hardware trade-offs and constraints. It has been shown that learning-from-mistakes successfully trains small networks to function as binary classifiers and perceptrons. However, without tailoring the hardware to the algorithm, performance decreases exponentially as the network size increases. When implementing neuromorphic algorithms on neuromorphic hardware, we investigate the trade-offs between depth, controllability, and capacity, the latter being the number of learnable patterns. We emphasize the significance of topology and the use of governing equations, demonstrating theoretical tools to aid in the co-design of neuromorphic hardware and algorithms. We provide quantitative techniques to evaluate the computational capacity of a neuromorphic device based on the measurements performed and the underlying circuit structure. This approach shows that breaking the symmetry of a neural network can increase both the controllability and average network capacity. By pruning the circuit, neuromorphic algorithms in all-memristive device circuits leverage stochastic resources to drive local contrast in network weights. Our combined experimental and simulation efforts explore the parameters that make a network suited for displaying emergent intelligence from simple rules.</description>

      <title>Lattice model for percolation on a plane of partially aligned sticks with length dispersity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A lattice-based model for continuum percolation is applied to the case of randomly located, partially aligned sticks with unequal lengths in 2D which are allowed to cross each other. Results are obtained for the critical number of sticks per unit area at the percolation threshold in terms of the distributions over length and orientational angle and are compared with findings from computer simulations. Consistent with findings from computer simulations, our model shows that the percolation threshold is (i) elevated by increasing degrees of alignment for a fixed length distribution, and (ii) lowered by increasing degrees of length dispersity for a fixed orientational distribution. The impact of length dispersity is predicted to be governed entirely by the first and second moments of the stick length distribution, and the threshold is shown to be quite sensitive to particulars of the orientational distribution function.</description>

      <title>Importance Sampling for counting statistics in one-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of numerical investigation of the counting statistics for a class of one-dimensional systems. Importance sampling, the cornerstone technique usually implemented for such problems, critically hinges on selecting an appropriate biased distribution. While exponential tilt in the observable stands as the conventional choice for various problems, its efficiency in the context of counting statistics may be significantly hindered by the genuine discreteness of the observable. To address this challenge, we propose an alternative strategy which we call importance sampling with the local tilt. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach through the analysis of three prototypical examples: a set of independent Gaussian random variables, Dyson gas, and Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (SSEP) with a steplike initial condition.</description>

Abstract: We derive the formula for the stationary states of particle-number conserving exclusion processes infinitesimally perturbed by inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. The formula not only proves but also generalises the conjecture proposed in arXiv:1711.06949 to account for inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. As an application of the formula, we draw part of the phase diagrams of the open asymmetric simple exclusion process with and without Langmuir kinetics, correctly reproducing known results.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Combinatorial Polymerization through Kinetic-Trap Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Like the letters in the alphabet forming words, reusing components of a heterogeneous mixture is an efficient strategy for assembling a large number of target structures. Examples range from synthetic DNA origami to proteins self-assembling into complexes. The standard self-assembly paradigm views target structures as free-energy minima of a mixture. While this is an appealing picture, at high speed structures may be kinetically trapped in local minima, reducing self-assembly accuracy. How then can high speed, high accuracy, and combinatorial usage of components coexist? We propose to reconcile these three concepts not by avoiding kinetic traps, but by exploiting them to encode target structures. This can be achieved by sculpting the kinetic pathways of the mixture, instead of its free-energy landscape. We formalize these ideas in a minimal toy model, for which we analytically estimate the encoding capacity and kinetic characteristics, in agreement with simulations. Our results may be generalized to other soft-matter systems capable of computation, such as liquid mixtures or elastic networks, and pave the way for high-dimensional information processing far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Envisioning Future Deep Learning Theories: Some Basic Concepts and Characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To advance deep learning methodologies in the next decade, a theoretical framework for reasoning about modern neural networks is needed. While efforts are increasing toward demystifying why deep learning is so effective, a comprehensive picture remains lacking, suggesting that a better theory is possible. We argue that a future deep learning theory should inherit three characteristics: a \textit{hierarchically} structured network architecture, parameters \textit{iteratively} optimized using stochastic gradient-based methods, and information from the data that evolves \textit{compressively}. As an instantiation, we integrate these characteristics into a graphical model called \textit{neurashed}. This model effectively explains some common empirical patterns in deep learning. In particular, neurashed enables insights into implicit regularization, information bottleneck, and local elasticity. Finally, we discuss how neurashed can guide the development of deep learning theories.</description>

      <title>Two-level systems and harmonic excitations in a mean-field anharmonic quantum glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural glasses display at low temperature a set of anomalies in thermodynamic observables. A prominent example is the linear-in-temperature scaling of the specific heat, at odds with the Debye cubic scaling found in crystals, due to acoustic phonons. Such an excess of specific heat in amorphous solids is thought of arising from phenomenological soft excitations dubbed tunneling two-level systems (TTLS). Their nature as well as their statistical properties remain elusive from a first-principle viewpoint. In this work we investigate the canonically quantized version of the KHGPS model, a mean-field glass model of coupled anharmonic oscillators, across its phase diagram, with an emphasis on the specific heat. The thermodynamics is solved in a semiclassical expansion. We show that in the replica-symmetric region of the model, up to the marginal glass transition line where replica symmetry gets continuously broken, a disordered version of the Debye approximation holds: the specific heat is dominated by harmonic vibrational excitations inducing a power-law scaling at the transition, ruled by random matrix theory. This mechanism generalizes a previous semiclassical argument in the literature. We then study the marginal glass phase where the semiclassical expansion becomes non-perturbative due to the emergence of instantons that overcome disordered Debye behavior. Inside the glass phase, a variational solution to the instanton approach provides the prevailing excitations as TTLS, which generate a linear specific heat. This phase thus hosts a mix of TTLS and harmonic excitations generated by interactions. We finally suggest to go beyond the variational approximation through an analogy with the spin-boson model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a tensor renormalization group simulation of non-Abelian gauge theory in three dimensions using a formulation based on the `armillary sphere.' In this formulation, matrix indices are completely traced out, eliminating the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum of the initial tensor. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique by computing the average plaquette at zero temperature and the Polyakov loop susceptibility at finite temperatures for 2+1D SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories. The deconfinement transition is identified for both gauge groups, with the SU(2) case being consistent with previous Monte Carlo results.</description>
