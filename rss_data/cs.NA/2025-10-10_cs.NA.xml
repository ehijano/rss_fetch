      <title>Determination of Range Conditions for General Projection Pair Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomographic techniques are vital in modern medicine, allowing doctors to observe patients' interior features. Individual steps in the measurement process are modeled by `single projection operators' $p$. These are line integral operators over a collection of curves that covers the regions of interest. Then, the entire measurement process can be understood as a finite collection of such single projections, and thus be modeled by an $N$-projections operator $P=(p_1,\dots,p_N)$. The most well-known example of an $N$-projections operator is the restriction of the Radon transform to finitely many projection angles. Characterizations of the range of $N$-projections operators are of intrinsic mathematical interest and can also help in practical applications such as geometric calibration, motion detection, or model parameter identification. In this work, we investigate the range of projection pair operators $\mathcal{P}$ in the plane, i.e., operators formed by two projections ($N=2$) applied to functions in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We find that the set of annihilators to $\mathrm{rg}(\mathcal{P})$ that are regular distributions contains at most one dimension and a range condition can be explicitly determined by what we refer to as `kernel conditions'. With this tool, we examine the exponential fanbeam transform for which no range conditions were known, finding that no (regular) range condition exists, and therefore, arbitrary data can be approximated in an $L^2$ sense by projections of smooth functions. We also illustrate the use of this theory on a mixed parallel-fanbeam projection pair operator.</description>

      <title>A control-based spatial source reconstruction in fractional heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the inverse source problem for a nonlocal heat equation involving the fractional Laplacian. The primary goal is to reconstruct the spatial component of the source term from partial observations of the system's state and its time derivative over a subset of the domain. A reconstruction formula for the Fourier coefficients of the unknown source is derived, leveraging the null controllability property of the fractional heat equation when the fractional order lies in the interval $s\in(1/2,1)$. The methodology builds on spectral analysis and Volterra integral equations, providing a robust framework for recovering spatial sources under limited measurement data. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and stability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Semi-implicit strategies for the Serre-Green-Naghdi equations in hyperbolic form. Is hyperbolic relaxation really a good idea?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Serre-Green-Naghdi (SGN) equations provide a valuable framework for modelling fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive shallow-water flows. However, their elliptic formulation can considerably increase the computational cost compared to the Saint-Venant equations. To overcome this difficulty, hyperbolic models (hSGN) have been proposed that replace the elliptic operators with first-order hyperbolic formulations augmented by relaxation terms, which recover the original elliptic formulation in the stiff limit. Yet, as the relaxation parameter \lambda increases, explicit schemes face restrictive stability constraints that may offset these advantages. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a semi-implicit (SI) integration strategy for the hSGN system, where the stiff acoustic terms are treated implicitly within an IMEX Runge-Kutta framework, while the advective components remain explicit. The proposed approach mitigates the CFL stability restriction and maintains dispersive accuracy at a moderate computational cost. Numerical results confirm that the combination of hyperbolization and semi-implicit time integration provides an efficient and accurate alternative to both classical SGN and fully explicit hSGN solvers.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Descent for Incomplete Tensor Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving large tensor linear systems poses significant challenges due to the high volume of data stored, and it only becomes more challenging when some of the data is missing. Recently, Ma et al. showed that this problem can be tackled using a stochastic gradient descent-based method, assuming that the missing data follows a uniform missing pattern. We adapt the technique by modifying the update direction, showing that the method is applicable under other missing data models. We prove convergence results and experimentally verify these results on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Parallel-in-Time Solution of Allen-Cahn Equations by Integrating Operator Learning into the Parareal Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning have shown promising efficiency gains in solving time- dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), matching the accuracy of conventional numerical solvers still remains a challenge. One strategy to improve the accuracy of deep learning-based solutions for time- dependent PDEs is to use the learned solution as the coarse propagator in the Parareal method and a traditional numerical method as the fine solver. However, successful integration of deep learning into the Parareal method requires consistency between the coarse and fine solvers, particularly for PDEs exhibiting rapid changes such as sharp transitions. To ensure such consistency, we propose to use the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the fully discrete time-stepping operator defined by the traditional numerical scheme used as the fine solver. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving the classical and mass-conservative Allen-Cahn (AC) equations. Through iterative updates in the Parareal algorithm, our approach achieves a significant computational speedup compared to traditional fine solvers while converging to high-accuracy solutions. Our results highlight that the pro- posed Parareal algorithm effectively accelerates simulations, particularly when implemented on multiple GPUs, and converges to the desired accuracy in only a few iterations. Another advantage of our method is that the CNNs model is trained on trajectories-based on random initial conditions, such that the trained model can be used to solve the AC equations with various initial conditions without re-training. This work demonstrates the potential of integrating neural network methods into the parallel-in-time frameworks for efficient and accurate simulations of time-dependent PDEs.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and error estimate of laws for a random splitting Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random splitting Langevin Monte Carlo could mitigate the first order bias in Langevin Monte Carlo with little extra work compared other high order schemes. We develop in this work an analysis framework for the sampling error under Wasserstein distance regarding the random splitting Langevin Monte Carlo. First, the sharp local truncation error is obtained by the relative entropy approach together with the explicit formulas for the commutator of related semi-groups. The necessary pointwise estimates of the gradient and Hessian of the logarithmic density are established by the Bernstein type approach in PDE theory. Second, the geometric ergodicity is established by accommodation of the reflection coupling. Combining the ergodicity with the local error estimate, we establish a uniform-in-time sampling error bound, showing that the invariant measure of the method approximates the true Gibbs distribution with $O(\tau^2)$ accuracy where $\tau$ is the time step. Lastly, we perform numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Smoother-type a posteriori error estimates for finite element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops user-friendly a posteriori error estimates of finite element methods, based on smoothers of linear iterative solvers. The proposed method employs simple smoothers, such as Jacobi or Gauss--Seidel iteration, on an auxiliary finer mesh to process the finite element residual for a posteriori error control. The implementation requires only a coarse-to-fine prolongation operator. For symmetric problems, we prove the reliability and efficiency of smoother-type error estimators under a saturation assumption. Numerical experiments for various PDEs demonstrate that the proposed smoother-type error estimators outperform residual-type estimators in accuracy and exhibit robustness with respect to parameters and polynomial degrees.</description>

      <title>Elastic-plastic cell-based smoothed finite element method solving geotechnical problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An elastic-plastic cell-based smoothed finite element method (CSFEM) is proposed for geotechnical analysis of soils and rocks exhibiting nonlinear and path-dependent behaviors. By introducing strain smoothing over subcell domains and employing a consistent stress return-mapping algorithm, the method enhances stress accuracy, alleviates volumetric locking, and reduces sensitivity to mesh distortion while retaining the flexibility of polygonal elements. The formulation is implemented in ABAQUS via a user-defined element and validated through benchmark and practical problems, including a pressurized thick cylinder, biaxial soil test, strip footing bearing capacity, tunnel excavation, and slope stability. Numerical results show excellent agreement with analytical solutions and conventional FEM, with smoother stress fields, improved convergence, and higher accuracy in ultimate load prediction. These findings demonstrate that CSFEM provides a stable and efficient framework for elastic-plastic analysis of complex geotechnical problems.</description>

      <title>Scaling crossover of the generalized Jeffreys-type law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Jeffreys-type law is formulated as a multi-term time-fractional Jeffreys-type equation, whose dynamics exhibit rich scaling crossover phenomena entailing different diffusion mechanisms. In this work, we provide a novel physical explanation for the equation from first principles, beginning with a microscopic description based on the continuous-time random walk framework with a generalized waiting time distribution and further deriving the equation from an overdamped Langevin equation subject to a stochastic time-change (subordination). Employing the Laplace transform method, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the equation, establishing its well-posedness and providing a detailed Sobolev regularity analysis. We also develop a novel numerical scheme, termed the CIM-CLG algorithm, which achieves spectral accuracy in both time and space while substantially relaxing the temporal regularity requirements on the solution. The algorithm reduces the computational complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ in time and $\mathcal{O}(M\log M)$ in space and is fully parallelizable. Detailed implementation guidelines and new technical error estimates are provided. Extensive numerical experiments in 1D and 2D settings validate the efficiency, robustness, and accuracy of the proposed method. By integrating stochastic modeling, mathematical analysis, and numerical computation, this work advances the understanding of the generalized Jeffreys-type law and offers a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient framework for tackling complex nonlocal problems.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-informed Model Reduction for Bayesian Inference of Static Structural Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inverse problems use data to update a prior probability distribution on uncertain parameter values to a posterior distribution. Such problems arise in many structural engineering applications, but computational solution of Bayesian inverse problems is often expensive because standard solution approaches require many evaluations of the forward model mapping the parameter value to predicted observations. In many settings, this forward model is expensive because it requires the solution of a high-dimensional discretization of a partial differential equation. However, Bayesian inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure because the available data are primarily informative (relative to the prior) in a low-dimensional subspace, sometimes called the likelihood-informed subspace (LIS). This paper proposes a new projection-based model reduction method for static linear systems that exploits this low-dimensional structure in the setting where the unknown parameter is the right-hand-side forcing. The proposed method projects the governing partial differential equation onto the likelihood-informed subspace, yielding a computationally efficient reduced model that can be used to accelerate the solution of the inverse problem. Numerical experiments on two structural engineering model problems demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully exploit the intrinsic low-dimensionality of the problem, obtaining relative errors of O(10^{-10}) in the inverse problem solution with a 10x-100x lower-dimensional model.</description>

      <title>LDMD with Temporally Adaptive Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a widely used data-driven algorithm for predicting the future states of dynamical systems. However, its standard formulation often struggles with poor long-term predictive accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a localized DMD (LDMD) framework that improves prediction performance by integrating DMD's strong linear forecasting capabilities with time-domain segmentation techniques. In this framework, the temporal domain is segmented into multiple subintervals, within which snapshot matrices are constructed and localized predictions are performed. We first present the localized DMD method with predefined segmentation, and then explore an adaptive segmentation strategy to further enhance computational efficiency and prediction robustness. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis that provides the upper bound of the local and global truncation error for the proposed framework. The effectiveness of LDMD is demonstrated on four benchmark problems-Burgers', Allen-Cahn, nonlinear Schrodinger, and Maxwell's equations. Numerical results show that LDMD significantly enhances long-term predictive accuracy while preserving high computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Semi-Implicit Central scheme for Hyperbolic Systems of Balance Laws with Relaxed Source Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-linear hyperbolic systems with source terms introduce significant computational challenges due to the presence of a stiff source term. To address this, a finite volume Nessyahu-Tadmor (NT) central numerical scheme is explored and applied to benchmark models such as the Jin-Xin relaxation model, the shallow-water model, the Broadwell model, the Euler equations with heat transfer, and the Euler system with stiff friction to assess their effectiveness. The core part of this numerical scheme lies in developing a new implicit-explicit (IMEX) scheme, where the stiff source term is handled in an semi-implicit manner constructed by combining the midpoint rule in space, the trapezoidal rule in time with a backward semi-implicit Taylor expansion. The advantage of the proposed method lies in its stability region and maintains robustness near stiffness and discontinuities, while asymptotically preserving second-order accuracy.
  Theoretical analysis and numerical validation confirm the stability and accuracy of the method, highlighting its potential for efficiently solving the stiff hyperbolic systems of balance laws.</description>

      <title>Dual-primal Isogeometric Tearing and Interconnecting Solvers for adaptively refined multi-patch configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isogeometric Analysis is a variant of the finite element method, where spline functions are used for the representation of both the geometry and the solution. Splines, particularly those with higher degree, achieve their full approximation power only if the solution is sufficiently regular. Since solutions are usually not regular everywhere, adaptive refinement is essential. Recently, a multi-patch-based adaptive refinement strategy based on recursive patch splitting has been proposed, which naturally generates hierarchical, non-matching multi-patch configurations with T-junctions, but preserves the tensor-product structure within each patch.
  In this work, we investigate the application of the dual-primal Isogeometric Tearing and Interconnecting method (IETI-DP) to such adaptive multi-patch geometries. We provide sufficient conditions for the solvability of the local problems and propose a preconditioner for the overall iterative solver. We establish a condition number bound that coincides with the bound previously shown for the fully matching case. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in adaptive refinement scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on deriving optimal-order full moment error estimates in strong norms for both velocity and pressure approximations in the Euler-Maruyama time discretization of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with multiplicative noise. Additionally, it introduces a novel approach and framework for the numerical analysis of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with multiplicative noise in general. The main ideas of this approach include establishing exponential stability estimates for the SPDE solution, leveraging a discrete stochastic Gronwall inequality, and employing a bootstrap argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a new type of fully discrete surface finite element approximation of a class of linear parabolic stochastic evolution equations with additive noise. Our discretization uses a surface finite element approximation of the noise, and is tailored for equations with noise having covariance operator defined by (negative powers of) elliptic operators, like Whittle--Mat\'ern random fields. We derive strong and pathwise convergence rates of our approximation, and verify these by numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a refinement-based Christoffel sampling (RCS) algorithm for least squares approximation in the span of a given, generally non-orthogonal set of functions $\Phi_n = \{\phi_1, \dots, \phi_n\}$. A standard sampling strategy for this problem is Christoffel sampling, which achieves near-best approximations in probability using only $\mathcal{O}(n \log(n))$ samples. However, it requires i.i.d.\ sampling from a distribution whose density is proportional to the inverse Christoffel function $k_n$, the computation of which requires an orthonormal basis. As a result, existing approaches for non-orthogonal bases $\Phi_n$ typically rely on costly discrete orthogonalization. We propose a new iterative algorithm, inspired by recent advances in approximate leverage score sampling, that avoids this bottleneck. Crucially, while the computational cost of discrete orthogonalization grows proportionally with $\|k_n\|_{L^\infty(X)}$, the cost of our approach increases only logarithmically in $\|k_n\|_{L^\infty(X)}$. In addition, we account for finite-precision effects by considering a numerical variant of the Christoffel function, ensuring that the algorithm relies only on computable quantities. Alongside a convergence proof, we present extensive numerical experiments demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Where Have All the Kaczmarz Iterates Gone?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The randomized Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm is one of the most computationally and memory-efficient iterative algorithms for solving large-scale linear systems. However, practical applications often involve noisy and potentially inconsistent systems. While the convergence of RK is well understood for consistent systems, the study of RK on noisy, inconsistent linear systems is limited. This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of RK iterates in expectation when solving noisy and inconsistent systems, addressing the locations of their limit points. We explore the roles of singular vectors of the (noisy) coefficient matrix and derive bounds on the convergence horizon, which depend on the noise levels and system characteristics. Finally, we provide extensive numerical experiments that validate our theoretical findings, offering practical insights into the algorithm's performance under realistic conditions. These results establish a deeper understanding of the RK algorithm's limitations and robustness in noisy environments, paving the way for optimized applications in real-world scientific and engineering problems.</description>

      <title>Time-causal and time-recursive wavelets</title>

Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal.
  This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel.
  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals.
  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</description>

      <title>Targeted Digital Twin via Flow Map Learning and Its Application to Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin (tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing full flow simulations.</description>

      <title>A Geomechanically-Informed Framework for Wellbore Trajectory Prediction: Integrating First-Principles Kinematics with a Rigorous Derivation of Gated Recurrent Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate wellbore trajectory prediction is a paramount challenge in subsurface engineering, governed by complex interactions between the drilling assembly and heterogeneous geological formations. This research establishes a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous framework for trajectory prediction that moves beyond empirical modeling to a geomechanically-informed, data-driven surrogate approach.The study leverages Log ASCII Standard (LAS) and wellbore deviation (DEV) data from 14 wells in the Gulfaks oil field, treating petrophysical logs not merely as input features, but as proxies for the mechanical properties of the rock that fundamentally govern drilling dynamics. A key contribution of this work is the formal derivation of wellbore kinematic models, including the Average Angle method and Dogleg Severity, from the first principles of vector calculus and differential geometry, contextualizing them as robust numerical integration schemes. The core of the predictive model is a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, for which we provide a complete, step-by-step derivation of the forward propagation dynamics and the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) training algorithm. This detailed theoretical exposition, often omitted in applied studies, clarifies the mechanisms by which the network learns temporal dependencies. The methodology encompasses a theoretically justified data preprocessing pipeline, including feature normalization, uniform depth resampling, and sequence generation. Trajectory post-processing and error analysis are conducted using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R2).</description>

      <title>Minimal Denominators Lying in Subsets of the Ring of Polynomials over a Finite Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ and fixed $n,m\in \mathbb{N}$, one can study the distribution of the value of the smallest denominator $Q\in \mathcal{S}$, for which there exists $\mathbf{P}\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]^m$ such that $\frac{P}{Q}\in B(\boldsymbol{\alpha},q^{-n})$, where $Q\in \mathcal{S}$. On the other hand, one can study the discrete analogue, when $N\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ is a polynomial with $\deg(N)=n$ and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in \frac{1}{N}\mathbb{F}_q[x]^m$ as a discrete probability distribution function. We prove that for any infinite subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[x]$, for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, and for any dimension $m$, the probability distribution functions of both these random variables are equal to one another. This is significantly stronger than the real setting, where Balazard and Martin proved that these functions have asymptotically close averages, when there are no restrictions on the denominators.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Power of Multiple Gossip Steps: A Stability-Based Generalization Analysis in Decentralized Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity, node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training. Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A Stable, Accurate and Well-Conditioned Time-Domain PMCHWT Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new boundary element formulation for transient electromagnetic scattering by homogeneous dielectric objects based on the time-domain PMCHWT equation. To address dense-mesh breakdown, a multiplicative Calderon preconditioner utilizing a modified static electric field integral operator is employed. Large-timestep breakdown and late-time instability are simultaneously resolved by rescaling the Helmholtz components leveraging the quasi-Helmholtz projectors and using temporal differentiation and integration as rescaling operators. This rescaling also balances the loop and star components at large timesteps, improving solution accuracy. The resulting discrete system is solved using a marching-on-in-time scheme and iterative solvers. Numerical experiments for simply- and multiply-connected dielectric scatterers, including highly non-smooth geometries, corroborate the accuracy, stability, and efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Parallel-in-time solution of hyperbolic PDE systems via characteristic-variable block preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the parallel-in-time solution of hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems in one spatial dimension, both linear and nonlinear. In the nonlinear setting, the discretized equations are solved with a preconditioned residual iteration based on a global linearization. The linear(ized) equation systems are approximately solved parallel-in-time using a block preconditioner applied in the characteristic variables of the underlying linear(ized) hyperbolic PDE. This change of variables is motivated by the observation that inter-variable coupling for characteristic variables is weak relative to intra-variable coupling, at least locally where spatio-temporal variations in the eigenvectors of the associated flux Jacobian are sufficiently small. For an $\ell$-dimensional system of PDEs, applying the preconditioner consists of solving a sequence of $\ell$ scalar linear(ized)-advection-like problems, each being associated with a different characteristic wave-speed in the underlying linear(ized) PDE. We approximately solve these linear advection problems using multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT); however, any other suitable parallel-in-time method could be used. Numerical examples are shown for the (linear) acoustics equations in heterogeneous media, and for the (nonlinear) shallow water equations and Euler equations of gas dynamics with shocks and rarefactions.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Simulation of Modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck/Navier-Stokes Model for Compressible Electrolytes under Mechanical Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a finite element method for a modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck/Navier-Stokes (PNP/NS) model under the mechanical equilibrium, developed for compressible electrolytes. The modification is based on the new model proposed by Dreyer, Guhlke and Muller [39], where the diffusion flux in the classical PNP system is replaced with an implicitly involved new diffusion flux, leading to fractional nonlinearity. He and Sun [42] previously developed a numerical approach for another type of modification, where the Poisson equation in the PNP system was substituted with a fourth-order elliptic equation. Another key contribution of this work is the reduction of the equilibrium system to a modified Poisson-Boltzmann system. The proposed numerical scheme is capable of handling both compressible and incompressible regimes by employing a bulk modulus parameter, which governs the fluid's compressibility and enables seamless transition between these regimes. To emphasize practical relevance, we discuss the implications of compressible electrolytes in the context of double-layer capacitance behavior. We also conduct numerical simulations over various domains to demonstrate its applicability under various operating conditions, including temperature fluctuations and variations in the bulk modulus. The numerical results validate the accuracy and robustness of our computational scheme and demonstrate that the observed limiting behavior for the incompressible regime aligns with the theoretical trends anticipated by Dreyer et al. [39].</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the design and analysis of a novel hybrid high-order (HHO) method on unfitted meshes. HHO methods rely on a pair of unknowns, combining polynomials attached to the mesh faces and the mesh cells. In the unfitted framework, the interface can cut through the mesh cells in a very general fashion, and the polynomial unknowns are doubled in the cut cells and the cut faces. In order to avoid the ill-conditioning issues caused by the presence of small cut cells, the novel approach introduced herein is to use polynomial extensions in the definition of the gradient reconstruction operator. Stability and consistency results are established, leading to optimally decaying error estimates. The theory is illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the deterministic Lyapunov-based stabilization framework to random hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, where uncertainties arise in boundary controls and initial data. Building on the finite volume discretization method from [{\sc M. Banda and M. Herty}, Math. Control Relat. Fields., 3 (2013), pp. 121--142], we introduce a stochastic discrete Lyapunov function to prove the exponential decay of numerical solutions for systems with random perturbations. For linear systems, we derive explicit decay rates, which depend on boundary control parameters, grid resolutions, and the statistical properties of the random inputs. Theoretical decay rates are verified through numerical examples, including boundary stabilization of the linear wave equations and linearized shallow-water flows with random perturbations. We also present the decay rates for a nonlinear example and for the linearized Saint-Venant system with source terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop quaternion--native iterative methods for computing the Moore--Penrose (MP) pseudoinverse of quaternion matrices and analyze their convergence. Our starting point is a damped Newton--Schulz (NS) iteration tailored to noncommutativity: we enforce the appropriate left/right identities for rectangular inputs and prove convergence directly in $\mathbb{H}$ under a simple spectral scaling. We then derive higher--order (\emph{hyperpower}) NS schemes with exact residual recurrences that yield order-$p$ local convergence, together with factorizations that reduce the number of $s\times s$ quaternion products per iteration. Beyond NS, we introduce a randomized sketch--and--project method (RSP--Q), a hybrid RSP+NS scheme that interleaves inexpensive randomized projections with an exact hyperpower step, and a matrix--form conjugate gradient on the normal equations (CGNE--Q). All algorithms operate directly in $\mathbb{H}$ (no real or complex embeddings) and are matrix--free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic modeling is important in modern society. In this work we propose a new model on the optimal network pricing (Onp) with the assumption of oblivious users, in which the users remain oblivious to real-time traffic conditions and others' behavior. Inspired by works on transportation research and network pricing for selfish traffic, we mathematically derive and prove a new formulation of Onp with decision-dependent modeling that relax certain existing modeling constraints in the literature. Then, we express the Onp formulation as a constrained nonconvex stochastic quadratic program with uncertainty, and we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the problem, utilizing graph theory, sparse linear algebra and stochastic approximation. Lastly, we showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the usefulness of the new Onp formulation. The proposed algorithm achieves a 5x speedup by exploiting the sparsity structure of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Langevin Dynamics is a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) central to sampling and generative modeling and is implemented via time discretization. Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), based on the Euler-Maruyama discretization, is the simplest and most studied algorithm. LMC can suffer from slow convergence - requiring a large number of steps of small step-size to obtain good quality samples. This becomes stark in the case of diffusion models where a large number of steps gives the best samples, but the quality degrades rapidly with smaller number of steps. Randomized Midpoint Method has been recently proposed as a better discretization of Langevin dynamics for sampling from strongly log-concave distributions. However, important applications such as diffusion models involve non-log concave densities and contain time varying drift. We propose its variant, the Poisson Midpoint Method, which approximates a small step-size LMC with large step-sizes. We prove that this can obtain a quadratic speed up of LMC under very weak assumptions. We apply our method to diffusion models for image generation and show that it maintains the quality of DDPM with 1000 neural network calls with just 50-80 neural network calls and outperforms ODE based methods with similar compute.</description>

Abstract: Many domains, from deep learning to finance, require compounding real numbers over long sequences, often leading to catastrophic numerical underflow or overflow. We introduce generalized orders of magnitude (GOOMs), a principled extension of traditional orders of magnitude that incorporates floating-point numbers as a special case, and which in practice enables stable computation over significantly larger dynamic ranges of real numbers than previously possible. We implement GOOMs, along with an efficient custom parallel prefix scan, to support native execution on parallel hardware such as GPUs. We demonstrate that our implementation of GOOMs outperforms traditional approaches with three representative experiments, all of which were previously considered impractical or impossible, and now become possible and practical: (1) compounding real matrix products far beyond standard floating-point limits; (2) estimating spectra of Lyapunov exponents in parallel, orders of magnitude faster than with previous methods, applying a novel selective-resetting method to prevent state colinearity; and (3) capturing long-range dependencies in deep recurrent neural networks with non-diagonal recurrent states, computed in parallel via a prefix scan, without requiring any form of stabilization. Our results show that our implementation of GOOMs, combined with efficient parallel scanning, offers a scalable and numerically robust alternative to conventional floating-point numbers for high-dynamic-range applications.</description>
