      <title>Real-space Calculation of Orbital Hall Responses in Disordered Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed an efficient numerical approach to compute the different components of the orbital Hall responses in disordered materials from the Berry phase theory of magnetization. We propose a theoretical framework based on the Chebyshev expansion of Green's functions and the position operator for systems under arbitrary boundary conditions. The capability of this scheme is illustrated by computing the orbital Hall conductivity for gapped graphene and Haldane model in the presence of nonperturbative disorder effects. This methodology opens the door to realistic simulations of orbital Hall responses in arbitrary complex models of disordered materials.</description>

      <title>Disorder Suppresses Collective Polaritonic Effects on Chemical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a powerful formalism, disordered collective dynamics using truncated equations (d-CUT-E), to simulate the ultrafast quantum dynamics of molecular polaritons in the collective strong coupling regime, where a disordered ensemble of $N\gg10^{6}$ molecules couples to a cavity mode. Notably, we can capture this dynamics with a cavity hosting a single \textit{effective} molecule with $\sim N_{bins}$ electronic states, where $N_{bins}\ll N$ is the number of bins discretizing the disorder distribution. Using d-CUT-E we conclude that strong coupling, as evaluated from linear optical spectra, can be a poor proxy for polariton chemistry. For highly disordered ensembles, total reaction yield upon broadband excitation is identical to that outside of the cavity, while narrowband excitation produces distinct reaction yields solely due to differences in the initial states prepared prior to the reaction.</description>

      <title>Fast convergence to an approximate solution by message-passing for complex optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Message-passing (MP) is a powerful tool for finding an approximate solution in optimization. We generalize it to nonlinear product-sum form, and numerically show the fast convergence for the minimum feedback vertex set and the minimum vertex cover known as NP-hard problems. From the linearity of MP in a logarithmic space, it is derived that an equilibrium solution exists in a neighborhood of random initial values. These results will give one of the reason why the convergence is very fast in collective computation based on a common mathematical background.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorem of Overlap for the Mean Field Ghatak-Sherrington model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ghatak-Sherrington (GS) spin glass model is a random probability measure defined on the configuration space $\{0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots, \pm \mathcal{S} \}^N$ with system size $N$ and $\mathcal{S}\ge1$ finite. This generalizes the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model on the boolean cube $\{-1,+1\}^N$ in order to capture more complex behaviors, including the spontaneous inverse freezing phenomenon. Although many results on the physics side have been established to understand the GS model, mathematical exploration of the model remains scarce. Overlap, the normalized inner product of two configurations, acts as the system order parameter to understand the phase transition of mean-field spin glass models. In this paper, we use moment method combined with the cavity approach to rigorously establish a quantitative joint central limit theorem for the overlap and self-overlap array. The results hold at high temperatures under arbitrary crystal and external fields. Compared to the SK model, the main challenge comes from the non-trivial self-overlap terms which also correlated with the standard overlap terms.</description>
