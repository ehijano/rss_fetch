      <title>Thin-shell wormhole with a background Kalb-Ramond Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kalb-Ramond field is a background tensor field that arises in string theory and violates local Lorentz symmetry of spacetime, upon acquiring the Vacuum Expectation Value. A non-minimal coupling between the Kalb-Ramond VEV and the Ricci tensor may give rise to a modified black hole solution. Considering two copies of such black holes, we construct a thin-shell wormhole using the Cut-and-Paste technique. Then we investigate key physical properties of the wormhole like pressure-density profile, equation of state, the geodesic motion of test particles near the wormhole throat, and the total amount of exotic matter in the throat, and examine how these properties vary with the Lorentz-Violating parameters. We find that the wormhole model violates the null and weak energy conditions, but satisfies the strong energy condition. On top of that, the velocity of the throat radius is found considering its time evolution. Finally, we analyze its linear stability against small radial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Conundrum of regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields has sprouted numerous candidates, each exhibiting certain virtues but often accompanied by significant drawbacks. We demonstrate that Komar mass, electric charge and magnetic charge are mutually dependent in regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields, defined by Lagrangian which is a function of both electromagnetic invariants, $F_{ab} F^{ab}$ and $F_{ab}{\star F}^{ab}$, regardless of the specific weak field limit of the theory. Also, we generalize one of the key no-go theorems by showing that static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black holes in a theory respecting the relaxed Maxwellian weak field limit do not admit a bounded Kretschmann scalar. Finally, we address one of the long-standing niche questions, whether regular black hole solutions can exist when both electric and magnetic charges are present, by constructing an exotic family of regular dyonic black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields in theories respecting the Maxwellian weak field limit. Mounting evidence suggests that regularizing black holes through simplistic nonlinear extensions of Maxwell's electromagnetism entails a high cost in the form of unorthodox theoretical assumptions.</description>

      <title>Shadow structure of generalized $k-n$ black-bounce metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of black hole shadows is one of the most interesting effects of the strong field regime of general relativity (GR). Recent observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have provided high-resolution images of the vicinity of supermassive black holes, ushering in a new era for testing gravitation on astrophysical scales. In this work, we continue the investigation initiated by \cite{furtado2025gravitational}, focusing on shadows associated with generalized $k-n$ \emph{black-bounce} type spacetimes, which smoothly interpolate between regular black holes and wormholes. We consider a generalization of the metric with free parameters $(a,k,n)$ that modify the mass function and enrich the possible phenomenology. We develop a semi-analytical study of photon orbits, obtaining the critical impact parameter and the shadow radius for different parameter combinations. Subsequently, we perform numerical ray-tracing simulations using the \textsc{GYOTO} code, incorporating optically thick accretion disks and varying the observation angle. Our results reveal characteristic signatures, including the formation of double-ring structures and deformations of the shadow radius, which can serve as observational discriminators between classical black holes and \emph{black-bounce} solutions.</description>

      <title>The symplectic geometry of the black hole photon shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unstably bound, critical null geodesics of the Kerr spacetime form a distinguished class of orbits whose properties govern observables such as the photon ring and the high-frequency component of black-hole ringdown. This set of orbits defines a codimension-two submanifold of the null-geodesic phase space known as the photon shell. In this work we investigate the photon shell's intrinsic symplectic geometry. Using the induced symplectic form, we construct the canonical volume form on the shell and compute the differential phase-space volume it encloses as a function of radius -- equivalently, the radial density of states. In the near-extremal limit the photon shell bifurcates into near-horizon and far-region components; we find that approximately $3\%$ of the shell's phase-space volume resides in the near-horizon component. We also analyze a thickening of the photon shell that includes near-critical orbits, and compute its differential phase-space volume. Beyond their intrinsic theoretical interest, these results may inform the interpretation of high-resolution observations of spinning black holes.</description>

      <title>Theory-agnostic searches of non-gravitational modes in the ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory-agnostic framework to search for extra-fundamental modes in the ringdown phase of black hole mergers. These modes, distinct from standard General Relativity (GR) deviations, originate from modifications of the theory of gravity. Applying our method to the events GW150914, GW190521, and GW200129, we find no significant evidence for extra modes beyond those expected in GR.</description>

      <title>Constraining the gravitational-wave emission of core-collapse supernovae with ground-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gravitational-wave background (GWB) arising from the superposition of numerous unresolved gravitational-wave signals has yet to be detected. Potential contributing sources to such a background include compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). In this work, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave energy emitted by CCSNe using cross-correlation measurements made with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors during their third observing run (O3). Specifically, we obtain a $95\%$ credibility upper limit of $0.01~ {M_\odot c^2}$ while accounting for the contribution from CBC sources to a GWB. This result improves on previous constraint obtained from initial LIGO data by approximately two orders of magnitude. We also explore the detection prospects of third-generation ground-based detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer for both individual CCSNe events and the GWB. Our results show that single events are likely to be detected prior to the GWB.</description>

      <title>Imperfect dark matter with higher derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a higher-derivative action for dark matter whose energy-momentum tensor describes an imperfect fluid with nonzero pressure, energy flux, and anisotropic stress. In the limit where the higher-derivative couplings are switched off, the energy-momentum tensor reduces to pressureless dust. A systematic derivation follows from extending the singular conformal transformation used in the mimetic dark matter scenario to include higher-derivative terms while the resulting action is general and does not rely on the mimetic framework. On a homogeneous cosmological background, the dynamics coincides with that of pressureless dust, while in the presence of inhomogeneities the higher-derivative terms generate nonzero acceleration and vorticity, making it possible to avoid the formation of caustic singularities even if the strong energy condition satisfies. In particular, within the mimetic realization these terms resolve the usual caustic pathology of mimetic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Vacuum breakdown around a Kerr black hole surrounded by a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the invariant characterization of the region where vacuum breakdown into electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pairs occurs due to an overcritical electric field, the dyadoregion, in the case of a Kerr black hole (BH) in the presence of an external, asymptotically uniform test magnetic field aligned with the BH rotation axis, using the Wald solution. We calculate the dyadoregion morphology, the electromagnetic energy available for the pairs, the pair-creation rate, the number density of pairs, the average energy per pair, and their energy density and pressure. These results provide initial conditions for simulating the subsequent dynamics of the pair-produced plasma and astrophysical applications in the context of high-energy transients involving BHs in strong electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect describes how photons are gravitationally redshifted, producing anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background. We study the inverse problem and show that primordial gravitational perturbations, in particular their polarizations in the transversally traceless (TT) gauge can be identified from the local observation of the ISW effect.</description>

      <title>Effects of tidal charge on Blandford-Znajek process around braneworld black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process is a pivotal mechanism to efficiently extract the energy from a rotating black hole (BH) via its plasma-filled magnetosphere in relativistic astrophysics. Within the framework of extended BZ monopole expansion, we have studied BZ process in the Randall-Sundrum braneworld BH spacetime and analyzed effects of the tidal charge on the energy and angular momentum extraction rates. It is found that the positive tidal charge reduces the BZ power of a braneworld BH, while the negative tidal charge enhances the power. Compared with a Kerr BH of the same mass and angular velocity, the BZ power exhibits a maximum reduction of approximately $15.2\%$ in positive cases, whereas in negative cases, it achieves a maximum enhancement of $66.5\%$ in power output. A similar qualitative trend is also observed for the relative angular momentum extraction rate, albeit with different magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Laws of black hole mechanics in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the isolated horizon formalism to include rotating black holes arising in five dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) theory of gravity, and derive the laws of black hole mechanics. This result allows us to show that the first law of black hole mechanics is modified, due to the Gauss-Bonnet term, so as to include corrections to (i) the area of horizon cross-sections and, to (ii) the expression of horizon angular momentum. Once these modifications are included, the Hamiltonian generates an evolution on the space of solutions of the EGB theory admitting isolated horizon as an internal boundary, the consequence of which is the first law of black hole mechanics. These boundary conditions may help in the search for exact solutions describing rotating black holes in this theory.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of black holes and an invariant of spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We represent a new approach to exploring the thermodynamic topology of black holes, without introducing the nonphysical variable $\Theta\in[0,\pi]$ considered in previous studies, where black holes can exchange both energy and matter with the environment, leading to a thermal and chemical equilibrium. We construct a conserved topological tensor based on the gradient flow of the off-shell grand free energy corresponding to a two-dimensional or higher-dimensional vector field whose zeros are black hole solutions. We obtain a topological charge that is the sum of the index of all zeros. We find that black holes that share the same background geometry would have the same topological charge, hence they belong to the same kind of solutions. This point implies that the topological charge characterizing the black hole thermodynamics is also an invariant of spacetime, leading to valuable insight into the observed cosmological constant and the AdS distance conjecture.</description>

      <title>Modified Gravity with Nonminimal Curvature-Matter Couplings: A Framework for Gravitationally Induced Particle Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified gravity theories with a nonminimal coupling between curvature and matter offer a compelling alternative to dark energy and dark matter by introducing an explicit interaction between matter and curvature invariants. Two of the main consequences of such an interaction are the emergence of an additional force and the non-conservation of the energy--momentum tensor, which can be interpreted as an energy exchange between matter and geometry. By adopting this interpretation, one can then take advantage of many different approaches in order to investigate the phenomenon of gravitationally induced particle creation. One of these approaches relies on the so-called irreversible thermodynamics of open systems formalism. By considering the scalar--tensor formulation of one of these theories, we derive the corresponding particle creation rate, creation pressure, and entropy production, demonstrating that irreversible particle creation can drive a late-time de Sitter acceleration through a negative creation pressure, providing a natural alternative to the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics holds: the total entropy, from both the apparent horizon and enclosed matter, increases monotonically and saturates in the de Sitter phase, imposing constraints on the allowed particle production dynamics. Furthermore, we present brief reviews of other theoretical descriptions of matter creation processes. Specifically, we consider approaches based on the Boltzmann equation and quantum-based aspects and discuss the generalization of the Klein--Gordon equation, as well as the problem of its quantization in time-varying gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Results on Lorentzian metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a short introduction to ``Lorentzian metric spaces" i.e., spacetimes defined solely in terms of the two-point Lorentzian distance. As noted in previous work, this structure is essentially unique if minimal conditions are imposed, such as the continuity of the Lorentzian distance and the relative compactness of chronological diamonds. The latter condition is natural for interpreting these spaces as low-regularity versions of globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Confirming this interpretation, we prove that every Lorentzian metric space admits a Cauchy time function. The proof is constructive for this general setting and it provides a novel argument that is interesting already for smooth spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal stress-energy tensor in time-dependent gravitational backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a massless quantum scalar field in time-dependent gravitational backgrounds. Starting from its formal expression obtained within the covariant perturbative expansion to lowest order in the curvature, we evaluate the RSET in an arbitrary number of dimensions in terms of coordinate-space distributions. For time-dependent spherically symmetric spacetimes, we derive a multipole expansion and determine its asymptotic behavior. We find that the RSET is locally nonvanishing at null infinity and depends on the detailed dynamics of the collapsing body. However, the total emitted energy vanishes at this order, meaning that the leading contribution does not account for the energy density of the created particles. Nevertheless, by enforcing stress-tensor conservation up to second order in the curvature, we show that the total radiated energy can be extracted from the first-order RSET. Finally, we compute the induced quantum corrections to the metric at large distances, which display several unexpected features.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waveforms from periodic orbits around a charged black hole with scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate geodesic motion and gravitational-wave signatures of charged black holes with scalar hair. Using the effective potential approach, we analyze marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits, showing how their positions and energy thresholds are modified by the scalar hair parameter $r_B$. These results demonstrate scalar hair's role in altering the boundary of stable motion. We further explore periodic orbits characterized by rational frequency ratios, labeled by the index $(z,w,v)$, and quantify how scalar hair affects their orbital energy and angular momentum. Based on these orbital properties, we compute gravitational waveforms from extreme mass-ratio inspirals where a stellar-mass compact object orbits a supermassive charged black hole with scalar hair. Using the numerical kludge method, we generate waveforms that exhibit clear zoom-whirl patterns with morphology visibly affected by $r_B$. Our results show that scalar hair leaves distinguishable imprints on waveforms, suggesting future space-based detectors could probe deviations from classical black hole spacetimes through extreme mass-ratio inspirals observations.</description>

      <title>Entropy of de Sitter (d+1)-spacetime: modification of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of cosmological horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the connection between the entropy of the Hubble volume in de Sitter spacetime and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy $S_{\rm GH}=A/4G$ associated with the cosmological horizon. In (3+1) spacetime, these two entropies coincide, and hence the Gibbons-Hawking conjecture holds. This provides physical meaning and a natural explanation to the Gibbons-Hawking entropy -- it is the entropy in the volume $V_H$ bounded by the cosmological horizon. Here we consider whether the Gibbons-Hawking conjecture remains valid for the de Sitter state in general $d+1$ spacetime. To do this, we use local de Sitter thermodynamics, characterized by a local temperature $T=H/\pi$. This temperature is not related to the horizon: it is the temperature of local activation processes, such as the ionization of an atom in the de Sitter environment, which occur deep within the cosmological horizon. This local temperature is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}=H/2\pi$. Two different ways of calculations of the entropy of the Hubble volume were considered: integration of the local entropy density over the Hubble volume and the first law of the de Sitter thermodynamics. In both cases we found that the entropy of the Hubble volume is $S_H=(d-1)A/8G$, which modifies the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of horizon. The original form of the Gibbons-Hawking is valid only for $d=3$.</description>

      <title>The stress-energy distributional multipole for both uncharged and charged dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the distributional uncharged and charged stress-energy tensors. These are integrals, along a worldline, of derivatives of the delta-function. These distributions are also multipoles and they are prescribed to any order. They represent an extended region of non-self-interacting uncharged or charged dust, shrunken to a single point in space. We show that the uncharged dust stress-energy multipole is divergence-free, while the divergence of the charged dust stress-energy multipole is given by the current and the external electromagnetic field. We show that they can be obtained by squeezing a regular dust stress-energy tensor onto the worldine. We discuss the aforementioned calculations in a coordinate-free manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical instability of a self-gravitating thermal system in the quantum regime, where Fermi degeneracy pressure becomes significant. Using a truncated Fermi-Dirac distribution and solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we identify marginally stable configurations following Chandrasekhar's criterion. While Fermi pressure stabilizes a system against gravitational collapse in Newtonian gravity, in general relativity it can instead drive the instability, enabling collapse even at low temperatures. We discuss implications for the formation of massive black holes in the early Universe through the gravothermal collapse of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the bulk flat space limit in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flat space limit of scalar bulk fields in AdS is discussed within a Lorentzian canonical quantization setup tailored to describe AdS state preparation and to extract the flat S-matrix dynamics. We discuss how the algebraic \`{I}n\"on\"u-Wigner contraction captures the local physics of the equivalence principle in quantum field theory in a fixed background description. We develop the embedding formalism to describe the bulk AdS scalar primary wave functions as holomorphic functions. Flat space massive particle states are built out of the AdS primary together with AdS boosted wave functions. We compute their inner products and show that these become orthogonal in the flat limit, resulting in the correct continuous spectrum for a standard unitary representation of the Lorentz group. In this same limit the original AdS descendants become null states. We also argue how the flat space S-matrix emerges from standard perturbation theory in the interaction picture. To obtain flat space massless particles requires to consider a double scaled limit in which the boost rapidity is scaled to infinity keeping the average particle energy in the flat space limit fixed. We comment on how this limit generates interesting massless state wave functions with non-trivial shape profiles that remember the dimension of the AdS operator. We discuss some of the puzzles attached to these.</description>

      <title>Novel black saddles for 5d gravitational indices and the index enigma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a series of novel Euclidean multi-black-hole, black ring, black Saturn, and black lens solutions to $5d$ supergravity that contribute as saddle-points to the $5d$ gravitational supersymmetric index, either in asymptotically flat space or in asymptotically AdS$_3\times S^2$. All these solutions are supersymmetric, have finite temperature, and an appropriate angular velocity turned on that makes fermionic fields periodic around the thermal circle. They contribute either to the helicity supertrace of supergravity in $5d$ flat space or to the elliptic genus of a supergravity theory in AdS$_3 \times S^2$. Their on-shell actions are independent of temperature, as consistent with the computation of a protected index, and equal to the entropy of the corresponding extremal black object. Our construction relies on uplifting saddles that can be singular in $4d$, but which are desingularized in $5d$. The resulting saddles exhibit a novel ``index enigma'', not encountered in previous Lorentzian solutions. One example of this enigma is that, in the computation of the index in asymptotically flat space, less symmetric black ring saddles dominate over the contributions from $5d$ black holes.</description>

      <title>Study of Neutron Star Properties under the Two-Flavor Quark NJL Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Equation of State (EOS) of matter within neutron stars is a central topic in nuclear physics and astrophysics. A precise understanding of the composition and phase behavior of matter under such extreme conditions is crucial for uncovering the fundamental laws of the strong interaction. This study investigates hadron-quark hybrid stars using a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. As an effective theory, this model can describe the generation of dynamical quark masses and chiral symmetry restoration characteristic of dense quark matter.
  We construct the hybrid EOS by joining the BSR6 relativistic mean-field model for hadronic matter with the NJL model for quark matter. A quintic polynomial interpolation ensures a smooth ($C^2$ continuity) and thermodynamically consistent crossover between the phases. Based on this hybrid EOS, we solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to calculate macroscopic properties of neutron stars, such as the mass-radius ($M-R$) relationship and the tidal deformability parameter ($\Lambda$).
  By exploring key model parameters, we identify a region satisfying a wide range of multi-messenger constraints. Our resulting EOS supports a maximum mass consistent with PSR J0740+6620, while simultaneously predicting radii and tidal deformabilities for a $1.4M_{\odot}$ star that agree with NICER observations and limits from GW170817. This work thus presents a self-consistent model that resolves the tension between high-mass pulsars and small tidal deformabilities, deepening our understanding of the hadron-quark crossover.</description>

      <title>Bulk-to-bulk photon propagator in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the photon bulk-to-bulk propagator in AdS in various gauges, including axial, Coulomb, and the standard covariant gauge. We compute the propagator using both momentum and position space techniques. We ensure the propagators obtained obey the right subsidiary conditions arising from gauge invariance. In particular, BRST invariance implies a relation between the longitudinal components of the gauge field propagator and the ghost bulk-to-bulk propagator. Our method relies on decomposing the components of the propagator in terms of independent tensor structures and solving for the form factors. We recover some previously existing results and obtain new expressions for the propagator in other gauges. The propagator in axial and Coulomb gauge is simpler in momentum space, as momentum space makes manisfest the translational invariance in the boundary directions, while the position space expression is the simplest in the covariant Fried-Yennie gauge. In this gauge the propagator has an improved IR behavior, somewhat analogous to the UV improved behavior associated with the Landau gauge in flat space. The results readily extend to Yang-Mills fields.</description>

      <title>Towards theory constraints on ultralight dark matter from quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar dark matter may couple to the Standard Model through dimension-five operators that contain the field-strength tensors of the gauge interactions. Recent progress in nuclear clocks is projected to increase the sensitivity to such couplings by several orders of magnitude. Future experimental constraints may even have Planck-scale sensitivity, calling for a study of such couplings in a framework that includes quantum gravity. We take a first step towards providing the theoretical constraints on such couplings that arise in asymptotically safe gravity. We find evidence that such couplings vanish in asymptotically safe gravity and are also not generated in a perturbative quantum-gravity regime that describes quantum gravity as an effective field theory.</description>

      <title>A Cardy-like expression for charged rotating solitons and black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to propose a Cardy-like formula characterized by the mass, charge, and angular components of the black hole, along with their corresponding solitonic configuration, obtained through a double Wick rotation. The expression also incorporates the dynamical exponent and effective spatial dimensionality as key elements. To validate the proposal, we first present a new concrete example in which recovering the semiclassical entropy requires the soliton to possess thermodynamic quantities beyond its mass. Additionally, we show more examples derived from static black hole solutions, employing a Lorentz boost to calculate their thermodynamic parameters. Finally, we include a case of a rotating configuration where the Lorentz boost is not required.</description>

      <title>Islands in Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the information paradox in the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole by employing the recently proposed island paradigm. We first consider the quantum filed in the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman spacetime. By employing the near-horizon limit, we demonstrate that the field can be effectively described by a reduced two-dimensional field. Consequently, the formula of entanglement entropy in CFT$_2$ can be naturally adapted to this reduced two-dimensional theory. Under the framework of this reduced two-dimensional theory, we show that the entanglement entropy of radiation for the non-extremal case satisfies the unitarity in the later stage of the appearance of the entanglement islands. We further examine the impact of angular momentum and charges on the Page time and the scrambling time. Both quantities increases as the angular momentum increases, while decreases as the charge increases. At last, we consider the near extremal case. Resort to the Kerr/CFT correspondence, the near-horizon geometry of near extremal Kerr-Newman black holes can be taken account for a warped AdS geometry. In this scenario, the low-energy effective degrees of freedom are dominated by the Schwarzian zero mode, resulting in a one-loop correction to the partition function. The entanglement entropy is subsequently recalculated under the thermodynamic with corrections. Through explicit calculations, we finally find that the Page time and the scrambling time exhibits quantum delays. This strongly suggests that the near extremal geometry is governed by the Schwarzschild dynamics, in which quantum fluctuations result in a reduced rate of information leakage. Our findings further substantiate the conservation of information and extend the applicability of the island paradigm to the most general stationary spacetime background.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of the Timelike Unruh Effect with a Trapped-Ion System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect predicts that an accelerated observer perceives the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal bath, but its direct observation requires extreme accelerations beyond current experimental reach. Foundational theory [Olson &amp; Ralph, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 110404 (2011)] shows that an equivalent thermal response, known as the timelike Unruh effect, can occur for detectors following specific timelike trajectories without acceleration, enabling laboratory tests with stationary yet time-dependent detectors. Here, we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of the timelike Unruh effect in a quantum system of trapped ion, where a two-level spin serves as the detector and is temporally coupled to the ambient field encoded in the ion's vibrational motion. Specifically, we study both excitation and emission dynamics of the detector moving along a spacetime trajectory in the future/past light cone, and demonstrate the thermal response of the detector to the Minkowski vacuum that resembles the Unruh effect. This work establishes a controllable tabletop platform for exploring relativistic quantum physics under accessible laboratory conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Relative Entropy implies the Semiclassical Einstein Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the semiclassical Einstein equations emerge directly from quantum information theory. Using modular theory, we establish that the relative entropy between the vacuum state and coherent excitations of a scalar quantum field on a bifurcate Killing horizon is given by the energy flux across the horizon. Under the assumption of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area formula, this energy flux is proportional to a variation in the surface area of the horizon cross section. The semiclassical Einstein equations follow automatically from this identification. Our approach provides a rigorous quantum field theoretic generalization of Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of Einstein's equations, replacing classical thermodynamic entropy with the well-defined quantum relative (Araki-Uhlmann) entropy. This suggests that quantum information plays a fundamental role in what is seen as a zeroth order approximation of a theory of quantum gravity, namely quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) in Higgs inflation, wherein the inflaton is a scalar field with quartic self-coupling $\lambda$ and a nonminimal coupling to gravity $\xi$, and which may, but need not be, the Higgs boson of the Standard Model (SM). We find an explosive particle production peaked on a characteristic comoving wavenumber $k\sim \xi^{2/3} a H$ with a peak occupation number that scales with $\xi$. This new peak in production can easily dominate over the conventional (minimally coupled inflation) CGPP even for modest values of $\xi$. The results apply for a wide range of $\xi$, e.g., as low as $\xi=10$, which can be realized for the Standard Model Higgs given suitable RG flow of the quartic coupling. We discuss implications for late time relics such as dark matter.</description>

      <title>How Flat is a Plateau? Evolution of Late-Time TDE Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Late-time light curve plateaus in tidal disruption events (TDEs) are often approximated as flat and time-independent. This simplification is motivated by theoretical modeling of spreading late time TDE disks, which often predicts slow light curve evolution. However, if time evolution can be detected, late-time light curves will yield more information than has been previously accessible. In this work, we re-examine late-time TDE data to test how well the flat plateau assumption holds. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the maximum likelihood for a family of theory-agnostic models and apply the Akaike information criterion to find that that roughly one third of our sample favors evolving plateaus, one third favors truly flat plateaus, and one third shows no statistically significant evidence for any plateau. Next, we refit the TDEs that exhibit statistically significant plateaus using a magnetically elevated $\alpha$-disk model, motivated by the lack of clear thermal instability in late time TDE light curves. From these model-dependent fits, we obtain estimates for the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, the mass of the disrupted star, and the $\alpha$ parameter itself. Fitted $\alpha$ values range from $10^{-3}$ to 0.4 (the mean fitted $\alpha=10^{-1.8}$, with scatter of 0.6 dex), broadly consistent with results from magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we estimate the timescales of disk precession in magnetically elevated TDE models. Theoretically, we find that disk precession times may be orders of magnitude shorter than in unmagnetized Shakura-Sunyaev disks, and grow in time as $T_{\rm prec}\propto t^{35/36}$; empirically, by using fitted $\alpha$ parameters, we estimate that late time disks may experience $\sim$few-10 precession cycles.</description>

Abstract: In a recent work, Herderschee and Wall (HW) proved a bound on scalar field excursions in spatially flat FRW cosmologies. In this note, we give an alternate proof of their bound using the Friedmann equations, and we prove that it can be saturated only in universes with vanishing acceleration, $\ddot a =0$. We argue that in a realistic (eternal) inflation scenario, the bound is robust against quantum corrections and spacetime curvature, and it can be violated by higher-derivative corrections only at the expense of a superluminal speed of sound. We further speculate on possible connections between the swampland program and the vacuum estimates given in the work of HW.</description>

      <title>Observation of stationary spontaneous Hawking radiation and the time evolution of an analogue black hole</title>

Abstract: The emission of Hawking radiation from a black hole was predicted to be stationary, which is necessary for the correspondence between Hawking radiation and black-body radiation. Spontaneous Hawking radiation was observed in analogue black holes in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, although the stationarity was not probed. Here, we confirm that the spontaneous Hawking radiation is stationary, by observing such a system at six different times. Furthermore, we follow the time evolution of Hawking radiation and compare and contrast it with predictions for real black holes. We observe the ramp up of Hawking radiation followed by stationary spontaneous emission, similar to a real black hole. The end of the spontaneous Hawking radiation is marked by the formation of an inner horizon, which is seen to cause stimulated Hawking radiation as predicted. We find that the stimulated Hawking and partner particles are directly observable, and that the stimulated emission evolves from multi-mode to monochromatic. Numerical simulations suggest that Bogoliubov-Cherenkov-Landau stimulation predominates, rather than black-hole lasing.</description>

      <title>The essential regularity of singular connections in Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We accomplish three things: (i) We discover the geometric (true) regularity of affine connections, their essential (highest possible) regularity, a geometric property independent of starting atlas. (ii) We give a checkable necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether or not connections are at their essential regularity, based on the relative regularity of the connection and its Riemann curvature. (iii) We introduce a computable procedure for lifting any $L^p$ affine connection in an atlas ($p&gt;n$), to a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity. To accomplish this, we prove that the RT-equations, originally designed by the authors to locally lift the regularity of singular connections by one derivative, surprisingly, also induce an implicit hidden regularization of the Riemann curvature, together with a global regularization of transition maps between regularizing coordinate charts. From this we deduce a multi-step regularization of the connection, and construct a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity. This paper is a culmination of the theory of the RT-equations which provides a computable iterative procedure for lifting an atlas to a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity, applicable to any $L^p$ affine connection defined in a $W^{2,p}$ starting atlas, $p&gt;n$. This provides a definitive theory for determining whether singularities in an $L^p$ affine connection are essential or removable by coordinate transformation, together with an explicit procedure for lifting removable singularities to their essential regularity, both locally and globally, $p&gt;n$. This includes GR shock wave singularities and cusp singularities (continuous metrics with infinite gradients) in General Relativity. The essential regularity is the point where an intrinsic level regularity enters the subject of Geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous pressureless ellipsoid. We have shown that the minimal size $r$ that the ellipsoid can reach during collapse depends on its initial eccentricity $e_0$ as $r\propto e_0^\nu$, where $\nu \approx 15/8$, and this dependence is very universal. We have estimated the parameters (in particular, the initial eccentricity) of a homogeneous pressureless ellipsoid, whereat it collapses directly into a black hole.</description>

      <title>Response of a Kerr black hole to a generic tidal perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the response, the real part of which provides the tidal Love numbers, for non-extremal as well as extremal Kerr black holes under generic tidal perturbations. Our results suggest that the static as well as dynamical (linear-in-frequency) Love numbers vanish for both Schwarzschild and slowly rotating (linear-in-angular momentum) Kerr black holes, under generic perturbations. The vanishing of static and dynamical Love numbers also holds for axisymmetric tidal perturbations of non-extremal and extremal Kerr black holes. In fact, even under generic tidal perturbations, the static Love numbers of Kerr black holes vanish identically. The only case with non-zero Love numbers corresponds to the non-axisymmetric dynamical tidal perturbations of Kerr black holes (to arbitrary order of angular momentum). We also demonstrate that the non-zero dynamical Love numbers, for both non-extremal and extremal Kerr black holes, get modified under the change of the sign of the spin-weight, for electromagnetic and gravitational tidal perturbations.</description>

      <title>PETRA: From the LISA global fit to a catalog of Galactic binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect mHz gravitational waves from many astrophysical sources, including millions of compact binaries in the Galaxy, thousands of which may be individually resolvable. The large number of signals overlapping in the LISA dataset requires a \emph{global fit} in which an unknown number of sources are modeled simultaneously. This introduces a \emph{label-switching ambiguity} for sources in the same class, making it challenging to distill a traditional astronomical catalog from global-fit posteriors. We present a method to construct a catalog by post-processing the global-fit posterior, relabeling samples to minimize the statistical divergence between the global fit and a factorized catalog representation. The resulting catalog consists of the source posterior distributions and their probabilities of having an astrophysical origin. We demonstrate our algorithm on two toy models and on a small simulated LISA dataset of Galactic binaries. Our method is implemented in the open-source Python package \textsc{petra\_catalogs}, and it can be applied in postprocessing to the output of any global-fit sampler.</description>

      <title>Global Portraits of Inflation in Nonsingular Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the phase space perspective, scalar field slow roll inflation is described by a heteroclinic orbit from a saddle type fixed point to a final attractive point. In many models the saddle point resides in the scalar field asymptotics, and thus for a comprehensive view of the dynamics a global phase portrait is necessary. For this task, in the literature one mostly encounters dynamical variables that either render the initial or the final state singular, thus obscuring the full picture. In this work we construct a hybrid set of variables which allow the depiction of both the initial and final states distinctly in nonsingular manner. To illustrate the method, we apply these variables to portray various interesting types of scalar field inflationary models like metric Higgs inflation, metric Starobinsky inflation, pole inflation, and a nonminimal Palatini model.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of long-duration gravitational wave signals originating from Galactic sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detection of quasi-monochromatic, long-duration (continuous) gravitational wave radiation emitted by, e.g., asymmetric rotating neutron stars in our Galaxy requires a long observation time to distinguish it from the detector's noise. If this signal is additionally microlensed by a lensing object located in the Galaxy, its magnitude would be temporarily magnified, which may lead to its discovery and allow probing of the physical nature of the lensing object and the source. We study the observational effect of microlensing of continuous gravitational wave signals for Galactic sources and lenses in the point mass lens approximation. In particular, we examine the regions of the parameter space that are promising for lensed CW searches, and perform example simulations to demonstrate how the lensing effect affects the continuous-wave signal. We show that an analytical lensing pattern can be identified from the lensed continuous wave signal using the Time-Domain F-statistic search, as the estimated signal-to-noise ratio in each time-domain segment scales directly with the amplification factor.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Bianchi Models with Deformed Commutation Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the anisotropic Bianchi I and Bianchi II models in vacuum in the framework of deformed commutation relations (DCRs). Working in a parametrisation of the spatial metric by a volume and two anisotropy variables, we propose modified Poisson brackets that for the volume alone reproduce the bounce dynamics of effective loop quantum cosmology (LQC), with additional modifications for anisotropy degrees of freedom. We derive effective Friedmann equations and observe cosmological bounces both in Bianchi I and Bianchi II. For Bianchi II, we find that the cosmological bounce now interacts with the usual reflection seen in the Kasner indices in various interesting ways, in close similarity again with what had been seen in LQC. This suggests that the DCR framework could model more general quantum-gravity inspired bounce scenarios in a relatively straightforward way.</description>

      <title>Probing the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a dark matter halo through astrophysical tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a recently derived Schwarzschild-like black hole immersed in a Dehnen-type $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)=(1,4,5/2)$ dark matter (DM) halo. We obtain constraints on the two model parameters, i.e., the halo core radius $r_s$ and the DM density parameter $\rho_s$ in both the weak and the strong field regimes. In the weak field, we model test particle geodesics and match the predicted perihelion shift to Mercury (Solar System) and the orbit of the S2 star data. We obtain upper limits on $r_s$ and $\rho_s$ and highlight that the DM halo effects become observable only around supermassive BHs. In the strong field, we analyse twin high frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) from four microquasars (e.g., GRO~J1655-40, GRS~1915+105, XTE~J1859+226, and XTE~J1550-564). Because QPO frequencies depend only on the local spacetime curvature, they can serve as a probe of halo-induced deviations from general relativity. Our MCMC analysis produces posterior distributions for model parameters, revealing close agreement between the theoretical QPO frequencies and the observations for GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40. The same analysis also yielded best-fit values and upper bounds for each parameter. Our combined geodesic and QPO analysis demonstrates that timelike orbits and epicyclic oscillations can act as sensitive probes of DM halos around BHs, offering a pathway to distinguish Dehnen-type profiles from alternative DM distributions in future analysis and observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present two generalized formulations of the Holographic and Ricci Dark Energy (DE) models, given by $ \rho_{GH} = 3c^2M^{2}_{pl} \left[ 1-\epsilon\left(1-\frac{R}{H^2}\right) \right]H^2$ and $\rho_{GR} = 3c^2M^{2}_{pl}\left[ 1-\eta\left(1-\frac{H^2}{R}\right) \right]R$ where $H$ and $R$ denote the Hubble parameter and the Ricci scalar, while $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ are model parameters related by $\epsilon = 1 - \eta$. We derived explicit analytical expressions for key cosmological quantities, including the Hubble parameter, the DE density $\rho_D$, the DE pressure $p_D$, the equation of state parameter of DE $\omega_D$ and the deceleration parameter $q$. The analysis was carried out for four distinct cases: (i) the standard model in its original formulation; (ii) the inclusion of spatial curvature; (iii) the addition of interactions between the dark sectors; and (iv) the presence of both interaction and curvature. Moreover, we also considered the limiting case of a DE Dominated Universe.
  To further characterize the dynamical features of the models, we investigated several diagnostic tools, namely the statefinder parameters, the $Om(z)$ diagnostic, the squared speed of the sound $v_s^2$, the cosmographic parameters and the age of the present Universe. Moreover, we established a correspondence between the DE models we studied and some scalar field theories, including tachyon, k-essence, dilaton, quintessence, Dirac-Born-Infeld, Yang-Mills and Nonlinear Electrodynamics (NLED) fields.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a coordinate- and foliation-independent Heisenberg-type lower bound for quantum states strictly localized in geodesic balls of radius $r$ on spacelike hypersurfaces of arbitrary spacetimes (with matter and a cosmological constant). The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\sigma_p$ by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\sigma_p r \ge \hbar/2$. Under the same assumption, a vector-field Barta-type argument improves this universal floor to the scale-invariant bound $\sigma_p r \ge \pi\hbar/2$, which provides a universal, foliation-independent floor. Any further sharpening of the constant requires eigenvalue-comparison results or other curvature-sensitive methods.</description>

Abstract: The tidal deformation of compact objects, characterised by their Love numbers, provides insights into the internal structure of neutron stars and black holes. While bosonic tidal Love numbers vanish for black holes in general relativity, it has been recently revealed that fermionic tidal perturbations can induce non-zero Love numbers for Kerr black holes. In this paper, we investigate the response of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole to the fermionic Weyl field. As a result, we find that the corresponding fermionic tidal Love numbers are also non-vanishing for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes except for the extremal ones, which highlights the universal distinct behavior of the fermionic tidal Love numbers compared to the bosonic counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for detecting gravitational-wave signals lensed by cosmic strings (CSs), addressing a key gap in current searches. CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength $\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated, exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space.</description>

Abstract: Using ray-tracing techniques, this paper investigates the optical and polarization images of rotating black holes in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity illuminated by thick accretion disks. We examine two accretion disk models: the phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model and the analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF) model. The RIAF model incorporates both isotropic and anisotropic radiation. In all models, the external bright rings corresponding to the high-order image and the internal dark region associated with the event horizon are observed. At high observational inclinations, the inner shadows are obscured by the radiation from the equatorial plane, which is significantly different from the thin accretion disk model. The primary distinction between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that the latter causes distortion of the high-order image in the vertical direction, resulting in an elliptical structure. For the BAAF model, due to certain regions are geometrically thinner under the conical approximation, the high-order images are narrower compared to the RIAF model. Furthermore, we find that an increase in the rotational parameter $a$ leads to an asymmetry in the intensity distribution of the high-order image, while an increase in the spontaneous Lorentz violating parameters, $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$, results in a decrease in the size of the high-order image. In the polarization image, the linear polarization is found to be significantly influenced by the intensity, while it is relatively less affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$. The electric vector position angle is mainly affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$.</description>

      <title>Greybody factors of string-corrected d-dimensional black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute analytically greybody factors for asymptotically flat spherically symmetric black holes with stringy higher derivative corrections in d dimensions in the high frequency limit. Our calculations include both the eikonal limit - where the real part of the frequency of the scattered wave is much larger than the imaginary part - and the highly damped case - where the imaginary part of the frequency is much larger than the real part -, addressing the emission of gravitons and test scalar fields, and yielding full transmission and reflection scattering coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated both by classical physics problems associated with ``Newton's bucket'' and recent developments related to QCD in rotating frames of reference relevant to heavy ion collisions, we discuss the difference between ``active'' and ``passive'' rotations in quantum systems. We examine some relevant potentials and give general symmetry arguments to give criteria where such rotations give the same results. We close with a discussion of how this can be translated to quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Redshift from Galaxy Clusters -- a Relativistic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The light that we receive from clusters of galaxies is redshifted by the presence of the clusters' gravitational potential. This effect, known as gravitational redshift, was first detected from a sample of stacked clusters in 2011, by taking redshift differences between the centre of each cluster and the respective member galaxies. However, the interpretation of this result was later challenged by several studies, which emphasised the possible influence of additional kinematic effects on the observed signal, like the transverse Doppler effect. In this work, we present the first derivation of all such effects within a relativistic framework, accurate to third order in the weak-field approximation. This framework allows us to correctly capture the hierarchy of terms on the scale of clusters and at the same time account for all relativistic effects. We compare our result with previous literature and show that some terms of the same order of the transverse Doppler effect were not properly included, leading to an overestimation of the kinematic contamination. In particular, we do not find any contribution arising from the so-called light-cone effect and obtain a larger correction due the motion of the central galaxy. Our derivation is independent of the Euler equation, providing a straightforward framework to test the weak equivalence principle.</description>

      <title>Apparent $w&lt;-1$ and a Lower $S_8$ from Dark Axion and Dark Baryons Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a simple coupling between dark energy and dark matter can simultaneously address two distinct hints at new physics coming from cosmological observations. The first is the recent evidence from the DESI project and supernovae observations that the dark energy equation of state~$w$ is evolving over cosmic time from an earlier value that is~$&lt;-1$ to a present-day value~$&gt;-1$. The second observation is the so-called~$S_8$ tension, describing the suppression of the growth of matter overdensities compared to that expected in the~$\Lambda$CDM model. We propose a stable, technically natural particle physics implementation of this idea, in which dark matter consists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark energy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark matter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits a phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in a slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall growth of density perturbations.</description>

      <title>A Hubble constant estimation with dark standard sirens and galaxy cluster catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the possibility of using galaxy cluster catalogues to provide redshift support for a gravitational-wave dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$. We adapt the cosmology inference pipeline gwcosmo to handle galaxy cluster catalogues. Together with binary black holes from the GWTC-3, we use galaxy cluster data from the PSZ2 and the eRASS catalogues. With these catalogues, we obtain $H_0 = 77^{+10}_{-10}$ and $81^{+8}_{-8}\, \text{km}\, \text{s}^{-1}\, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ respectively, which demonstrates improvements on precision by factors of 10% and 38% respectively over the traditional galaxy catalogue result. This exploratory work paves the way towards precise and accurate cosmography making use of distant compact binary mergers from upcoming observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network and future gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Addressing $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions within $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of $f(Q)$ gravity as an alternative framework to address the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions in cosmology. Focusing on three representative $f(Q)$ models, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using a combination of cosmological observations, including cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and CMB distance priors. Our results demonstrate that most of these models can yield higher values of $H_0$ than those predicted by $\Lambda$CDM, offering a partial alleviation of the tension. In addition, one model satisfies the condition $G_{\mathrm{eff}} &lt; G$, making it a promising candidate for addressing the $S_8$ tension. However, these improvements are accompanied by mild internal inconsistencies between different subsets of data, which limit the overall statistical preference relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Despite this, $f(Q)$ gravity remains a promising and flexible framework for late-time cosmology, and our results motivate further exploration of extended or hybrid models that may reconcile all observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Dark Energy in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favour a scenario in which dark energy (DE) decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state (EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w &lt; - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w &gt; - 1$ at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$. Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In this work, we investigate a broad class of $thawing~scalar~field~models$, including the simple quadratic, quartic, exponential, symmetry-breaking and axion potentials, propagating on a (4+1)-dimensional ghost-free phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the $Om$ diagnostic, and demonstrate that the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$ values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.</description>

      <title>Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy cosmologies using joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, GW standard siren observations from binary neutron star mergers provide a powerful tool for probing the expansion history of the universe. Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations. When GW data are included into the CBS dataset, a preference for $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &gt; 0$ emerges at approximately the $1\sigma$ level in the $w$CDM and CPL models, and reaches about $3\sigma$ in the HDE model. Moreover, the upper limits on $m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm eff}$ are reduced by approximately 13%, 75%, and 3% in the $w$CDM, HDE, and CPL models, respectively.</description>

      <title>Reexamining Evidence of a Pair-Instability Mass Gap in the Binary Black Hole Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fourth gravitational wave transient catalog~(GWTC-4) has enabled empirical probes of the theorized pair-instability gap in the higher end of the binary black hole~(BBH) mass-spectrum. In this letter, using flexibly parametrized models, we show that at present there is no evidence of a sharp drop-off in the spectrum of black hole masses near $~40-50M_{\odot}$. We simultaneously characterize the transition in the distribution of BBH mass-ratios, effective aligned and effective precessing spins using our flexible models. From the transitions in our inferred spin and mass-ratio distributions, we find that the high-mass broad-spin sub-population has a significant fraction~($52^{+18}_{-23}\%$) of systems with mass ratios in the range $0.6-1$. This suggests that alternatives to the hypothesis of 2G+1G hierarchical systems dominating BBH formation above $\sim 40-50 M_{\odot}$ are more consistent with the GWTC-4 detection sample. By comparing with the predictions of star cluster simulations, we further show that contributions from (2G+2G) systems are not abundant enough to alleviate this discrepancy. We also demonstrate the effects of strong model assumptions on this inference, which can lead to biased astrophysical interpretation from restricted priors. We note that our results do not exclude that a high-mass gap may be identified as our sample size increases. We constrain the lower bound on the location of a possible PISN cutoff still allowed within measurement uncertainties to be $(57^{+17}_{-10}M_{\odot})$ and discuss its implications on the S factor of $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16}O$ at 300 kev.</description>
