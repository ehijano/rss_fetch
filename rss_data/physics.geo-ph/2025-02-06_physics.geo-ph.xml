      <title>A new method for structural diagnostics with muon tomography and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the production of high-resolution images of typical support elements in concrete structures by means of the muon tomography (muography). By exploiting detailed Monte Carlo radiation-matter simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of the reconstruction of 1 cm--thick iron tubes inside 30 cm--deep concrete blocks, regarded as an important testbed within the structural diagnostics community. In addition, we present a new method for integrating simulated data with advanced deep learning techniques in order to improve the muon imaging of concrete structures. Through deep learning enhancement techniques, this results into a dramatic improvement of the image quality, as well as into a significant reduction of the data acquisition time, which are two critical limitations within the usual practice of muography for civil engineering diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Rocketquake Seismology with a Falcon 9 Rocket Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of using rocket launches, specifically rocketquakes, as a seismic source to image subsurface velocity and geology of planetary bodies. Toward this goal, we record the seismic vibrations excited by a Falcon 9 rocket launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base (SFB) near Lompoc, California. Nine passive three-component (3C) seismometers were deployed every 18.75 meters along a 45-degree line from the launch site starting at the offset of about 7 km kilometers from the launch pad. Results show that coherent body waves can be recorded with a P-velocity of more than 2.0 km/s and a penetration depth of 1 km or deeper. Stronger Rayleigh waves were also recorded and inverted to give an S-velocity profile to a depth of 60 m. Notably, a 3C recorder placed approximately 15 km from the launch site did not capture any discernible body wave arrivals. The imaging techniques employed for rocketquake seismology integrate inversion methods from earthquake and exploration seismology, yielding the P- and S-velocity profiles of the subsurface. These results suggest that rocket launches as seismic sources will provide unprecedented opportunities for identifying the subsurface hazards, faults, tunnels, water ice, and mineral deposits of planetary bodies and their moons.</description>
