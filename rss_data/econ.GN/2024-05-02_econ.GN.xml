      <title>Conceiving Naturally After IVF: the effect of assisted reproduction on obstetric interventions and child health at birth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing share of the world's population is being born via assisted reproductive technology (ART), including in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, two concerns persist. First, ART pregnancies correlate with predictors of poor outcomes at birth--and it is unclear whether this relationship is causal. Second, the emotional and financial costs associated with ART-use might exacerbate defensive medical behaviour, where physicians intervene more than necessary to reduce the risk of adverse medical outcomes and litigation. We address the challenge of identifying the pure effect of ART-use on both maternal and infant outcomes at birth by leveraging exogenous variation in the success of ART cycles. We compare the obstetric outcomes for ART-conceived births with those of spontaneously-conceived births after a failed ART treatment. Moreover, we flexibly adjust for key confounders using double machine learning. We do this using clinical registry ART data and administrative maternal and infant data from New South Wales (NSW) between 2009-2017. We find that ART slightly decreases the risk of obstetric interventions, lowering the risk of a caesarean section and increasing the rate of spontaneous labour (+3.5 p.p.). Moreover, we find that ART has a statistically and clinically insignificant effect on infant health outcomes.

      <title>Blockchain Price vs. Quantity Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimal transaction fee mechanisms for blockchains, focusing on the distinction between price-based ($\mathcal{P}$) and quantity-based ($\mathcal{Q}$) controls. By analyzing factors such as demand uncertainty, validator costs, cryptocurrency price fluctuations, price elasticity of demand, and levels of decentralization, we establish criteria that determine the selection of transaction fee mechanisms. We present a model framed around a Nash bargaining game, exploring how blockchain designers and validators negotiate fee structures to balance network welfare with profitability. Our findings suggest that the choice between $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ mechanisms depends critically on the blockchain's specific technical and economic features. The study concludes that no single mechanism suits all contexts and highlights the potential for hybrid approaches that adaptively combine features of both $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ to meet varying demands and market conditions.</description>

      <title>The value of non-traditional credentials in the labor market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the labor market value of credentials obtained from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and shared on business networking platforms. We conducted a randomized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and without college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera platform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had recently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the sharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of approximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17 percentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6\% more likely to report new employment within a year, with an 8\% increase in jobs related to their certificates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability. Across the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicating an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing and reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on the workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE estimates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles the baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.</description>

      <title>DAM: A Universal Dual Attention Mechanism for Multimodal Timeseries Cryptocurrency Trend Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the distributed systems landscape, Blockchain has catalyzed the rise of cryptocurrencies, merging enhanced security and decentralization with significant investment opportunities. Despite their potential, current research on cryptocurrency trend forecasting often falls short by simplistically merging sentiment data without fully considering the nuanced interplay between financial market dynamics and external sentiment influences. This paper presents a novel Dual Attention Mechanism (DAM) for forecasting cryptocurrency trends using multimodal time-series data. Our approach, which integrates critical cryptocurrency metrics with sentiment data from news and social media analyzed through CryptoBERT, addresses the inherent volatility and prediction challenges in cryptocurrency markets. By combining elements of distributed systems, natural language processing, and financial forecasting, our method outperforms conventional models like LSTM and Transformer by up to 20\% in prediction accuracy. This advancement deepens the understanding of distributed systems and has practical implications in financial markets, benefiting stakeholders in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. Moreover, our enhanced forecasting approach can significantly support decentralized science (DeSci) by facilitating strategic planning and the efficient adoption of blockchain technologies, improving operational efficiency and financial risk management in the rapidly evolving digital asset domain, thus ensuring optimal resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Heat, Health, and Habitats: Analyzing the Intersecting Risks of Climate and Demographic Shifts in Austrian Districts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of hot weather on health outcomes of a population is mediated by a variety of factors, including its age profile and local green infrastructure. The combination of warming due to climate change and demographic aging suggests that heat-related health outcomes will deteriorate in the coming decades. Here, we measure the relationship between weekly all-cause mortality and heat days in Austrian districts using a panel dataset covering $2015-2022$. An additional day reaching $30$ degrees is associated with a $2.4\%$ increase in mortality per $1000$ inhabitants during summer. This association is roughly doubled in districts with a two standard deviation above average share of the population over $65$. Using forecasts of hot days (RCP) and demographics in $2050$, we observe that districts will have elderly populations and hot days $2-5$ standard deviations above the current mean in just $25$ years. This predicts a drastic increase in heat-related mortality. At the same time, district green scores, measured using $10\times 10$ meter resolution satellite images of residential areas, significantly moderate the relationship between heat and mortality. Thus, although local policies likely cannot reverse warming or demographic trends, they can take measures to mediate the health consequences of these growing risks, which are highly heterogeneous across regions, even in Austria.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Gains (and Losses) of Revenue Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04424v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of revenue management in many industries such as airline, railway, and hospitality, there is still scarce empirical evidence on the gains or losses of such strategies compared to uniform pricing or fully flexible strategies. We quantify such gains and losses and identify their underlying sources in the context of French railway transportation. The identification of demand is complicated by censoring and the absence of exogenous price variations. We develop an original identification strategy combining temporal variations in relative prices, consumers' rationality and weak optimality conditions on the firm's pricing strategy. Our results suggest similar or better performance of the actual revenue management compared to optimal uniform pricing, but also substantial losses of up to 16.7% compared to the optimal pricing strategy. We also highlight the key role of revenue management in acquiring information when demand is uncertain.</description>

      <title>Advertiser Learning in Direct Advertising Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct buy advertisers procure advertising inventory at fixed rates from publishers and ad networks. Such advertisers face the complex task of choosing ads amongst myriad new publisher sites. We offer evidence that advertisers do not excel at making these choices. Instead, they try many sites before settling on a favored set, consistent with advertiser learning. We subsequently model advertiser demand for publisher inventory wherein advertisers learn about advertising efficacy across publishers' sites. Results suggest that advertisers spend considerable resources advertising on sites they eventually abandon--in part because their prior beliefs about advertising efficacy on those sites are too optimistic. The median advertiser's expected CTR at a new site is 0.23%, five times higher than the true median CTR of 0.045%.
  We consider how an ad network's pooling of advertiser information remediates this problem. As ads with similar visual elements garner similar CTRs, the network's pooling of information enables advertisers to better predict ad performance at new sites. Counterfactual analyses indicate that gains from pooling advertiser information are substantial: over six months, we estimate a median advertiser welfare gain of \$2,756 (a 15.5% increase) and a median publisher revenue gain of \$9,618 (a 63.9% increase).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows the universal representations of symmetric functions with multidimensional variable-size variables, which help assessing the justification of approximation methods aggregating the information of each variable by moments. It then discusses how the results give insights into economic applications, including two-step policy function estimation, moment-based Markov equilibrium, and aggregative games.</description>

      <title>Three-state Opinion Dynamics for Financial Markets on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the effects of complex networks on the collective behavior of a three-state opinion formation model in economic systems. Our model considers two distinct types of investors in financial markets: noise traders and fundamentalists. Financial states evolve via probabilistic dynamics that include economic strategies with local and global influences. The local majoritarian opinion drives noise traders' market behavior, while the market index influences the financial decisions of fundamentalist agents. We introduce a level of market anxiety $q$ present in the decision-making process that influences financial action. In our investigation, nodes of a complex network represent market agents, whereas the links represent their financial interactions. We investigate the stochastic dynamics of the model on three distinct network topologies, including scale-free networks, small-world networks and Erd{\"o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. Our model mirrors various traits observed in real-world financial return series, such as heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and short-term memory correlation of returns. The histograms of returns are fitted by coupled Gaussian distributions, quantitatively revealing transitions from a leptokurtic to a mesokurtic regime under specific economic heterogeneity. We show that the market dynamics depend mainly on the average agent connectivity, anxiety level, and market composition rather than on specific features of network topology.</description>
