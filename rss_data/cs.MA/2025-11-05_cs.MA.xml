      <title>EvoMem: Improving Multi-Agent Planning with Dual-Evolving Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning has been a cornerstone of artificial intelligence for solving complex problems, and recent progress in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks have begun to extend this capability. However, the role of human-like memory within these frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents coordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the success. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor) and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multi-Lane Intersection Performance in Mixed Autonomy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is ensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model the dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and temporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a robust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal control through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the system to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with objectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring safety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated using a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1% reduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs improved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types. These findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for real-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.</description>

      <title>Automata-Conditioned Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited to the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for learning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main challenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove the correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of learned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time. Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents, e.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and short-circuiting tasks.</description>

      <title>ABIDES-MARL: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Environment for Endogenous Price Formation and Execution in a Limit Order Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ABIDES-MARL, a framework that combines a new multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methodology with a new realistic limit-order-book (LOB) simulation system to study equilibrium behavior in complex financial market games. The system extends ABIDES-Gym by decoupling state collection from kernel interruption, enabling synchronized learning and decision-making for multiple adaptive agents while maintaining compatibility with standard RL libraries. It preserves key market features such as price-time priority and discrete tick sizes. Methodologically, we use MARL to approximate equilibrium-like behavior in multi-period trading games with a finite number of heterogeneous agents-an informed trader, a liquidity trader, noise traders, and competing market makers-all with individual price impacts. This setting bridges optimal execution and market microstructure by embedding the liquidity trader's optimization problem within a strategic trading environment. We validate the approach by solving an extended Kyle model within the simulation system, recovering the gradual price discovery phenomenon. We then extend the analysis to a liquidity trader's problem where market liquidity arises endogenously and show that, at equilibrium, execution strategies shape market-maker behavior and price dynamics. ABIDES-MARL provides a reproducible foundation for analyzing equilibrium and strategic adaptation in realistic markets and contributes toward building economically interpretable agentic AI systems for finance.</description>

      <title>JaxMARL-HFT: GPU-Accelerated Large-Scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for High-Frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based modelling (ABM) approaches for high-frequency financial markets are difficult to calibrate and validate, partly due to the large parameter space created by defining fixed agent policies. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) enables more realistic agent behaviour and reduces the number of free parameters, but the heavy computational cost has so far limited research efforts. To address this, we introduce JaxMARL-HFT (JAX-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for High-Frequency Trading), the first GPU-accelerated open-source multi-agent reinforcement learning environment for high-frequency trading (HFT) on market-by-order (MBO) data. Extending the JaxMARL framework and building on the JAX-LOB implementation, JaxMARL-HFT is designed to handle a heterogeneous set of agents, enabling diverse observation/action spaces and reward functions. It is designed flexibly, so it can also be used for single-agent RL, or extended to act as an ABM with fixed-policy agents. Leveraging JAX enables up to a 240x reduction in end-to-end training time, compared with state-of-the-art reference implementations on the same hardware. This significant speed-up makes it feasible to exploit the large, granular datasets available in high-frequency trading, and to perform the extensive hyperparameter sweeps required for robust and efficient MARL research in trading. We demonstrate the use of JaxMARL-HFT with independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) for a two-player environment, with an order execution and a market making agent, using one year of LOB data (400 million orders), and show that these agents learn to outperform standard benchmarks. The code for the JaxMARL-HFT framework is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Census-Based Population Autonomy For Distributed Robotic Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborating teams of robots show promise due in their ability to complete missions more efficiently and with improved robustness, attributes that are particularly useful for systems operating in marine environments. A key issue is how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the full benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of multi-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This paper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the principle of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for collective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior optimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component is expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective behavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model can be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization and control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors that are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new method for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where robots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost functions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states from neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group can collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the total global cost. The utility of this model is experimentally validated in three categorically different experiments with fleets of autonomous surface vehicles: an adaptive sampling scenario, a high value unit protection scenario, and a competitive game of capture the flag.</description>

      <title>Modeling Hawkish-Dovish Latent Beliefs in Multi-Agent Debate-Based LLMs for Monetary Policy Decision Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting central bank policy decisions, particularly those of the Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC) has become increasingly important amid heightened economic uncertainty. While prior studies have used monetary policy texts to predict rate changes, most rely on static classification models that overlook the deliberative nature of policymaking. This study proposes a novel framework that structurally imitates the FOMC's collective decision-making process by modeling multiple large language models(LLMs) as interacting agents. Each agent begins with a distinct initial belief and produces a prediction based on both qualitative policy texts and quantitative macroeconomic indicators. Through iterative rounds, agents revise their predictions by observing the outputs of others, simulating deliberation and consensus formation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a latent variable representing each agent's underlying belief(e.g., hawkish or dovish), and we theoretically demonstrate how this belief mediates the perception of input information and interaction dynamics. Empirical results show that this debate-based approach significantly outperforms standard LLMs-based baselines in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit modeling of beliefs provides insights into how individual perspectives and social influence shape collective policy forecasts.</description>

      <title>From Solo to Symphony: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Collaboration with Single-Agent Demos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g., collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data, making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.</description>

      <title>When One Modality Sabotages the Others: A Diagnostic Lens on Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations. More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing possible interventions.</description>

Abstract: Picker-to-parts pallet warehouses often face inefficiencies due to conventional layouts causing excessive travel distances and high labor requirements. This study introduces a novel layout design inspired by CPU architecture, partitioning warehouse space into specialized zones, namely Performance (P), Efficiency (E), and Shared (S). Discrete-event simulation is used to evaluate this design against traditional rectangular (random and ABC storage) and Flying-V layouts. Results demonstrate significant improvements in throughput time and reduced labor requirements, highlighting the potential for CPU-based layouts in optimizing warehouse operations.</description>

      <title>When Is Diversity Rewarded in Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing on multi-agent task allocation problems, we study this question from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$ task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneity Gain Parameter Search (HetGPS), a gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous. Across different environments, we show that HetGPS rediscovers the reward regimes predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both validating HetGPS and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity delivers a measurable benefit.</description>

      <title>Strategic Communication and Language Bias in Multi-Agent LLM Coordination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in multi-agent scenarios where coordination is crucial but not always assured. Research shows that the way strategic scenarios are framed linguistically can affect cooperation. This paper explores whether allowing agents to communicate amplifies these language-driven effects. Leveraging FAIRGAME, we simulate one-shot and repeated games across different languages and models, both with and without communication. Our experiments, conducted with two advanced LLMs-GPT-4o and Llama 4 Maverick-reveal that communication significantly influences agent behavior, though its impact varies by language, personality, and game structure. These findings underscore the dual role of communication in fostering coordination and reinforcing biases.</description>

      <title>Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordinating workflows across complex systems remains a central challenge in safety-critical environments such as scientific facilities. Language-model-driven agents offer a natural interface for these tasks, but existing approaches often lack scalability, reliability, and human oversight. We introduce the Osprey Framework, a domain-agnostic, production-ready architecture for scalable agentic systems that integrate conversational context with robust tool orchestration across safety-critical domains. Our framework provides: (i) dynamic capability classification to select only relevant tools; (ii) plan-first orchestration with explicit dependencies and optional human approval; (iii) context-aware task extraction that combines dialogue history with external memory and domain resources; and (iv) production-ready execution with checkpointing, artifact management, and modular deployment. We demonstrate its versatility through two case studies: a deployment at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator and a tutorial-style wind farm monitoring example. These results establish Osprey as a reliable and transparent framework for agentic systems across diverse high-stakes domains.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Mapping of the Douro River Plume with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.</description>

      <title>I Want to Break Free! Persuasion and Anti-Social Behavior of LLMs in Multi-Agent Settings with Social Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As LLM-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying the interplay among them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the interactions among agents within a simulated hierarchical social environment, drawing inspiration from the Stanford Prison Experiment. Leveraging 2,400 conversations across six LLMs (i.e., LLama3, Orca2, Command-r, Mixtral, Mistral2, and gpt4.1) and 240 experimental scenarios, we analyze persuasion and anti-social behavior between a guard and a prisoner agent with differing objectives. We first document model-specific conversational failures in this multi-agent power dynamic context, thereby narrowing our analytic sample to 1,600 conversations. Among models demonstrating successful interaction, we find that goal setting significantly influences persuasiveness but not anti-social behavior. Moreover, agent personas, especially the guard's, substantially impact both successful persuasion by the prisoner and the manifestation of anti-social actions. Notably, we observe the emergence of anti-social conduct even in absence of explicit negative personality prompts. These results have important implications for the development of interactive LLM agents and the ongoing discussion of their societal impact.</description>

      <title>H-NeiFi: Non-Invasive and Consensus-Efficient Multi-Agent Opinion Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus. Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus. Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework, H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles, considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts. Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0% to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.</description>

      <title>Co-Evolving Complexity: An Adversarial Framework for Automatic MARL Curricula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement of general-purpose intelligent agents is intrinsically linked to the environments in which they are trained. While scaling models and datasets has yielded remarkable capabilities, scaling the complexity, diversity, and interactivity of environments remains a crucial bottleneck. Hand-crafted environments are finite and often contain implicit biases, limiting the potential for agents to develop truly generalizable and robust skills. In this work, we propose a paradigm for generating a boundless and adaptive curriculum of challenges by framing the environment generation process as an adversarial game. We introduce a system where a team of cooperative multi-agent defenders learns to survive against a procedurally generative attacker. The attacker agent learns to produce increasingly challenging configurations of enemy units, dynamically creating novel worlds tailored to exploit the defenders' current weaknesses. Concurrently, the defender team learns cooperative strategies to overcome these generated threats. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates a self-scaling environment where complexity arises organically from the adversarial interaction, providing an effectively infinite stream of novel and relevant training data. We demonstrate that with minimal training, this approach leads to the emergence of complex, intelligent behaviors, such as flanking and shielding by the attacker, and focus-fire and spreading by the defenders. Our findings suggest that adversarial co-evolution is a powerful mechanism for automatically scaling environmental complexity, driving agents towards greater robustness and strategic depth.</description>

      <title>Generative World Models of Tasks: LLM-Driven Hierarchical Scaffolding for Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in agent development have focused on scaling model size and raw interaction data, mirroring successes in large language models. However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. We propose that an effective world model for decision-making must model the world's physics and also its task semantics. A systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer reveals a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We formalize this trend into a framework for Hierarchical Task Environments (HTEs), which are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. Our framework incorporates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as generative world models of tasks, capable of dynamically generating this scaffolding. We argue that HTEs provide a mechanism to guide exploration, generate meaningful learning signals, and train agents to internalize hierarchical structure, enabling the development of more capable and general-purpose agents with greater sample efficiency than purely end-to-end approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Tongyi DeepResearch, an agentic large language model, which is specifically designed for long-horizon, deep information-seeking research tasks. To incentivize autonomous deep research agency, Tongyi DeepResearch is developed through an end-to-end training framework that combines agentic mid-training and agentic post-training, enabling scalable reasoning and information seeking across complex tasks. We design a highly scalable data synthesis pipeline that is fully automatic, without relying on costly human annotation, and empowers all training stages. By constructing customized environments for each stage, our system enables stable and consistent interactions throughout. Tongyi DeepResearch, featuring 30.5 billion total parameters, with only 3.3 billion activated per token, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of agentic deep research benchmarks, including Humanity's Last Exam, BrowseComp, BrowseComp-ZH, WebWalkerQA, xbench-DeepSearch, FRAMES and xbench-DeepSearch-2510. We open-source the model, framework, and complete solutions to empower the community.</description>
