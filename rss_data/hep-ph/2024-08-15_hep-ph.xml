      <title>Photon Leading Twist Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have calculated the photon leading-twist T-even transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). For these calculations, we have treated photon as a state of quark anti-quark pair and represent the TMDs in explicit form of helicity amplitudes. We have presented all the T-even TMDs for the photon being massless (real) and massive (virtual). We have also compared our longitudinally and transversely polarized TMDs results for different photon masses. The collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) have been predicted for both the real and virtual photon cases. The results for the unpolarized PDF of our calculations are in good agreement with other model predictions. In addition to this, we have also discussed the spin-spin correlations between the quark and photon.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of excited quarkonium states in the light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the ground state ($1S$), radially excited states ($2S$) and ($3S$) along with the orbitally excited state ($1P$) for the heavy charmonia ($c \bar c$) and bottomonia ($b \bar b$) mesons in the light-front quark model (LFQM). The light-front wave functions have been successful in explaining various physical properties of meson states in the past, especially for the $1S$ and $2S$ states. However, studies regarding the radially excited state $3S$ and orbitally excited state $1P$ have hardly been pursued before. In this study, we take up these two excited states and investigate the electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs), charge radii, decay constants, parton distribution functions (PDFs) and the distribution amplitudes (DAs) for the quarkonia system. For the sake of completeness, we have also included the study of the ground and the first excited states of quarkonia mesons. We have also illustrated the 3D wave functions for the radially excited states in order to study their nodal structures.</description>

      <title>Unraveling sub-leading twist GTMDs of proton using LFQDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the sub-leading twist generalized transverse momentum dependent distributions (GTMDs) of a proton within the light-front quark-diquark model (LFQDM) framework. We solve the parametrization equations for the Dirac matrix structure to yield the explicit GTMD expressions for scalar as well as vector diquark configurations for active $u$ and $d$ quarks. This analysis addresses the multi-dimensional nature of GTMDs by exploring their dependencies on one or two variables while keeping others fixed. Additionally, we extract transverse momentum dependent form factors (TMFFs) from GTMDs by integrating over the longitudinal momentum fraction $x$. The study uses $3$-dimensional plots to illustrate the variation of TMFFs with the quark's transverse momentum $p_{\perp}$ and the transverse momentum transfer to the proton $\Delta_{\perp}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the unpolarized valence quark generalized parton distribution functions (GPDs) and parton distribution functions (PDFs) for heavy spin-$0$, $B$- and $D$-mesons in the light-front quark model (LFQM). PDFs have been extracted from unpolarized $f_1(x,\textbf{k}^2_{\perp})$ transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). We have solved the quark-quark correlation function to have an unpolarized $H(x,\zeta,t)$ GPD. The unpolarized GPDs at zero skewness ($\zeta=0$) lead to describing the electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) ($F_M(t)$) and gravitational form factors (GFFs)($A_M(t)$) of the mesons.</description>

      <title>Constraining light QCD axions with isolated neutron star cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of lighter-than-expected QCD axions can lead to a new ground state of matter, where the sourced axion field reduces the nucleon effective mass. The presence of the axion field has structural consequences, in particular, it results in a thinner (or even prevents its existence) heat-blanketing envelope, significantly altering the cooling patterns of neutron stars. We exploit the anomalous cooling behavior to constrain previously uncharted regions of the axion parameter space by comparing model predictions with existing data from isolated neutron stars. Notably, this analysis does not require the lighter-than-expected QCD axion to be the dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Sub-MeV Dark Sink Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Dark Sink uses dark-sector interactions to siphon energy from dark matter to lighter dark degrees of freedom, i.e. dark radiation. Here, we extend dark matter models containing a Dark Sink to sub-MeV masses. We consider a Dark Sink model where the dark matter is charged under a light dark photon that has kinetic mixing with the Standard Model. For sub-MeV dark matter masses, plasmon decays are the dominant mechanism for transferring energy to the dark sector. Relative to a standard freeze-in cosmology, reproducing the observed dark matter density in a Dark Sink structure requires an increase in the dark matter couplings to the Standard Model, and hence increased direct detection cross sections. These models provide benchmarks for current and upcoming direct detection experiments. Accounting for plasmon effects, we derive the range of possible dark matter masses and cross sections for Dark Sink models in the sub-MeV regime. We make code available to reproduce our benchmarks; it may be of use for other freeze-in scenarios, including those where plasmon decays to the dark matter are important.</description>

      <title>No Warm Inflation From Sphaleron Heating With a Vanilla Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At finite temperature, the coupling of an axion to non-Abelian gauge fields causes dissipation due to sphaleron heating. This mechanism is ideally suited for realizing warm inflation since it can lead to large thermal friction while preserving the flatness of the potential. We show, however, that requiring standard properties of an axion $-$ in particular a discrete shift symmetry and a potential generated non-perturbatively by instanton effects $-$ excludes the strong regime of warm slow-roll inflation, in which thermal friction dominates. The derivation of this result does not require any phenomenological input. While non-minimal (axion-like) models provide a way out, sphaleron heating with a standard axion is capable of enabling the weak regime of warm inflation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Hidden Valley at MATHUSLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden valley models naturally predict numerous long-lived particles, the distinctive signatures of which would be compelling evidence for a hidden valley scenario. As these are typically low energy particles, they pose a challenge in terms of passing energy triggers in traditional searches at the Large Hadron Collider. The MATHUSLA experiment is specifically designed for the purpose of detecting long-lived particles. It also has the capability of detecting lower energy particles relative to ATLAS and CMS. In this paper, we assess MATHUSLA's potential for effectively probing hidden valley models. As a benchmark, we assume the hidden valley sector communicates with Standard Model sectors via a heavy vector propagator that couples to Standard Model quarks as well as hidden valley quarks. We model the showering and hadronization in the hidden valley sector using PYTHIA, and study the detector acceptance as a function of the hidden valley meson's lifetime. We find that MATHUSLA possesses significant capabilities to explore previously uncharted parameter space within hidden valley models.</description>

      <title>Collision Energy Dependence of Particle Ratios and Freeze-out Parameters in Ultra Relativistic Nucleus Nucleus Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates how the theoretically calculated particle ratios and freeze-out parameters for a multi-component hot and dense non-ideal hadron resonance gas system, formed during the pre freeze-out stage in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions, are affected by van der Waals type interactions, incorporating both repulsive and attractive interactions among hadrons. The baryons (antibaryons) are treated as hard incompressible objects. Using this theoretical approach, we analyze experimental particle ratios involving like-mass as well as unlike-mass hadrons. We also try to understand the existence of horn-like structures seen in the ratios of strange particles to pion as a function of the collision energy. Using information about the dependence of experimental particle ratios on $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ over a wide range of collision energies, we have extracted several model freeze-out parameters and examined their dependence on $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ The correlation between the $\bar{p}/p$ and $K^-/K^+$ ratios is also examined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we calculate the mixing angles between the axial-vector mesons $^{3}P_1$ and $^{1}P_1$, specifically $D_{1(s1)} - D_{1(s1)}'$ and $B_{1(s1)} - B_{1(s1)}'$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. Our results for the mixing angles are smaller than those predicted by the Bethe-Salpeter, relativistic and non-relativistic quark models. These angles can be measured by analyzing various decay channels at experiments conducted at BELLE II, and LHCb.</description>

      <title>New renormalization scheme in the two Higgs doublet models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new renormalization scheme in the two Higgs doublet models with a softly-broken $Z_2$ symmetry and CP-conservation in the Higgs sector. In this scheme, counterterms for mixing angles of the Higgs bosons are determined by using the decay rates of the discovered Higgs boson $h$, $i.e.$, $h \to \tau^+\tau^-$ and $h \to ZZ^* \to Z\ell^+\ell^-$ at next leading order (NLO) instead of using the renormalized two-point functions which are adopted in the previous scheme. We require that the decay rates at NLO are determined to be the corresponding predictions at NLO in the Standard Model (SM) times square of the scaling factor which describes the deviation of $h$ couplings at tree level from the SM value. The mixing angles then maintain the meaning of the ``alignmentness", $i.e.$, how the properties of $h$ are close to the SM predictions, while they lose such meaning in the previous scheme. We compare the predictions of the decay rates at NLO given in the new scheme and those in the previous scheme.</description>

      <title>Double and Triple Higgs Production to probe the Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of three Higgs bosons could be a stretch goal for the LHC and a strategic case for future colliders. In this work, we analyse the phenomenological prospects of (neutral) triple Higgs compared to di-Higgs boson production, for a range of Higgs-sector extensions from a strong first-order electroweak phase transition perspective. In parallel, we include constraints from existing exotics and Higgs boson measurements that further limit the parameter space of such models. Resonance contributions offer large modifications in particular for triple Higgs production, albeit starting from a small SM expectation. With enhancements of order 40 over the SM, however, experimental efforts to obtain limits at the HL-LHC are well-motivated and well-placed. This is further highlighted by the potential of these processes to inform the investigation of the thermal history of our universe.</description>

      <title>Multi-Jet Merging in Deep Inelastic Scattering with Pythia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to improve the modelling of deep inelastic scattering by implementing multi-jet merging capabilities in Vincia parton shower in the general-purpose Monte Carlo event generator, Pythia. Merging allows to combine event samples of different parton multiplicities with logarithmically enhanced radiation from parton shower algorithms, without double-counting. Here we consider events up to five outgoing partons and present results for jet analyses compared to experimental data provided by the ZEUS and H1 collaborations of the HERA collider. The analyses span a wide range in photon virtuality, and the results show that the multi-jet merging improves jet modelling especially for low virtuality events.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference analysis of jet quenching using inclusive jet and hadron suppression measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JETSCAPE Collaboration reports a new determination of the jet transport parameter $\hat{q}$ in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) using Bayesian Inference, incorporating all available inclusive hadron and jet yield suppression data measured in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. This multi-observable analysis extends the previously published JETSCAPE Bayesian Inference determination of $\hat{q}$, which was based solely on a selection of inclusive hadron suppression data. JETSCAPE is a modular framework incorporating detailed dynamical models of QGP formation and evolution, and jet propagation and interaction in the QGP. Virtuality-dependent partonic energy loss in the QGP is modeled as a thermalized weakly-coupled plasma, with parameters determined from Bayesian calibration using soft-sector observables. This Bayesian calibration of $\hat{q}$ utilizes Active Learning, a machine--learning approach, for efficient exploitation of computing resources. The experimental data included in this analysis span a broad range in collision energy and centrality, and in transverse momentum. In order to explore the systematic dependence of the extracted parameter posterior distributions, several different calibrations are reported, based on combined jet and hadron data; on jet or hadron data separately; and on restricted kinematic or centrality ranges of the jet and hadron data. Tension is observed in comparison of these variations, providing new insights into the physics of jet transport in the QGP and its theoretical formulation.</description>

      <title>Photon Frequency Conversion in High-$Q$ Superconducting Resonators: Axion Electrodynamics, QED &amp; Nonlinear Meissner Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Q superconducting resonators have been proposed and developed as detectors of light-by-light scattering mediated by the hypothesized axion or virtual electron-positron pairs in quantum electrodynamics - the Euler-Heisenberg (EH) interaction. Photon frequency and mode conversion is central to the scheme for detecting such rare events. Superconducting resonators are nonlinear devices. The Meissner screening currents that confine the electromagnetic fields to the vacuum region of a superconducting RF cavity are nonlinear functions of the EM field at the vacuum-superconducting interface, and as a result can generate source currents and frequency conversion of microwave photons in the cavity. In this report we consider photon frequency and mode conversion in superconducting resonators with high quality factors from Meissner currents in single and dual cavity setups proposed for axion and QED searches based on light-by-light scattering. In a single cavity with two pump modes photon frequency conversion by the Meissner screening current dominates photon generation by the EH interaction for cavities with $Q \lesssim 10^{12}$. The Meissner currents also generate background photons that limits the operation of the resonator for axion detection in three-mode, single cavity setups. We also consider the leakage of photons from pump modes into the signal mode for both axion and EH mediated light-by-light scattering. Photon frequency conversion by the EH interaction can compete with Meissner and leakage radiation in \emph{ultra-high-Q} cavities that are beyond current state of the art. Meissner radiation and leakage backgrounds can be suppressed in dual cavity setups with appropriate choices for pump and spectator modes, as well as the single-cavity setup proposed for heterodyne detection of galactic axion dark matter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of scalar fluctuations ($\chi$) non-minimally coupled to gravity, $\xi\chi^2 R$, as a potential source of secondary gravitational waves (SGWs). Our study reveals that when reheating EoS $\wre &gt; 1/3$ and $\xi \gtrsim 1/6$, the super-horizon modes of scalar field experience a \textit{Tachyonic instability} during the reheating phase. Particularly for $\xi &gt;1$ such instability causes substantial growth in the scalar field amplitude leading to pronounced production of SGWs in an intermediate-frequency range that is strong enough to be detected by future gravitational wave detectors. Such growth in super-horizon modes of the scalar field and associated GW production may have a significant effect on the strength of the tensor fluctuation at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales (parametrized by $r$) and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (parametrized by $\dneff$) at the time of CMB decoupling. To prevent such overproduction, the PLANCK constraints on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \leq 0.036$ and $\dneff \leq 0.284$ yield a strong upper bound on the value of $\xi$ depending upon the value of $\wre$ and reheating temperature $\Tre$. Taking into account all the observational constraints we found the value of $\xi$ should be $ \lesssim 4.0$ for any value of reheating temperature within $10^{-2} \lesssim \Tre \lesssim 10^{14}$ GeV, reheating equation of state within $ 1/2 \leq\wre \leq 1$, and for a wide range of inflationary energy scales. However, for $\wre &lt; 1/3$, $\xi$ is found to be unconstrained by any known observation. Finally, we identify the parameter regions in $(\Tre,\xi)$ plane which can be probed by the upcoming GW experiments namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Collective behaviour in proton number fluctuations seen in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 2.4 GeV Au+Au collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At energies of a few GeV per nucleon, nuclear collisions exhibit phenomena more complex than the individualistic nucleon interactions observed at much higher energies. From recent results on proton number fluctuations in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4$~GeV obtained by the HADES experiment at GSI, we suggest that measuring the multiplicity distributions heavy-ion collisions can be used to probe density fluctuations associated with correlation phenomena. By using the combinant analysis, one can obtain new information contained in them and otherwise unavailable, which may broaden our knowledge of the particle interactions mechanism.</description>

      <title>Hadron masses from a Kaluza-Klein like Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04292v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to calculate the masses of hadrons without orbital momentum. It is hypothized the Kaluza-Klein like model does deliver results in particle physics complementing those of the Standard Model of particle physics. For this paper a Kaluza-Klein like model was developed based on the structure of the Standard Model. The model consists of 10 dimensions which are: one time, three usual macroscopic space and six compactified dimensions. Excitations - disturbances traveling with the speed of light on the 10D-spacetime - are introduced. An excitation on a compactified dimension can induce a mass in 4D-spacetime; it is accompanied by an integer, the excitation number, and has a well-defined spin. The model's parameters are determined using electron's g-factor and the measured masses of the charged leptons, the proton, the neutron, the mesons $\pi^{+}, \phi, \psi, \Upsilon$. So far, exact formulas for calculating hadron masses were not derived. The approximate formulas, however, are reported and applied to about one hundred composite particles, which are compiled within four separate tables. The comparison between the measured masses of 64 hadrons and the approximations shows relative errors below $0.05$ for 55\% and below $0.1$ in 81\% of all cases. Pearson's correlation coefficient of masses measured versus calculated is $r=0.998$. The results of another 36 hadron masses, not yet experimentally determined, are stated. For a better assessment of the presented model's validity, and in addition to the paper's original purpose, the strong, electric, and weak forces were calculated. These forces together with other derived parameters are discussed and compared with measurements or values from the standard model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Determining the $CP$ Property of $ht\bar{t}$ Coupling via a Novel Jet Substructure Observable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the $CP$ property of the Higgs boson is important for a precision test of the Standard Model as well as for the search for new physics. We propose a novel jet substructure observable based on the azimuthal anisotropy in a linearly polarized gluon jet that is produced in association with a Higgs boson at hadron colliders, and demonstrate that it provides a new $CP$-odd observable for determining the $CP$ property of the Higgs-top interaction. We introduce a factorization formalism to define a polarized gluon jet function with the insertion of an infrared-safe azimuthal observable to capture the linear polarization.</description>

      <title>$K^\pm\to\pi^\pm a$ at Next-to-Leading Order in Chiral Perturbation Theory and Updated Bounds on ALP Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak decays $K^\pm\to\pi^\pm a$ offer a powerful probe of axion-like particles (ALPs). In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of these processes within chiral perturbation theory, extending existing calculations by including complete next-to-leading order (NLO) contributions and isospin-breaking corrections at first order in $(m_d-m_u)$. We show that the consistent incorporation of ALPs in the QCD and weak chiral Lagrangians requires a non-trivial extension of the corresponding operator bases, which we describe in detail. Furthermore, we show that in the presence of an ALP the so-called ``weak mass term'', which is unobservable in the Standard Model, is non-redundant already at leading order. We find that NLO corrections associated with flavor-violating ALP couplings modify the leading-order result by a few percent, with negligible uncertainties. NLO corrections proportional to flavor-conserving ALP couplings lead to potentially larger corrections, which, however, are accompanied by sizable uncertainties mainly due to the currently limited knowledge of various low-energy constants. We study how these corrections impact bounds on the ALP couplings, first model independently, and then specializing to the case of an ALP with flavor-universal couplings in the UV. Our findings confirm that the decays $K^\pm\to\pi^\pm a$ provide the strongest particle-physics constraints for $m_a\lesssim 300$\,MeV. In addition, we point out that these bounds have interesting implications for the ALP couplings to nucleons, which were so far only constrained by astrophysical measurements and non-accelerator experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a method to analyze the polarization correlations of two baryons $B_{1}\bar{B}_{2}$ with various spin combinations in the annihilation process. We established spin density matrices for arbitrary spins in standard and Cartesian forms, and demonstrated their application in the helicity formalism. This paper provides parametrization schemes for the helicity amplitudes and details the analysis of two baryons with spin combinations of (1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 3/2), and (1/2, 5/2). We also illustrated methods for determining the spin and parity of the excited baryon $\bar{\Xi}^{*+}$ using the $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \gamma^*/\psi \rightarrow \Xi^{-}\bar{\Xi}^{*+}$ process as an example. Our research offers broad opportunities for exploring the baryon spectrum and transition form factors in electron-positron annihilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the General Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (GNMSSM), singlet particles may form a secluded sector of dark matter (DM), in which Singlino-like DM could achieve the observed relic abundance through various channels such as $\tilde{\chi}_1^0 \tilde{\chi}_1^0 \to h_s h_s, A_s A_s, h_s A_s$, where $h_s$ and $A_s$ represent singlet-dominated CP-even and CP-odd Higgs bosons. We provide analytical formulas for both the spin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections of Singlino DM scattering with nucleons, illustrating their dependence on the model's parameters in a clear manner. We also present analytic expressions for the annihilation cross sections of these three important channels. Based on these preparations, we conducted Bayesian analyses of the GNMSSM and concluded that the theory significantly favored Singlino-dominated DM over Bino-like DM across a much broader range of parameters. The combined results from our numerical analyses and the formulas distinctly highlight crucial aspects of DM physics within the GNMSSM.</description>

Abstract: Structure functions of the spin-1 deuteron will be investigated experimentally from the late 2020's at various facilities such as Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, nuclotron-based ion collider facility, and electron-ion colliders. We expect that a new high-energy spin-physics field could be created by these projects. In this paper, the current theoretical status is explained for the structure functions of spin-1 hadrons, especially on parton distribution functions, transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions, and fragmentation functions. Related multiparton distribution functions are also shown.</description>

      <title>Solving the strong CP problem without axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate general conditions under which the strong CP problem is solved by spontaneous CP violation. Quark-mass matrix elements are polynomials in the CP-breaking order parameters, engineered such that their determinant is a real constant. This scheme permits only a limited number of textures. These conditions can be realized in supersymmetric theories with CP as an anomaly-free local flavour symmetry, suggesting a unified solution to the strong CP problem and the flavour puzzle. Our solution can be implemented using either modular invariance or a local U(1) symmetry. We present modular-invariant realizations where matter fields are assigned small modular weights $\pm2$ ($\pm1$), utilising higher levels $N=2$ ($N=3$). Heavy quarks are in general not required, but their presence allows for models where colored particles fill non-singlet representations of the flavour group.</description>

      <title>Towards UV Models of Kinetic Mixing and Portal Matter: A More Complex Dark Matter Sector?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Portal Matter, with both SM and dark charges, induces KM between the $U(1)_D$ dark photon and the SM gauge fields offering an attractive mechanism by which light thermal DM can obtain its observed relic density. If DM is fermionic, the CMB informs us that it must be Majorana/pseudo-Dirac in nature to avoid temperature-independent $s$-wave annihilation to SM states. How does this fit into a more complete picture with the SM? A first step along this path may not lie far away in energy due to the RGE running of the dark gauge coupling which can becomes non-perturbative before the $\sim 10$'s of TeV range. This implies that $U(1)_D$ must become embedded in a non-Abelian group, $G_D$, before this occurs. The breaking of this group then produces the PM masses and the heavy gauge fields associated with $G_D$ lead to new interactions between the SM and the dark sector. In the past we have examined a set of distinctive phenomenological features associated with this setup, based upon a number of simplifying assumptions. It behooves us to explore the impact of these assumptions on the predictions for possible experimental tests of these models. In past analyses we assumed that DM is a VL, complex singlet under $G_D$. If this assumption is relaxed, the dark sector must be augmented by additional fermion(s) and the scalar fields needed to break the symmetries while generating the needed Majorana-like mass terms for the DM. Here we analyze the simplest extension of this kind wherein the DM lies in a VL doublet of $G_D$, which we take to have the structure $SU(2)_I\times U(1)_{Y_I}$, leading to new phenomenology. We find that given the current LHC search constraints on the masses of heavy gauge bosons, the production of these new dark states with large rates is unlikely at colliders unless they are produced singly in $gg$-fusion or are resonantly enhanced.</description>

      <title>Resonant conversion of axion dark radiation into terahertz electromagnetic radiation in a neutron star magnetosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the strong magnetic field of a neutron star's magnetosphere, axions coupled to electromagnetism develop a nonzero probability to convert into photons. Past studies have revealed that the axion-photon conversion can be resonantly enhanced. We recognize that the axion-photon resonance admits two parametrically distinct resonant solutions, which we call the mass-matched resonance and the Euler-Heisenberg assisted resonance. The mass-matched resonance occurs at a point in the magnetosphere where the radially-varying plasma frequency crosses the axion mass $\omega_\mathrm{pl} \approx m_a$. The Euler-Heisenberg assisted resonance occurs where the axion energy satisfies $\omega \approx (2 \omega_\mathrm{pl}^2 / 7 g_{\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma} \bar{B}^2 )^{1/2}$. This second resonance is made possible though the strong background magnetic field $\bar{B}$ as well as the nonzero Euler-Heisenberg four-photon self interaction, which has the coupling $g_{\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma} = 8 \alpha^2 / 45 m_e^4$. We study the resonant conversion of relativistic axion dark radiation into photons via the Euler-Heisenberg assisted resonance, and we calculate the expected electromagnetic radiation assuming different values for the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ and different amplitudes for the axion flux onto the neutron star $\Phi_a$. We briefly discuss several possible sources of axion dark radiation. Achieving a sufficiently strong axion flux to induce a detectable electromagnetic signal seems unlikely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel model of charged leptons is presented, which contains two basics hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that the Yukawa coupling between Higgs field and charged leptons is the weak interaction, the Higgs field is a scalar intermediate boson which changes the chirality of charged leptons in the weak interaction. The other hypothesis is that the flavor eigenstates of charged leptons are the superposition states of left-handed and right-handed elementary Weyl spinors before the electroweak symmetry breaking. According to this model, the Yukawa coupling constants between Higgs field and three generations of charged leptons are considered to be a universal constant, and the difference of the masses of different charged leptons is due to the different left-right mixing angles of their flavor eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Scaffolded Gluons and the Combinatorial Origins of Yang-Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new formulation for Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes in any number of dimensions and at any loop order, based on the same combinatorial and binary-geometric ideas in kinematic space recently used to give an all-order description of Tr $\phi^3$ theory. We propose that in a precise sense the amplitudes for a suitably "stringy" form of these two theories are identical, up to a simple shift of kinematic variables. This connection is made possible by describing the amplitudes for $n$ gluons via a "scalar scaffolding", arising from the scattering of $2n$ colored scalars coming in $n$ distinct pairs of flavors fusing to produce the gluons. Fundamental properties of the "$u$-variables", describing the "binary geometry" for surfaces appearing in the topological expansion, magically guarantee that the kinematically shifted Tr $\phi^3$ amplitudes satisfy the physical properties needed to be interpreted as scaffolded gluons. These include multilinearity, gauge invariance, and factorization on tree- and loop- level gluon cuts. Our "stringy" scaffolded gluon amplitudes coincide with amplitudes in the bosonic string for extra-dimensional gluon polarizations at tree-level, but differ (and are simpler) at loop-level. We provide many checks on our proposal, including matching non-trivial leading singularities through two loops. The simple counting problem underlying the $u$ variables autonomously "knows" about everything needed to convert colored scalar to gluon amplitudes, exposing a striking "discovery" of Yang-Mills amplitudes from elementary combinatorial ideas in kinematic space.</description>

      <title>Neutrino quantum kinetics in a core-collapse supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of neutrino flavor conversion in the supernova core is still preliminary, despite its likely relevance to the neutrino-driven supernova mechanism. We present multi-angle and multi-energy numerical simulations of neutrino quantum kinetics within a spherically symmetric shell in the proximity of the region of neutrino decoupling. We rely on inputs from a one-dimensional core-collapse supernova model with a mass of $18.6\ M_\odot$ and find that, at early post-bounce times ($t_{\mathrm pb} \lesssim 0.5$~s), no crossing is present in the angular distribution of the electron neutrino lepton number and flavor conversion is triggered by slow collective instabilities. Angular crossings appear for $t_{\textrm{pb}} \gtrsim 0.5$~s and fast flavor conversion leads to flavor equipartition, with the spectral energy distribution of $\nu_{e}$ ($\bar{\nu}_{e}$) and $\nu_{x}$ ($\bar{\nu}_{x}$) becoming comparable. Notably, flavor equipartition is not a generic outcome of fast flavor conversion, rather it is a consequence of the relatively similar properties of neutrinos of different flavors characterizing the late accretion phase. Artificially tweaking the collision term to introduce an electron lepton number angular crossing for $t_{\mathrm{pb}} \lesssim 0.05$~s, we observe that flavor equipartition is not achieved. While our findings are restricted to a specific supernova model, and they only take into account the feedback of the neutrino background on the flavor conversion, they suggest a rich phenomenology in the supernova core as a function of the post-bounce time which needs to be further explored to assess its impact on the explosion mechanism.</description>
