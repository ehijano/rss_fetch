      <title>Interaction of domain walls with scalar particles in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of solitons (such as closed domain walls) in the super-Early Universe is predicted in a number of theories of the formation of primordial black holes. However, the interaction of particles of the surrounding medium with the solitons should affect their dynamics. In the paper, we consider the interaction between domain walls and scalar particles which can play a role of dark matter. It is shown that when the temperature of the scalar particle gas, caused by the expansion of the Universe, decreases below a certain threshold value, the wall abruptly becomes opaque and locks particles inside itself. We discuss the dynamics of a single domain wall taking into account pressure of scalar particles locked inside a closed wall. It is shown, this effect leads to a time delay of domain wall collapse and the deferred formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>How black hole mimickers and Shapiro-free lenses signal effective dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the existence of two exotic compact objects in the leading relativistic model of modified Newtonian dynamics, namely aether-scalar-tensor theory. This model is consistent with precision cosmology and gravitational wave constraints on tensor speed. Black hole mimickers could subtly change observations: gravitational waves from their mergers might show unusual echoes or altered ringdown patterns, and images of their horizon-scale shadows might be slightly different from those of a true black hole. Shapiro-free lenses are massless objects that deflect light without any gravitational time delay, producing distinctive lensing events. These predictions connect to ongoing and future gravitational-wave searches, horizon-scale imaging, and time-domain lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>PyGRO: a Python Integrator for General Relativistic Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancement in recent years in the field of experimental gravitation has allowed to test the equivalence principle in regimes that were previously unexplored, allowing for unprecedented verifications of general relativity and also enabling tests of alternative theories of gravity. We introduce a new computational tool, PyGRO, with the aim of integrating numerically the geodesic equations for the trajectories of massive and massless test particles in any analytic four-dimensional space-time. The result is a modern, fast, open-source, highly customizable and user-friendly Python package to perform the numerical integration of the the geodesic equations. Combining symbolic and numerical calculations, PyGRO offers a variety of methods to obtain fully relativistic orbits with minimal intervention by the user, working in full generality with any user-given symbolic expression of the space-time metric tensor. We have tested PyGRO in an array of different scenarios, validating the methodology employed by successfully reproducing classical results from general relativity, which we report in this article.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves constraints of the effective gravitational coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy allows to derive a consistency relation (CR) between the effective gravitational constant, the gravitational and electromagnetic luminosity (EM) distance and the speed of gravitational waves (GW), in agreement with the results obtained in some luminal modified gravity theories. We test the CR by comparing the constraints obtained from large scale structure (LSS) observations with those from GW events with and without electromagnetic counterparts, confirming the validity of the CR at the current level of experimental uncertainty. The GW event GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart provides a constraint of the effective gravitational constant with an accuracy comparable with LSS constraints, while the analysis of GW events without electromagnetic counterpart are consistent, but do not have a constraining power comparable to LSS observations.</description>

      <title>Holographic cosmology with logarithmic equation of state based on a new generalized entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological application of a dark viscous fluid in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe with a modified logarithmic equation of state (EoS), being an analogue of the equation associated with the isotropic deformation of crystalline solids, is explored. This formalism represents a class of the so-called logotropic fluids, and allows explaining an accelerating late-time universe. Our research is based on a new generalized entropy function proposed by Nojiri-Odintsov-Faraoni [1]. We consider entropic cosmology and describe the evolution of the late time universe in the presence of dark matter coupled with viscous dark energy. In order to obtain a more detailed picture of its evolution, we add in our model a coupling of the log-corrected power-law fluid with dark matter, and study various interacting forms between them. We solve the system of dynamic equations for viscous dark fluid coupled with dark matter and obtain expressions for the log-corrected power-law dark energy density, and the energy density for dark matter. The research results are presented in holographic form in terms of generalized holographic cut-offs introduced by Nojiri and Odintsov [2, 3]. In the asymptotic case an expression for the Hubble function, and the energy density for dark matter in the entropic cosmology, are obtained.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantum Speed Limit and Entanglement in Flavor Oscillations of Neutrino-Antineutrino System in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates (KSP). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time (QSLT) bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</description>

      <title>Growth of a Black Hole in a Scalar Field Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical relativity study of the accretion properties of a non-spinning black hole in a cosmology driven by a scalar field. The simulations are carried out with a modified moving-puncture gauge condition suitable for cosmological space-times. We considered a scalar field with potential $ V=\lambda \,\varphi^4/4$ and derived the black hole mass growth formula for this scenario using the dynamical horizon framework. As with perturbative studies, we find that the accretion rate $\dot M \propto M^2$ with $M$ the mass of the black hole, and that $\dot M \propto \dot\varphi^2$. We verify that the results of the simulations satisfy the mass growth formula. Unexpectedly, the dynamics of the scalar field in the neighborhood of the black hole is not significantly different from the behavior of the field far away from the hole. We found situations in which the black hole can growth $\sim 15\%$ of its initial mass before the scalar field reaches the bottom of its potential.</description>

      <title>Horizon-Driven Expansion from Hawking-Like Radiation: A Curvature-Coupled Cosmological Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a cosmological model in which the expansion of the universe is driven by a Hawking-like influx of energy across the cosmological horizon, rather than from a fixed cosmological constant. In place of a cosmological constant, we introduce source terms in the Friedmann and continuity equations that couple horizon curvature to matter and radiation densities. At high curvature (large Hubble parameter $H$), this influx strongly replenishes matter and radiation, slowing their adiabatic dilution. As curvature diminishes, the influx weakens, smoothly transitioning into standard radiation- or matter-dominated eras. This mechanism naturally suppresses spatial curvature without requiring an inflationary phase. It may also produce near-scale-invariant fluctuations via slowly varying horizon thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Dark Phases in Scalar Particles within the Schwarzschild-Kiselev-Letelier Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the emergence of dark phases (dark energy imprints) in the radial wave function of scalar particles. We achieve this by presenting novel solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in a spherically symmetric spacetime, encompassing a black hole, a quintessential fluid, and a cloud of strings. We determine the exact solution for the spacetime metric, analyze the admissible ranges for its physical parameters, and discuss the event horizon formation. Subsequently, we detail the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation and explore three distinct cases of dark phases, corresponding to the quintessence state parameter $\alpha_{Q}$ taking the values $0$, $1/2$, and $1$. Notably, the case where $\alpha_{Q} = 1$ holds particular significance due to current observational constraints on dark energy.</description>

      <title>Gaussian tripartite steering in Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite steering is a fundamental quantum resource that is uniquely suited to tackling complex relativistic quantum information challenges, but its properties in the gravitational field context remain to be elucidated. We study the distribution of Gaussian tripartite steering in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. Our results show that physically accessible $2\rightarrow 1$ steerability remains robust at any Hawking temperature, which contrasts with the behavior of $1\rightarrow 1$ steering that experiences ``sudden death" as the Hawking temperature increases, making $2\rightarrow 1$ steerability a more reliable candidate for relativistic quantum information tasks. Notably, we observe that the sudden death of quantum steering is accompanied by a peak in steering asymmetry, signifying a critical transition from two-way steering to one-way steering in the relativistic three-mode system. We find that the Hawking effect can generate inaccessible two-way steering of a bipartite system in both directions, as shown in [Phys. Rev. D 93, 125011 (2016)], while it can only generate physically inaccessible one-way $2\rightarrow 1$ steering in tripartite systems. These insights enhance our understanding of the redistribution of multipartite steering near the event horizon of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Solitons and singularities in relativistic ultrastiff fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical duality exists between massless scalar fields and relativistic fluids governed by an ultrastiff equation of state, in which the pressure equals the mass-energy density, and the sound speed equals $c$. This duality entails that certain solutions of the wave equation (a linear theory) can be mapped to solutions of ideal relativistic hydrodynamics (an inherently nonlinear theory). Leveraging this correspondence, we explore some interesting properties of ultrastiff fluids. Specifically, we demonstrate that all nonlinear sound waves in such media are solitons. Moreover, we prove that, in 3+1 dimensions, compactly supported configurations of an ultrastiff fluid inevitably evolve, in finite time, toward a singular state where the fluid's flow velocity exits the future lightcone. We also demonstrate that, prior to the formation of this singularity, first-order perturbation theory in the small parameter $c_s^{-2}-c^{-2}$ produces divergent results. As a consequence, a fluid whose speed of sound is, say, $0.995 c$ exhibits markedly different behavior near the singularity compared to a fluid with a speed of sound exactly equal to $c$.</description>

      <title>Radial Oscillations of the HESS J1731-347 Compact Object via the Karmarkar Condition in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the light HESS J1731-347 compact object (of known stellar mass and radius) within Einstein's General Relativity imposing the Karmarkar condition in gravity for anisotropic stars. The three free parameters of the analytic solution are determined imposing the matching conditions at the surface of the star for objects of known stellar mass and radius. Finally, using well established criteria it is shown that the solution is compatible with all requirements for well behaved and realistic solutions. Furthermore, we study the radial oscillation modes, and we compare to the ones corresponding to an isotropic star modeled by the Tolman IV exact analytic solution obtained long time ago. A comparison between the large frequency separations is made as well.</description>

      <title>Modular Channels, Thermal Filtering and the Spectral Emergence of Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the information-theoretic structure underlying causal horizons through the formalism of modular quantum channels. By analyzing the singular value decomposition of the channel induced by the partial trace over inaccessible regions, we show that the Unruh effect and the Page curve can be understood as manifestations of a universal thermal filtering mechanism governed by the modular Hamiltonian. This structure leads to a Gibbs-weighted hierarchy of information transmission modes, with entanglement entropy corresponding to spectral activation and thermal capacity.
  We reinterpret the first law of entanglement as a Clausius relation for modular flow and derive Einstein's equations by requiring its local validity across Rindler horizons. In the case of black hole evaporation, we find that the modular channel undergoes an informational phase transition at the Page time, marked by a shift from entanglement preservation to recoverability, quantified through fidelity and channel capacity.
  Based on these results, we propose the Modular Channels Flow Correspondence (MCFC): a minimal holographic principle whereby the area of a causal screen measures the storage of filtered quantum information. Our framework offers a unified operational account of holography, entropy, and curvature, grounded in the spectral dynamics of modular channels.</description>

      <title>Evolution of precessing binary black holes on eccentric orbits using orbit-averaged evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most general bound binary black hole (BBH) system has an eccentric orbit and precessing spins. The detection of such a system with significant eccentricity close to the merger would be a clear signature of dynamical formation. In order to study such systems, it is important to be able to evolve their spins and eccentricity from the larger separations at which the binary formed to the smaller separations at which it is detected, or vice versa. Knowledge of the precessional evolution of the binary's orbital angular momentum can also be used to twist up aligned-spin eccentric waveform models to create a spin-precessing eccentric waveform model. In this paper, we present a new publicly available code to evolve eccentric, precessing BBHs using orbit-averaged post-Newtonian (PN) equations from the literature. The spin-precession dynamics is 2PN accurate, i.e., with the leading spin-orbit and spin-spin corrections. The evolution of orbital parameters (orbital frequency, eccentricity, and periastron precession), which follow the quasi-Keplerian parametrization, is 3PN accurate in the point particle terms and includes the leading order spin-orbit and spin-spin effects. All the spin-spin terms include the quadrupole-monopole interaction. The eccentricity enhancement functions in the fluxes use the high-accuracy hyperasymptotic expansions from Loutrel and Yunes [Classical Quantum Gravity {\bf 34} 044003 (2017)]. We discuss various features of the code and study the evolution of the orbital and spin-precession parameters of eccentric, precessing BBHs. In particular, we study the dependence of the spin morphologies on eccentricity, where we find that the transition point from one spin morphology to another can depend nonmonotonically on eccentricity, and the fraction of binaries in a given morphology at a given point in the evolution of a population depends on the instantaneous eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Thin accretion disk around a Kerr black hole immersed in swirling universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the properties of the thin accretion disk around a swirling-Kerr black hole, which owns an extra swirling parameter described the rotation of the immersed universe. Our results show that the swirling parameter imprints in the energy flux, temperature distribution and emission spectra of the disk and gives rise to some new effects differed from those arising from the black hole spin. With the increasing of the swirling parameter, the energy flux and the radiated temperature in the disk increase in the near region with the smaller circular orbital radius and decrease in the far region with the larger circular orbital radius. However, they always increase with the black hole spin. Although the swirling parameter and the black hole spin parameter lead to the higher cut-off frequencies, the background swirling decreases the observed luminosity of the disk at the lower frequencies and enhances the higher observed luminosity only at the higher frequencies, which differs from that of the black hole spin. Moreover, the conversion efficiency increases with the black hole spin parameter, but decreases with on the swirling parameters. Furthermore, effects of the swirling parameter are found to be suppressed by the black hole spin parameter. These results could help us to further understand the properties of thin accretion disks and the swirling of the universe background.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal f-modes of anisotropic quark stars in full general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate f-mode oscillations of anisotropic quark stars within the framework of full general relativity. We consider two different equations of state (EOSs), one is the MIT bag model EOS and the other is EOS-A. Our study examines the impact of the pressure anisotropy on the equilibrium structure, as well as on the frequencies and damping times of f-mode oscillations. Our results confirm that the f-mode frequency scales linearly with the square root of the average density, with anisotropy influencing both the slope and intercept of this relation. The dependence of the f-mode frequency on total mass reveals distinct trends based on the relative dominance of tangential and radial pressure. When the tangential pressure exceeds the radial pressure, the frequency increases with mass, exhibiting rapid growth for massive quark stars. When the radial pressure dominates, the frequency increases with mass; however, in cases where the radial pressure is significantly greater than the tangential pressure, the frequency decreases as mass increases. For low-mass quark stars, stronger tangential pressure leads to an increase in frequency, while beyond a threshold mass, a further increase in tangential pressure results in a decrease in frequency. For the chosen range of anisotropic strengths, the frequency varies between 1.3 kHz and 2.3 kHz for the MIT bag EOS and between 1.8 kHz and 3.4 kHz for EOS-A. We find that the normalized damping time follows a linear trend with compactness. For a fixed stellar mass, an increase in tangential pressure relative to radial pressure reduces the damping time, whereas a decrease in tangential pressure significantly increases it. The damping time ranges from 83 ms to 900 ms for the MIT bag EOS and from 60 ms to 761 ms for EOS-A. We present semi-empirical expressions for both the frequency and damping time as functions of mass, radius, and anisotropic strength.</description>

      <title>Static black hole horizons in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite previous results that rule out the possibility of a static black hole horizon in cosmology we present a black hole metric that has a static horizon whilst mimicking the cosmological behavior at large scales away from the black hole horizon. By a suitable choice of coordinates, we show that it is possible to have a static black hole horizon in cosmology that does not suffer from issues like singularities in curvature invariants at the horizon. The resulting metric is consistent with the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric for constant Hubble parameter. It should be noted that this metric does not lead to isotropic pressure, i.e. $p_\perp\neq p_r$ for radial distances comparable to Schwarzschild radius, but for large $r$ the stress tensor (assuming general relativity) tends to the cosmological value. Turning to a more realistic framework, we study the cases of black hole$+$cosmological matter and black hole$+$matter$+$cosmological constant where we assume the pressure component takes its cosmological value and show that although the resulting metric does not have a static horizon, the physical radius of the apparent horizon can tend to a constant value for large cosmological time. This metric does not suffer from issues like a singular horizon for asymptotically vanishing Hubble parameter.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Shadows of Black Holes in Infinite Derivative Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) and shadow of a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) with higher-order metric corrections, in the framework of the Infinite Derivative theory of Gravity (IDG). We study the effects of corrections to the BH's metric, which arises from the IDG's corrections, on the QNMs and shadow of the BH. We used the 6th-order Pad\'{e} averaged WKB approximation method to study the QNMs of the BH perturbed by a scalar field. The dependence of the amplitude and damping of QNMs with respect to the free parameters has been analysed. It is found that the BH system becomes unstable for some values of the free parameters. We also studied the time evolution of a scalar field around the BH spacetime. The QNMs have also been calculated from the time profile of the evolution, which show good agreement with the values obtained from the WKB method. The variation of the shadow radius of the BH due to the inclusion of higher-order corrections has been studied. Finally, we constrain the free parameters associated with the correction terms using the data from the Keck and VLTI observation, and we obtain some bounds on the parameters.</description>

      <title>Effective Metric Description of Charged Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged black holes arise as solutions of General Relativity (GR) coupled to Maxwell theory. As functions of the mass and charge, they can exhibit extremal behavior, in which case they are stable against thermal decay. (Quantum) corrections to GR are expected to alter the classical features of these objects, especially near extremality. To capture such effects in a model-independent way, we extend the Effective Metric Description (EMD) previously introduced in [Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 2, 024045, Eur.Phys.J.C 84 (2024) 12, 1273] for spherically symmetric and static black holes. The EMD parametrizes deformations of the metric in terms of physical quantities, such as the radial spatial distance to the event horizon. While the latter is still viable for non-extremal charged black holes, we argue that the proper time of a free-falling observer is better suited in the extremal case: we derive the necessary conditions for the parameters of such an EMD for constructing a consistent space-time in the vicinity of the (extremal) horizon. Finally, we illustrate our framework through a concrete example, and mention implications of the Weak Gravity Conjecture on the effective metric parameters.</description>

      <title>Standard constraints on the shadow radius of black holes in $d$-dimensional space-time: The case of regular Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a $d$-dimensional constraint formula for the black hole shadow radius, providing a standardized framework for using observational confidence intervals to constrain the corresponding characteristic parameters in $d$-dimensional black hole solutions. This approach can correct the misapplication of shadow radius constraints in some previous studies. Subsequently, we selected two regular Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) black hole solutions as a representative example to test the $d$-dimensional shadow constraint formula. Our analysis reveals that the characteristic parameters within these $d$-dimensional black hole solutions maintain physically meaningful bounded domains under shadow radius constraints. We further propose that this $d$-dimensional shadow constraint formula is universal and can be applied to constrain the characteristic parameters in other high-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the conformal Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant to extract fall-off conditions of the gravitational fields. The fall-off conditions are consistent with a finite, non-trivial presymplectic current on the future boundary of de Sitter. Hence our result allows a non-zero gravitational flux across the boundary of the de Sitter. We present an explicit gauge-free computation to show that the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term, counterterm in the action, and fall-off condition of gravitational field in conformal Einstein equation are crucial to reproduce the finite symplectic flux.</description>

      <title>Chaos Around the Kerr Black Hole: its Effects on Entropy and the Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massless or massive particles in unstable orbits around a Kerr black hole exhibit chaotic motion when perturbed. They either plunge into the black hole or escape to infinity after making some oscillations around the equatorial plane. In both of these cases, chaotic motion causes information production. In the case of the photons that escape to infinity, it was recently suggested that this information can be used to resolve the subring structure of the shadow image and obtain more precise data about the black hole mass and spin. Here, we extend this method to obtain more precise results by including the non-equatorial contributions to the Lyapunov exponents. In the other case of massive particles that plunge into the Kerr black hole, we show that the associated Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy derived from the Lyapunov exponents can be interpreted in the context of black hole thermodynamics and that it obeys Bekenstein's bound on the entropy of a physical material system. Thus, the perturbed unstable orbits, either ending inside the black hole or at the observer's screen, have physical consequences.</description>

      <title>Barotropic Equation of State and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Dynamical Black Hole Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of black holes that differ from idealized vacuum and electrovacuum solutions of Einstein's equations often contain parameters whose physical interpretation is unclear. However, to propose a black hole model for experimental verification, we must clearly understand which parameters describe the black hole and what physical constraints can be imposed on each parameter. When considering dynamical black holes with a barotropic equation of state, an additional integration constant arises, the nature of which remains unclear except for a few specific values of the equation of state coefficient. Nevertheless, when examining solutions such as Husain or Kiselev, we can observe remarkable effects related to black hole evaporation, which are associated with the violation of null energy conditions. However, the main issue lies in the fact that while violations of energy conditions may occur in nature, the ambiguity in the values of parameters describing black holes makes it difficult to determine whether such violations result from natural physical processes or are purely mathematical artifacts that should be excluded from consideration. Moreover, energy conditions play a crucial role in the evolution of a black hole shadow - a characteristic that can potentially be observed experimentally. In this article, we elucidate the parameter arising in Husain's and Kiselev's solutions using nonlinear electrodynamics. We demonstrate that for physically relevant equations of state, the additional parameter represents a combination of electric and magnetic charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In General Relativity and gauge field theory, one often encounters a claim, which may be called the boundary problem, according to which "boundaries break diffeomorphism and gauge symmetries". We argue that this statement has the same conceptual structure as the hole argument, and is thus likewise defused by the point-coincidence argument: We show that the boundary problem dissolves once it is understood that a physical region, thus its boundary, is relationally and invariantly defined. This insight can be technically implemented via the Dressing Field Method, a systematic tool to exhibit the gauge-invariant content of general-relativistic gauge field theories, whereby physical field-theoretical degrees of freedoms co-define each other and define, coordinatize, the physical spacetime. We illustrate our claim with a simple application to the case of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Slip in the Parameterized Post-Newtonian Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key signature of general relativity is that the two scalar potentials $\Phi$ and $\Psi$, when expressed in the longitudinal gauge, are equal in the absence of fluids with anisotropic stress. This is often expressed by stating that their ratio, the "gravitational slip", is equal to unity. However, the equality of $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ is typically broken in alternative theories of gravity. Observational constraints on the slip parameter are therefore of direct interest for testing Einstein's theory. In this paper we derive theory-independent expressions for the slip parameter on both large and small scales in Friedmann cosmologies, expressing it as a function of the post-Newtonian parameters. This is the final ingredient required for a complete parameterization of dust and dark energy-dominated cosmologies within the framework of Parameterized Post-Newtonian Cosmology (PPNC), which allows for the fully self-consistent modelling of cosmological observables without assuming any specific theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Recoherence, adiabaticiy and Markovianity in Gaussian maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of situations where cosmological fluctuations recohere during inflation, we investigate the relationship between quantum recoherence (late-time purification after a transient phase of decoherence), adiabaticity, and Markovianity. To that end, we study a simple setup of two linearly-coupled harmonic oscillators, and compute the purity of one oscillator when the interaction is switched off. We find that there exists a critical value for the coupling strength below which the purity oscillates and above which it decays exponentially. This decay cannot be captured with perturbation theory, hence, decoherence is always a non-perturbative phenomenon. When the interaction is turned off, the purity either freezes to its value prior to the turn-off, or it smoothly goes back to a value very close to one (recoherence). This depends on the rate at which the turn-off occurs. We thus develop a new adiabatic-expansion scheme and find complete recoherence at any finite order in the inverse turn-off time. Therefore, decoherence is always a non-adiabatic effect. The critical value of the turn-off time above which recoherence takes place is then expressed in terms of the other time scales of the problem. Finally, we show that even though the dynamics of the system is never Markovian, when decoherence takes place, it can always be interpreted as resulting from a locally Markovian process. We introduce a new measure of Markovianity dubbed the Bures velocity and use it to optimise Markovian approximations.</description>

      <title>The Weak Gravity Conjecture in Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) posits that gravity must be the weakest force in any consistent theory of quantum gravity. Originally formulated to constrain the landscape of effective field theories arising from string theory, the WGC suggests the existence of states with a charge-to-mass ratio larger than that of extremal black holes. In this work, we revisit the WGC within the framework of Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity, a non-perturbative approach where gravitational and gauge couplings flow to a non-Gaussian ultraviolet (UV) fixed point. We construct a scale-dependent effective action, derive quantum-corrected Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole solutions by incorporating position-dependent renormalization scale identification, and compute leading quantum corrections to the extremality condition. Our key finding is that the quantum correction to the extremal charge-to-mass ratio is dominantly governed by the running of the gauge coupling, characterized by a correction parameter $\delta \sim \epsilon_e (\ell_P/r_+)^{2\theta}$, where $\epsilon_e$ captures deviations from infrared behavior. We show that if the electromagnetic coupling grows in the UV ($\epsilon_e &gt; \epsilon_G$), the WGC is dynamically strengthened, whereas if it decreases ($\epsilon_e &lt; \epsilon_G$), large extremal black holes may violate the WGC unless additional light charged states exist. Our analysis demonstrates that Asymptotic Safety provides a concrete ultraviolet mechanism influencing low-energy swampland criteria, offering a deep UV/IR connection between quantum gravity consistency and effective field theory behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that induced gravitational waves (IGWs) can naturally emerge within the framework of thermal leptogenesis models, thereby providing a robust probe for exploring this theory at remarkably high energy scales. To illustrate this principle, we put forth a basic leptogenesis model in which an early matter-dominated phase, tracing the leptogenesis scale, enhances the generation of gravitational waves induced by an early structure formation. Leveraging recent N-body and lattice simulation results for IGW computations in the non-linear regime, we show that it is possible to establish a direct link between the frequency and amplitude of these IGWs and the thermal leptogenesis scale.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flavor instabilities in a binary neutron star merger remnant: Roles of a long-lived hypermassive neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the post-merger evolution of binary neutron star merger (BNSM) requires accurate modeling of neutrino transport and microphysics including neutrino flavor conversions. Many previous studies have suggested that fast flavor instability (FFI) and collisional flavor instability (CFI) pervade inner regions of BNSM remnant, and they could impact on fluid dynamics and r-process nucleosynthesis. In this work, we re-examine prospects of occurrences of FFI and CFI using Boltzmann neutrino transport, assuming a frozen fluid background obtained from a numerical relativity simulation of BNSM. We pay special attention to a case involving a long-lived ($&gt;1\,$ s) hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Apart from confirming the claim that these flavor instabilities can occur in BNSM remnants, some new insights are revealed. We identify multiple mechanisms responsible for generating electron neutrino lepton number angular crossings, corresponding to a key indicator of FFI onset, which differ notably from those in black hole (BH) accretion disk systems. We also find that the appearance of positive chemical potential of electron-type neutrinos is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for FFI, which offers a valuable diagnostic tool for predicting FFI based solely on fluid properties. For CFI, their growth rates are generally lower than FFI, but they can persistently occur in most of the accretion disk up to $\sim 1\,$ s. We also find that neglecting contributions of heavy-leptonic neutrinos results in overestimating growth rate and area of unstable regions of CFI. Our result suggests that FFI (CFI) tends to occur transiently (persistently) and locally (widespread in the disk), and FFI is more sensitive to the central compact object (HMNS or BH) than CFI, though more self-consistent simulations with incorporating effects of flavor conversions are needed to confirm these claims.</description>

      <title>Can black holes preserve $N &gt; 4$ supersymmetry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of near-BPS black holes are governed by the breaking of the conformal symmetry that emerges near their horizons. Using the classification of superconformal symmetries, we systematically classify and quantize all effective theories that can arise in the near-BPS limit of black holes. Using these results, we argue, under certain physical assumptions, that BPS black holes cannot preserve more than four supercharges. This conclusion is consistent with existing constructions in string theory.</description>

      <title>A forest of gravitational waves in our Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the Galactic Centre, we can expect a population of a few tens of early extreme-mass ratio inspirals (E-EMRIs) and extremely large mass ratio inspirals (XMRIs). Depending on their evolutionary stage, they can be highly eccentric, with moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of tens or hundreds, or nearly circular, with SNRs as large as a few thousand. Their individual signals combine into a common signal, which can complicate the resolution of other types of sources. We have calculated the foreground signal of continuous E-EMRIs and XMRIs using a catalog based on the expected number of sources and a realistic phase-space distribution. The forest of E-EMRIs will cover a large portion of the LISA sensitivity curve, obscuring the signals of some massive black hole binaries, verification binaries, and harmonics of EMRIs in their polychromatic phase. The combined signal from XMRIs will be much weaker but still affect intermediate-mass black hole binaries. Due to the large SNR, this forest can be also found in other galactic nuclei, such as that of the Andromeda galaxy. Even under conservative assumptions, the forest created by E-EMRIs and XMRIs in our Galactic Centre will likely pose a challenge for resolving other types of sources, as their contribution is non-coherent and exhibits large SNRs.</description>

      <title>High Precision Black Hole Scattering: Tutti Frutti vs Worldline Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider black hole scattering up to the fifth Post Minkowskian ($G^5$) order and compare the predictions of the Tutti Frutti formalism to the results obtained within two different versions of Worldline Effective Field Theory. At the $G^4$ order we highlight the complete agreement between Tutti Frutti results and the results of [C. Dlapa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{130}, no.10, 101401 (2023)], and show how the Tutti Frutti approach allows one to extract the $O(G^3)$ angular momentum loss from the $O(G^4)$ impulse. We compare the sixth Post-Newtonian (6PN) accurate Tutti Frutti predictions to the recent results of [M. Driesse et al., arXiv:2411.11846 [hep-th]], which are at the $G^5$ order, and at the leading order in the two mass ratios, finding complete agreement. We highlight that this agreement involves the presence at the 5.5PN level of a nonlocal tail-of-tail contribution to the scattering (first computed in [D. Bini et al., Phys. Rev. D \textbf{102}, no.8, 084047 (2020)]), and involves, at the 6PN level, the presence of a $O(G^4)$ contribution to the angular momentum loss [C. Heissenberg, arXiv:2501.02904 [hep-th]]. At the second order in the mass ratios of the $O(G^5)$ order we predict two independent gauge-invariant observables to high-PN accuracy.</description>

      <title>Application of the Holographic Equation of State for Numerical Modeling of the Evolution of Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for numerical modeling of the nuclear matter properties within the framework of relativistic heavy-ion collisions using a holographic equation of state. Model's free parameters are calibrated using lattice results for quark masses approximating physical values and adjusted to match the Regge spectra of $\rho$ mesons. Numerical simulations are performed using the iEBE-MUSIC framework, which incorporates the MUSIC relativistic hydrodynamics solver. We modify the code by implementing a tabulated holographic equation of state, enabling simulations of quark-gluon plasma evolution with dynamically generated initial conditions via the 3D Monte Carlo Glauber Model. Finally, the spectra of produced hadrons are computed using a hybrid iSS+UrQMD approach at the freeze-out stage.</description>

      <title>Integrable black hole dynamics in the asymptotic structure of AdS$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work deepens the study of integrable asymptotic symmetries for AdS$_{3}$. They are given by an infinite set of integrable nonlinear equations known as the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, characterized by an also infinite set of abelian conserved charges. We present their field-dependent Killing vectors and the computation of the canonical charges associated to the asymptotic metric, together with their corresponding charge algebra. We study black hole thermodynamics and show that the temperature for stationary black holes falling in the AKNS asymptotics is always constant, even in the case where the solutions are not axisymmetric. This is related to the existence of a hyperelliptic curve, which appears as a fundamental object in many integrable systems. We also present a special solution associated with the Korteweg-de Vries equation, that is a particular case of the AKNS integrable hierarchy. It is presented in the form of a periodic soliton leading to a cnoidal KdV black hole, whose temperature is characterized by two copies of hyperelliptic curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this letter is to study the universal thermodynamics and criticality of charged AdS black holes with string clouds in the bulk and in the boundary conformal field theory (CFT). For this system, we determined the critical quantities and noticed that the free energy in the bulk exhibits swallow tail behavior. In the boundary CFT, the presence of second order phase transition is observed. At constant charge, the heat capacity is finite in the bulk but diverges at critical points in the boundary CFT. Furthermore, we tried to determine the nature of interactions between black hole molecules in the boundary CFT and in the bulk, which is novel for charged AdS black holes with string clouds.</description>

      <title>Horizon Thermodynamics on Nice Slices of the Causal Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a deep link between gravity and thermodynamics; in a precise way gravity can be derived from entanglement entropy in conformal field theories. However, this depends crucially on properties of horizons, and asymptotic symmetries of phase space. To explore how this relation behaves under dynamical processes, we consider covariant gravitational phase space enhanced with bulk conformal symmetry. As is well known, the Noether-Wald entropy has an explicit form in terms of the Abbott-Deser-Tekin conserved surface charges of gauge theories. We find a new vector contribution to the Abbott-Deser-Tekin charges that arises for conformal symmetries. In applying this to the causal diamond, we derive a general relation for surface gravity, based on the conformal invariance of horizons, that allows us to find slices where the zeroth law holds, as well as the degree to which a first law arises on the phase space.</description>

Abstract: A technique to build perturbative series for the spectator field's correlation functions in de Sitter space through the Fokker-Planck equation is proposed. We derive from the first-order differential equation the iterative integral relation for equal- and multi-time correlation functions. With an appropriate integration, the obtained two-point and four-point correlation functions are in agreement with quantum field theory's ones in the leading-logarithm approximation.</description>

      <title>Challenging $\Lambda$CDM: 5$\sigma$ Evidence for a Dynamical Dark Energy Late-Time Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been considerable debate regarding potential evidence for the dynamical nature of dark energy (DE), particularly in light of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements released by DESI survey. In this work, we propose an agnostic test that simultaneously constrains the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) and probes the possibility of a transition between the quintessence and phantom regimes, or vice versa. Our initial approach is independent of physical priors, allowing the data to determine which behavior best fits the parameters. We then consider a minimally modified gravity theory known as VCDM, into which we can map our initial approximation, placing it within a theoretically stable framework. To this end, we incorporate the most up-to-date datasets available, including BAO measurements from DESI-DR2, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3 samples, as well as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis reveals strong and statistically significant evidence for a quintessence-phantom transition across various data combinations. \textit{The strongest evidence is found for Planck+DESI+DESY5, with a significance exceeding $\sim$5$\sigma$ in favor of a quintessence-phantom transition at $z_{\dag} = 0.493^{+0.063}_{-0.081}$}. Beyond this redshift, the EoS remains within the phantom regime, while for $z &lt; z_{\dag}$, it favors the quintessence regime. Despite this strong indication, \textit{we find that such transitions do not resolve the $H_0$ tension}.</description>

      <title>Numerical Relativity Simulations of Dark Matter Admixed Binary Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers provide insight into strong-field gravity and the properties of ultra-dense nuclear matter. These events offer the potential to search for signatures of physics beyond the standard model, including dark matter. We present the first numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers admixed with dark matter, based on constraint-solved initial data. Modeling dark matter as a non-interacting fermionic gas, we investigate the impact of varying dark matter fractions and particle masses on the merger dynamics, ejecta mass, post-merger remnant properties, and the emitted gravitational waves. Our simulations suggest that the dark matter morphology - a dense core or a diluted halo - may alter the merger outcome. Scenarios with a dark matter core tend to exhibit a higher probability of prompt collapse, while those with a dark matter halo develop a common envelope, embedding the whole binary. Furthermore, gravitational wave signals from mergers with dark matter halo configurations exhibit significant deviations from standard models when the tidal deformability is calculated in a two-fluid framework. This highlights the need for refined models in calculating the tidal deformability when considering mergers with extended dark matter structures. These initial results provide a basis for further exploration of dark matter's role in binary neutron star mergers and their associated gravitational wave emission and can serve as a benchmark for future observations from advanced detectors and multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Viability of warm inflation with standard model interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimal warm inflation scenario proposed in Ref. [1] -- featuring an axion-like inflaton coupled to Standard Model (SM) gluons via the standard interaction $\phi G \tilde G$ -- offers a compelling bridge between inflationary dynamics and SM particle content. While the model retains only the inflaton as a beyond-SM field, its original analysis relied on some approximate treatments of warm inflation's (WI) dynamics. Here, we revisit this scenario using WI2easy, a precision computational tool for WI dynamics [2], to rigorously evaluate the model's viability and full range of model's parameters compatible with the observational parameters. Overall, we find that the results of Ref. [1] hold, but with significant differences in the weak and strong dissipative regimes of WI.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from Quaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the large-scale angular clustering of quasars in the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalog, Quaia, and their cross-correlation with maps of the lensing convergence of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), to constrain the level of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). Specifically, we target the scale-dependent bias that would be induced by PNG on biased tracers of the matter inhomogeneities on large scales. The Quaia sample is particularly well suited for this analysis, given the large effective volume covered, and our ability to map out the main potential sources of systematic contamination and mitigate their impact. Using the universality relation to characterise the response of the quasar overdensity to PNG ($p_\phi=1$), we report constraints on the local-type PNG parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ of $f_{\rm NL}=-20.5^{+19.0}_{-18.1}$ (68\% C.L.) by combining the quasar auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with CMB lensing in two tomographic redshift bins (or $f_{\rm NL}=-28.7^{+26.1}_{-24.6}$ if assuming a lower response for quasars, $p_\phi=1.6$). Using the CMB lensing cross-correlations alone, we find $f_{\rm NL}=-13.8^{+26.7}_{-25.0}$. These are the tightest constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$ to date from angular clustering statistics and cross-correlations with CMB lensing.</description>

Abstract: A Planck scale inflationary era -- in a quantum gravity theory predicting discreteness of quantum geometry at the fundamental scale -- produces the scale invariant spectrum of inhomogeneities with very small tensor-to-scalar ratio of perturbations and a hot big bang leading to a natural dark matter genesis scenario. Here we evoke the possibility that some of the major puzzles in cosmology would have an explanation rooted in quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: We give an analytical approximation for the energy spectrum of the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) generated by a broken power-law power spectrum, and find that both the asymptotic power-law tails and the intermediate peak contribute distinct features to the SIGW spectrum. Moreover, the broken power-law power spectrum has abundant near-peak features and our results can be used as a near-peak approximation that covers a wide range of models. Our analytical approximation is useful in the rapid generation of the SIGW energy spectrum, which is beneficial for gravitational wave data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conditions for the existence of the Chapman-Enskog first-order solution to the Boltzmann equation for a dilute gas are examined from two points of view. The traditional procedure is contrasted with a somehow more formal approach based on the properties of the linearized collision operator. It is shown that both methods lead to the same integral equation in the non-relativistic scenario. Meanwhile, for relativistic systems, the source term in the integral equation adopts two different forms. However, as we explain, this does not lead to an inconsistency. In fact, the constitutive equations that are obtained from both methods are shown to be equivalent within relativistic first-order theories. The importance of stating invariant definitions for the transport coefficients in this context is emphasized.</description>

Abstract: Scaling laws for critical phenomena take pivotal status in almost all branches of physics. However, as scaling laws are commonly guaranteed by the renormalization group theory, systems that violate them have rarely been found. In this letter, we demonstrate that gravitational system can break scaling laws. We derive this result through investigating phase transition and critical phenomenon in a gravitational system with quantum anomaly. For the first time, we outline the key conditions to violate the scaling laws in generic gravitational system viewed from the equation of state $P=P(T,V)$. Our results indicate that quantum effects can magnify the distinctiveness of gravity, which may be significant to understand the microscopic structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame: Hyperbolicity, causality, and stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a first-order theory of relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame, which is similar to Eckart's frame except that the temperature is determined by fixing the trace of the stress-energy tensor. Our theory is hyperbolic and causal provided a single inequality holds. For low wave numbers, the expected damped modes in the shear, acoustic, and heat diffusion channels are recovered. Stability of global equilibria with respect to all wave numbers is also analyzed. The conditions for hyperbolicity, causality and stability are satisfied for a simple gas of hard spheres or disks.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame: Strongly hyperbolic quasi-linear first-order evolution equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a new first-order theory of relativistic dissipative fluids by adopting the trace-fixed particle frame. Whereas in a companion letter we show that this theory is hyperbolic, causal and stable at global equilibrium states, here we prove that the full nonlinear system of equations can be cast into a first-order quasilinear system which is strongly hyperbolic. By rewriting the system in first-order form, auxiliary constraints are introduced. However, we show that these constraints propagate, and thus our theory leads to a well-posed Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>Scalar kicks and memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scalar field coupled conformally and disformally to matter affects both the linear memory effect for binary systems on hyperbolic orbits, as well as the kick velocity for binaries on bound or unbound orbits. We study these corrections in detail, their order of magnitude, and discuss their detectability. In particular, we find that the disformal interaction does not contribute to the memory effect and the emitted power spectrum at zero frequency. The conformal interaction corrects the GR linear memory and the quadrupole emitted power at zero frequency resulting in a breaking of the GR memory-power spectrum relationship. On the other hand, disformal interactions give rise to a change of momentum for the centre of mass. Hence, measuring both the linear memory effect and the kicks for hyperbolic orbits would give access to the conformal and disformal couplings of nearly massless scalars to matter.</description>

      <title>Reproducing $\Lambda$CDM-like Solutions in $f(Q)$ Gravity: A Comprehensive Study Across All Connection Branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the remarkable success of the $\Lambda$CDM model in fitting various cosmological observations, a pertinent question in assessing the phenomenological viability of modified gravity theories is whether they can reproduce an exactly $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmic background evolution. In this paper, we address this question in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity, where $Q$ denotes the nonmetricity scalar. It is known that there are three possible symmetric teleparallel connection branches that respect the cosmological principles of spatial homogeneity, isotropy, and global spatial flatness. By enforcing a $\Lambda$CDM-like background evolution via the cosmographic condition $j(z)=1$, where $j$ is the jerk parameter, we reconstruct the $\Lambda$CDM-mimicking $f(Q)$ theory for each of the three possible connection branches. For the first connection branch, also known as the ``coincident gauge'' in cosmology, we recover the previously known result that a theory of the form $f(Q)=-2\Lambda+\alpha Q+\beta\sqrt{-Q}$ can exactly reproduce a $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmic evolution. Furthermore, we establish that the stability of the $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmic solution within this reconstructed $f(Q)$, as well as the robustness of the reconstructed $f(Q)$ form with respect to small errors in the astrophysical measurements of the jerk parameter. For the second connection branch, we analytically reconstruct the $\Lambda$CDM-mimicking $f(Q)$ to be of the form $f(Q)=-2\Lambda+\alpha Q-\beta Q^2$. For the third connection branch, we could decouple the evolution equation for the dynamical connection function, which enabled us to perform a numerical reconstruction. Our analysis proves that, at least at the background level, it is possible to obtain $\Lambda$CDM-mimicking $f(Q)$ models for all the three possible connection branches.</description>

      <title>Kiselev black strings: the charged rotating solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of a charged rotating black string immersed in a Kiselev anisotropic fluid in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. The Einstein-Maxwell equations with an anisotropic stress-energy tensor and cosmological constant are analyzed and solved exactly. In this work, we calculate the Kretschmann scalar, obtaining a consistent result that agrees with the existing literature in the absence of charge and fluid. The rotating solution is obtained by applying a coordinate transformation on time and angular coordinates. The event horizon associated with specific values of the equation of state parameter $w_q$ is studied. The results show an important influence of the fluid parameters $N_{q}$ and $w_{q}$, the charge parameter $Q$, and the rotation parameter $a$ on the size of the black string horizon. In addition, we determine the conditions for the existence of closed timelike curves (CTCs) and compute the conserved charges, such as mass, angular momentum, and electric charge of the black string. Utilizing the Klein-Gordon equation, we employ the quantum particle tunneling approach to obtain the probability of charged scalar particles tunneling across the event horizon. We obtain the correspondent Hawking temperature as a consequence. Furthermore, we examine the thermodynamic properties, including entropy and heat capacity, to assess the effects of the quintessence field and charge on the black string. The results include particular cases such as the Lemos black string, providing a broader view of black string configurations in AdS spacetime.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>

      <title>Displacement Memory Effect from Supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain the recent results on the displacement memory effect (DME) of plane gravitational waves using supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This novel approach stems from that both the geodesic and the Schr\"odinger equations are Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems. Supersymmetry provides a unified framework for the P\"oschl-Teller and the Scarf profiles and yields the critical values of the associated wave amplitudes for DME in a natural way. Within our framework, we obtain a compact formula for DME in terms of the asymptotic values of the superpotential and the geodesics. In addition, this new technique enables us to build plane and gravitational waves with 2-transverse directions using superpartner potentials. Lastly, we study DME within a singular wave profile inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which demonstrates the broader applicability of our method.</description>

They are found in the reformulation of the third order equations by Harada as Einstein equations with sources supplemented by a divergence free anisotropic conformal Killing tensor. A conserved current proposed by Altas and Tekin is also evaluated, and found nonzero for the vacuum solution by Harada.</description>

      <title>Unified Non-Singular Cosmology with Late-Time Acceleration through a Novel Parametrization of Bulk Viscosity Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the influence of viscous fluids on cosmological dynamics within the framework of General Relativity. We introduce a novel time-dependent parametrization for the bulk viscosity coefficient, given by \(\zeta = \zeta_0 (t - t_0)^{-2n} \rho^{1/2}\), where \(\zeta_0\), \(t_0\), and \(n\) are model parameters. This formulation is designed to investigate whether bulk viscosity of this nature can effectively describe the evolution of the universe, particularly in scenarios that avoid initial singularities through a cosmological bounce. Remarkably, the general solutions emerging from our model exhibit significant flexibility, accommodating not only a bouncing universe but also an early inflationary phase and a late-time acceleration mimicking dark energy. The roles of \(\zeta_0\), \(t_0\), and \(n\) are pivotal, as they govern the cosmic evolution and determine the transitions between different phases. To validate the robustness of our model, we analyze key cosmological quantities such as the energy density, deceleration parameter, and the validity of various energy conditions. Furthermore, we employ statefinder diagnostics to probe the dark energy behavior and examine Hubble flow parameters to shed light on the inflationary aspects of the model. Lastly, we confront our theoretical predictions with observational data sets, including the BAO, DESI and Pantheon+SH0ES datasets, demonstrating the model's consistency with empirical cosmological trends.</description>

Abstract: We study the infrared on-shell action of Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, obtaining an effective, gauge-invariant boundary action for memory and shockwave spacetimes. We show that the phase space is in both cases parameterized by the leading soft variables in asymptotically flat spacetimes, thereby extending the equivalence between shockwave and soft commutators to spacetimes with non-vanishing Bondi mass. We then demonstrate that our on-shell action is equal to three quantities studied separately in the literature: $(i)$ the soft supertranslation charge; $(ii)$ the shockwave effective action, or equivalently the modular Hamiltonian; and $(iii)$ the soft effective action. Finally, we compute the quantum fluctuations in the soft supertranslation charge and, assuming the supertranslation parameter may be promoted to an operator, we obtain an area law, consistent with earlier results showing that the modular Hamiltonian has such fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the covariant formulation of Penrose's plane wave limit by Blau et~al., we construct for any semi-Riemannian metric $g$ a family of "plane wave limits." These limits are taken along any geodesic of $g$, yield simpler metrics of Lorentzian signature, and are isometric invariants. We show that they generalize Penrose's limit to the semi-Riemannian regime and, in certain cases, encode $g$'s tensorial geometry and its geodesic deviation. As an application of the latter, we partially extend a well known result by Hawking &amp; Penrose to the semi-Riemannian regime: On any semi-Riemannian manifold, if the Ricci curvature is nonnegative along any complete geodesic without conjugate points that is "causally independent" (in a sense we make precise), then the curvature tensor along that geodesic must vanish in all normal directions. A Morse Index Theorem is also proved for such geodesics.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the missing mass of galaxy clusters in MOND: the view from gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) has long been known to fail in galaxy clusters, implying a residual missing mass problem for clusters in this context. Here, using mass profiles derived from strong- and weak-lensing shear, as well as magnification data, for a sample of clusters from the CLASH survey, we characterize the density profile of this residual MOND missing mass in the central Mpc of galaxy clusters. In line with results obtained in the literature from the hydrostatic equilibrium of hot gas, we find that an inner constant density core and an outer power-law slope sharper than $-3.5$ provides a good description within $\sim 1$~Mpc. We also show that the data in the central parts of clusters can be even better represented by a `dark mass-follows-gas' profile with an exponential cut-off. Clusters in the sample display a remarkable uniformity for the missing-to-hot-gas density ratio in the inner parts, of order $\sim$10, as well as for the exponential cut-off radius, of order $\sim 400$~kpc. These lensing results can in principle serve as a crucible for relativistic theories of MOND in galaxy clusters, or for any other tentative hypothesis regarding the nature of the clusters residual missing mass in the MOND context.</description>

Abstract: The Macquart relation and time-delay cosmography are now two promising ways to fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. In this work, we propose a joint method that combines strongly lensed and unlensed FRBs for improving cosmological parameter estimation by using simulated FRB data from the future sensitive coherent all-sky monitor survey, which is expected to detect a large number of FRBs including galaxy-galaxy strongly lensed events. We find that using a detectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can simultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy, with high precision of $\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\%$ and $\varepsilon(w)=4.5\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint analysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on $H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs with future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with CMB. Furthermore, combining the full FRB sample with the CMB+BAO+SNe data yields $\sigma(H_0)=0.29~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.046$, and $\sigma(w_a)=0.15$ in the two-parameter dynamical dark energy model, which outperform the results from the CMB+BAO+SNe+GW data. This reinforces the cosmological implications of a multi-wavelength observational strategy in optical and radio bands. We conclude that the future FRB observations will shed light on the nature of dark energy and also the Hubble tension if enough events with long-duration lensing are incorporated.</description>

      <title>Flat limit of AdS/CFT from AdS geodesics: scattering amplitudes and antipodal matching of Li\'enard-Wiechert fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the flat limit of AdS/CFT from the point of view of geodesics in AdS. We show that the flat space scattering amplitudes can be constructed from operator insertions where the geodesics of the particles corresponding to the operators hit the conformal boundary of AdS. Further, we compute the Li\'enard-Wiechert solutions in AdS by boosting a static charge using AdS isometries and show that the solutions are antipodally matched between two regions, separated by a global time difference of $\Delta\tau=\pi$. Going to the boundary of AdS along null geodesics, in the flat limit, this antipodal matching leads to the flat space antipodal matching near spatial infinity.</description>

      <title>On-shell approach to scalar hair in spinning binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an on-shell description of spinning binary systems in gravitational theories where compact objects display scalar hair. The framework involves matter particles of arbitrary spin which, in addition to the minimal coupling to gravitons, are conformally coupled to a massless scalar mediating non-standard interactions. We use the unitary factorization techniques to derive the on-shell amplitudes relevant for emission of scalars and gravitons in matter scattering, paying attention to parametrize the freedom due to contact terms. Using the KMOC formalism, these amplitudes allow one to derive succinct expressions for the radiation waveforms at the leading post-Minkowskian order, together with the associated memory effects. Furthermore, we compute the power emitted via gravitational and scalar radiation in hyperbolic encounters of compact objects. After a continuation to bound orbits, these are compared with results obtained in specific scalar-tensor theories where black holes exhibit scalar hair, such as the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet or dynamical Chern-Simons theories. Finally, we identify possible deformations from the conformal coupling that can contribute to radiation observables at the same post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <title>Lensed fast radio bursts as a probe of time-varying gravitational potential induced by wave dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic wave dark matter (DM) is preponderantly contesting the conventional cold DM paradigm in predicting diverse and rich phenomena on small scales. For a DM halo made of ultralight bosons, the wave interference naturally induces slow de Broglie time-scale fluctuations of the gravitational potential. In this paper, we first derive an estimation for the effect of a time-varying gravitational potential on photon propagation. Our numerical simulations suggest that the time-varying potential of a $10^{11}M_{\odot}$ halo composed of $10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$ bosons would stretch or compress a time series signal by a factor of $10^{-10}$. Here, we propose that, due to the precise measurements of their arrival times, lensed repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) have the potential to effectively validate temporal variations in gravitational potential by monitoring their images over a period of approximately $\mathcal{O}(1)$ years. With rapidly growing FRB observations, this method would serve as a promising method to directly probe the wave nature of galactic DM halos.</description>

      <title>Accidental Symmetry Near Extreme Spinning Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near the horizon of extremal charged black holes, an accidental symmetry is known to act on zero-temperature perturbations, transforming them into finite-temperature ones. In this paper, we uncover the corresponding accidental symmetry of the vacuum Einstein equation near the horizon of extremal spinning black holes. To do so, we first devise a new method of deriving the symmetry near the ${\rm AdS}_2 \times S^2$ near-horizon geometry of extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"om, using a new scaling coordinate transformation that unifies the near-horizon limits of extremal and near-extremal black holes in a way that is regular at zero temperature. We use our new method to obtain the accidental symmetry in the near-horizon of extreme Kerr (NHEK). We show that accidental symmetries combine neatly with the near-horizon isometries inside a Virasoro algebra.</description>

      <title>Extracting more information from entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extract the complex frequency of the lowest quasi-normal mode from the holographically computed entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. The system consists of a purely thermal Supersymmetric Yang-Mills N=4 plasma in homogeneous isotropization dynamics. The initial state is far-from-equilibrium, proceeding to thermalization over time. The system evolves to equilibrium entropy forming a stairway pattern. The analysis reveals that the rate of increase of the stairway is twice the decay rate of the lowest quasi-normal mode. This leads us to propose a model explaining how this information is encoded in entropy. The model is extended to consider finite temperature, R-charge density and scalar condensate of the medium, disclosing an additional feature. The system's main dissipation channel may shift to one driven by the scalar condensate, depending on the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Holographic timelike entanglement and $c$ theorem for supersymmetric QFTs in ($ 0+1 $)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a holographic set up that computes timelike Entanglement Entropy (tEE) in $ (0+1) $d QFTs preserving some amount of SUSY. The first example we consider is that of $\mathcal{N}=2$ matrix models with massive deformations. These are dual to non-Abelian T-dual of $AdS_5 \times S^5$ that asymptotes to \emph{smeared} D0 branes. The second example, that we consider is of $ \mathcal{N}=4 $ superconformal quantum mechanical quivers in ($ 0+1 $)d that are dual to a class of type IIB backgrounds with an $ AdS_2 $ factor. In both of these examples, tEE reveals a remarkable similarity with holographic $ c $ function pertaining to a RG flow. We further compute the complexity in these models, which also reveals an identical behaviour indicating the fact that tEE is a measure of number of degrees of freedom for these ($ 0+1 $)d SQFTs in a RG flow from UV to deep IR.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical signals from the neighboring brane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the two-brane model and show that any field is settled on both neighboring branes, thus forming two independent effective fields with different masses. The hierarchy of the energy scales and the subsequent fine-tuning can be achieved for a brane populated by observers. The neighboring brane is thus populated by extremely massive fields. The electromagnetic field is uniformly distributed over the extra dimensions, preserving charge universality in 4D physics.
  It is shown that the particles on different branes interact by exchanging photons and gravitons, which could explain the phenomena such as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and dark matter. The latter consists of heavy electrons that are located on a brane free of the observers.</description>

      <title>Model spaces as constrained Hamiltonian systems: I. Application to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by group-theoretical questions that arise in the context of asymptotic symmetries in gravity, we study model spaces and their quantization from the viewpoint of constrained Hamiltonian systems. More precisely, we propose a definition of a model space for a generic Lie group $G$ as a suitable second class constrained system associated to the cotangent bundle $T^{*}G$. Before turning to the non-compact infinite-dimensional groups relevant in the gravitational setting, we work out all details in the simplest case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Besides recovering well-known results on the quantum theory of angular momentum from a unified perspective, the analysis sheds some light on the definition and properties of spin-weighted/monopole spherical harmonics.</description>

      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>

      <title>Hints for a Geon from Causal Dynamic Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of geons, physical states of self-bound gravitons, has long been proposed. In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes. We also find indications that the phase of rapid expansion of the obtained de Sitter universe impacts the mass, and relates to quantum fluctuations of space-time.</description>
