      <title>Passive Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna (6DMA)-Assisted Multiuser Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a promising solution for enhancing wireless network capacity through the adjustment of both three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of distributed antenna surfaces. Previous works mainly consider 6DMA surfaces composed of active antenna elements, thus termed as active 6DMA. In this letter, we propose a new passive 6DMA system consisting of distributed passive intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) that can be adjusted in terms of 3D position and 3D rotation. Specifically, we study a passive 6DMA-aided multiuser uplink system and aim to maximize the users' achievable sum rate by jointly optimizing the 3D positions, 3D rotations, and reflection coefficients of all passive 6DMA surfaces, as well as the receive beamforming matrix at the base station (BS). To solve this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes it into three subproblems and solves them alternately in an iterative manner. Numerical results are presented to investigate the performance of the proposed passive 6DMA system under different configurations and demonstrate its superior performance over the traditional fixed-IRS counterpart for both directive and isotropic radiation patterns of passive reflecting elements.</description>

      <title>Near-field Communications with Extremely Large-Scale Uniform Arc Arrays: Channel Modelling and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a new conformal array architecture, called extremely large-scale uniform arc array (XL-UAA), to improve near-field communication performance. Specifically,under the non-uniform spherical wavefront channel model, we establish mathematical modeling and performance analysis for XL-UAAs. It is shown that XL-UAAs have larger direction-dependent Rayleigh distance and uniform power distance than the conventional XL uniform linear arrays (XL-ULAs). Moreover, a closed-form expression for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is obtained, which depends on collective properties of XL-UAAs, such as the distance between the user and the array center,as well as the arc radius. In addition, we show that the asymptotic SNR of XL-UAAs with the number of antennas depends on the projection distance of the user to the middle of the arc array. Finally, numerical results verify that XL-UAAs achieve a higher SNR than XL-ULAs, especially at larger user incident angles.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Interference Prediction for In-X 6G Sub-networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) industrial Sub-networks (SNs) face several challenges in meeting extreme latency and reliability requirements in the order of 0.1-1 ms and 99.999 -to-99.99999 percentile, respectively. Interference management (IM) plays an integral role in addressing these requirements, especially in ultra-dense SN environments with rapidly varying interference induced by channel characteristics, mobility, and resource limitations. In general, IM can be achieved using resource allocation and \textit{accurate} Link adaptation (LA). In this work, we focus on the latter, where we first model interference at SN devices using the spatially consistent 3GPP channel model. Following this, we present a discrete-time dynamic state space model (DSSM) at a SN access point (AP), where interference power values (IPVs) are modeled as latent variables incorporating underlying modeling errors as well as transmission/protocol delays. Necessary approximations are then presented to simplify the DSSM and to efficiently employ the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for interference prediction. Unlike baseline methods, our proposed approach predicts IPVs solely based on the channel quality indicator (CQI) reports available at the SN AP at every transmission time interval (TTI). Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed approach clearly outperforms the conventional baseline. Furthermore, we also show that despite predicting with limited information, our proposed approach consistently achieves a comparable performance w.r.t the off-the-shelf supervised learning based baseline.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Grouping-Based Index Modulation: Transceiver Design for MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid antenna (FA)-enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system based on index modulation (IM), referred to as FA-IM, significantly enhances spectral efficiency (SE) compared to the conventional FA-assisted MIMO system. This paper proposes an innovative FA grouping-based IM (FAG-IM) system to improve performance in mitigating the high spatial correlation between multiple activated ports. A block grouping scheme is employed based on the spatial correlation model and the distribution structure of the ports. Then, a closed-form expression for the average bit error probability (ABEP) upper bound of the FAG-IM system is derived. In order to reduce the receiver complexity of the proposed system, the message passing mechanism is first incorporated into the FAG-IM system. Subsequently, within the approximate message passing (AMP) framework, an efficient structured AMP (S-AMP) detector is devised by leveraging the structural characteristics of the transmission signal vector. Simulation results confirm that the proposed FAG-IM system significantly outperforms the existing FA-IM system in the presence of spatial correlation. The derived ABEP curve aligns well with the numerical results, providing an efficient theoretical tool for evaluating the system performance. Additionally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed low-complexity S-AMP detector not only reduces the time complexity to a linear scale but also substantially improves bit error rate (BER) performance compared to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector, thus facilitating the practical implementation of the FAG-IM system.</description>

      <title>Analog-Only Beamforming for Near-Field Multiuser MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the existing near-field multiuser communications based on hybrid beamforming (HBF) architectures, high-quality effective channel estimation is required to obtain the channel state information (CSI) for the design of the digital beamformer. To simplify the system reconfiguration and eliminate the pilot overhead required by the effective channel estimation, we considered an analog-only beamforming (AoBF) architecture in this study. The AoBF is designed with the aim of maximizing the sum rate, which is then transformed into a problem, maximizing the power transmitted to the target user equipment (UE) and meanwhile minimizing the power leaked to the other UEs. To solve this problem, we used beam focusing and beam nulling and proposed two AoBF schemes based on the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm. First, the AoBF scheme based on perfect CSI is proposed, with the focus on the beamforming performance and regardless of the CSI acquisition. Then, the AoBF scheme based on imperfect CSI is proposed, where the low-dimensional imperfect CSI is obtained by beam sweeping based on a near-field codebook. Simulation results demonstrate that the two AoBF schemes can approach the sum rate of the HBF schemes but outperform HBF schemes in terms of energy efficiency (EE).</description>

      <title>Galois self-orthogonal MDS codes with large dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q=p^m$ be a prime power, $e$ be an integer with $0\leq e\leq m-1$ and $s=\gcd(e,m)$. In this paper, for a vector $v$ and a $q$-ary linear code $C$, we give some necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalent code $vC$ of $C$ and the extended code of $vC$ to be $e$-Galois self-orthogonal. From this, we directly obtain some necessary and sufficient conditions for (extended) generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS and EGRS) codes to be $e$-Galois self-orthogonal. Furthermore, for all possible $e$ satisfying $0\leq e\leq m-1$, we classify them into three cases (1) $\frac{m}{s}$ odd and $p$ even; (2) $\frac{m}{s}$ odd and $p$ odd; (3) $\frac{m}{s}$ even, and construct several new classes of $e$-Galois self-orthogonal maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. It is worth noting that our $e$-Galois self-orthogonal MDS codes can have dimensions greater than $\lfloor \frac{n+p^e-1}{p^e+1}\rfloor$, which are not covered by previously known ones. Moreover, by propagation rules, we obtain some new MDS codes with Galois hulls of arbitrary dimensions. As an application, many quantum codes can be obtained from these MDS codes with Galois hulls.</description>

      <title>Spatial Bandwidth of Bilateral Near-Field Channels for Linear Large-Scale Antenna Array System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the spatial bandwidth of line-of-sight (LoS) channels in massive MIMO systems. For the linear large-scale antenna arrays (LSAA) of transceivers placed in random locations in 3D space, a simple but accurate closed-form expression is derived to characterize the spatial bandwidth. Subsequent analysis of the LSAA's spatial bandwidth properties is also provided, leading to the formulation of an approximate expression for the effective degrees of freedom (EDoF) of bilateral near-field channels. Interestingly, as proved in this work, when the transmit and receive arrays are coplanar, with the receive array positioned perpendicular to the axis joining the centroids of the transmit and receive arrays, the EDoF of the LoS channel is found to be approximately maximized.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Analysis of Ghost Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Side channels have become an essential component of many modern information-theoretic schemes. The emerging field of cross technology communications (CTC) provides practical methods for creating intentional side channels between existing communications technologies. This paper describes a theoretical foundation for one such, recently proposed, CTC scheme: Ghost Modulation (GM). Designed to modulate a low-data-rate message atop an existing network stream, GM is particularly suited for transmitting identification or covert information. The implementation only requires firmware updates to existing hardware, making it a cost-effective solution. However, GM provides an interesting technical challenge due to a highly asymmetric binary crossover erasure channel (BCEC) that results from packet drops and network delays. In this work, we provide a mathematical description of the signal and channel models for GM. A heuristic decision rule based on maximum-likelihood principles for simplified channel models is proposed. We describe an algorithm for GM packet acquisition and timing synchronization, supported by simulation results. Several well known short block codes are applied, and bit error rate (BER) results are presented.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Aided 6G Drone Communications: Real-World Datasets and Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the advent of next-generation wireless communication, millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) technologies are pivotal for their high data rate capabilities. However, their reliance on large antenna arrays and narrow directive beams for ensuring adequate receive signal power introduces significant beam training overheads. This becomes particularly challenging in supporting highly-mobile applications such as drone communication, where the dynamic nature of drones demands frequent beam alignment to maintain connectivity. Addressing this critical bottleneck, our paper introduces a novel machine learning-based framework that leverages multi-modal sensory data, including visual and positional information, to expedite and refine mmWave/THz beam prediction. Unlike conventional approaches that solely depend on exhaustive beam training methods, our solution incorporates additional layers of contextual data to accurately predict beam directions, significantly mitigating the training overhead. Additionally, our framework is capable of predicting future beam alignments ahead of time. This feature enhances the system's responsiveness and reliability by addressing the challenges posed by the drones' mobility and the computational delays encountered in real-time processing. This capability for advanced beam tracking asserts a critical advancement in maintaining seamless connectivity for highly-mobile drones. We validate our approach through comprehensive evaluations on a unique, real-world mmWave drone communication dataset, which integrates concurrent camera visuals, practical GPS coordinates, and mmWave beam training data...</description>

      <title>Latent Space Characterization of Autoencoder Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the latent spaces learned by deep learning models is crucial in exploring how they represent and generate complex data. Autoencoders (AEs) have played a key role in the area of representation learning, with numerous regularization techniques and training principles developed not only to enhance their ability to learn compact and robust representations, but also to reveal how different architectures influence the structure and smoothness of the lower-dimensional non-linear manifold. We strive to characterize the structure of the latent spaces learned by different autoencoders including convolutional autoencoders (CAEs), denoising autoencoders (DAEs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs) and how they change with the perturbations in the input. By characterizing the matrix manifolds corresponding to the latent spaces, we provide an explanation for the well-known observation that the latent spaces of CAE and DAE form non-smooth manifolds, while that of VAE forms a smooth manifold. We also map the points of the matrix manifold to a Hilbert space using distance preserving transforms and provide an alternate view in terms of the subspaces generated in the Hilbert space as a function of the distortion in the input. The results show that the latent manifolds of CAE and DAE are stratified with each stratum being a smooth product manifold, while the manifold of VAE is a smooth product manifold of two symmetric positive definite matrices and a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix.</description>

      <title>Location-Driven Programmable Wireless Environments through Light-emitting RIS (LeRIS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As 6G wireless networks seek to enable robust and dynamic programmable wireless environments (PWEs), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a cornerstone for controlling electromagnetic wave propagation. However, realizing the potential of RISs for demanding PWE applications depends on precise and real-time user localization, especially in scenarios with random receiver orientations and inherent hardware imperfections. To address this challenge, we propose a novel optical localization framework that integrates conventional ceiling-mounted LEDs with light-emitting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (LeRISs). By leveraging the spatial diversity offered by the LeRIS architecture, the framework introduces robust signal paths that improve localization accuracy and reduce errors under varying orientations. To this end, we derive a system of equations for received signal strength-based localization that accounts for random receiver orientations and imposes spatial constraints on LED placement, ensuring unique and reliable solutions. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves precise beam control and high spectral efficiency even for RISs with large number of reflecting elements, establishing our solution as scalable and adaptive for PWEs that require real-time accuracy and flexibility.</description>

      <title>Generating Rectifiable Measures through Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive universal approximation results for the class of (countably) $m$-rectifiable measures. Specifically, we prove that $m$-rectifiable measures can be approximated as push-forwards of the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$ using ReLU neural networks with arbitrarily small approximation error in terms of Wasserstein distance. What is more, the weights in the networks under consideration are quantized and bounded and the number of ReLU neural networks required to achieve an approximation error of $\varepsilon$ is no larger than $2^{b(\varepsilon)}$ with $b(\varepsilon)=\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-m}\log^2(\varepsilon))$. This result improves Lemma IX.4 in Perekrestenko et al. as it shows that the rate at which $b(\varepsilon)$ tends to infinity as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero equals the rectifiability parameter $m$, which can be much smaller than the ambient dimension. We extend this result to countably $m$-rectifiable measures and show that this rate still equals the rectifiability parameter $m$ provided that, among other technical assumptions, the measure decays exponentially on the individual components of the countably $m$-rectifiable support set.</description>

Abstract: Sparse binary matrices are of great interest in the field of sparse recovery, nonnegative compressed sensing, statistics in networks, and theoretical computer science. This class of matrices makes it possible to perform signal recovery with lower storage costs and faster decoding algorithms. In particular, Bernoulli$(p)$ matrices formed by independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli$(p)$ random variables are of practical relevance in the context of noise-blind recovery in nonnegative compressed sensing.
  In this work, we investigate the robust nullspace property of Bernoulli$(p)$ matrices. Previous results in the literature establish that such matrices can accurately recover $n$-dimensional $s$-sparse vectors with $m=O\left(\frac{s}{c(p)}\log\frac{en}{s}\right)$ measurements, where $c(p) \le p$ is a constant dependent only on the parameter $p$. These results suggest that in the sparse regime, as $p$ approaches zero, the (sparse) Bernoulli$(p)$ matrix requires significantly more measurements than the minimal necessary, as achieved by standard isotropic subgaussian designs. However, we show that this is not the case.
  Our main result characterizes, for a wide range of sparsity levels $s$, the smallest $p$ for which sparse recovery can be achieved with the minimal number of measurements. We also provide matching lower bounds to establish the optimality of our results and explore connections with the theory of invertibility of discrete random matrices and integer compressed sensing.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication and Channel Discrimination</title>

Abstract: We consider a basic joint communication and sensing setup comprising a transmitter, a receiver and a sensor. The transmitter sends a codeword to the receiver through a discrete memoryless channel, and the receiver is interested in decoding the transmitted codeword. At the same time, the sensor picks up a noisy version of the transmitted codeword through one of two possible discrete memoryless channels. The sensor knows the codeword and wishes to discriminate between the two possible channels, i.e. to identify the channel that has generated the output given the input. We study the trade-off between communication and sensing in the asymptotic regime, captured in terms of the channel coding rate against the two types of discrimination error exponents. We characterize the optimal trade-off between the rate and the exponents for general discrete memoryless channels with an input cost constraint.</description>

      <title>On de Bruijn Arrays Codes, Part I: Nonlinear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A de Bruijn array code is a set of $r \times s$ binary doubly-periodic arrays such that each binary $n \times m$ matrix is contained exactly once as a window in one of the arrays. Such a set of arrays can be viewed as a two-dimensional generalization of a perfect factor in the de Bruijn graph. Necessary conditions for the existence of such codes are given. Several direct constructions and recursive constructions for such arrays are given. A framework for a theory of two-dimensional feedback shift registers which is akin to (one-dimensional) feedback shift registers is suggested in the process.</description>

      <title>Distributed Channel Estimation and Optimization for 6D Movable Antenna: Unveiling Directional Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an innovative technology to improve wireless network capacity by adjusting 3D positions and 3D rotations of antenna surfaces based on channel spatial distribution. However, the existing works on 6DMA have assumed a central processing unit (CPU) to jointly process the signals of all 6DMA surfaces to execute various tasks. This inevitably incurs prohibitively high processing cost for channel estimation. Therefore, we propose a distributed 6DMA processing architecture to reduce processing complexity of CPU by equipping each 6DMA surface with a local processing unit (LPU). In particular, we unveil for the first time a new \textbf{\textit{directional sparsity}} property of 6DMA channels, where each user has significant channel gains only for a (small) subset of 6DMA position-rotation pairs, which can receive direct/reflected signals from users. In addition, we propose a practical three-stage protocol for the 6DMA-equipped base station (BS) to conduct statistical CSI acquisition for all 6DMA candidate positions/rotations, 6DMA position/rotation optimization, and instantaneous channel estimation for user data transmission with optimized 6DMA positions/rotations. Specifically, the directional sparsity is leveraged to develop distributed algorithms for joint sparsity detection and channel power estimation, as well as for directional sparsity-aided instantaneous channel estimation. Using the estimated channel power, we develop a channel power-based optimization algorithm to maximize the ergodic sum rate of the users by optimizing the antenna positions/rotations. Simulation results show that our channel estimation algorithms are more accurate than benchmarks with lower pilot overhead, and our optimization outperforms fluid/movable antennas optimized only in two dimensions (2D), even when the latter have perfect instantaneous CSI.</description>

      <title>Sharper Guarantees for Learning Neural Network Classifiers with Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the data-dependent convergence and generalization behavior of gradient methods for neural networks with smooth activation. Our first result is a novel bound on the excess risk of deep networks trained by the logistic loss, via an alogirthmic stability analysis. Compared to previous works, our results improve upon the shortcomings of the well-established Rademacher complexity-based bounds. Importantly, the bounds we derive in this paper are tighter, hold even for neural networks of small width, do not scale unfavorably with width, are algorithm-dependent, and consequently capture the role of initialization on the sample complexity of gradient descent for deep nets. Specialized to noiseless data separable with margin $\gamma$ by neural tangent kernel (NTK) features of a network of width $\Omega(\text{poly}(\log(n)))$, we show the test-error rate to be $e^{O(L)}/{\gamma^2 n}$, where $n$ is the training set size and $L$ denotes the number of hidden layers. This is an improvement in the test loss bound compared to previous works while maintaining the poly-logarithmic width conditions. We further investigate excess risk bounds for deep nets trained with noisy data, establishing that under a polynomial condition on the network width, gradient descent can achieve the optimal excess risk. Finally, we show that a large step-size significantly improves upon the NTK regime's results in classifying the XOR distribution. In particular, we show for a one-hidden-layer neural network of constant width $m$ with quadratic activation and standard Gaussian initialization that mini-batch SGD with linear sample complexity and with a large step-size $\eta=m$ reaches the perfect test accuracy after only $\ceil{\log(d)}$ iterations, where $d$ is the data dimension.</description>
