      <title>Cr/p-HgCdTe (x = 0.28, 1.0) contact resistance and I-V characteristics in the LTLM configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The specific contact resistance $\rho_c$ of Cr/p-Hg$_{0.72}$Cd$_{0.28}$Te and Cr/p-CdTe/p-Hg$_{0.72}$Cd$_{0.28}$Te heterointerfaces, which were formed by deposition of Cr films at room temperatures on the surfaces of semiconductors, was studied by the Linear Transmission Line Model (LTLM) method. It was observed linear or close to linear behavior of current-voltage (I-V) characteristics at temperatures T = 77 and 300 K. It was assumed that relatively large specific contact resistance $\rho_c$ perhaps is mainly connected with the formation of Cr-oxides and the elements diffusion into Cr layers from the semiconductors under consideration. No intermediate dielectric layer, separating Cr from Hg0.72Cd0.28Te or CdTe layers was observed. It was accepted that the MIGS (metal-induced gap states) model in the semiconductor can be considered to describe the mechanism of current transport through the Cr/p-CdTe/p-Hg$_{0.72}$Cd$_{0.28}$Te and Cd/p-Hg$_{0.72}$Cd$_{0.28}$Te interfaces (Schottky barriers - SBs). The linear or almost linear I-V-characteristics in the LTLM configuration observed can be explained by taking into account the series resistance of bulk semiconductor substrate and low resistance of large area SBs.</description>

      <title>A Phononic Crystal Waveguide Using Surface Waves Below the Sound Cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves are commonly used in a variety of radio-frequency electrical devices as a result of their operation at high frequencies and robust nature. For devices based on Rayleigh-like plane waves, functionality is based on the fact that the Rayleigh wave mode is confined at the solid-air interface. However, to create advanced functionality through the use of phononic crystal structures, standard cylindrical inclusions have been shown to couple Rayleigh modes to the shear horizontal bulk modes and provide a significant pathway to energy loss. We introduce alternative inclusion shapes with a reduced 2-fold symmetry that lowers the speed of the Rayleigh-like surface acoustic wave to below that of the shear horizontal mode. With an eigenfrequency below the sound line, the new mode is confined to the surface with limited coupling and loss to the bulk. Based on these inclusions, an acoustic waveguide design is proposed that demonstrates a strong confinement of wave energy both at the surface and within the waveguide.</description>

      <title>Non-Relativistic Boson Stars as Gravitational Quantum Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of a gravitational bounded cloud of generic bosons or a boson star in the non-relativistic regime, assuming from the very beginning that the boson star is in a Bose-Einstein condensed state. Also, we have taken into account multi-particle interactions within the boson star, which are described through the so-called logarithmic potential. Assuming energy conservation conditions at any time, we are able to describe the boson star as a some kind of gravitational quantum liquid, or more specifically, as a macroscopic gravitational quantum droplet. The assumption of logarithmic interactions, lead us to establish several scenarios in which the system is able to oscillates around the equilibrium radius. The approach analyzed in the present report shows that the interpretation of a boson star as a macroscopic gravitational quantum droplet can be applied to the dynamics analysis of a large number of systems on different size scales.</description>

      <title>Complex Vector Gain-Based Annealer for Minimizing XY Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Complex Vector Gain-Based Annealer (CoVeGA), an analog computing platform designed to overcome energy barriers in XY Hamiltonians through a higher-dimensional representation. Traditional gain-based solvers utilizing optical or photonic hardware typically represent each XY spin with a single complex field. These solvers often struggle with large energy barriers in complex landscapes, leading to relaxation into excited states. CoVeGA addresses these limitations by employing two complex fields to represent each XY spin and dynamically evolving the energy landscape through time-dependent annealing. Operating in a higher-dimensional space, CoVeGA bridges energy barriers in this expanded space during the continuous phase evolution, thus avoiding entrapment in local minima. We introduce several graph structures that pose challenges for XY minimization and use them to benchmark CoVeGA against single-dimension XY solvers, highlighting the benefits of higher-dimensional operation.</description>

      <title>A dualization approach to the Ground State Subspace Classification of Abelian Higher Gauge Symmetry Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the literature, abelian higher gauge symmetry models are shown to be valid in all finite dimensions and exhibit the characteristic behavior of SPT phases models. While the ground state degeneracy and the entanglement entropy were thoroughly studied, the classification of the ground state space still remained obscure. Based on differentio-geometric approach and, anticipating the notation of the current paper, if $\left( C_{\bullet} , \partial^C_{\bullet} \right)$ is the chain complex associated to the geometrical content of these models, while $\left( G_{\bullet} , \partial^G_{\bullet} \right)$ is its symmetries counterpart, we show that the ground state space is classified by a $H^0 (C,G) \times H_0 (C,G)$ group, where $H^0(C,G)$ is the $0$-th cohomology and $H_0 (C,G)$ is the corresponding $0$-th homology group with coefficients in the chain complex.</description>
