      <title>Bound of Casimir Effect by Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kovtun-Son-Starinet bound, we propose that holography impose a lower bound on the Casimir effect. For simplicity, we focus on the Casimir effect between parallel planes for 3d conformal field theories and briefly comment on the generalizations to other boundary shapes and higher dimensions. Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound of the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, Ising model, and $O(N)$ model with $N=2,3$ at critical points. Remarkably, the holographic bound is also obeyed by a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries. It is interesting to find a field-theoretical proof or counterexample for the holographic bound of Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-assisted preparation of topological boundary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust states emerging at the boundaries of a system are an important hallmark of topological matter. Here, using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev chain as examples, we study the impact of a type of experimentally realizable bond dissipation on topological systems by calculating the steady-state density matrix, and demonstrate that such dissipation applied near the system boundary can assist in preparing topological edge states of the parent Hamiltonian, irrespective of the initial state or filling. This effect stems from the matching between the phase distribution encoded in the topological edge states and the target state prepared through bond dissipation. This work provides new insights into the preparation of topological edge states, particularly in the context of Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>GARFIELD, a toolkit for interpreting ultrafast electron diffraction data of imperfect quasi-single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) data from low-symmetry single crystals of small molecules is often challenged by the difficulty of assigning unique Laue indices to the observed Bragg reflections. For a variety of technical and physical reasons, UED diffraction images are typically of lower quality when viewed from the perspective of structure determination by single-crystal X-ray or electron diffraction. Nevertheless, time series of UED images can provide valuable insight into structural dynamics, provided that an adequate interpretation of the diffraction patterns can be achieved. GARFIELD is a collection of tools with a graphical user interface designed to facilitate the interpretation of diffraction patterns and to index Bragg reflections in challenging cases where other indexing tools are ineffective. To this end, GARFIELD enables the user to interactively create, explore, and optimize sets of parameters that define the diffraction geometry and characteristic properties of the sample.</description>

      <title>Anomalous spectrum in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectra of particles in disordered lattices can either be completely extended or localized or can be intermediate which hosts both the localized and extended states separated from each other. In this work, however, we show that in the case of a one dimensional lattice with long-range hopping and non-Hermitian quasiperiodic onsite potential, the localized and extended states in the spectrum are intermixed with each other rather than well separated. As a result, an atypical intermediate phase appears where consecutive pairs of extended states intermittently appear in the pool of localized states. We also argue that such anomalous spectral intermixing can be realized in the short-range hopping limit by appropriate engineering of the onsite potential. Moreover, we obtain that the nature of the spectrum also reveals non-standard scenarios in the complex energy plane where the complex energies encircle real ones. These findings shed light on the intricate interplay between the non-Hermiticity and quasiperiodic disorder in the system.</description>

      <title>Parrondo's paradox in quantum walks with inhomogeneous coins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parrondo's paradox, a counterintuitive phenomenon where two losing strategies combine to produce a winning outcome, has been a subject of interest across various scientific fields, including quantum mechanics. In this study, we investigate the manifestation of Parrondo's paradox in discrete-time quantum walks. We demonstrate the existence of Parrondo's paradox using space and time-dependent coins without the need for a higher-dimensional coin or adding decoherence to the system. Our results enhance the feasibility of practical implementations and provide deeper insights into the underlying quantum dynamics, specifically the propagation constrained by the interference pattern of quantum walks. The implications of our results suggest the potential for more accessible and efficient designs in quantum transport, broadening the scope and application of Parrondo's paradox beyond conventional frameworks.</description>

      <title>Tower of Structured Excited States from Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing highly entangled quantum states is a key challenge in quantum metrology and quantum information science. Measurements, especially those of global observables, offer a simple and efficient way to generate entanglement between subsystems when they are measured as a whole. We introduce a log-depth protocol leveraging quantum phase estimation to measure a global observable, such as total magnetization and momentum. We demonstrate its capability to prepare towers of structured excited states that are useful in quantum metrology; examples include quantum many-body scars in various models, including the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, the constrained domain-wall model, and the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-$1$ XX chains. The same method is also applicable to preparing the Dicke states of high weight. In addition, we propose a protocol for momentum measurement that avoids disturbing the system, facilitating the preparation of states beyond the above construction, such as the Arovas $A$ state of the AKLT Hamiltonian. Our results expand the utility of measurement-based approaches to accessing highly entangled states in quantum many-body systems.</description>
