      <title>WCCC in Gedankenexperiments at All Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) through Gedankenexperiments involving black hole perturbations induced by test particles. Our approach allows for the calculation of perturbations to any order for a general class of black holes that admit the zero-temperature extremal limit. We find that the WCCC for extremal and near-extremal black holes is hinged upon the positive sign of only one quantity, namely $W=\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right)_{Q_\alpha ; T=0}$, which is indeed positive for all the well-known black holes.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian theory-inspired framework for characterizing eccentricity in gravitational waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing eccentricity in gravitational waveforms in a consistent manner is crucial to facilitate parameter estimation, astrophysical population studies, as well as searches for these rare systems. We present a framework to characterize eccentricity directly from gravitational waveforms for non-precessing eccentric binary black hole (BBH) mergers using common modulations that eccentricity induces in all spherical harmonic modes of the signals. Our framework is in the spirit of existing methods that use frequency modulations in the waveforms, but we refine the approach by connecting it to state-of-the-art post-Newtonian calculations of the time evolution of the eccentricity. Using 39 numerical relativity (NR) simulations from the SXS and RIT catalogs, as well as waveforms obtained from the post-Newtonian approximation and effective-one-body (EOB) formalism, we show that our framework provides eccentricity estimates that connect smoothly into the relativistic regime (even up to $\sim 2M$ before merger). We also find that it is necessary to carry existing post-Newtonian calculations to an extra $0.5$PN order to adequately characterize existing NR simulations, and provide fits to the extra coefficient for existing simulations. We make the framework publicly available through the Python-based \texttt{gwModels} package.</description>

      <title>Structure formation in the local Universe and the cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure formation in the local Universe is considered within the weak-field modification of General Relativity involving the cosmological constant. This approach enables to describe the dynamics of groups and clusters of galaxies, to explain the discrepancy in the observational properties of the local (late) and the global (early) Universe, i.e. the Hubble tension as a result of two flows, local and global ones, with non-equal Hubble parameters. The kinetic analysis with the modified gravitational potential involving the cosmological constant is shown to predict semi-periodical structure of filaments in the local universe. In the local scale this complements the Zeldovich pancake theory of evolution of the primordial density perturbations and of structure formation in the cosmological scale. The role of the cosmological constant is outlined in rescaling of the physical constants from one aeon to another within the Conformal Cyclic Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of the shockwave dynamics in effective loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherically symmetric effective dust collapse inspired by effective loop quantum cosmology predicts a bounce when the stellar energy density becomes planckian, which in turn inevitably leads to shell-crossing singularity formation. An extension of the spacetime beyond such singularities is possible through weak solutions of the equations of motion in integral form, leading to the shockwave model. In this work, we show explicitly that such an extension is not unique, and that relevant features like the black hole life-time strongly depend on the choice of the integral form of the equation of motion.</description>

      <title>Displacement memory and B-memory in generalised Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) memory effect is studied in the context of generalised Ellis-Bronnikov (GEB) wormholes. We solved the geodesic equations in this wormhole spacetime, in the presence of a GW pulse. The resulting evolution of the geodesic separation shows the presence of displacement and velocity memory. Memory effect due to a gravitational wave ensures that there is a permanent effect on spacetime geometry. The corresponding geodesic evolution, being metric dependent, would display distinct results in each case. Motivated by the same, we study further aspects of memory effect on the geodesic congruences, known as the B-memory, by solving the Raychaudhuri equations. Since future GW detectors will be able to probe the memory effect, our work presents GEB spacetime as a black hole mimicker with distinguishing features.</description>

      <title>Observational signature of Lorentz violation in acceleration radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Lorentz violation (LV) has emerged as a vibrant area of research in fundamental physics. Despite predictions from quantum gravity theories that Lorentz symmetry may break down at Planck-scale energies, which are currently beyond experimental reach, its low-energy signatures could still be detectable through alternative methods. In this paper, we propose a quantum optical approach to investigate potential LV effects on the acceleration radiation of a freely falling atom within a black hole spacetime coupled to a Lorentz-violating vector field. Our proposed experimental setup employs a Casimir-type apparatus, wherein a two-level atom serves as a dipole detector, enabling its interaction with the field to be modeled using principles from quantum optics. We demonstrate that LV can introduce distinct quantum signatures into the radiation flux, thereby significantly modulating particle emission rates. It is found that while LV effects are negligible at high mode frequencies, they become increasingly pronounced at lower frequencies. This suggests that detecting LV at low-energy scales may depend on advancements in low-frequency observational techniques or detectors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article I study how the problem of time of canonical approaches to quantum gravity affects the simple minisuperspace models used in quantum cosmology. I follow some authors who have argued that this issue makes the quantization of general relativity problematic to conclude that the same applies in the case of quantum cosmology. In particular, I argue that temporal structures are lost in quantization and that this is a problem, as they encode part of the empirical content of classical cosmology, such as the age of the universe.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits of neutral test particles in Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m naked singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct studies on Levin's taxonomy of periodic orbits for neutral test particles around a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m naked singularity. It was known that naked singularities could harbor two distinct regions of time-like bound orbits and thus we expect periodic orbits to appear in both regions. It is possible for a pair of periodic orbits from both regions to possess the exact same angular momentum $L$ and energy $E$ values. We chart the sets of periodic orbits in $(L,E)$-parameter space and highlight the general distribution pattern of these sets for three possible scenarios. Regions within $(L,E)$-space can be partitioned into multiple domains $\mathcal{D}_k$ based on the roots configuration of the quartic polynomial $P(u)$ where $u$ is the inverse radial coordinate. Consequently, each domain and interestingly enough, portions of certain periodic orbits sets that lie in different $\mathcal{D}_k$ require different analytical solutions to plot the resulting orbit. Furthermore, we uncover physical properties of some hypothetical circular orbits residing in the inner region from analysing the $(L,E)$-space.</description>

Abstract: In the last decade, the ringdown community has made large strides in understanding the aftermath of binary black hole mergers through the study of numerical simulations. In this note, we introduce two flavors of fitting algorithms, that have been verified against each other, for the extraction of quasinormal mode amplitudes from ringdown waveforms - $\texttt{qnmfits}$ in Python and $\texttt{KerrRingdown}$ in Mathematica.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hubble Tension Alleviation through Neutrino-Coupled Perturbed $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the Hubble constant (\(H_0\)) tension within the frameworks of perturbed \(f(R)\) gravity and perturbed \(f(R)\) gravity coupled with neutrinos, using lastest observational data. The datasets incorporate the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), lensing, and Pantheon supernovae. We compare the ability of these models to bridge the discrepancy between Planck 2018 (\(H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5 \ \text{km/s/Mpc}\)) and the local R22 measurement (\(H_0 = 73.5 \pm 1.04 \ \text{km/s/Mpc}\)). In perturbed \(f(R)\) gravity, the derived \(H_0\) values align closely with Planck, leaving a substantial tension with R22. The inclusion of neutrino interactions introduces additional parameters that shift \(H_0\) toward higher values, reducing the tension with local measurements. Notably, the coupled model achieves a smaller residual tension compared to the standalone perturbed \(f(R)\) model, indicating that neutrino physics plays a significant role in modifying the late-time expansion dynamics. While both models provide insights into addressing the Hubble tension, the coupled \(f(R)\) gravity with neutrinos offers a more consistent alignment across the datasets.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis of CCDM cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed investigation of the CCDM (creation of cold dark matter) cosmologies using the powerful techniques of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. Considering a wide variety of the creation rates ranging from constant to dynamical, we examine the nature of critical points and their stability obtained from the individual scenario consisting of only cold dark matter, or cold dark matter plus a second fluid with constant equation of state. According to our analyses, these scenarios predict unstable dark matter dominated critical points, stable accelerating attractors dominated either by dark matter or the second fluid, scaling attractors in which both dark matter and the second fluid co-exist. Along with these critical points, these scenarios also indicate the possibility of decelerating attractors or decelerating scaling attractors in the future which are new results in this direction. These altogether suggest that CCDM cosmologies are viable alternatives to the mainstream cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Degenerate higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories linear in the curvature tensor and quadratic in the derivatives of the electromagnetic field strength whose kinetic matrices are degenerate. This provides a generalisation of quadratic degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories for a U(1) gauge field. After establishing a classification of the independent Lagrangians, we obtain all the theories with at most third order field equations involving only second order derivatives of the metric, thus generalising Horndeski's quadratic theory for a gauge field. Some of these are shown to be conformally invariant. We then classify degenerate non-minimally coupled interactions, obtaining all conformally invariant ones. Finally, we investigate the effect of U(1)-preserving disformal transformations on these degenerate Lagrangians. The ``mimetic" singular transformations are obtained and new ghost-free degenerate theories are generated.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Kerr-Newman black hole from Noncommutative Einstein-Maxwell equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we introduce the noncommutative geometry into the standard Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell action via the $\partial_t\wedge\partial_\phi$ Drinfeld twist and solve the equation of motion pertubatively in the expansion of the noncommutative parameter $a$. The equation of motion, the NC Einstein-Maxwell equation, turns out to be effectively a problem in nonlinear electrodynamics where the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ obtains correction terms with three Faraday tensors $F_{\mu\nu}$. A solution with nonzero $a^1$ terms turns out to be the Kerr-Newman black hole modified with nonzero $g_{t\theta}, g_{r\phi}, g_{tr}$ and $g_{\phi\theta}$ components proportional to $a$, while the electromagnetic potential is the Seiberg-Witten expanded Kerr-Newman potential which introduces a nonzero $A_{\theta}$ term proportional to $a$.</description>

      <title>Running Love Numbers and the Effective Field Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive states produce higher derivative corrections to Einstein gravity in the infrared, which are encoded into operators of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of gravity. These EFT operators modify the geometry and affect the tidal properties of black holes, either neutral or charged. A thorough analysis of the perturbative tidal deformation problem leads us to introduce a tidal Green function, which we use to derive two universal formulae that efficiently provide the constant and running Love numbers induced by the EFT. We apply these formulae to determine the tidal response of EFT-corrected non-spinning black holes induced by vector and tensor fields, reproducing existing results where available and deriving new ones. We find that neutral black hole Love numbers run classically for $l\geq 3$ while charged ones run for $l\geq2$. Insights from the Frobenius method and from EFT principles confirm that the Love number renormalization flow is a well-defined physical effect. We find that extremal black holes can have Love numbers much larger than neutral ones, up to ${\cal O}(1)$ within the EFT validity regime, and that the EFT cutoff corresponds to the exponential suppression of the Schwinger effect. We discuss the possibility of probing an Abelian dark sector through gravitational waves, considering a scenario in which dark-charged extremal black holes exist in the present-day Universe.</description>

      <title>Extended Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy: Ghost Condensate Dark Energy with Sextic Dispersion Relation in de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our studies of the ghost condensate (GC) with sixth-order dispersion relation. Contrary to the GC with quartic dispersion relation, we find that the correction to the Newtonian potential explicitly depends on the space and time dependence of matter density. At late times when the Newtonian potential becomes time-independent, one obtains similar oscillatory behavior at the distance $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{M^2}$, but this time at the time scale $\frac{M^4}{M_\textrm{Pl}^3}$, where $M^2$ is the ghost field velocity. We also show that the speed of gravitational wave is modified in a frequency dependent manner at momenta close to $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{\sqrt{|\sigma_1|}}$, where $\sigma_1$ is the coefficient of $\gamma^{ij} \nabla_i K_{lr} \nabla_j K^{lr}$ operator in the unitary gauge action.</description>

      <title>Geometric modular flows in 2d CFT and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study geometric modular flows in two-dimensional conformal field theories. We explore which states exhibit a geometric modular flow with respect to a causally complete subregion and, conversely, how to construct a state from a given geometric modular flow. Given suitable boundary conditions, we find that generic geometric modular flows in the Rindler wedge are conformally equivalent. Based on this insight, we show how conformal unitaries can be used to explicitly construct a state for each flow. We analyze these states, deriving general formulas for the energy density and entanglement entropy. We also consider geometric flows beyond the Rindler wedge setting, and in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the effect of localizing quantum field degrees of freedom by dynamically growing cavity walls through a time-dependent potential. We use our results to show that it is possible to do this without introducing non-negligible mixedness in localized modes of the field. We discuss how this addresses the concerns, raised in previous literature, that the high degree of entanglement of regular states in QFT may hinder relativistic quantum information protocols that make use of localized relativistic probes.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Entropy, Quantum Corrections and EFT Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit and study quantum corrections to the supersymmetric entropy of BPS black holes in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ effective field theories (EFTs), which can be obtained from Type IIA string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold. Macroscopically, these corrections arise from an infinite series of higher-derivative F-terms that encode certain modifications to the two-derivative supergravity effective action. Within the large volume regime, we analyze in detail the moduli dependence of these semi-classical contributions and explore their implications for the black hole entropy. As a byproduct, we show that the entropy captures, in a rather intricate way, the transition between four- and five-dimensional dual EFT descriptions. In fact, the expansion parameter $\alpha$ controlling the relevant asymptotic series can be related to the ratio of the black hole horizon and the Kaluza-Klein scale, given here by the inverse D0-brane mass. Furthermore, we are able to resum the series into a well-behaved convergent expression for all values of $\alpha$. This demonstrates, in turn, that (stable) black holes can, indeed, probe scales besides the quantum gravity cutoff. More precisely, by examining two representative BPS systems --the D0-D2-D4 and D2-D6 black hole solutions-- we explicitly illustrate how highly non-local (perturbative) quantum effects resolve the divergences, ultimately leading to a well-defined entropy function. Additionally, in certain cases, we show that one can take a suitable decompactification limit to 5d and verify that the corrected entropy function reproduces the exact microstate counting of the underlying five-dimensional black string. Our results also clarify the role of non-perturbative quantum corrections, which, remarkably, do not modify any of our prior conclusions.</description>

      <title>Love numbers of black p-branes: fine tuning, Love symmetries, and their geometrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute scalar static response coefficients (Love numbers) of non-dilatonic black $p$-brane solutions in higher dimensional supergravity. This calculation revels a fine-tuning behavior similar to that of higher dimensional black holes, which we explain by ``hidden'' near-zone Love symmetries. In general, these symmetries act on equations for perturbations but they are not background isometries. The Love symmetry of charged $p=0$ branes is described by the usual $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebra. For $p=1$ the Love symmetry has an algebraic structure $SL(2,\mathbb{R})\times SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. The $p=0,1$ Love symmetries reduce to isometries of the near-horizon Schwarzschild-AdS$_{p+2}$ metric in the near-extremal finite temperature limit. They further reduce to the AdS$_{p+2}$ isometries in the extremal zero-temperature limit. We call this process geometrization. In contrast, for the $p&gt;1$ cases, the Love symmetry is always an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, and there is no limit in which it becomes geometric. We interpret geometrization and its absence as a consequence of the local equivalence between the Schwarzschild-AdS$_{p+2}$ and pure AdS$_{p+2}$ spaces for $p=0,1$, which does not hold for $p&gt;1$. We also show that the static Love numbers of extremal $p$-branes are always zero regardless of spacetime dimensionality, which contrasts starkly with the non-extremal case. Overall, our results suggest that the Love symmetry is hidden by nature, and it can acquire a geometric meaning only if the background has an AdS$_{2}$ or AdS$_{3}$ limit.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov emission by fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon &gt; 1$ produces Cherenkov emission. This is a new physical effect: classical (non-quantum) emission of electromagnetic waves by a completely charge-neutral ``particle''. The governing equations (involving General Relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous media) have no external electromagnetic source - it is the distortion of the initial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the role of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual Cherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c &gt; 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Unlike Cherenkov emission by a point charge, the effective source in this case is spatially distributed, with emission generated along the single Cherenkov emission cone. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $\propto dk_z /|k_z|$ for wave numbers $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_G$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Probing intermediate-mass black hole binaries with the Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New concepts for observing the gravitational waves (GWs) using a detector on the Moon, such as the Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna (LGWA), have gained increasing attention. By utilizing the Moon as a giant antenna, the LGWA is expected to detect GWs in the frequency range from 1 millihertz (mHz) to several hertz, with optimal sensitivity in the decihertz band. Despite the debated formation and evolution channel of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses in the range of $[10^2, 10^5]\ {\rm M_\odot}$, binary systems containing at least one IMBH are widely believed to generate GWs spanning from mHz to a few Hz, making them a key scientific target for the LGWA. We explore the detectability of IMBH binaries with the LGWA in this work. The LGWA is more sensitive to nearby binaries (i.e. with redshift $z\lesssim0.5$) with the primary mass $m_1 \in [10^4, 10^5] \ {\rm M_\odot}$, while it prefers distant binaries (i.e. $z \gtrsim 5$) with $m_1 \in [10^3, 10^4] \ {\rm M_\odot}$. Considering a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 10, our results imply that the LGWA can detect IMBH binaries up to $z \sim \mathcal{O}(10)$. We further show that the LGWA can constrain the primary mass with relative errors $\lesssim 0.1\%$ for binaries at $z \lesssim 0.5$. Furthermore, we show that the IMBH binaries at $z \lesssim 0.1$ can be used to constrain redshift with relative errors $\lesssim 10\%$, and those with $m_1 \in [10^4, 10^5] \ {\rm M_\odot}$ can be localized by the LGWA to be within $\mathcal{O} (10)$ $\rm deg^2$.</description>

      <title>SACRA-2D: New axisymmetric general relativistic hydrodynamics code with fixed mesh refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \texttt{SACRA-2D}, a new MPI and OpenMP parallelized, fully relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) code in dynamical spacetime under axial symmetry with the cartoon method using the finite-volume shock-capturing schemes for hydrodynamics. Specifically, we implemented the state-of-the-art HLLC Riemann solver and found better accuracy than the standard Total Variation Diminishing Lax-Friedrich Riemann solver. The spacetime evolves under the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura formalism with Z4c constraint propagation. We demonstrate the accuracy of the code with some benchmark tests and excellent agreement with other codes in the literature. A wide variety of test simulations, including the head-on collision of black holes, the migration and collapse of neutron stars, and the collapse of a rotating supermassive star to a massive black hole and a disk, is also performed to show the robustness of our new code.</description>

      <title>Heat engines for scale invariant systems dual to black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to holography, a black hole is dual to a thermal state in a strongly coupled quantum system. The principle example of holography is the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. We construct reversible heat engines where the working substance consists of a static thermal equilibrium state of a CFT. For thermal states dual to an asymptotically AdS black hole, this yields a novel realization of Johnson's holographic heat engines. We compute the efficiency for a number of idealized heat engines, such as the Carnot, Brayton, Otto, Diesel, and Stirling cycles. The efficiency of most heat engines can be derived from the CFT equation of state, which follows from scale invariance, and we compare them to the efficiencies for an ideal gas. However, the Stirling efficiency for a generic CFT is uniquely determined in terms of its characteristic temperature and volume only in the high-temperature or large-volume regime. We derive an exact expression for the Stirling efficiency for CFT states dual to AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, and compare the subleading corrections in the high-temperature regime with those in a generic CFT.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Calipers: Precise and Accurate Neutron Star Radius Measurements with Next-Generation Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from merging binary neutron stars carry characteristic information about their astrophysical properties, including masses and tidal deformabilities, that are needed to infer their radii. In this study, we use Bayesian inference to quantify the precision with which radius can inferred with upgrades in the current gravitational wave detectors and next-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We assign evidences for a set of plausible equations of state, which are then used as weights to obtain radius posteriors. We find that prior choices and the loudness of observed signals limit the precision and accuracy of inferred radii by current detectors. In contrast, next-generation observatories can resolve the radius precisely and accurately, across most of the mass range to within $\lesssim 5\%$ for both soft and stiff equations of state. We also explore how the choice of the neutron star mass prior can influence the inferred masses and potentially affect radii measurements, finding that choosing an astrophysically motivated prior does not notably impact an individual neutron star's radius measurements.</description>

Abstract: We analyze cosmography as a tool to constrain modified gravity theories. We take four distinct models and obtain their parameters in terms of the cosmographic parameters favored by observational data of strong gravitational lensing. We contrast with the values obtained by direct comparison between each model and the observational data. In general, we find consistency between the two approaches at 2$\sigma$ for all models considered in this work. Our study bridges the gap between theoretical predictions of modified gravity and empirical observations of strong gravitational lensing, providing a simple methodology to test the validity of these models.</description>

Abstract: We consider a scalar field coupled to the torsion in Teleparallel Gravity with a coupling function that does not allow for a tachyonic instability to occur, and it leads to the formation of new black holes with scalar hair. The scalarized black hole solutions are asymptotically flat, and they are studied under their thermodynamics, and we show that they are meta-stable solutions without phase transitions of first and second order. Also, we demonstrate the existence of distinct branches of solutions classified by the number of nodes of the scalar field. For the branches analysed, the scalarized solutions have lower free energy than the Schwarzschild black hole; therefore, they are always thermodinamically preferred. Also, we show that the scalarized black holes are entropically favoured compared to the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravitational Lensing Effects of the Rotating Short-Haired Black Hole and Constraints from EHT Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the short hairs that have a significant impact only near the event horizon, studying their strong gravitational lensing effects is of great significance for revealing the properties of these hairs. In this study, we systematically investigated the strong gravitational lensing effects in the rotating short-haired black hole and constrained its hair parameter $Q_m$. Specifically, \(Q_m\) causes the event horizon radius, photon - orbit radius, and impact parameter to be lower than those of the Kerr black hole. Regarding the lensing coefficients \(\bar{a}\) and \(\bar{b}\), as the spin parameter \(a\) increases, \(\bar{a}\) shows an increasing trend, while \(\bar{b}\) shows a decreasing trend. In the observational simulations of M87* and Sgr A*, the angular position and angular distance of the relativistic image increase with the increase of \(a\), while the magnification of the image shows an opposite trend. The existence of \(Q_m\) only intensifies these trends. More importantly, the rotating short-haired black hole exhibits a significant difference in time delay compared to other black hole models. Especially in the simulation of M87*, the time delay deviation between the rotating short-haired black hole and the Kerr black hole, as well as the Kerr-Newman black hole, can reach dozens of hours. Through a comparative analysis with the observational data from the EHT, we effectively constrain the parameter space of the rotating short-haired black hole. The results indicate that this model has potential application prospects in explaining cosmic black hole phenomena and provides a possible theoretical basis for differentiating between different black hole models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric optics effectively describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves when the wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of the medium, making wave phenomena like diffraction negligible. As a result, light propagation in a vacuum is typically modeled by rays that follow null geodesics. However, general relativity predicts that polarization-dependent deviations from these geodesics occur in an inhomogeneous gravitational field. In this article, we evaluate the corrections for the deflection and emission of light by a massive gravitating body. Additionally, we derive the scaling behavior of the physical parameters characterizing the trajectories. The calculations are performed at leading order in frequency. We use these results to assess the significance of the birefringence effect in various astrophysical observations. We find that the effect cannot be measured with current instruments but may be detectable in the near future.</description>

Abstract: We study the effective temperature, as a rate of gravitational redshift, of the Hawking modes perceived by a radially free falling observer at an arbitrary location in a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-(anti-)de Sitter [RN(A)dS] spacetime. In particular, the behavior of the modes at the inner horizon, and therein the validity of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture under the effective temperature formalism, has been analyzed across the physically permissible parameter space of the RNdS metric. The modes perceived by observers of both positive and negative specific energies have been taken into consideration. Finally, the behavior of the adiabatic control function has been examined over the position space of the observer to determine the regimes where the effective temperature function yields a Planckian spectrum of thermal radiation.</description>

Abstract: There exist two consistent theories of self-interacting gravitons: general relativity and Weyl transverse gravity. The latter has the same classical solutions as general relativity, but different local symmetries. We argue that Weyl transverse gravity also naturally arises from thermodynamic arguments. In particular, we show that thermodynamic equilibrium of local causal diamonds together with the strong equivalence principle encodes the gravitational dynamics of Weyl transverse gravity rather than general relativity. We obtain this result in a self-consistent way, verifying the validity of our initial assumptions, i.e. the proportionality between entropy and area and the different versions of the equivalence principle in Weyl transverse gravity. Furthermore, we extend the thermodynamic derivation of the equations of motion from Weyl transverse gravity to a class of modified theories of gravity with the same local symmetries. For this purpose, we employ the general expression for Wald entropy in such theories.</description>

      <title>Wigner distributions in Rindler spacetime and nonvacuum Minkowski states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1970s, Fulling, Davies, and Unruh demonstrated that the vacuum state perceived by an inertial observer in Minkowski space appears as a thermal bath to a uniformly accelerated observer. We explore the transformation of the Wigner distribution of a real scalar field from an inertial to a Rindler frame, utilizing both Minkowski and Unruh modes. We present a general expression for the reduced Wigner distribution for a specific set of massless scalar field configurations, and validate it against known distributions within this set. This includes arbitrary Gaussian states of Unruh-Minkowski modes, the Minkowski vacuum state, the Rindler vacuum, and the thermal bath of Unruh particles. Additionally, we analyze several other distributions, such as a uniform momentum distribution, a slight deviation from the Minkowski vacuum, and a distribution with a Fermionic component in the Rindler frame. The conclusions are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Penrose-type inequality for static spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a lower bound on the total mass of the time slices of (n + 1)-dimensional asymptotically flat standard static spacetimes under the timelike convergence condition. The inequality can be viewed equivalently as a Minkowski-type inequality in these spaces, i.e. as a lower bound on the total mean curvature of the boundary, and thus extends inequalities from [3], [22], [19], and [10]. Equality is achieved only by slices of Schwarzschild space and is related to the characterization of quasi-spherical static vacuum metrics from [10]. As a notable special case of the main inequality, we obtain the Riemannian Penrose inequality in all dimensions for static spaces under the TCC.</description>

      <title>Finitely supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole and its perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finitely supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole possesses nontrivial super-Lorentz charges compared with the standard one. This may impact the quasinormal modes of the black hole. Since the Einstein's equations are generally covariant, the quasinormal modes of a supertranslated black hole can be obtained by supertranslating the familiar results for a standard black hole. It turns out that the supertranslated quasinormal modes can be obtained by simply shifting the retarded time of the standard modes by an angle-dependent function parameterizing the supertranslation. Therefore, the supertranslated quasinormal modes oscillate at the same frequencies and decay at the same rates as the corresponding standard ones. The supertranslated metric is time translation invariant, but does not explicitly respect spherical symmetries, although it is implicitly rotationally symmetric. So the supertranslated perturbations can still be written as linear combinations of the eigenfunctions of the generalized angular momentum operators for the underlying rotational symmetry. With a suitably defined asymptotic parity transformation, any perturbation can be decomposed into the even and odd parity parts. Then, one may conclude that the isospectrality still holds. To detect such supertranslated quasinormal modes, one has to place multiple gravitational wave interferometers around the supertranslated black hole, and measure the differences in the time shifts between interferometers. Gravitational lensing may also be helpful in the same spirit.</description>

      <title>Local coordinates and motion of a test particle in the McVittie spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the orbital motion of a test particle in the gravitational field of a massive body (that might be a black hole) with mass $m$ placed on the expanding cosmological manifold described by the McVittie metric. We introduce the local coordinates attached to the massive body to eliminate nonphysical, coordinates-dependent effects associated with Hubble expansion. The resultant equation of motion of the test particle are analyzed by the method of osculating elements with application of time-averaging technique. We demonstrate that the orbit of the test particle is not subject to the cosmological expansion up to the terms of the second order in the Hubble parameter. However, the cosmological expansion causes the precession of the orbit of the test particle with time and changes the frequency of the mean orbital motion. We show that the direction of motion of the orbital precession depends on the Hubble parameter as well as the deceleration parameter of the universe. We give numeric estimates for the rate of the orbital precession with respect to time due to the cosmological expansion in case of several astrophysical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entangled Relativity is a non-linear reformulation of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (General Relativity) that offers a more parsimonious formulation. This non-linear approach notably requires the simultaneous definition of matter fields, thus aligning more closely with Einstein's \textit{principle of relativity of inertia} than General Relativity does. Solutions for spherically charged black holes have already been identified. After exploring further some of the properties of these solutions, we present new solutions for the field equations pertaining to slowly rotating charged black holes.</description>

      <title>The Confluent Heun functions in Black Hole Perturbation Theory: a spacetime interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides a spacetime interpretation of the confluent Heun functions within black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) and explores their relationship to the hyperboloidal framework. In BHPT, the confluent Heun functions are solutions to the radial Teukolsky equation, but they are traditionally studied without an explicit reference to the underlying spacetime geometry. Here, we show that the distinct behaviour of these functions near their singular points reflects the structure of key surfaces in black hole spacetimes. By interpreting homotopic transformations of the confluent Heun functions as changes in the spacetime foliation, we connect these solutions to different regions of the black hole's global structure, such as the past and future event horizons, past and future null infinity, spatial infinity, and even past and future timelike infinity. We also discuss the relationship between the confluent Heun functions and the hyperboloidal formulation of the Teukolsky equation. Although neither confluent Heun form of the radial Teukolsky equation can be interpreted as hyperboloidal slices, this approach offers new insights into wave propagation and scattering from a global black hole spacetime perspective.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Torsion, Extrinsic Torsion, and the Hubble Parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the intrinsic and extrinsic torsions (defined by analogy with the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures) of the spatial sections of torsional spacetimes. We consider two possibilities. First, that the intrinsic torsion might prove to be directly observable. Second, that it is not observable, having been ``inflated away'' in the early Universe. We argue that, even in this second case, the extrinsic torsion may grow during the inflationary era and be non-negligible at reheating and thereafter. Even if the spatial intrinsic curvature and torsion are too small to be detected directly, then, the extrinsic torsion might not be. We point out that, if its presence is not recognised, the extrinsic torsion could lead to anomalies in the theoretical estimate of the Hubble parameter -- $\,$ a result with obvious potential applications. We stress that extrinsic torsion is by far the most natural way to produce such anomalies, simply because it mixes naturally with the Hubble parameter; that is, the second fundamental form of a spacelike section depends on a sum of two terms, one determined by the Hubble parameter, the other by the extrinsic torsion.</description>

      <title>Light rings and shadows of static black holes in effective quantum gravity II: A new solution without Cauchy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the three known types of static solutions proposed within the Hamiltonian constraint approach to effective quantum gravity (EQG), the first two have been extensively investigated, whereas the third type-which preserves general covariance, is free of Cauchy horizons, and was only recently obtained-remains relatively unexplored. This solution can describe a black hole with an event horizon for certain parameter ranges, or a horizonless compact object beyond those ranges. In this paper, we focus on the third type and show that its light rings feature both stable and unstable branches, and that the black hole shadow size grows with the quantum parameter-unlike in the first two types. However, when we account for both the shadow and the lensing ring, the overall behavior closely resembles that of the second type, in which an increasing quantum parameter leads to a larger portion of the lensing ring being occupied by the shadow. This feature can serve as a hallmark of black holes in EQG, offering a potential way to distinguish them from their GR counterparts. Remarkably, the parameter ranges under which the solution remains a black hole are highly consistent with the current observational constraints on black hole shadows, lending strong support to the classification of the third type of compact object in EQG as a black hole endowed with an event horizon.</description>

      <title>Significant increase in sensitive volume of a gravitational wave search upon including higher harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most gravitational wave searches to date have included only the quadrupole mode in their search templates. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating higher harmonics improves the search sensitive volume for detecting binary black hole mergers, challenging the conclusion of previous studies. Using the $\tt{IAS-HM}$ detection pipeline, and the simulated (injection) signals from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration, we quantify the improvement in sensitivity due to the inclusion of higher harmonics. This improvement is significant for systems with higher mass ratios and larger total masses, with gains in sensitivity even exceeding $100\%$ at certain high masses. We also show that, due to using a marginalized detection statistic, the $\tt{IAS-HM}$ pipeline performs roughly as well as its quadrupole-mode-only counterpart even for equal mass-ratio mergers, and its sensitive volume is either better than or comparable to that of the individual LVK pipelines.</description>

      <title>Cosmological quantum mechanics on FLRW spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply our recent formulation of general relativistic quantum mechanics to the case of an FLRW cosmological background. The formalism comes from noncommutative geometry and provides an operator version of the equations of a geodesic, while its Schroedinger picture has wave functions on spacetime and evolution by the Klein-Gordon operator and with respect to geodesic proper time. Stationary states in this Klein-Gordon quantum mechanics are solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation for different eigenvalues and in the case of positive spatial curvature we find a discrete spectrum of cosmological atom-like modes. For nonstationary states, we show that the system can be factorised and appears for each spatial Laplacian eigenvector as a novel 1-dimensional quantum system on the time axis with potential $1/a(t)^2$, where $a(t)$ is the Friedmann expansion factor. We also show how this is relevant to quantum mechanics on space with respect to time $t$, identifying potentially new physics when the Hubble constant exceeds $2/3$ of the particle mass, as typically occurs during inflation. We also find washout of the evolution of spatial observables at late times and a backward-traveling reflected mode generated when the value of $H$ transitions to a larger value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.01695v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamentals of quantum field theory on a rigid de Sitter space. We show that the perturbative expansion of late-time correlation functions to all orders can be equivalently generated by a non-unitary Lagrangian on a Euclidean AdS geometry. This finding simplifies dramatically perturbative computations, as well as allows us to establish basic properties of these correlators, which comprise a Euclidean CFT. We use this to infer the analytic structure of the spectral density that captures the conformal partial wave expansion of a late-time four-point function, to derive an OPE expansion, and to constrain the operator spectrum. Generically, dimensions and OPE coefficients do not obey the usual CFT notion of unitarity. Instead, unitarity of the de Sitter theory manifests itself as the positivity of the spectral density. This statement does not rely on the use of Euclidean AdS Lagrangians and holds non-perturbatively. We illustrate and check these properties by explicit calculations in a scalar theory by computing first tree-level, and then full one-loop-resummed exchange diagrams. An exchanged particle appears as a resonant feature in the spectral density which can be potentially useful in experimental searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results in relativistic quantum information and quantum thermodynamics have independently shown that in the quantum regime, a system may fail to thermalise when subject to quantum-controlled application of the same, single thermalisation channel. For example, an accelerating system with fixed proper acceleration is known to thermalise to an acceleration-dependent temperature, known as the Unruh temperature. However, the same system in a superposition of spatially translated trajectories that share the same proper acceleration fails to thermalise. Here, we provide an explanation of these results using the framework of quantum field theory in relativistic noninertial reference frames. We show how a probe that accelerates in a superposition of spatial translations interacts with incommensurate sets of field modes. In special cases where the modes are orthogonal (for example, when the Rindler wedges are translated in a direction orthogonal to the plane of motion), thermalisation does indeed result, corroborating the here provided explanation. We then discuss how this description relates to an information-theoretic approach aimed at studying quantum aspects of temperature through quantum-controlled thermalisations. The present work draws a connection between research in quantum information, relativistic physics, and quantum thermodynamics, in particular showing that relativistic quantum effects can provide a natural realisation of quantum thermodynamical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Spectral Characterization of the Gravitational-wave Background with the PTA Optimal Statistic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have made tremendous progress and are now showing strong evidence for the gravitational-wave background (GWB). Further probing the origin and characteristics of the GWB will require more generalized analysis techniques. Bayesian methods are most often used but can be computationally expensive. On the other hand, frequentist methods, like the PTA Optimal Statistic (OS), are more computationally efficient and can produce results that are complementary to Bayesian methods, allowing for stronger statistical cases to be built from a confluence of different approaches. In this work we expand the capabilities of the OS through a technique we call the Per-Frequency Optimal Statistic (PFOS). The PFOS removes the underlying power-law assumption inherent in previous implementations of the OS, and allows one to estimate the GWB spectrum in a frequency-by-frequency manner. We have also adapted a recent generalization from the OS pipeline into the PFOS, making it capable of accurately characterizing the spectrum in the intermediate and strong GW signal regimes using only a small fraction of the necessary computational resources when compared with fully-correlated Bayesian methods, while also empowering many new types of analyses not possible before. We find that even in the strong GW signal regime, where the GWB dominates over noise in all frequencies, the injected value of the signal lies within the 50th-percentile of the PFOS uncertainty distribution in 41-45% of simulations, remaining 3$\sigma$-consistent with unbiased estimation.</description>

      <title>Scant evidence for thawing quintessence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe seem to favor evolving dark energy in the form of thawing quintessence models, i.e., models for which a canonical, minimally coupled scalar field has, at late times, begun to evolve away from potential energy domination. We scrutinize the evidence for thawing quintessence by exploring what it predicts for the equation of state. We show that, in terms of the usual Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parameters, ($w_0$, $w_a$), thawing quintessence is, in fact, only marginally consistent with a compilation of the current data. Despite this, we embrace the possibility that thawing quintessence is dark energy and find constraints on the microphysics of this scenario. We do so in terms of the effective mass $m^2$ and energy scale $V_0$ of the scalar field potential. We are particularly careful to enforce un-informative, flat priors on these parameters so as to minimize their effect on the final posteriors. While the current data favors a large and negative value of $m^2$, when we compare these models to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model we find that there is scant evidence for thawing quintessence.</description>

      <title>Brick Wall in AdS-Schwarzschild Black Hole: Normal Modes and Emerging Thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the normal modes of a probe scalar field in a five-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole with the brick wall boundary condition near the horizon. We employ various techniques to compute the spectrum and analyze its properties. Our results reveal a linear dependence of the spectrum on the principal quantum number while demonstrating a non-trivial dependence on the angular momentum quantum number. We compute the Spectral Form Factor (SFF) and find a dip-ramp-plateau structure, with the slope of the ramp approaching unity as the brick wall nears the horizon. We also observe that as the brick wall approaches the horizon, the poles of the retarded Green's function condense on the real line, leading to an emergent thermal behavior in the boundary theory. This work extends previous studies on lower-dimensional black holes to higher dimensions, providing insights into the connection between black hole microstate models and boundary chaos. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussions on the information paradox and the nature of black hole interiors in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Hanging on the cliff: Extreme mass ratio inspiral formation with local two-body relaxation and post-Newtonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are anticipated to be primary gravitational wave sources for LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna). They form in dense nuclear clusters when a compact object (CO) is captured by the central massive black holes (MBHs) due to frequent two-body interactions among orbiting objects. We present a novel Monte Carlo approach to evolve the post-Newtonian (PN) equations of motion of a CO orbiting an MBH accounting for two-body relaxation locally on the fly, without the assumption of orbit-averaging. We estimate the fraction $S(a_0)$ of EMRIs to total captures (including direct plunges, DPs) as a function of the initial semi-major axis $a_0$ for COs around MBHs of $M_\bullet\in[10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot,4\times10^6\,{\rm M}_\odot]$. Previous results indicate $S(a_0)\rightarrow 0$ at large $a_0$, with a sharp transition from EMRIs to DPs around a critical scale $a_{\rm c}$. This notion has been recently challenged for low-mass MBHs, with EMRIs forming at $a\gg a_{\rm c}$, the so-called "cliffhangers''. Our simulations confirm their existence, at larger numbers than previously expected. Cliffhangers start to appear for $M_\bullet\lesssim3\times 10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and can account for up to 55% of the overall EMRIs formed. We find $S(a_0)\gg 0$ for $a\gg a_{\rm c}$, reaching values as high as 0.6 for $M_\bullet=10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$, much larger than previously found. We find that the PN description of the system greatly enhances the number of EMRIs by shifting $a_{\rm c}$ to larger values at all MBH masses, and that the local treatment of relaxation significantly boosts the number of cliffhangers for small MBHs. Our work shows the limitations of standard assumptions for estimating EMRI formation rates, most importantly their dynamical models. Future estimates of rates and properties of EMRIs detectable by LISA should account for these improvements.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Forecasts Constrained by JWST AGN Observations for Early Massive Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive black holes (BHs) grow by gas accretion and mergers, observable through electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) emission. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs), revealing an abundant population of accreting BHs with masses of $M_\bullet\sim 10^{6-8}~M_\odot$. This mass range overlaps with the detection scopes of space-based GW interferometers and approaches the upper bounds of the predicted mass of seed BHs. We model BH mass assembly in light of the new JWST findings to investigate their formation channels and predict merger events. Two types of seed BHs are considered: heavy seeds ($M_\bullet\sim 10^{2-5}~M_\odot$) formed in rare and overdense cosmic regions, and light seeds ($M_\bullet\sim 10^{1-3}~M_\odot$) formed as stellar remnants in less massive dark-matter halos. The BHs grow through episodic accretion and merger events, which we model by fitting the AGN luminosity function to observational data including JWST-identified AGNs at $z\sim 5$. We find that heavy seeds alone struggle to explain quasars and faint JWST-selected AGNs simultaneously, requiring the more abundant light seeds. The observed merger rate of BHs from heavy seeds alone is limited to $\lesssim 10^{-1}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for major mergers at $z\geq5$. However, the presence of light seeds increases the major merger rate by several orders of magnitude, which peaks at a total BH mass of $M_\bullet\simeq 2\times 10^3~M_\odot$ over $5&lt;z&lt;10$ at a rate of $\sim 30~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. These events are detectable by future GW observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Precise sky localization and distance measurement of those GW events, with solid angle and luminosity distance uncertainties $\Delta\Omega\Delta\log D_L\lesssim 10^{-4}~\rm deg^2$, will enable EM identification of mergers at $z\geq5$ and multi-messenger follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Soft Metric Fluctuations During Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conservation of the long wavelength fluctuations of the metric plays a vital role in cosmology as the link between quantum fluctuations during inflation and late time observations. This is a well-known property of the classical evolution equations, but demonstrating that it is robust to quantum correction involves a number of technical arguments. In this paper, we will use effective field theory (EFT) techniques to demonstrate the all orders conservation of the super-horizon scalar and tensor fluctuations of the metric during inflation. We show how to construct an EFT for these soft modes, in analogy with Soft de Sitter Effective Theory. We pay particular attention to how the breaking of time-diffeomorphisms by the inflationary background introduces new time scales that alter the structure of the EFT. In this description, the all orders conservation of the metric fluctuations is a direct consequence of symmetries and power counting that cannot be altered by loop corrections. We further show that this holds when the inflaton (or metric fluctuations) is coupled to additional heavy fields, as in quasi-single field inflation. We match this behavior to several calculations in the ultraviolet (UV) theory and show how the Mellin representation enables a more transparent connection between the UV and the EFT descriptions.</description>

      <title>Probing the axion-photon coupling with space-based gravitational waves detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple modification of space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector optical benches which would enable the measurement of vacuum birefringence of light induced by axion dark matterthrough its coupling to electromagnetism. Specifically, we propose to change a half-wave plate by a circular polarizer. While marginally affecting the sensitivity to GW by a factor $\sqrt{2}$, we show that such an adjustment would make future detectors such as LISA, TianQin, Taiji and Big-Bang Observer the most sensitive experiments at low axion masses</description>

      <title>Inequivalence between the Euclidean and Lorentzian versions of the type IIB matrix model from Lefschetz thimble calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is conjectured to describe superstring theory nonperturbatively in terms of ten $N \times N$ bosonic traceless Hermitian matrices $A_\mu$ ($\mu=0, \ldots , 9$), whose eigenvalues correspond to $(9+1)$-dimensional space-time. Quite often, this model has been investigated in its Euclidean version, which is well defined although the ${\rm SO}(9,1)$ Lorentz symmetry of the original model is replaced by the ${\rm SO}(10)$ rotational symmetry. Recently, a well-defined model respecting the Lorentz symmetry has been proposed by gauge-fixing the Lorentz symmetry nonperturbatively using the Faddeev-Popov procedure. Here we investigate the two models by Monte Carlo simulations, overcoming the severe sign problem by the Lefschetz thimble method, in the case of matrix size $N=2$ omitting fermionic contributions. We add a quadratic term $\gamma \, \mathrm{tr} (A_\mu A^\mu)$ in the action and calculate the expectation values of rotationally symmetric (or Lorentz symmetric) observables as a function of the coefficient $\gamma$. Our results exhibit striking differences between the two models around $\gamma=0$ and in the $\gamma&gt;0$ region, associated with the appearance of different saddle points, clearly demonstrating their inequivalence against naive expectations from quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>On heat coefficients, multiplicative anomaly and 4D Casimir energy for GJMS operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note aims to verify a prediction on the total derivative term of the 4D trace anomaly, and the corresponding heat coefficient, for GJMS operators. It stems from the explicit computation of an {\it improved} Casimir (or vacuum) energy on the sphere that takes into account the multiplicative anomaly among the (shifted) Laplacian factors and connects, via the Cappelli-Coste relation, with both the type A central charge and the total derivative term of the 4D trace anomaly. The present heat coefficient computation is based on Juhl's explicit formula for GJMS operators, Gilkey's formula for the integrated heat coefficient of higher-order Laplacians, and the \textit{conformal principle} by Branson and {\O}rsted.</description>

      <title>Hawking's singularity theorem for Lipschitz Lorentzian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Hawking's singularity theorem for spacetime metrics of local Lipschitz regularity. The proof rests on (1) new estimates for the Ricci curvature of regularising smooth metrics that are based upon a quite general Friedrichs-type lemma and (2) the replacement of the usual focusing techniques for timelike geodesics -- which in the absence of a classical ODE-theory for the initial value problem are no longer available -- by a worldvolume estimate based on a segment-type inequality that allows one to control the volume of the set of points in a spacelike surface that possess long maximisers.</description>
