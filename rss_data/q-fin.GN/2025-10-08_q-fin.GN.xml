      <title>Modeling ROI in Chronic Disease Management, A Simulation-Based Framework Integrating Patient Adherence and Policy Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Chronic diseases impose a sustained burden on healthcare systems through progressive deterioration and long-term costs. Although adherence-enhancing interventions are widely promoted, their return on investment (ROI) remains uncertain, particularly under heterogeneous patient behavior and socioeconomic variation. Methods: We developed a simulation-based framework integrating disease progression, time-varying adherence, and policy timing. Cumulative healthcare costs were modeled over a 10-year horizon using continuous-time stochastic formulations calibrated with Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data stratified by income. ROI was estimated across adherence gains (delta) and policy costs (gamma). Results: Early and adaptive interventions yielded the highest ROI by sustaining adherence and slowing progression. ROI exceeded 20 percent when delta &gt;= 0.20 and gamma &lt;= 1.5, whereas low-impact or high-cost policies failed to break even. Subgroup analyses showed a 32 percent ROI gap between the lowest and highest income strata, with projected savings of 312 USD per patient versus baseline. Sensitivity tests confirmed robustness under stochastic adherence and inflation variability. Conclusions: The framework provides a transparent and adaptable tool for evaluating cost-effective adherence strategies. By linking behavioral effectiveness with fiscal feasibility, it supports the design of robust and equitable chronic disease policies. Reported ROI values represent conservative lower bounds, and extensions incorporating DALYs and QALYs illustrate scalability toward full health outcome integration.</description>

      <title>Inverse Portfolio Optimization with Synthetic Investor Data: Recovering Risk Preferences under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops an inverse portfolio optimization framework for recovering latent investor preferences including risk aversion, transaction cost sensitivity, and ESG orientation from observed portfolio allocations. Using controlled synthetic data, we assess the estimator's statistical properties such as consistency, coverage, and dynamic regret. The model integrates robust optimization and regret-based inference to quantify welfare losses under preference misspecification and market shocks. Simulation experiments demonstrate accurate recovery of transaction cost parameters, partial identifiability of ESG penalties, and sublinear regret even under stochastic volatility and liquidity shocks. A real-data illustration using ETFs confirms that transaction-cost shocks dominate volatility shocks in welfare impact. The framework thus provides a statistically rigorous and economically interpretable tool for robust preference inference and portfolio design under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Smart Contract Adoption in Derivative Markets under Bounded Risk: An Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops and analyzes an optimization model of smart contract adoption under bounded risk, linking structural theory with simulation and real-world validation. We examine how adoption intensity alpha is structurally pinned at a boundary solution, invariant to variance and heterogeneity, while profitability and service outcomes are variance-fragile, eroding under volatility and heavy-tailed demand. A sharp threshold in the fixed cost parameter A3 triggers discontinuous adoption collapse (H1), variance shocks reduce profits monotonically but not adoption (H2), and additional results on readiness heterogeneity (H3), profit-service co-benefits (H4), and distributional robustness (H5) confirm the duality between stable adoption and fragile payoffs. External validity checks further establish convergence of sample average approximation at the canonical O(1/sqrt(N)) rate (H6). Empirical validation using S&amp;P 500 returns and the MovieLens100K dataset corroborates the theoretical structure: bounded and heavy-tailed distributions fit better than Gaussian models, and profits diverge across volatility regimes even as adoption remains stable. Taken together, the results demonstrate that adoption choices are robust to uncertainty, but their financial consequences are highly fragile. For operations and finance, this duality underscores the need for risk-adjusted performance evaluation, option-theoretic modeling, and distributional stress testing in strategic investment and supply chain design.</description>
