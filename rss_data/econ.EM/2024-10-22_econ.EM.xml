      <title>Learning the Effect of Persuasion via Difference-In-Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persuasion rate is a key parameter for measuring the causal effect of a directional message on influencing the recipient's behavior. Its identification analysis has largely relied on the availability of credible instruments, but the requirement is not always satisfied in observational studies. Therefore, we develop a framework for identifying, estimating, and conducting inference for the average persuasion rates on the treated using a difference-in-differences approach. The average treatment effect on the treated is a standard parameter with difference-in-differences, but it underestimates the persuasion rate in our setting. Our estimation and inference methods include regression-based approaches and semiparametrically efficient estimators. Beginning with the canonical two-period case, we extend the framework to staggered treatment settings, where we show how to conduct rich analyses like the event-study design. We revisit previous studies of the British election and the Chinese curriculum reform to illustrate the usefulness of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Fast and Efficient Bayesian Analysis of Structural Vector Autoregressions Using the R Package bsvars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R package bsvars provides a wide range of tools for empirical macroeconomic and financial analyses using Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregressions. It uses frontier econometric techniques and C++ code to ensure fast and efficient estimation of these multivariate dynamic structural models, possibly with many variables, complex identification strategies, and non-linear characteristics. The models can be identified using adjustable exclusion restrictions and heteroskedastic or non-normal shocks. They feature a flexible three-level equation-specific local-global hierarchical prior distribution for the estimated level of shrinkage for autoregressive and structural parameters. Additionally, the package facilitates predictive and structural analyses such as impulse responses, forecast error variance and historical decompositions, forecasting, statistical verification of identification and hypotheses on autoregressive parameters, and analyses of structural shocks, volatilities, and fitted values. These features differentiate bsvars from existing R packages that either focus on a specific structural model, do not consider heteroskedastic shocks, or lack the implementation using compiled code.</description>

      <title>Predictive Quantile Regression with High-Dimensional Predictors: The Variable Screening Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper advances a variable screening approach to enhance conditional quantile forecasts using high-dimensional predictors. We have refined and augmented the quantile partial correlation (QPC)-based variable screening proposed by Ma et al. (2017) to accommodate $\beta$-mixing time-series data. Our approach is inclusive of i.i.d scenarios but introduces new convergence bounds for time-series contexts, suggesting the performance of QPC-based screening is influenced by the degree of time-series dependence. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we validate the effectiveness of QPC under weak dependence. Our empirical assessment of variable selection for growth-at-risk (GaR) forecasting underscores the method's advantages, revealing that specific labor market determinants play a pivotal role in forecasting GaR. While prior empirical research has predominantly considered a limited set of predictors, we employ the comprehensive Fred-QD dataset, retaining a richer breadth of information for GaR forecasts.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Instrumental Variables Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instrumental variables (IV) estimation is a fundamental method in econometrics and statistics for estimating causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. However, challenges such as untestable model assumptions and poor finite sample properties have undermined its reliability in practice. Viewing common issues in IV estimation as distributional uncertainties, we propose DRIVE, a distributionally robust framework of the classical IV estimation method. When the ambiguity set is based on a Wasserstein distance, DRIVE minimizes a square root ridge regularized variant of the two stage least squares (TSLS) objective. We develop a novel asymptotic theory for this regularized regression estimator based on the square root ridge, showing that it achieves consistency without requiring the regularization parameter to vanish. This result follows from a fundamental property of the square root ridge, which we call ``delayed shrinkage''. This novel property, which also holds for a class of generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators, ensures that the estimator is robust to distributional uncertainties that persist in large samples. We further derive the asymptotic distribution of Wasserstein DRIVE and propose data-driven procedures to select the regularization parameter based on theoretical results. Simulation studies confirm the superior finite sample performance of Wasserstein DRIVE. Thanks to its regularization and robustness properties, Wasserstein DRIVE could be preferable in practice, particularly when the practitioner is uncertain about model assumptions or distributional shifts in data.</description>

      <title>A Kernelization-Based Approach to Nonparametric Binary Choice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new estimator for nonparametric binary choice models that does not impose a parametric structure on either the systematic function of covariates or the distribution of the error term. A key advantage of our approach is its computational efficiency. For instance, even when assuming a normal error distribution as in probit models, commonly used sieves for approximating an unknown function of covariates can lead to a large-dimensional optimization problem when the number of covariates is moderate. Our approach, motivated by kernel methods in machine learning, views certain reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces as special sieve spaces, coupled with spectral cut-off regularization for dimension reduction. We establish the consistency of the proposed estimator for both the systematic function of covariates and the distribution function of the error term, and asymptotic normality of the plug-in estimator for weighted average partial derivatives. Simulation studies show that, compared to parametric estimation methods, the proposed method effectively improves finite sample performance in cases of misspecification, and has a rather mild efficiency loss if the model is correctly specified. Using administrative data on the grant decisions of US asylum applications to immigration courts, along with nine case-day variables on weather and pollution, we re-examine the effect of outdoor temperature on court judges' "mood", and thus, their grant decisions.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Bayesian Inference for a Conditional Moment Equality Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional moment equality models are regularly encountered in empirical economics, yet they are difficult to estimate. These models map a conditional distribution of data to a structural parameter via the restriction that a conditional mean equals zero. Using this observation, I introduce a Bayesian inference framework in which an unknown conditional distribution is replaced with a nonparametric posterior, and structural parameter inference is then performed using an implied posterior. The method has the same flexibility as frequentist semiparametric estimators and does not require converting conditional moments to unconditional moments. Importantly, I prove a semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises theorem, providing conditions under which, in large samples, the posterior for the structural parameter is approximately normal, centered at an efficient estimator, and has variance equal to the Chamberlain (1987) semiparametric efficiency bound. As byproducts, I show that Bayesian uncertainty quantification methods are asymptotically optimal frequentist confidence sets and derive low-level sufficient conditions for Gaussian process priors. The latter sheds light on a key prior stability condition and relates to the numerical aspects of the paper in which these priors are used to predict the welfare effects of price changes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Biases of Static Panel Data Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper identifies an important bias - termed dynamic bias - in fixed effects panel estimators that arises when dynamic feedback is ignored in the estimating equation. Dynamic feedback occurs if past outcomes impact current outcomes, a feature of many settings ranging from economic growth to agricultural and labor markets. When estimating equations omit past outcomes, dynamic bias can lead to significantly inaccurate treatment effect estimates, even with randomly assigned treatments. This dynamic bias in simulations is larger than Nickell bias. I show that dynamic bias stems from the estimation of fixed effects, as their estimation generates confounding in the data. To recover consistent treatment effects, I develop a flexible estimator that provides fixed-T bias correction. I apply this approach to study the impact of temperature shocks on GDP, a canonical example where economic theory points to an important feedback from past to future outcomes. Accounting for dynamic bias lowers the estimated effects of higher yearly temperatures on GDP growth by 10% and GDP levels by 120%.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries in Financial Spillovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes nonlinearities in the international transmission of financial shocks originating in the US. To do so, we develop a flexible nonlinear multi-country model. Our framework is capable of producing asymmetries in the responses to financial shocks for shock size and sign, and over time. We show that international reactions to US-based financial shocks are asymmetric along these dimensions. Particularly, we find that adverse shocks trigger stronger declines in output, inflation, and stock markets than benign shocks. Further, we investigate time variation in the estimated dynamic effects and characterize the responsiveness of three major central banks to financial shocks.</description>

      <title>Switchback Price Experiments with Forward-Looking Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a retailer running a switchback experiment for the price of a single product, with infinite supply. In each period, the seller chooses a price $p$ from a set of predefined prices that consist of a reference price and a few discounted price levels. The goal is to estimate the demand gradient at the reference price point, with the goal of adjusting the reference price to improve revenue after the experiment. In our model, in each period, a unit mass of buyers arrives on the market, with values distributed based on a time-varying process. Crucially, buyers are forward looking with a discounted utility and will choose to not purchase now if they expect to face a discounted price in the near future. We show that forward-looking demand introduces bias in naive estimators of the demand gradient, due to intertemporal interference. Furthermore, we prove that there is no estimator that uses data from price experiments with only two price points that can recover the correct demand gradient, even in the limit of an infinitely long experiment with an infinitesimal price discount. Moreover, we characterize the form of the bias of naive estimators. Finally, we show that with a simple three price level experiment, the seller can remove the bias due to strategic forward-looking behavior and construct an estimator for the demand gradient that asymptotically recovers the truth.</description>

      <title>Quantifying world geography as seen through the lens of Soviet propaganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.</description>

      <title>Fast and simple inner-loop algorithms of static / dynamic BLP estimations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04494v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates computationally efficient inner-loop algorithms for estimating static/dynamic BLP models. It provides the following ideas to reduce the number of inner-loop iterations: (1). Add a term concerning the outside option share in the BLP contraction mapping; (2). Analytically represent mean product utilities as a function of value functions and solve for the value functions (for dynamic BLP); (3). Combine an acceleration method of fixed point iterations, especially Anderson acceleration. They are independent and easy to implement. This study shows good performance of these methods by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Identifying and exploiting alpha in linear asset pricing models with strong, semi-strong, and latent factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The risk premia of traded factors are the sum of factor means and a parameter vector we denote by {\phi} which is identified from the cross section regression of alpha of individual securities on the vector of factor loadings. If phi is non-zero one can construct "phi-portfolios" which exploit the systematic components of non-zero alpha. We show that for known values of betas and when phi is non-zero there exist phi-portfolios that dominate mean-variance portfolios. The paper then proposes a two-step bias corrected estimator of phi and derives its asymptotic distribution allowing for idiosyncratic pricing errors, weak missing factors, and weak error cross-sectional dependence. Small sample results from extensive Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed estimator has the correct size with good power properties. The paper also provides an empirical application to a large number of U.S. securities with risk factors selected from a large number of potential risk factors according to their strength and constructs phi-portfolios and compares their Sharpe ratios to mean variance and S&amp;P 500 portfolio.</description>
