      <title>Unevolved Li-rich stars at low metallicity: a possible formation pathway through novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A small fraction of low-mass stars have been found to have anomalously high Li abundances. Although it has been suggested that mixing during the red giant branch phase can lead to Li production, this method of intrinsic Li production cannot explain Li-rich stars that have not yet undergone the first dredge-up. To obtain clues about the origin of such stars, we present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of four unevolved Li-rich stars with $-2.1 &lt; [\mathrm{Fe/H}] &lt; -1.3$ and $2.9&lt;A({\rm Li})&lt;3.6$, $0.7-1.4$ dex higher Li abundance than typical unevolved metal-poor stars. One of the stars, Gaia DR3 6334970766103389824 (D25_6334), was serendipitously found in the stellar stream ED-3, and the other three stars have been reported to have massive ($M\gtrsim 1.3\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) non-luminous companions. We show that three of the four stars exhibit abundance patterns similar to those of known unevolved Li-rich stars, namely normal abundances in most elements except for Li and Na. These abundance similarities suggest a common origin for the unevolved Li-rich stars and low-mass metal-poor stars with massive compact companions. We also made the first detection of N abundance to unevolved Li-rich stars in D25_6334, and found that it is significantly enhanced ($[\mathrm{N/Fe}]=1.3$). The observed abundance pattern of D25_6334, spanning from C to Si, indicates that its surface has been polluted by an intermediate-mass former companion star or a nova system that involves a massive ONe white dwarf. Using a population synthesis model, we show that the nova scenario can lead to the observed level of Li enhancement and also provide an explanation for Li-rich stars without companions and those with massive compact companions.</description>

      <title>"Frog-eyes" in Astronomy: Monitoring Binary Radial Velocity Variations Through A Pair of Narrow-Band Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations are a crucial step in driving major discoveries in the era of time-domain surveys. However, the pace of current spectroscopic surveys is increasingly unable to meet the demands of rapidly advancing large-scale time-domain surveys. To address this issue, we propose the ``Frog-eyes" system, which employs a pair of narrow-band filters: one positioned near a strong absorption line to capture signals from Doppler shifts, and the other placed on the adjacent continuum to monitor intrinsic variations. The combination of observations from the two filters enables the extraction of radial velocity (RV) curves from a large sample of binary stars, and is particularly efficient for single-lined binaries (SB1), using photometric techniques. Comprehensive mock simulations on SB1 demonstrate that the binary orbital parameters can be precisely measured from the extracted RV curves for binary systems where the primary star has an effective temperature greater than 6000 K. With a typical ground-based photometric precision of approximately 0.3%, the uncertainties in the derived semi-amplitude K and eccentricity e are less than 10% and 0.1, respectively, for binary systems with K $\ge$ 30 km/s. These encouraging results are further validated by real observations of the hot subdwarf-white dwarf binary system HD 265435, using a non-specialized ``Frog-eyes" system installed on the Chinese 2.16m telescope. Once this system is properly installed on large-field-of-view survey telescopes, the rate of acquiring RV curves for binaries will approach their detection rate in leading time-domain photometric surveys.</description>

      <title>A method for statistical research on binary stars using radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using radial velocity to estimate binary fraction and predict orbital parameter distribution laws is an important method in the studies of binary stars. However, the high dimensionality of the orbital parameters of the binary system pose challenges to this work, particularly in terms of sample size and the accuracy of the calculated results.
  We have proposed and implemented an algorithm called DVCD (Differential Velocity Cumulative Distribution) for the statistical analysis of binary properties. % On the basis of higher accuracy than previous methods, the running efficiency of the method is greatly improved. This method not only achieves higher accuracy than previous approaches but also significantly improves computational efficiency. The computing time for the same sample and the hardware environment was reduced to $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ of that of some previous methods.
  Red giant samples from APOGEE DR16 were analyzed using the DVCD method. Both the hyperparameter of the orbital period $\pi$ and the intrinsic binary fraction ($f_{bin}$) can be constrained. We divided the sample into 16 subsets based on log$g$ and $M/H$. Calculation results showed that the binary fraction decreases with the decrease of surface gravity and decreases with the increase of metallicity. This trend provides important constraints on the evolution of binary stars.</description>

      <title>SED Modeling of Young Stellar Objects in the Orion Star Formation Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a large-scale spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis for young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion star formation complex (OSFC) to derive key physical parameters; temperature, luminosity, mass, and age, using SED models. Our goal is to establish a statistically robust characterization of the stellar population and its evolutionary state across the entire complex. We utilize a set of new radiative transfer model SEDs that span a variety of geometries and parameter spaces. These SEDs are fitted to multi-wavelength photometric data from optical to submillimeter wavelengths. We conducted SED fitting on a sample of 15,396 sources. Among these, 5,062 have at least a reliable AllWISE W3 (12~$\mu$m) detection at longer wavelengths, and 63 have sub-millimeter detections in APEX/SABOCA at 350~$\mu$m or APEX/LABOCA at 870~$\mu$m. The resulting physical parameters are cross-referenced with stellar evolutionary tracks to ensure consistency with theoretical predictions. Sources placed on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram show distinct evolutionary sequences. The results are provided with varying levels of completeness and reliability, depending on the available data for each source. The catalog includes quality indicators such as the flux code, which represents the longest detected wavelength for each source, as well as Prob_W3 and Prob_W4 values that quantify the reliability of the AllWISE W3 and W4 detections. All results, including SED fitting outcomes, uncertainty estimates, and source metadata, are publicly available in a comprehensive CDS table. This dataset provides a statistically significant view of the evolutionary processes within the OSFC. The publicly accessible dataset offers a valuable resource for future studies on star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Variability of Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae with the Zwicky Transient Facility. II. Long-Timescale Variables including Wide Binary and Late Thermal Pulse Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this second paper on the variability survey of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) using ZTF, we focus on the 11 long-timescale variables with variability timescales ranging from months to years. We also present preliminary analyses based on spectroscopic and/or photometric follow-up observations for six of them. Among them is NGC 6833, which shows a 980 day periodic variability with strange characteristics: 'triangle-shaped' brightening in $r$, $i$, and WISE bands but almost coincidental shallow dips in the $g$-band. We speculate this to be a wide but eccentric binary with the same orbital period. Long-period near-sinusoidal variability was detected in two other systems, NGC 6905 and Kn 26, with periods of 700 days and 230 days, respectively, making them additional wide-binary candidates. The latter also shows a short period at 1.18 hours which can either be from a close inner binary or pulsational origin. We present CTSS 2 and PN K 3-5 which show brightening and significant reddening over the whole ZTF baseline. A stellar model fit to the optical spectrum of CTSS 2 reveals it to be one of the youngest post-AGB CSPN known. Both show high-density emission-line cores. These appear to be late thermal pulse candidates, currently evolving towards the AGB phase, though alternative explanations are possible. We then present recent HST/COS ultraviolet spectroscopy of the known wide-binary candidate LoTr 1 showing that the hot star is a spectroscopic twin of the extremely hot white dwarf in UCAC2 46706450. We think that the long photometric period of 11 years is the binary orbital period. Finally, we briefly discuss the ZTF light curves of the remaining variables, namely Tan 2, K 3-20, WHTZ 3, Kn J1857+3931, and IPHAS J1927+0814. With these examples, we present the effectiveness of the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew-based metric space in searching for long-timescale variables.</description>

      <title>Filament Mass Losses Forced by Magnetic Reconnection in the Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of the solar atmosphere in cool extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lines have reported the prevalence of coronal rain falling from coronal cloud filaments that are associated with the magnetic dips of coronal X-point structures. These filaments mysteriously appear as clouds of mass in the corona that subsequently shrink and disappear due to mass losses that drain as coronal rain along arced field lines. Using a two and a half dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic model, we investigated evaporation-condensation as the formation mechanism of the subset of coronal cloud filaments that form above coronal X-points. Our simulation included the effects of field-aligned thermal conduction and optically thin radiation and used the state-of-the-art Transition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to model the formation, maintenance, and mass loss of a filament above a coronal X-point. This paper presents a physical model that demonstrates magnetic reconnection as a filament loss mechanism, producing hybrid filament/coronal rain via mass losses through the X-point. A detailed analysis of how the mass of the filament forces the field to reconnect is also presented, revealing three phases that characterize the evolution of the reconnecting current sheet and associated mass losses. We conclude that the formation of certain coronal cloud filaments and subsequent mass losses via coronal rain can be explained by the evaporation-condensation model combined with filament mass losses forced by magnetic reconnection. We also report that rebound shocks generated by the impact of coronal rain condensations on the chromosphere together with retractive upflows can cause upward propagating condensations to form through a dynamic thermal runaway process.</description>

      <title>FAUST-XXII. Deuteration in the VLA1623-2417 protostellar hot-corinos, cavities, and streamers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of deuterium fractionation is a valuable tool for reconstructing our chemical history from the early prestellar stages to the formation of planets. In the context of the ALMA Large Programme FAUST, we observed formaldehyde, H$_2$CO, and its singly and doubly deuterated forms, HDCO and D$_2$CO, towards the protostellar cluster VLA1623-2417, on scales of ~ 2000 - 50 au. Formaldehyde probes the inner envelopes of the protostars VLA1623A, B, and W, the rotating cavities opened by the VLA1623A outflow, and several streamers. The HDCO and D$_2$CO emissions are observed towards VLA1623A, in its outflow cavities, and in one of the streamers. We estimate the gas temperature from the HDCO lines: T~ 125 K towards VLA1623A, indicating hot-corino emission, lower temperatures in the outflow cavities (20 - 40 K), and in the streamers ($\le15$ K). The D$_2$CO lines also trace the flattened envelope of VLA1623A, where H$_2$CO and HDCO are fainter. This may be due to D$_2$CO formation on dust grains in the cold prestellar phase, and subsequent photodesorption caused by the enhanced UV flux from two nearby B stars. We inferred the molecular deuteration: [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO] ~ 0.16, ~ 0.07 - 0.13, and ~ 0.3; [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO] ~ 0.003, ~ 0.05 - 0.13, and ~ 0.03 in the hot corino, in the outflow cavities, and in the streamer, respectively. The spatial distribution of D$_2$CO, which points to formation on dust grains, and the similar values of [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO] and [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO] in the components of the system, suggest that deuterium fractionation occurs at the prestellar stage and is then inherited, mostly unaltered, in the protostellar phase.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic Study of Subgiants and Giants of the Open Cluster M67 using Kepler/K2: Expanded Sample and Precise Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparked by the asteroseismic space revolution, ensemble studies have been used to produce empirical relations linking observed seismic properties and fundamental stellar properties. Cluster stars are particularly valuable because they have the same metallicity, distance, and age, thus reducing scatter to reveal smoother relations. We present the first study of a cluster that spans the full evolutionary sequence from subgiants to core helium-burning red giants using asteroseismology to characterise the stars in M67, including a yellow straggler. We use Kepler/K2 data to measure seismic surface gravity, examine the potential influence of core magnetic fields, derive an empirical expression for the seismic surface term, and determine the phase term $\epsilon$ of the asymptotic relation for acoustic modes, extending its analysis to evolutionary states previously unexplored in detail. Additionally, we calibrate seismic scaling relations for stellar mass and radius, and quantify their systematic errors if surface term corrections are not applied to state-of-the-art stellar models. Our masses show that the Reimers mass loss parameter can not be larger than $\eta$ $\sim$ 0.23 at the 2-$\sigma$ level. We use isochrone models designed for M67 and compare their predictions with individual mode frequencies. We find that the seismic masses for subgiants and red giant branch stars align with the isochrone-predicted masses as per their luminosity and colour. However, our results are inconsistent with the mass of one of the stellar components of an eclipsing binary system near the TAMS. We use traditional seismic $\chi^2$ fits to estimate a seismic cluster age of 3.95 $\pm$ 0.35 Gyrs.</description>

      <title>Census of Blue Straggler Stars in Distant Open Clusters and Maximum Fractional Mass Excess of OC BSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identified blue straggler stars (BSSs) in 53 open clusters utilizing data from Gaia DR3. Most of these clusters are situated in the outer regions of the Galactic disc, encompassing structures such as the warp and the Outer arm. We analyzed their astrometric parameters and determined that 48 of them demonstrate high reliability in radial density profile. Furthermore, through manual isochrone fitting and visual inspection, we confirmed 119 BSS candidates and identified 328 additional possible candidates within these clusters. Our results contribute to a 46% increase in the sample size of BSSs in open clusters for regions of the Galactic disc where Rgc &gt; 12 kpc. We observed that the new samples are fainter compared to those identified in the past. Additionally, we investigated the maximum fractional mass excess (Me) of the BSSs in open clusters, including previously published BSS samples. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between the capability to produce highest-Me BSSs and the mass of their host clusters. This observation appears to reinforce a fundamental principle whereby an increase in the mass of a star cluster correlates with a higher likelihood of stellar mergers. In contrast, we observe minimal correlation between maximum-Me and the cluster age. Among clusters containing BSSs, younger clusters (0.5 to 1 Gyr) display a scarcity of high-Me BSSs. This scarcity may be attributed to the absence of more massive clusters within this age range.</description>

      <title>Disparities in Magnetic Cloud Observations Between Two Spacecraft Having Small Radial and Angular Separations Near 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies for inferring the global characteristics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from its multipoint local in situ observations have been undertaken earlier, but there are limited studies utilizing measurements from multiple spacecraft with sufficiently small radial and angular separations. In the present study, we investigate a magnetic cloud (MC) region of a CME observed in situ during 2023 September 24-26, at STEREO-A and Wind spacecraft near 1 AU, which had radial and angular separations of 0.03 AU and 3.4 degrees, respectively. We examine the disparities in the estimates of the arrival times of CME substructures, the MC axis, and its orientation between the two spacecraft. We also propose an approach for identifying the MC axis's arrival and have compared it with the arrival of the size/time center to understand the non-isotropic compression of the MC along its angular extent. Using minimum variance analysis (MVA), we note that the orientation of the MC is slightly out-of-ecliptic at Wind but not at STEREO-A. We also compare the magnetic field parameters over the start to end of the MC at both spacecraft and note a significant non-coherency in the MC towards its trailing portion. Our analysis confirms that MC has a stronger rear side compression at STEREO-A than at Wind, with its trailing edge arriving later at Wind. Our study highlights substantial differences in CME characteristics even at mesoscales across the angular extent, and therefore, one needs to analyze several such cases to better understand the flux rope structure.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of small-scale magnetic fields modulated by the solar cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to sunspots, which represent the most easily visualized manifestation of solar magnetism, cutting-edge observations of the solar atmosphere have uncovered a plethora of magnetic flux tubes, down to the resolving power of modern high-resolution telescopes (a few tens of km), revealing how the Sun is a fully magnetized star. These magnetic elements are advected and buffeted by ambient plasma flows and turbulent convection, resulting in perturbations of the flux tubes that make them natural conduits for channeling wave energy into the upper layers of the Sun's atmosphere and significantly contributing to the acceleration of the solar wind. Today, data acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), have made it possible to study the dynamics of small-scale magnetic fields over long timescales. Here, for the first time, we present the discovery of a modulation in the dynamical behavior of small-scale magnetic concentrations in the photosphere over temporal scales consistent with the solar activity cycle (i.e. 11 years), which has only been made possible by the long observing lifetime of the SDO/HMI spacecraft. Furthermore, a temporal varying polarization of their perturbations is also found on similar timescales. This demonstrates how the small-scale dynamics of magnetic fields are also affected by the global dynamo. These discoveries were realized through automated tracking of magnetic fields in the solar photosphere across 11 continuous years, resulting in the most extended statistical analyses of its kind so far, with more than 31 million magnetic concentrations examined.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Origin of Solar Energetic Electrons II: Investigating Turbulent Coronal Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-thermal particle acceleration in the solar corona is evident from both remote hard X-ray (HXR) sources in the chromosphere and direct in-situ detection in the heliosphere. Correlation of spectral indices between remote and in-situ energy spectra presents the possibility of a common source acceleration region within the corona, however the properties and location of this region are not well constrained. To investigate this we perform a parameter study for both the properties of the ambient plasma of a simulated acceleration region and the turbulent acceleration profile acting on an initially isotropic thermal electron population. We find that the independently varying the turbulent acceleration timescale $\tau_{acc}$, acceleration profile standard deviation ${\sigma}$ and acceleration region length L result in in-situ spectral index variation of between 0.5 and 2.0 at 1.0 AU for &lt; 100 keV electrons. Short timescale turbulent scattering in the flaring corona steepens the spectra by $\sim$ 0.5. It was also found that the in-situ spectral index $\delta$ derived from the peak electron flux produces a spectral index $\sim$ 1.6 harder than that from a full-flare X-ray photon flux (of spectral index $\gamma$) simulated with the same intermediate parameters. Previous studies have indicated an approximate $\delta \approx \gamma$ relationship for selected flares with measured in-situ electron and X-ray photon observations, suggesting that an extended source region with non-uniform plasma and/or acceleration properties may be necessary to reproduce this relationship.</description>

      <title>Coronal Abundance Fractionation Linked to Chromospheric Transverse MHD Waves in a Solar Active Region Observed with FISS/GST and EIS/Hinode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elemental abundances in the solar corona differ from those in the photosphere, with low first ionization potential (FIP) elements being enhanced, a phenomenon known as the FIP effect. This enhancement is attributed to ponderomotive forces linked to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, particularly incompressible transverse waves. Our study investigates the relationship between coronal abundance fractionation and chromospheric transverse MHD waves by examining the spatial correlation between FIP fractionation and these waves and by analyzing their properties to test the ponderomotive force model. We used H alpha data from the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph at the Goode Solar Telescope to detect chromospheric transverse MHD waves and \ion{Si}{X} (low FIP) and \ion{S}{X} (high FIP) spectra from Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer to determine relative abundances in an active region. Extrapolated linear force free magnetic fields from Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager magnetograms further linked the observed chromospheric waves with coronal composition. Approximately 400 wave packets were identified and characterized by their period, velocity amplitude, propagation speed, and direction. These incompressible or weakly compressible waves were mainly observed near loop footpoints in the sunspot penumbra and superpenumbral fibrils. Regions of high FIP fractionation coincided with closed magnetic fields where these waves were present, and low-frequency, downward-propagating waves comprised about 43/% of the total. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between coronal abundance fractionation and chromospheric transverse MHD waves, supporting the view that the FIP effect is driven by the ponderomotive force from these waves.</description>

      <title>Some musings on erythrogigantoacoustics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of stars other than the Sun are sensitive to oscillations of only low degree. Many are high-order acoustic modes. Acoustic frequencies of main-sequence stars, for example, satisfy a well-known pattern, which some astronomers have adopted even for red-giant stars. That is not wise, because the internal structures of these stars can be quite different from those on the Main Sequence, which is populated by stars whose structure is regular. Here I report on pondering this matter, and point out two fundamental deviations from the commonly adopted relation. There are aspects of the regular relation that are connected in a simple way to gross properties of the star, such as the dependence of the eigenfrequencies on the linear combination $n+\textstyle{\frac {1}{2}}l$ of the order $n$ and degree $l$, which is characteristic of a regular spherical acoustic cavity. That is not a feature of red-giant frequencies, because, as experienced by the waves, red-giant stars appear to have (phantom) singular centres, which substantially modify the propagation of waves. That requires a generalization of the eigenfrequency relation, which I present here. When fitted to the observed frequencies of the Sun, the outcome is consistent with the Sun being round, with no singularity in the core. That is hardly novel, but at least it provides some assurance that our understanding of stellar acoustic wave dynamics is on a sound footing.</description>

      <title>ELemental abundances of Planets and brown dwarfs Imaged around Stars (ELPIS): II. The Jupiter-like Inhomogeneous Atmosphere of the First Directly Imaged Planetary-Mass Companion 2MASS 1207 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2MASS 1207 b, the first directly imaged planetary-mass companion, has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of exoplanets and brown dwarfs over the past 20 years. We have performed extensive atmospheric retrieval analyses of 2MASS 1207 b's JWST/NIRSpec spectrum using petitRADTRANS and a new atmospheric inhomogeneity framework, which characterizes homogeneous atmospheres, patchy clouds, cloud-free hot spots, or the combination of patchy clouds and spots. Among 24 retrieval runs with various assumptions, the most statistically preferred model corresponds to the patchy cloud scheme, with Teff$=1174^{+4}_{-3}$ K, log(g)=$3.62^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ dex, and R$=1.399^{+0.008}_{-0.010}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$, along with near-solar atmospheric compositions of [M/H]$=-0.05\pm0.03$ dex and C/O$=0.440\pm0.012$. This model suggests ~9% of 2MASS 1207 b's atmosphere is covered by thin iron clouds, producing L-dwarf-like spectra, while the remaining 91% consists of thick silicate and iron clouds, emitting blackbody-like spectra. These thin-cloud and thick-cloud regions resemble Jupiter's belts and zones, respectively; this scenario is consistently supported by other retrieval runs incorporating inhomogeneous atmospheres. We demonstrate that 2MASS 1207 b's weak CO absorption can be explained by the veiling effects of patchy thick clouds; the absence of 3.3um CH4 absorption is attributed to its hot thermal structure, which naturally leads to a CO-dominant, CH4-deficient atmosphere. The retrieved atmospheric models also match the observed variability amplitudes of 2MASS 1207 b. Our analysis reveals that the inferred atmospheric properties show significant scatter in less statistically preferred retrieval runs but converge to consistent values among the preferred ones. This underscores the importance of exploring diverse assumptions in retrievals to avoid biased interpretations of atmospheres and formation.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: The bulge Cluster APOGEE Survey VII: First detailed chemical analysis of NGC 6316</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey (CAPOS), high-resolution, high Signal-to-Noise Ratio Near-Infrared spectroscopy, we aim to conduct the most robust chemical study to date for NGC 6316, deriving abundances for a number of elements with a variety of nucleosynthetic origins, most of which have never been studied before in this cluster. We use the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High accuracy Spectra (BACCHUS) with atmospheric parameters photometrically obtained in order to determine, for the first time, abundances for C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Ce for this cluster. We obtained a mean metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.87 +- 0.02, finding no indication of an intrinsic metallicity spread. Our metallicity agrees with the most recent values from other studies, revising earlier values that were ~0.5 dex metal-richer. With this new value, this cluster, long believed to be a member of the classical metal-rich group of bulge GCs around -0.5, now falls in the dominant bulge globular cluster peak around [Fe/H] = -1. The cluster presents a clear C-N anticorrelation. We also found a [{\alpha}/Fe] = 0.3 +- 0.02. Our abundances show similar behaviour to other in situ globular clusters with comparable metallicity. We obtained E(B-V) = 0.71 and (M-m)_0 = 15.32 +- 0.05 by isochrone fitting, in good agreement with the recent determinations from other works. We derive an overall metallicity [M/H] = -0.6 +- 0.05 by isochrone fitting, in agreement with our abundance determination. According to the mean [Mg/Fe] and [Al/Fe] abundances from first population stars, NGC 6316 is an in-situ globular cluster, in accordance with various dynamical classifications.</description>

      <title>A Challenge of Developing a Classifier for Multi-Band Classification of Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable stars play a very important role in our understanding of the Milky Way and the universe. In recent years, many survey projects have generated a large amount of photometric data, necessitating classifiers that can quickly identify various types of variable stars. However, obtaining these classifiers often requires substantial manpower and computational resources. To conserve these resources, it would be best to have a classifier that can be used across surveys. We explore the possibility that a classifier created in one optical band can also work in other bands, likely from different survey facilities. We construct a random forest classifier based on photometric data in ASAS-SN V-band and OGLE I-band, and apply the classifier on ASAS-SN V-band and ZTF r-band light curves of variable star samples. We explore the classification differences of using the magnitude light-curves or the normalized flux light-curves, the periods derived from single band light-curves or the periods derived from the multi-band combined light-curves, and with or without color-related features. We find it feasible to develop a classifier capable of working in both V and r bands for certain types of variable stars, such as RRAB variables. For other types of variable stars, like Cepheids, the classifier is unable to make accurate identifications.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Parameter Determination of Exoplanet through Asteroseismic Host Star Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops a robust framework for exoplanet characterization by leveraging asteroseismic constraints on host stars. Using precise photometric data from missions such as \textit{Kepler} and \textit{TESS}, we derive stellar parameters, including mass, radius, and age, with high accuracy through asteroseismic analysis. These stellar parameters are incorporated as priors in a Bayesian framework to refine planetary properties such as mass, radius, and orbital parameters. By applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we extract posterior distributions of planetary parameters, achieving significant improvements in precision and reliability. This approach is particularly effective for systems with evolved host stars, where precise stellar properties are essential for resolving uncertainties in planetary characterization. The results demonstrate the importance of asteroseismology in bridging stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science, enabling detailed studies of planetary system architectures and their dependence on host star properties. Our methodology underscores the synergy between stellar and planetary studies, paving the way for future research on exoplanet populations. This work provides a foundation for utilizing data from upcoming missions like \textit{PLATO}, ensuring continued advancements in the precision and scope of exoplanet characterization.</description>

      <title>Unveiling What Makes Saturn Ring: Quantifying the Amplitudes of Saturn's Planetary Normal-Mode Oscillations and Trends in C-Ring Properties Using Kronoseismology (VII)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain spiral density waves in Saturn's rings are generated through resonances with planetary normal modes, making them valuable probes of Saturn's internal structure. Previous research has primarily focused on the rotation rates of these waves. However, other characteristics of these waves also contain valuable information about the planet's interior. In this work, we investigate the amplitudes of the waves across the C-ring by analyzing high signal-to-noise profiles derived from phase-corrected averages of occultation profiles obtained by Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). By fitting these wave profiles to linear density wave models, we estimate the ring's surface mass density, mass extinction coefficient and effective kinematic viscosity at 34 locations in the C-ring, as well as the amplitude of the gravitational potential perturbations associated with 6 satellite resonances and 28 planetary normal mode resonances.
  Our estimates of the C-ring's mass extinction coefficient, indicate that the typical particle mass density is around 0.3 g/cm^3 interior to 84,000 km, but can get as low as 0.03 g/cm^3 exterior to 84,000 km. We also find the ring's viscosity is reduced in the outer C-ring, which is consistent with the exceptionally high porosity of the particles in this region. Meanwhile, we find the amplitudes of Saturn's normal modes are complex functions of frequency, l and m, implying that multiple factors influence how efficiently these modes are excited. This analysis identified two primary sources of these normal-mode oscillations: a deep source located close to Saturn's core, and a shallow source residing near the surface.</description>

      <title>Seimei KOOLS-IFU mapping of the gas and dust distributions in Galactic PNe: the origin and evolution of DdDm1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a detailed study of the planetary nebula (PN) DdDm1 in the Galactic halo field. DdDm1 is a metal-deficient and the most carbon-poor PN (C/O = 0.11 +/- 0.02) identified in the Galaxy. We aim to verify whether it evolved into a PN without experiencing the third dredge-up (TDU) during the thermal pulse asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase and to investigate its origin and evolution through accurate measurements of the physical parameters of the nebula and its central star. We perform a comprehensive investigation of DdDm1 using multiwavelength spectra. The KOOLS-IFU emission line images achieve ~0.9 arcsec resolution, resolving the elliptical nebula and revealing a compact spatial distribution of the [Fe III] line compared to the [O III] line, despite their similar volume emissivities. This indicates that iron, with its higher condensation temperature than oxygen, is easily incorporated into dust grains such as silicate, making the iron abundance estimate prone to underestimation. Using a fully data-driven approach, we directly derive ten elemental abundances, the gas-to-dust mass ratio, and the gas and dust masses based on our own heliocentric distance scale (19.4 kpc) and the emitting volumes of gas and dust. Our analysis reveals that DdDm1 is a unique PN evolved from a single star with an initial mass of ~1.0 Msun and a metallicity Z of 0.18 Zsun. Thus, DdDm1 is the only known PN that is confirmed to have evolved without experiencing TDUs. The photoionization model reproduces all observed quantities in excellent agreement with predictions from AGB nucleosynthesis, post-AGB evolution, and AGB dust production models. Our study provides new insights into the internal evolution of low-mass and metal-deficient stars like DdDm1 and highlights the role of PN progenitors in the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves, frequently produced by eruptions, propagate through the non-uniform magnetic field of the solar corona and interact with distant prominences, inducing their global oscillations. However, the generation, propagation, and interaction of these waves with distant prominences remain poorly understood. We aim to study the influence of an eruptive flux rope (EFR) on a distant prominence by means of extreme-resolution numerical simulations. We cover a domain of a horizontal extent of 1100 Mm, while capturing details down to 130 km using automated grid refinement. We performed a 2.5D numerical experiment using the open-source \texttt{MPI-AMRVAC 3.1} code, modeling an eruption as a 2.5D catastrophe scenario augmented with a distant dipole magnetic field to form a flux rope prominence. Our findings reveal that the EFR becomes unstable and generates a quasi-circular front. The primary front produces a slow secondary front when crossing the equipartition lines where the Alfv\'en speed is close to the sound speed. The resulting fast and slow EUV waves show different behaviors: the fast EUV wave slightly decelerates as it propagates through the corona, while the slow EUV wave forms a stationary front. The fast EUV wave interacts with the remote prominence, driving both transverse and longitudinal oscillations. Additionally, magnetic reconnection at a null point below the prominence-hosting flux rope is triggered by the fast EUV wave, affecting the flux rope magnetic field and the prominence oscillations. Our study unifies important results of the dynamics of eruptive events and their interactions with distant prominences, including details of (oscillatory) reconnection and chaotic plasmoid dynamics. We demonstrate for the first time the full consequences of remote eruptions on prominence dynamics and clarify the damping mechanisms of prominence oscillations.</description>

      <title>Observations and Radiative Transfer Simulations of the Carbon-rich AGB star V Oph with VLTI/MATISSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are among the most important contributors of enriched materials to the interstellar medium due to their strong stellar winds. To fully characterize mass loss on the AGB, it is necessary to determine the distributions of dust and gas around the stars, where the dust begins to condense from the gas, and how this extended atmospheric structure evolves over the pulsational period of the star. We present an analysis of L-band (2.8-4.2 $\mu$m) interferometric observations of the carbon-rich AGB star V Oph made with the MATISSE instrument at the VLTI at the maximum and minimum of the star's visual light curve. Using the radiative transfer software RADMC-3D, we model the circumstellar dust shell, and find stellar radii of 395 and 495 $R_{\odot}$ at the two phases, and dust radii of 790 and 742.5 $R_{\odot}$ at the two epochs, respectively. By adding C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN gas to the RADMC-3D models, we are able to fit the visibility spectra well, with some deviations at the 3.11 $\mu$m feature. Reasons for this deviation and interpretation of the best fitting models are discussed in the text, and we discuss motivations for follow-up imaging observations of V Oph.</description>

Abstract: We estimate ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]) for 48 million giants and dwarfs in low-dust extinction regions from the Gaia DR3 XP spectra by using tree-based machine-learning models trained on APOGEE DR17 and metal-poor star sample \revise{from} Li et al. The root mean square error of our estimation is 0.0890 dex for [M/H] and 0.0436 dex for [$\alpha$/M], when we evaluate our models \revise{on} the test data that are not used in training the models. Because the training data is dominated by giants, our estimation is most reliable for giants. The high-[$\alpha$/M] stars and low-[$\alpha$/M] stars selected by our ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]) show different kinematical properties for giants and low-temperature dwarfs. We further investigate how our machine-learning models extract information on ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]). Intriguingly, we find that our models seem to extract information on [$\alpha$/M] from Na D lines (589 nm) and Mg I line (516 nm). This result is understandable given the observed correlation between Na and Mg abundances in the literature. The catalog of ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]) as well as their associated uncertainties are publicly available online.</description>

      <title>3-D CMZ I: Central Molecular Zone Overview</title>

Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy and is heavily obscured in the optical and near-IR. We present an overview of the far-IR dust continuum, where the molecular clouds are revealed, provided by Herschel in the inner 40\deg($|l| &lt;$ 20\deg) of the Milky Way with a particular focus on the CMZ. We report a total dense gas ($N$(H$_2$) $&gt; 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) CMZ mass of M=$2\substack{+2 \\ -1} \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ and confirm that there is a highly asymmetric distribution of dense gas, with about 70-75% at positive longitudes. We create and publicly release complete fore/background-subtracted column density and dust temperature maps in the inner 40\deg ($|l| &lt;$ 20\deg) of the Galaxy. We find that the CMZ clearly stands out as a distinct structure, with an average mass per longitude that is at least $3\times$ higher than the rest of the inner Galaxy contiguously from 1.8\deg $&gt; \ell &gt;$ -1.3\deg. This CMZ extent is larger than previously assumed, but is consistent with constraints from velocity information. The inner Galaxy's column density peaks towards the SgrB2 complex with a value of about 2 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and typical CMZ molecular clouds are about N(H$_2$)=10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Typical CMZ dust temperatures range from about $12-35$ K with relatively little variation. We identify a ridge of warm dust in the inner CMZ that potentially traces the base of the northern Galactic outflow seen with MEERKAT.</description>

      <title>Secret of Longevity: Protoplanetary Disks as a Source of Gas in Debris Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are generally thought to disperse within several million years, recent observations have revealed gas in their older counterparts, debris disks. The origin of this gas remains uncertain, with one possibility being the unexpectedly long survival of PPDs (the primordial-origin scenario). To explore the plausibility of this scenario, we conduct 1D disk evolution simulations, varying parameters like stellar mass, disk mass, turbulent stress, and the model of magnetohydrodynamic winds, while incorporating stellar evolution to account for time-varying photoevaporation rates. Our focus is on disks where small grains are depleted, as these are potentially long-lived due to reduced far-ultraviolet photoevaporation. Our results show that gas in these disks can survive beyond 10 Myr regardless of the stellar mass, provided they are initially massive ($M_{\mathrm{disk}}\approx 0.1M_*$) with relatively weak turbulent stress ($\alpha \ll 10^{-2}$). The longest lifetimes are consistently found for $M_* = 2 M_{\odot}$ across a wide parameter space, with gas typically persisting at $\sim 10$--$10^3$ au. Roughly estimated CO masses for these disks fall within the observed range for the most massive gas-rich debris disks around early A~stars. These alignments support the plausibility of the primordial-origin scenario. Additionally, our model predicts that accretion persists for as long as the disk survives, which could explain the accretion signatures detected in old disks hosted by low-mass stars, including Peter Pan disks. Our finding also suggests that ongoing accretion may exist in gas-rich debris disks. Thus, searching for accretion signatures could be a key to determining the origins of gas in debris disks.</description>
