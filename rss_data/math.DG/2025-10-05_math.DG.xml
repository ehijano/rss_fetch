      <title>New classes of Finsler metrics: The birth of new projective invatiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a pioneering projective invariant in Finsler geometry, introducing a new class of Finsler metrics that are preserved under projective transformations. The newly formulated weakly generalized Douglas-Weyl $(W-G D W)$ equation facilitates the generalization of generalized Douglas-Weyl $(G D W)$-metrics into the broader category of $W-G D W$-metrics, which encompasses all $G D W$-metrics. Within this class, there are also two additional subclasses: generalized weakly-Weyl metrics, characterized by a milder form of Weyl curvature, and generalized $\tilde{D}$-metrics, defined by a less strict version of Douglas curvature. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of these generalized class of Finsler metrics and elucidates their properties, supported by detailed examples.</description>

      <title>Non-squeezing and capacities for some calibrated geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was shown by Barron--Shafiee that an analogue of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem holds for affine maps which preserve a power $\omega^k$ of the symplectic form $\omega$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. In the present paper, we state and prove in two ways an improved version of their result which is closer to the classical affine non-squeezing theorem. One proof closely follows their argument, and the other consists of a reduction to the classical case by showing that, except for the case $k = n$, every linear map that preserves $\omega^k$ must be symplectic or anti-symplectic.
  We then study when a calibration form satisfies an (affine) non-squeezing theorem. Particular focus is given to the special Lagrangian case, where we are able to establish an affine non-squeezing theorem for the holomorphic volume form $\Omega = dz^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dz^n$. The classical symplectic affine rigidity theorem states roughly that a non-singular linear map is symplectic or anti-symplectic if and only if it preserves the "capacity" of every ellipsoid. We establish an affine special Lagrangian version of this theorem under the additional assumption that the map is complex-linear. We also discuss some natural future questions.</description>

      <title>Minimally embedded Riemann surfaces in $\mb{S}^3$ and the conformal deformation of their metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $f_g: (\Sigma,g) \rightarrow (\mb{S}^{2+p},\tg)$ is a smooth minimal isometric embedding of a Riemannian surface $(\Sigma,g)$, and $[0,1]\ni t \rightarrow g_t$ is a path of area preserving conformal deformations of $g$ on $f_g(\Sigma)$, then there exists a path of conformal diffeomorphism $F_t: (\mb{S}^{2+p}, F_t^*\tg) \rightarrow (\mb{S}^{2+p},\tg)$ that starts at $\BOne_{\mb{S}^{2+p}}$, set theoretically fixes $f_g(\Sigma)$ for all $t$, and it is such that $F^{*}_t \tilde{g}\mid_{f_g(M)}=g_t$ with $f_{g_t}: (\Sigma,g_t) \rightarrow (\mb{S}^{2+p},\tg)$ a path of minimal embedding deformations of the initial $f_g$. We apply this result to the Lawson surface $( \Sigma,g)=(\xi_{k/m,m}, g_{\xi_{k/m,m}})$, $m|k&gt;1$, to conclude that if $a=\mu_{g_{\xi_{k/m,m}}}(\Sigma)$, and $[0,1]\ni t \rightarrow g_t$ is a path of area $a$ metrics conformal deformations of $g_{k/m,m}$ to a metric $g_a$ of scalar curvature $4\pi \chi(\Sigma)/a$, then $f_{g_{\xi_{k/m,m}}}: (\xi_{k/m,m},g_{\xi_{k/m,m}}) \rightarrow (\mb{S}^3, \tg)$ has associated minimal isometric conformal deformations $f_{g_t}$ to the isometric embedding $f_{g_a}$ of $g_a$, in sharp contrast with the situation of the standard sphere $\xi_{0,1}$ and Clifford torus $(\xi_{1,1}$, which are the only orientable Riemannian surfaces of genus $0$ and $1$ isometrically embedded into $(\mb{S}^3,\tg)$ as minimal surfaces. If $\sigma^2(\Sigma):=\sup_{[g]\in \mc{C}(\Sigma)}(4\pi \chi( \Sigma))^2/\left(\frac{1}{4}\inf_{g\in [g]}\mc{W}_{f_g}(\Sigma)\right)$, $\mc{W}_{f_g}(\Sigma)$ the Willmore energy of $f_g$ and $\mc{C}( \Sigma)$ the space of classes, then $(4\pi \chi(\Sigma))^2/\left( \frac{1} {4}\mc{W}_{f_g}(\Sigma) \right) \leq \sigma^2(\Sigma)=(4\pi \chi( \Sigma))^2/\left(\frac{1}{4}\mc{W}_{f_{g_{\xi_{k,1}}}}(\Sigma) \right)$, and we describe the $f_g$s for which the equality is achieved.</description>

      <title>On the invariant surface area functionals in 3-dimensional CR geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cheng, Yang, and Zhang have studied two invariant surface area functionals in 3-dimensional CR manifolds. They deduced the Euler-Lagrange equations of the associated energy functionals when the 3-dimensional CR manifold has constant Webster curvature and vanishing torsion. In this paper, we deduce the the Euler-Lagrange equations of the energy functionals in a more general 3-dimensional CR manifold. Moreover, we study the invariant area functionals on the disk bundle, on the Rossi sphere, and on 3-dimensional tori.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify $7$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds carrying a metric connection with parallel skew-symmetric torsion whose holonomy is contained in $\mathrm{G}_2$, up to naturally reductive homogeneous spaces and nearly parallel $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. This extends and completes the classification initiated by Th. Friedrich in the cocalibrated case. Incidentally, we also obtain the list of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ geometries with parallel skew-symmetric torsion, up to naturally reductive homogeneous spaces and nearly K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <title>Nodal resolution of quasiregular curves via bubble trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a version of Gromov's compactness theorem for quasiregular curves into calibrated manifolds with bounded geometry. In our main theorem, given an $n$-dimensional calibration $\omega$ on manifold $N$, we associate to a weak-$\star$ limit $\mu = \lim_{k \to \infty} \star F_k^*\omega$ of measures induced by a sequence $(F_k \colon X\to N)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of $K$-quasiregular $\omega$-curves on a nodal manifold $X$, a bubble tree $\widehat X$ over $X$, a sequence of mappings $(\widehat F_\ell \colon X \to N)_{\ell \in \mathbb{N}}$ converging locally uniformly to a quasiregular curve $\widehat F\colon \widehat X\to N$ which realizes the measure $\mu$, that is, $\mu = \pi_*(\star \widehat F^*\omega)$, where $\pi \colon \widehat X\to X$ is the natural projection. We call the sequence $(\widehat F_\ell)_{\ell \in \mathbb{N}}$ a nodal resolution of the sequence $(F_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$. As a corollary we obtain a normality criterion for families of quasiregular curves. Classic interpretations of bubbling via Gromov--Hausdorff convergence and pinching maps also follow.</description>

      <title>Two Calabi-Yau theorems for degenerations of compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss two closely related Calabi-Yau theorems for degenerations of compact K\"ahler manifolds. The first is a Calabi-Yau theorem for big test configurations, that generalizes a result in [WN24]. It follows from recent joint work with Mesquita-Piccione [MW25], but is here given a more direct proof. The second result is a Calabi-Yau theorem for a wider class of degenerations, formulated in the language of non-Archimedean K\"ahler geometry. It was first proved in the algebraic setting by Boucksom-Jonsson [BJ22], building on earlier work of Boucksom-Favre-Jonsson [BFJ15], while the general K\"ahler case was established in [MW25]. Our main focus here is on the connection between these results and the theory of big cohomology classes and their volumes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we construct correspondences between polygon spaces in Euclidean spaces of dimension $2,3,5,9\ $and the quotient spaces of $2$-Steifel manifolds along the normed division algebra$\ \mathbb{F}$ real $\mathbb{R}$, complex $\mathbb{C}$, quaternions $\mathbb{H}$, octonions $\mathbb{O}$. For the purpose, we introduce Hopf map on $\mathbb{F}^{2}\ $and consider the spin action of $SU\left( 2,\mathbb{F}\right) $ to spinor $\mathbb{F}^{2}\ $and the induced $SO\ $action to the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R\oplus F}$. The correspondences are extension of the work of Hausmann and Knutson for polygon spaces of dimension $2,3\ $and $2$-Grassmannians over real and complex.</description>

      <title>The epsilon-regularity theorem for Brakke flows near triple junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem for $k$-dimensional, possibly forced, Brakke flows near a static, multiplicity-one triple junction. This result provides the parabolic analogue to L. Simon's foundational work on the singular set of stationary varifolds and confirms that the regular structure of triple junctions persists under weak mean curvature flow. The regularity holds provided the flow satisfies a mild structural assumption on its 1-dimensional slices taken orthogonal to the junction's $(k-1)$-dimensional spine, which prohibits certain topological degeneracies. We prove that this assumption is automatically satisfied by two fundamental classes of flows where such singularities are expected: codimension-one multi-phase flows, such as the canonical $\mathrm{BV}$-Brakke flows constructed by the authors, and flows of arbitrary codimension with the structure of a mod 3 integral current, which arise from Ilmanen's elliptic regularization. For such flows, therefore, the Simon type regularity holds unconditionally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent interest of geometers in the $f$-structures of K. Yano is motivated by the study of the dynamics of contact foliations, as well as their applications in theoretical physics. Weak metric $f$-structures on a smooth manifold, recently introduced by the author and R. Wolak, open a new perspective on the theory of classical structures. In the paper, we define structures of this kind, called weak nearly ${\cal S}$- and weak nearly ${\cal C}$- structures, study their geometry, e.g. their relations to Killing vector fields, and characterize weak nearly ${\cal S}$- and weak nearly ${\cal S}$- submanifolds in a weak nearly K\"{a}hler manifold.</description>

Abstract: Given a Yamaguchi nonrigid parabolic model geometry $(G,P)$ with $G$ simple of real rank at least $3$, we use techniques developed by Erickson to establish the existence of closed, nonflat, essential, regular, normal Cartan geometries modeled on $(G,P)$. Yamaguchi nonrigidity is a necessary condition for admitting nonflat, regular, normal examples. This rules out Lichnerowicz-type conjectures for these model geometries.</description>

      <title>Nu-invariants of extra-twisted connected sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.16367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the possible ways of gluing twisted products of circles with asymptotically cylindrical Calabi-Yau manifolds to produce manifolds with holonomy G_2, thus generalising the twisted connected sum construction of Kovalev and Corti, Haskins, Nordstr\"om, Pacini. We then express the extended nu-invariant of Crowley, Goette, and Nordstr\"om arXiv:1505.02734 in terms of fixpoint and gluing contributions, which include different types of (generalised) Dedekind sums. Surprisingly, the calculations involve some non-trivial number-theoretical arguments connected with special values of the Dedekind eta-function and the theory of complex multiplication. One consequence of our computations is that there exist compact G_2-manifolds that are not G_2-nullbordant.</description>

      <title>The six operations in topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the six functor formalism for sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff topological spaces, as developed for example in Kashiwara and Schapira's book Sheaves on Manifolds, can be extended to sheaves with values in any closed symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category which is stable and bicomplete. Notice that, since we do not assume that our coefficients are presentable or restrict to hypercomplete sheaves, our arguments are not obvious and are substantially different from the ones explained by Kashiwara and Schapira. Along the way we also study locally contractible geometric morphisms and prove that, if $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous map which induces a locally contractible geometric morphism, then the exceptional pullback functor $f^!$ preserves colimits and can be related to the pullback $f^*$. At the end of our paper we also show how one can express Atiyah duality by means of the six functor formalism.</description>

      <title>A Gromov-Witten approach to $G$-equivariant birational invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07322v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2404.19088, we initiated a program linking birational invariants with smooth ones and offering new interpretations of classical invariants, such as the Kervaire-Milnor invariants. Here, we rely on the profound geometric reasoning provided by Lupercio and Uribe in the early 00s to establish a connection between Chen-Ruan cohomology and several $G$-birational invariants introduced in the pioneering works Kontsevich, Kresch, Pestun, Tschinkel, along with presenting applications. Combined with the theory of atoms by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, the proposal in this paper program will lead to a theory of equivariant atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10815v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lie Yamaguti algebras appear naturally on the smooth sections of the tangent bundle of a reductive homogeneous space when we interpret the torsion and curvature as algebraic operators. In this article we present a description of the free Lie Yamaguti algebra.</description>

      <title>Piecewise geodesic Jordan curves II: Loewner energy, projective structures, and accessory parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Jordan curves on the Riemann sphere passing through $n \ge 3$ given points. We show that in each relative isotopy class of such curves, there exists a unique curve that minimizes the Loewner energy. These curves have the property that each arc between two consecutive points is a hyperbolic geodesic in the domain bounded by the other arcs. This geodesic property lets us define a complex projective structure whose holonomy lies in $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. We show that the quadratic differential comparing this projective structure to the trivial projective structure on the sphere has simple poles whose residues (accessory parameters) are given by the Wirtinger derivatives of the minimal Loewner energy. This is reminiscent of Polyakov's conjecture for Fuchsian projective structures, proven by Takhtajan and Zograf. Finally, we show that the projective structures we obtain are related to Fuchsian projective structures through $\pi$-grafting.</description>

      <title>Liouville type results for semilinear elliptic equation and inequality on pseudo-Hermitian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the semilinear elliptic equation and inequality on pseudo-Hermitian manifolds. In particular, we first obtain a Liouville theorem for the equation $\Delta_b u+F(u)=0$ based on a generalized Jerison-Lee's formula. Next, we prove the nonexistence of a positive solution to the inequality $\Delta_b u+F(u)\leq 0$ under the volume estimate.</description>

      <title>Schwarzian Bounds on Bending in Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schwarzian derivative provides a classical analytic measure of how far a holomorphic map of the disk is from being M\"obius, with Nehari's bounds giving sharp criteria for univalence. Independently, Thurston introduced a geometric parametrization of locally univalent maps via bending measured laminations on the hyperbolic plane, capturing deviation from roundness in hyperbolic three-space. While both approaches quantify the same phenomenon, their precise relationship has remained only implicit. In this paper we establish explicit quantitative bounds relating the Schwarzian norm $\|Sf\|_\infty$ and the bending norm $\|\beta_f\|_L$. In particular, for univalent maps with $\|Sf\|_\infty&lt; 1/2$, we show that $\|\beta_f\|_L$ is controlled by an elementary function $B_L(\|Sf\|_L)$ that we compute explicitly. As an application, we obtain new effective bounds on the bending laminations of quasifuchsian manifolds in terms of the Teichm\"uller distance between their conformal boundary components. Our results sharpen the analytic-geometric correspondence between the Schwarzian derivative and hyperbolic geometry showing that just as small Schwarzian norm forces injectivity, it also forces controlled bending of convex hull boundaries.</description>
