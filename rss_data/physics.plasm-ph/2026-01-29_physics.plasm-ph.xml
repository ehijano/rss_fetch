      <title>Superelastic Heating in Treanor-Gordiets Plasmas: A Unified Analytic Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-equilibrium plasmas where the vibrational temperature exceeds the gas temperature, conventional harmonic models underestimate superelastic electron heating rates by an order of magnitude or more. This failure stems from the artificial decoupling of energy modes, which ignores the exponential heating contributions from overpopulated high-lying states characteristic of Treanor-Gordiets distributions. We resolve this limitation by deriving a closed-form, thermodynamically consistent anharmonic gain function based on detailed balance and a second-order Dunham expansion. This formulation serves as a unified governing equation that naturally identifies the kinetic crossover between vibrational-vibrational (V-V) up-pumping and vibrational-translational (V-T) relaxation. This approach accurately predicts the Treanor minimum and recovers the accuracy of full state-to-state benchmarks at a fraction of the computational cost. The model provides a robust closure for predicting electron temperature evolution in applications ranging from hypersonic flows to plasma-assisted combustion.</description>

      <title>Compressible Turbulence as a Source of Particle Beams and Ion Bernstein Waves in Collisionless Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the source of particle beams and ion Bernstein waves in collisionless plasmas using a high-resolution particle-in-cell simulation of compressible turbulence. At magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales, compressible turbulence is damped by transit-time damping, naturally generating suprathermal electrons and proton beams. As the energy cascade reaches sub-ion scales, multiple branches of ion Bernstein waves are excited and contribute to the formation of proton suprathermal tails. Under realistic conditions such as those in the solar wind, these processes remain efficient and provide a natural explanation for the super-Alfv\'enic proton beams observed in situ. We show that compressive fluctuations, though often understudied, are essential for cross-scale energy transfer and dissipation in collisionless plasma turbulence.</description>

      <title>Loading non-Maxwellian Velocity Distributions in Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical procedures for generating non-Maxwellian velocity distributions in particle simulations are presented. First, Monte Carlo methods for an $(r,q)$ distribution that generalizes flattop and kappa distributions are discussed. Then, two rejection methods for the regularized kappa distribution are presented, followed by a comparison in the $\kappa$ space. A simple recipe is proposed for the subtracted kappa distribution. Properties and numerical recipes for the ring and shell distributions with a finite Gaussian width are discussed. The ring and shell Maxwellians are further introduced as alternatives to the ring and shell distributions. Finally, methods for the super-Gaussian and the filled-shell distributions are presented.</description>

      <title>Advanced Shaping of Quasi-Bessel Beams for High-Intensity Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-Bessel beams produced by axiparabolas are increasingly used in high-intensity laser applications, yet their longitudinal profiles exhibit unwanted oscillations that limit their effectiveness. Here we identify the physical origin of these distortions and develop a general strategy to control the on-axis intensity of extended focal lines. By combining analytical insight with numerical and experimental validation, we show how both smooth and sharply structured longitudinal profiles can be reliably produced. This establishes a robust framework for tailoring quasi-Bessel beams in regimes relevant to laser-plasma acceleration, advanced photon sources, and other high-field applications.</description>

      <title>Unified theory of classical and quantum ergotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the ergotropy (a.k.a. available energy), namely the maximal amount of energy that can be extracted from a thermally isolated system, is a central problem in quantum thermodynamics. Notably, the same problem has been long studied for classical systems as well, e.g. in plasma physics and astrophysics, where the basic principles for its solution are known for the case of collisionless fluids. Here we provide the general analytical expression of ergotropy of classical systems valid regardless of their size and the type of interparticle interactions, and show that it emerges as the classical limit of the quantum expression of ergotropy, for quantum systems that are classically ergodic. We thus establish a unified theory of classical and quantum ergotropy, whose applicability ranges from atomic to galactic scale. Such unified theory is indispensable for studying the genuine quantum signatures of ergotropy: We show that the celebrated decomposition of quantum ergotropy into coherent ant inchoherent parts survives in the classical regime, indicating that coherences do not necessarily reveal quantumness. The unified theory also allows to port tools and methods across the classical-quantum boundary to unlock the solution of standing problems. We apply this to swiftly solve the open problem of ergotropy extraction in the classical regime.</description>

      <title>Virtual states and exponential decay in small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the Kazantsev theory of small-scale dynamo generation at small Prandtl numbers near the generation threshold and restore the concordance between the theory and numerical simulations: the theory predicted a power-law decay below the threshold, while simulations demonstrate exponential decay. We show that the exponential decay is temporary and owes its existence to the flattening of the velocity correlator at large scales. This effect corresponds to the existence of a long-living virtual level in the corresponding Schrodinger type equation. We also find the critical Reynolds number and the increment of growth/decay above and under the threshold; we express them in terms of the quantitative characteristic properties of the velocity correlator, which makes it possible to compare the results with the data of different simulations.</description>
