      <title>Big Ramsey combinatorics of the Cantor set and a simple proof of Blass' perfect set theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a simple approach to big Ramsey combinatorics of the Cantor set $2^\omega$. Using Infinite Dual Ramsey Theorem of Carlson and Simpson, we show that $2^\omega$, viewed as a topological space, has finite big Ramsey degrees. We then examine several natural topological first-order structures arising from the Cantor set and prove that each of them inherits finite big Ramsey degrees. As a consequence, we obtain a simple proof of Blass' perfect set theorem, although our method does not recover the sharp bound $(n-1)!$ for the number of colors. We also show that the complete Boolean algebra on countably many atoms has finite big Ramsey degrees, in contrast with the recent result showing that the countable atomless Boolean algebra does not have big Ramsey degrees.</description>

      <title>Compactness in Constructive Mathematics via Affine Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topology, particularly compactness, as an extension of Shulman's work for constructive mathematics via affine logic, while allowing propositional impredicativity. In addition to some basic properties of compactness, we prove the extreme value theorem and the Heine-Borel theorem for "cuts", which are a version of Dedekind cuts in affine logic. Moreover, from the antithesis translation of the Heine-Borel theorem for cuts to intuitionistic logic, we derive the Heine-Borel theorem for one-sided reals intuitionistically, and have verified its proof with the interactive theorem prover. The code is available at https://github.com/hziwara/CutsHeineBorel.</description>

      <title>Affine logic with the integration operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine continuous logic is extended to affine integration logic. Affine compactness theorem is proved by both the ultramean construction and Henkin's method. Also, a proof system and a completeness theorem are given. An appropriate variant of the Keisler-Shelah isomorphism theorem holds in this setting. This helps us to characterize non-forking extensions in affine stable theories by means of the notion of elementary embedding in the expanded logic.</description>

      <title>Axiomatizations of Presburger Arithmetic With Predicates For Powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete first-order axiomatization of the structure $(\mathbb{Z},+,(\ell^{\mathbb{N}})_{\ell\in L})$, where $L \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}$ is a set of pairwise multiplicatively independent integers and $\ell^{\mathbb{N}} = \{\ell^n : n\in \mathbb{N}\}$. Using recent work of Karimov et al., we obtain that this axiomatization is computable for $|L|=2$, which proves that $(\mathbb{Z},+,k^{\mathbb{N}}, \ell^{\mathbb{N}})$ is decidable for $k, \ell\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}$. Furthermore, we give an axiomatization of the universal theory of $(\mathbb{Z},+,&lt;,(\ell^{\mathbb{N}})_{\ell\in L})$.</description>

      <title>Rigid many-one degrees contain infinite antichains of $1$-degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odifreddi asked whether every non-irreducible many-one degree must contain an infinite antichain of one-one degrees. Positive answers are known for computably enumerable many-one degrees (Degtev) and, more recently, for many-one degrees admitting a $\Delta^0_2$ representative (Batyrshin). In this note we isolate a rigidity principle behind these phenomena.
  Call a set $A\subseteq\omega$ \emph{$m$-rigid} if every total computable $m$-autoreduction of $A$ is eventually the identity. We prove that if $A$ is $m$-rigid, then its many-one degree $\deg_m(A)$ contains an infinite antichain of $1$-degrees. The proof uses a uniform duplication construction: for each computable parameter $S$ we define $B_S\equiv_m A$ so that any injective reduction $B_S\le_1 B_T$ induces an $m$-autoreduction of $A$ and therefore forces $S\subseteq^{*}T$. Choosing an almost-inclusion infinite antichain of computable sets yields the desired infinite $1$-antichain inside $\deg_m(A)$.
  As applications, Jockusch's rigidity theorem implies that every $1$-generic set is $m$-rigid, giving a comeager family of positive instances. Moreover, $m$-rigidity holds with Lebesgue measure $1$ (indeed, every Martin-L\"of random real is $m$-rigid). Consequently, Odifreddi's Question~5 has a positive answer \emph{with probability $1$} for a fair-coin random $A\in 2^\omega$; any counterexample (if it exists) is confined to a null set (and, by genericity, also to a meager set).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the expressive power of HOL, a system of higher-order logic, and its relationship to the simply-typed lambda calculus and Church's simple theory of types, arguing for the potential of HOL as a unifying logical framework, capable of encoding a broad range of logical systems, including modal and non-classical logics. Along the way, we emphasize the essential role of discernment, the ability to tell things apart, as a language primitive; highlighting how it endows HOL with practical expressivity superpowers while elegantly enriching its theoretical properties.</description>

      <title>Hypersequent Calculi Have Ackermannian Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For substructural logics with contraction or weakening admitting cut-free sequent calculi, proof search was analyzed using well-quasi-orders on $\mathbb{N}^d$ (Dickson's lemma), yielding Ackermannian upper bounds via controlled bad-sequence arguments. For hypersequent calculi, that argument lifted the ordering to the powerset, since a hypersequent is a (multi)set of sequents. This induces a jump from Ackermannian to hyper-Ackermannian complexity in the fast-growing hierarchy, suggesting that cut-free hypersequent calculi for extensions of the commutative Full Lambek calculus with contraction or weakening ($\mathbf{FL_{ec}}$/$\mathbf{FL_{ew}}$) inherently entail hyper-Ackermannian upper bounds. We show that this intuition does not hold: every extension of $\mathbf{FL_{ec}}$ and $\mathbf{FL_{ew}}$ admitting a cut-free hypersequent calculus has an Ackermannian upper bound on provability.
  To avoid the powerset, we exploit novel dependencies between individual sequents within any hypersequent in backward proof search. The weakening case, in particular, introduces a Karp-Miller style acceleration, and it improves the upper bound for the fundamental fuzzy logic $\mathbf{MTL}$. Our Ackermannian upper bound is optimal for the contraction case (realized by the logic $\mathbf{FL_{ec}}$).</description>

      <title>Parallelism and Adaptivity in Student-Teacher Witnessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Student-Teacher Games are a model of computation in which a computationally restricted Student attempts to produce a string satisfying a refutable property, while an all-powerful Teacher refutes incorrect candidates by providing counterexamples. By the classical result of Kraj\'i\v{c}ek, Pudl\'ak, and Takeuti [KPT90], such games capture the witnessing of $\forall\exists\forall$-formulas in bounded arithmetic. In this paper, we introduce subclasses of total search problems in the polynomial hierarchy, classified by the number of rounds and candidate answers per round required for a Student at the corresponding level to solve them. Assuming the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse, we separate these classes for different number of rounds and queries. As applications we obtain the following results:
  (a) We study theories of bounded arithmetic axiomatized by fine-grained variants of length induction and bounded collection. We prove a general witnessing theorem connecting their $\forall\exists\forall$-consequences to the appropriate classes of Student-Teacher Games. Under the non-collapse of the polynomial hierarchy, we separate these theories.
  (b) These conditional separations resolve two open problems in bounded arithmetic: one by Buss and Ressayre [Bus85, CK93] on the strength of bounded collection, and one by Pollett [Pol97] on the difference between strict and non-strict double length induction.
  (c) Finally, we extend the unprovability of circuit upper bounds due to Kraj\'i\v{c}ek and Oliveira [KO17] to the theory $PV_1+BB(\Sigma^b_1)$, and the unprovability of strong co-nondeterministic circuit lower bounds due to Pich and Santhanam [PS21] to the theory $PV_1+LLIND(s\Sigma^b_1)$. By the preceding separations, both theories strictly extend $PV_1$ assuming $NP\nsubseteq P/poly$.</description>

      <title>Countable models of weakly quasi-o-minimal theories I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of triviality and order-triviality for global invariant types in an arbitrary first-order theory and show that they are well behaved in the NIP context. We show that these two notions agree for invariant global extensions of a weakly o-minimal type, in which case we say that the type is trivial. In the o-minimal case, we prove that every definable complete 1-type over a model is trivial. We prove that the triviality has several favorable properties; in particular, it is preserved in nonforking extensions of a weakly o-minimal type and under weak nonorthogonality of weakly o-minimal types. We introduce the notion of a shift in a linearly ordered structure that generalizes the successor function. Then we apply the techniques developed to prove that every weakly quasi-o-minimal theory that admits a definable shift has $2^{\aleph_0}$ countable models.</description>

Abstract: Using a variation of Woodin's $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{max}}$ forcing, we force over a model of the Axiom of Determinacy to produce a model of ZFC containing a very strongly increasing sequence of length $\omega_{2}$ consisting of functions from $\omega$ to $\omega$. We also show that there can be no such sequence of length $\omega_{4}$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that topological isomorphism on $2$-nilpotent procountable groups is not classifiable by countable structures, in the sense of descriptive set theory. In fact, the equivalence relation $\ell_\infty$ expressing that two sequences of reals have a bounded difference is Borel reducible to it. This marks substantial progress on an open problem of Kechris, Nies and Tent (2018): to determine the exact complexity of the isomorphism relation among all non-archimedean Polish groups.</description>

Abstract: We exhibit a geometric morphism from the Grothendieck topos representing the Solovay model to the $\kappa$-pyknotic sets of Barwick--Haine and Clausen--Scholze. We then use the properties of this morphism and automatic continuity in the Solovay model to prove Clausen--Scholze's resolution of the Whitehead problem for discrete condensed abelian groups. We also exhibit an analogous internal $Ext$ computation between locally compact abelian groups in the Solovay model.</description>

      <title>Wider systems for linear logic with fixed points: proof theory and complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate infinitary wellfounded systems for linear logic with fixed points, with transfinite branching rules indexed by some closure ordinal $\alpha$ for fixed points. Our main result is that provability in the system for some computable ordinal $\alpha$ is complete for the $\omega^{\alpha^\omega}$ level of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy.
  To this end we first develop proof theoretic foundations, namely cut elimination and focussing results, to control both the upper and lower bound analysis. Our arguments employ a carefully calibrated notion of formula rank, calculating a tight bound on the height of the (cut-free) proof search space.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Proving Choice in Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an alternative approach to proving the existence of choice functions for specific families of sets within Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) without assuming any form on the Axiom of Choice (AC). Traditional methods of proving choice, when it is possible without AC, are based on explicit constructing a choice function, which relies on being able to identify canonical elements within the sets. Our approach, instead, employs the axiom schema of separation. We begin by considering families of well-ordered sets, then apply the schema of separation twice to build a set of possible candidates for the choice functions, and, finally, prove that this set is non-empty. This strategy enables proving the existence of choice function in situations where canonical elements cannot be identified explicitly. We then extend our method beyond families of well-ordered sets to families of sets, over which partial orders with a least element exist. After exploring possibilities for further generalization, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition: in ZF, without assuming AC, a choice function exists for a non-empty family if and only if each set admits a partial order with a least element. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach can be used to prove the existence of choice functions for families of contractible and path-connected topological spaces, including hyper-intervals in $\mathbb{R}^n$, hyper-balls, and hyper-spheres.</description>

      <title>Toposes with enough points as categories of \'etale spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Makkai duality between coherent toposes and ultracategories to a duality between toposes with enough points and ultraconvergence spaces. Our proof generalizes and simplifies Makkai's original proof. Our main result can also be seen as an extension to ionads of Barr's equivalence between topological spaces and relational modules for the ultrafilter monad. In view of the correspondence between toposes and geometric theories, we obtain a strong conceptual completeness theorem, in the sense of Makkai, for geometric theories with enough Set-models. The same result has recently been obtained independently by Saadia (arXiv:2506.23935) and by Hamad (arXiv:2507.07922). Both of their proofs rely on groupoid representations of toposes, which our proof here does not assume.</description>

Abstract: The game of cops and robbers, played on a fixed graph $G$, is a two-player game, where the cop and the robber (the players) take turns in moving to adjacent vertices. The game finishes if the cop lands on the robber's vertex. In that case we say that the cop wins. If the cop can always win, regardless of the starting positions, we say that $G$ is a cop-win graph.
  For a finite cop-win graph $G$ we can ask for the minimum number $n$ such that, regardless of the starting positions, the game will end in at most $n$ steps. This number is called the maximum capture time of $G$. By looking at finite paths, we see that any non-negative integer is the maximum capture time for a cop-win graph.
  What about infinite cop-win graphs? In this case, the notion of capture time is nicely generalised if one works with ordinals, and so the question becomes which ordinals can be the maximum capture time of a cop-win graph? These ordinals are called CR (Cop-Robber)-ordinals. In this paper we fully settle this by showing that all ordinals are CR-ordinals, answering a question of Bonato, Gordinowicz and Hahn.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of (pre)liminary C*-algebras</title>

Abstract: Given an arbitrary countable ordinal $\alpha $, we introduce the notion of type $I_{\alpha }$ C*-algebra and $\alpha $-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. When $\alpha =0$, these recover the notions of Fell C*-algebra and of commutative C*-algebra, respectively. When $\alpha =n&lt;\omega $, these recover the notions of type $I_{n}$ C*-algebra and of $n$-subhomogeneous C*-algebra, respectively. We prove that a separable C*-algebra is liminary if and only if it is type $I_{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$, and it is preliminary (i.e., has no infinite-dimensional irreducible representation) if and only if it is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$. We also prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha $ there exists a separable C*-algebra that is type $I_{\alpha }$ and not type $I_{\beta }$ for $\beta &lt;\alpha $, and a separable C*-algebra that is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous and not $\beta $-subhomogeneous for any $\beta &lt;\alpha $.</description>

      <title>Strong Normalization for the Safe Fragment of a Minimal Rewrite Calculus: A Triple-Lexicographic Proof and a Conjecture on Full-Termination Limits for Pure Recursive Calculi (PRC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00081</link>

Abstract: We introduce Pure Recursive Calculi (PRC): finite, operator-only rewrite calculi with no variable binding, no external memory, no imported axioms, and an unrestricted step-duplicating recursor. We study KO7, a minimal witness system (7 constructors, 8 rules) designed to isolate the duplication barrier while remaining auditable. In the full relation, a non-local-join witness at eqW void void shows that unrestricted confluence is unavailable. We therefore define a guarded fragment, SafeStep, and prove strong normalization via a computable triple-lex measure (deltaFlag, kappa^M, tau). The proof is rule-by-rule and mechanized: rec-succ is discharged by a strict deltaFlag drop, rec-zero by a Dershowitz-Manna multiset decrease on kappa^M, and tie branches (including merge-cancel and guarded eqW cases) by tau. From this measure we derive a certified normalizer and prove totality and soundness. We then formalize a Newman engine for SafeStep, discharge the local-join hypothesis in the artifact, and obtain unconditional confluence and unique normal forms for the safe fragment. To characterize limits of internal termination proving under duplication, we report fourteen failed strategy families (twelve machine-checked, two meta-theoretical). These include additive and simple lexicographic counters, polynomial and weight-based interpretations, flag-only and depth-only rankings, naive multisets, local patch lemmas, and unrestricted recursion barriers; path-order methods are treated separately because they rely on imported subterm principles. We also connect safe-fragment normalization to fixed-target reachability via a normalize-and-compare decision pattern under confluence. These results motivate a conjecture: for PRCs with unrestricted step duplication, no internally definable method currently known proves full-calculus termination without importing external structural principles.</description>
