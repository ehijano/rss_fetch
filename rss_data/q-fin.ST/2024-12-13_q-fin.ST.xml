      <title>Detecting discrete processes with the Epps effect</title>

Abstract: The Epps effect is key phenomenology relating to high frequency correlation dynamics in financial markets. We argue that it can be used to provide insight into whether tick data is best represented as samples from Brownian diffusions, or as samples from truly discrete events represented as connected point processes. We derive the Epps effect arising from asynchrony and provide a refined method to correct for the effect. We then propose three experiments which show how to discriminate between possible underlying representations. These in turn demonstrate how a simple Hawkes representation recovers phenomenology reported in the literature that cannot be recovered using a Brownian representation without additional ad hoc model complexity. However, complex ad hoc noise models built on Brownian motions cannot in general be discriminated relative to a Hawkes representation. Nevertheless, we argue that high frequency correlation dynamics are most faithfully recovered when tick data is represented as a web of interconnected discrete events rather than being samples from continuous Brownian diffusions even when combined with noise.</description>
