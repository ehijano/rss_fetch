      <title>Quantized six-vertex model on a torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the integrability of the quantized six-vertex model with four parameters on a torus. It is a three-dimensional integrable lattice model in which a layer transfer matrix, depending on two spectral parameters associated with the homology cycles of the torus, can be defined not only on the square lattice but also on more general graphs. For a class of graphs that we call admissible, we establish the commutativity of the layer transfer matrices by introducing four types of tetrahedron equations and two types of inversion relations. Expanding in the spectral parameters yields a family of commuting quantum Hamiltonians. The quantized six-vertex model can also be reformulated in terms of (quantized) dimer models, and encompasses known integrable systems as special cases, including the free parafermion model and the relativistic Toda chain.</description>

      <title>The N-species integrable Volterra system as a maximally superintegrable Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results presented in this paper are a natural developments of those described in the paper {\it The Volterra Integrable case. Novel analytical and numerical results} (OCNMP Vol.4 (2024) pp 188-211), where the authors reconsidered the integrable case of the Hamiltonian $N$-species Lotka-Volterra system, introduced by Vito Volterra in 1937. There, an alternative approach for constructing the integrals of motion has been proposed, and compared with the old Volterra approach. Here we go beyond, and show that in fact the model introduced by Volterra and studied by us is not just integrable, but is maximally superintegrable and reducible to a system with only one degree of freedom regardless the number of species considered. We present both analytical and numerical results.</description>

      <title>Weyl group symmetry of q-characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an action of the Weyl group W of a simple Lie algebra g on a completion of the ring Y, which is the codomain of the q-character homomorphism of the corresponding quantum affine algebra U_q(g^). We prove that the subring of W-invariants of Y is precisely the ring of q-characters, which is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite-dimensional representations of U_q(g^). This resolves an old puzzle in the theory of q-characters. We also identify the screening operators, which were previously used to describe the ring of q-characters, as the subleading terms of simple reflections from W in a certain limit. Our results have already found applications to the study of the category O of representations of the Borel subalgebra of U_q(g^) in arXiv:2312.13256 and to the categorification of cluster algebras in arXiv:2401.04616.</description>

      <title>Dual Theory of MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for decaying incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Our solution reveals a dual formulation in terms of two interacting Euler ensembles--one for hydrodynamic and another for magnetic circulation. This replaces empirical scaling laws with an infinite set of power terms with calculable decay exponents, some of which appear as complex-conjugate pairs related to the Riemann zeta function. A key result of our analysis is the explicit dependence of the solution on the Prandtl number ($\mathrm{Pr} = \nu/\eta$), leading to a phase transition at $\mathrm{Pr} = 1$. In the $\mathrm{Pr}&lt;1$ regime, turbulence is dominated by hydrodynamic fluctuations, while for $\mathrm{Pr}&gt;1$, two distinct solutions emerge: a metastable one in which magnetic fluctuations grow with $\mathrm{Pr}$ and a stable one where they remain balanced with hydrodynamic fluctuations. We compare our theoretical predictions with recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) and discuss their implications for astrophysical plasmas, fusion devices, and laboratory MHD experiments. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding MHD turbulence and its dependence on fundamental parameters, offering a new perspective on turbulence in highly conducting fluids.</description>

      <title>Dual Theory of Turbulent Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for incompressible turbulent mixing described by 3D NS equations, with a passive scalar (concentration, temperature, or other scalar field) driven by the turbulent velocity field. Using our recent solution of decaying turbulence in terms of the Euler ensemble, we represent the correlation functions of a passive scalar as statistical averages over this ensemble. The statistical limit, corresponding to decaying turbulence, can be computed in quadrature by a multi-dimensional Mellin-Barnes integral representation. We find the decay spectrum and the scaling functions of the pair correlation. Full comparison with physical and real experiments is postponed till the future detailed computation of the spectrum in our solution.</description>
