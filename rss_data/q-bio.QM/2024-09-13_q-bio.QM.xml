      <title>Effective management of white rust disease in red amaranth: a field study in Dhaka, Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the effective management strategies of Albugo candida, a pathogen of white rust disease in red amaranth (Amaranthus tricolor L.), accountable for the reduction of seed production. The study was performed during the Rabi season of 2018 and the Kharif season of 2019 at Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University in Bangladesh. Eight treatments, including chemical, botanical, and biopesticide treatments such as Ridomil Gold 68 WG, Autostin 50 WP, Dithane M 45, Goldton 50 WP, the Bordeaux mixture, G-Derma, Garlic bulb extract, and Allamanda leaf extract, were evaluated. Four foliar sprays were applied at seven-day intervals after disease symptom onset. The field experiments followed a randomized complete block design with three replications. A microscopic study confirmed that Albugo candida was the causal organism. In both seasons, Ridomil Gold demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing disease incidence in plants, disease incidence in leaves, and disease severity, which were 63.07%, 62.78.5, and 84.31%, respectively, in Rabi and 69.73%, 65.71%, and 88.41%, respectively, in the Kharif season. Allamanda leaf extract also had statistically similar results, while Autostin exhibited promising effectiveness. Furthermore, compared with the other treatments, the combination of Ridomil Gold and Allamanda leaf extract significantly enhanced the growth parameters and seed yield in both seasons. Assessing the collective effectiveness of the treatments, Ridomil Gold demonstrated the most efficient control of white rust disease. Consequently, Ridomil Gold holds promise for application in red amaranth seed production. Additionally, the use of Allamanda leaf extract is an environmentally friendly approach to white rust disease management and promotes safer crop production practices. This study offers significant guidance to practitioners seeking optimal disease management strategies.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Electrical Conductivity Changes during Brain Functional Activity in 3T MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to visualize brain activation regions by detecting hemodynamic responses associated with increased metabolic demand. While alternative MRI methods have been employed to monitor functional activities, the investigation of in-vivo electrical property changes during brain function remains limited. In this study, we explored the relationship between fMRI signals and electrical conductivity (measured at the Larmor frequency) changes using phase-based electrical properties tomography (EPT). Our results revealed consistent patterns: conductivity changes showed negative correlations, with conductivity decreasing in the functionally active regions whereas B1 phase mapping exhibited positive correlations around activation regions. These observations were consistent across both motor and visual cortex activations. To further substantiate these findings, we conducted electromagnetic radio-frequency simulations that modeled activation states with varying conductivity, which demonstrated trends similar to our in-vivo results for both B1 phase and conductivity. These findings suggest that in-vivo electrical conductivity changes can indeed be measured during brain activity. However, further investigation is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms driving these measurements.</description>

      <title>Crown-Like Structures in Breast Adipose Tissue: Finding a 'Needle-in-a-Haystack' using Artificial Intelligence and Collaborative Active Learning on the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crown-like structures (CLS) in breast adipose tissue are formed as a result of macrophages clustering around necrotic adipocytes in specific patterns. As a histologic marker of local inflammation, CLS could have potential diagnostic utility as a biomarker for breast cancer risk. However, given the scale of whole slide images and the rarity of CLS (a few cells in an entire tissue sample), microscope-based manual identification is a challenge for the pathologist. In this report, we describe an artificial intelligence pipeline to solve this needle-in-a-haystack problem. We developed a zero-cost, zero-footprint web platform to enable remote operation on digital whole slide imaging data directly in the web browser, supporting collaborative annotation of the data by multiple experts. The annotated images then allow for incremental training and fine tuning of deep neural networks via active learning. The platform is reusable and requires no backend or installations, thus ensuring the data remains secure and private under the governance of the end user. Using this platform, we iteratively trained a CLS identification model, evaluating the performance after each round and adding examples to the training data to overcome failure cases. The resulting model, with an AUC of 0.90, shows promise as a first-pass screening tool to detect CLS in breast adipose tissue, considerably reducing the workload of the pathologist.

      <title>Decomposing force fields as flows on graphs reconstructed from stochastic trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disentangling irreversible and reversible forces from random fluctuations is a challenging problem in the analysis of stochastic trajectories measured from real-world dynamical systems. We present an approach to approximate the dynamics of a stationary Langevin process as a discrete-state Markov process evolving over a graph-representation of phase-space, reconstructed from stochastic trajectories. Next, we utilise the analogy of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of an edge-flow on a contractible simplicial complex with the associated decomposition of a stochastic process into its irreversible and reversible parts. This allows us to decompose our reconstructed flow and to differentiate between the irreversible currents and reversible gradient flows underlying the stochastic trajectories. We validate our approach on a range of solvable and nonlinear systems and apply it to derive insight into the dynamics of flickering red-blood cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. In particular, we capture the difference in irreversible circulating currents between healthy and passive cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. Our method breaks new ground at the interface of data-driven approaches to stochastic dynamics and graph signal processing, with the potential for further applications in the analysis of biological experiments and physiological recordings. Finally, it prompts future analysis of the convergence of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition in discrete and continuous spaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated cell segmentation is crucial for various biological and medical applications, facilitating tasks like cell counting, morphology analysis, and drug discovery. However, manual segmentation is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity, necessitating robust automated methods. This paper presents open-source infrastructure, utilizing the UNet model, a deep-learning architecture noted for its effectiveness in image segmentation tasks. This implementation is integrated into the open-source DeepChem package, enhancing accessibility and usability for researchers and practitioners. The resulting tool offers a convenient and user-friendly interface, reducing the barrier to entry for cell segmentation while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, we benchmark this model against various datasets, demonstrating its robustness and versatility across different imaging conditions and cell types.</description>

      <title>DrugAgent: Explainable Drug Repurposing Agent with Large Language Model-based Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug repurposing offers a promising avenue for accelerating drug development by identifying new therapeutic potentials of existing drugs. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework to enhance the drug repurposing process using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and knowledge integration. Our framework comprises several specialized agents: an AI Agent trains robust drug-target interaction (DTI) models; a Knowledge Graph Agent utilizes the drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb), DrugBank, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH) to systematically extract DTIs; and a Search Agent interacts with biomedical literature to annotate and verify computational predictions. By integrating outputs from these agents, our system effectively harnesses diverse data sources, including external databases, to propose viable repurposing candidates. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our approach in not only predicting drug-disease interactions but also in reducing the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery methods. This paper highlights the scalability of multi-agent systems in biomedical research and their role in driving innovation in drug repurposing. Our approach not only outperforms existing methods in predicting drug repurposing potential but also provides interpretable results, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective drug discovery processes.</description>
