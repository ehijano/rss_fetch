      <title>Data reification in a concurrent rely-guarantee algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specifications of significant systems can be made short and perspicuous by using abstract data types; data reification can provide a clear, stepwise, development history of programs that use more efficient concrete representations. Data reification (or "refinement") techniques for sequential programs are well established. This paper applies these ideas to concurrency, in particular, an algebraic theory supporting rely-guarantee reasoning about concurrency. A concurrent version of the Galler-Fischer equivalence relation data structure is used as an example.</description>

      <title>Between proof construction and SAT-solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical satisfiability problem (SAT) is used as a natural and general tool to express and solve combinatorial problems that are in NP. We postulate that provability for implicational intuitionistic propositional logic (IIPC) can serve as a similar natural tool to express problems in Pspace. This approach can be particularly convenient for two reasons. One is that provability in full IPC (with all connectives) can be reduced to provability of implicational formulas of order three. Another advantage is a convenient interpretation in terms of simple alternating automata. Additionally, we distinguish some natural subclasses of IIPC corresponding to the complexity classes NP and co-NP. Our experimental results show that a simple decision procedure requires a significant amount of time only in a small fraction of cases.</description>

      <title>Restructuring a concurrent refinement algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concurrent refinement algebra has been developed to support rely/guarantee reasoning about concurrent programs. The algebra supports atomic commands and defines parallel composition as a synchronous operation, as in Milner's SCCS. In order to allow specifications to be combined, the algebra also provides a weak conjunction operation, which is also a synchronous operation that shares many properties with parallel composition. The three main operations, sequential composition, parallel composition and weak conjunction, all respect a (weak) quantale structure over a lattice of commands. Further structure involves combinations of pairs of these operations: sequential/parallel, sequential/weak conjunction and parallel/weak conjunction, each pair satisfying a weak interchange law similar to Concurrent Kleene Algebra. Each of these pairs satisfies a common biquantale structure. Additional structure is added via compatible sets of commands, including tests, atomic commands and pseudo-atomic commands. These allow stronger (equality) interchange and distributive laws. This paper describes the result of restructuring the algebra to better exploit these commonalities. The algebra is implemented in Isabelle/HOL.</description>

      <title>Monoidal bicategories, differential linear logic, and analytic functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop further the theory of monoidal bicategories by introducing and studying bicate- gorical counterparts of the notions of a linear explonential comonad, as considered in the study of linear logic, and of a codereliction transformation, introduced to study differential linear logic via differential categories. As an application, we extend the differential calculus of Joyal's analytic functors to analytic functors between presheaf categories, just as ordinary calculus extends from a single variable to many variables.</description>

      <title>Age Aware Scheduling for Differentially-Private Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores differentially-private federated learning (FL) across time-varying databases, delving into a nuanced three-way tradeoff involving age, accuracy, and differential privacy (DP). Emphasizing the potential advantages of scheduling, we propose an optimization problem aimed at meeting DP requirements while minimizing the loss difference between the aggregated model and the model obtained without DP constraints. To harness the benefits of scheduling, we introduce an age-dependent upper bound on the loss, leading to the development of an age-aware scheduling design. Simulation results underscore the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared to FL with classic DP, which does not consider scheduling as a design factor. This research contributes insights into the interplay of age, accuracy, and DP in federated learning, with practical implications for scheduling strategies.</description>

      <title>The Transformation Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of temporal logics designed to finely balance the trade-off between expressivity and complexity. Their key feature is the possibility of defining operators of a new kind that we call transformation operators. Some of them subsume existing temporal operators, while others are entirely novel. Of particular interest are transformation operators based on semigroups. They enable logics to harness the richness of semigroup theory, and we show them to yield logics capable of creating hierarchies of increasing expressivity and complexity which are non-trivial to characterise in existing logics. The result is a genuinely novel and yet unexplored landscape of temporal logics, each of them with the potential of matching the trade-off between expressivity and complexity required by specific applications.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Proving Polyhedral Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an automated procedure to prove polyhedral abstractions (also known as polyhedral reductions) for Petri nets. Polyhedral abstraction is a new type of state space equivalence, between Petri nets, based on the use of linear integer constraints between the marking of places. In addition to defining an automated proof method, this paper aims to better characterize polyhedral reductions, and to give an overview of their application to reachability problems.
  Our approach relies on encoding the equivalence problem into a set of SMT formulas whose satisfaction implies that the equivalence holds. The difficulty, in this context, arises from the fact that we need to handle infinite-state systems. For completeness, we exploit a connection with a class of Petri nets, called flat nets, that have Presburger-definable reachability sets. We have implemented our procedure, and we illustrate its use on several examples.</description>

      <title>DECIDER: A Rule-Controllable Decoding Strategy for Language Generation by Imitating Dual-System Cognitive Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lexicon-based constrained decoding approaches aim to control the meaning or style of the generated text through certain target concepts. Existing approaches over-focus the targets themselves, leading to a lack of high-level reasoning about how to achieve them. However, human usually tackles tasks by following certain rules that not only focuses on the targets but also on semantically relevant concepts that induce the occurrence of targets. In this work, we present DECIDER, a rule-controllable decoding strategy for constrained language generation inspired by dual-system cognitive theory. Specifically, in DECIDER, a pre-trained language model (PLM) is equiped with a logic reasoner that takes high-level rules as input. Then, the DECIDER allows rule signals to flow into the PLM at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DECIDER can effectively follow given rules to guide generation direction toward the targets in a more human-like manner.</description>
