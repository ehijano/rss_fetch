      <title>Metastability in the parallel Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper we present some considerations about some parallel implementations of the dynamic (Monte Carlo) version of the Ising model. In some cases the equilibrium distribution of the parallel version does not present the symmetry breaking phenomenon in the low-temperature phase, i.e., the stochastic trajectory originated by the Monte Carlo simulation can jump between the distributions corresponding to both kinds of magnetization, or the lattice can break into two disjoint sublattices, each of which goes into a different asymptotic distribution. In this latter case, by introducing a small asynchronism, we can have a transition towards the standard ferromagnetic (or antiferromagnetic) distribution, with metastable transients.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Behavior at the Edge of Chaos in the z-Logistic Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the FeigenbaumCoulletTresser point of the dissipative one-dimensional z logistic map. We show that sums of iterates converge to q Gaussian distributions, which optimize the nonadditive entropic functional Sq under simple constraints. We derive a closedform prediction for the entropic index, and validate it numerically via data collapse for typical z values. The formula captures how the limiting law depends on the nonlinearity order and implies finite variance for z larger than 2 and divergent variance for z in between 1 and 2. These results extend edge of chaos central limit behavior beyond the standard case and provide a simple predictive law for unimodal maps with varying maximum order.</description>

      <title>Generalized Algebra Grounded on Nonadditive Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $N$-body system is simple if all associated physically relevant space-time correlations are short-ranged, meaning that their momenta of all orders are finite. Such systems typically have a total number $W$ of admissible microscopic configurations which grows with $N$ as $W(N) \sim \mu^N\;(\mu &gt;1, \, N\to\infty)$. Their thermostatistical properties are known to be satisfactorily handled within Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics. In contrast, a system is complex if one or more associated correlations are long-ranged. The simplest examples of such systems are those for which $W(N) \sim N^\rho\;\;(\rho&gt;0)$. A generalized statistical mechanics grounded on the nonadditive entropic functional $S_q(\{p_{i}\})=k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln_q \frac{1}{p_i} \;\;(q\in \mathbb{R}, \;S_1=S_{BG})$ with $\ln_q z =\frac{z^{1-q}-1}{1-q}$ ($\ln_1 z=\ln z$) satisfactorily handles such systems. Indeed, for equiprobabilities, $S_{q=1-1/\rho}(\{1/W(N)\})=k\ln_{1-1/\rho} W(N) \propto N$. Furthermore, for complex systems, the size of the corresponding phase spaces can be related to the property $\ln_q (x\otimes_q y) =\ln_q x + \ln_q y$, $x,y\geq1$, $q\leq 1$, where $x\otimes_q y=[x^{1-q}+y^{1-q}-1]^{\frac{1}{1-q}}_{+}\;\;(x\otimes_1 y=xy)$, and the $q$-product $\otimes_q$ grounds the definition of a $q$-generalized algebra. Another class of complex systems corresponds to $W(N) \sim \nu^{N^\gamma}\;\;(\nu &gt;1, \,\gamma &gt; 0)$, which appears to be the case of black holes and other cosmological phenomena. This class can be handled with $S_\delta(\{p_{i}\}) = k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \Bigl(\ln \frac{1}{p_i} \Bigr)^\delta \;\;(\delta&gt;0)$. Finally, we can define $S_{q,\delta}(\{p_{i}\})=k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \Bigl(\ln_q \frac{1}{p_i} \Bigr)^\delta$ $(q\in\mathbb{R},\delta&gt;0)$, which unifies all the above ones. In this paper, we generalize the $q$-algebra to a new, promising one, namely the $(q,\delta)$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Fiber bundle model of thermally activated creep failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An equal load sharing fiber bundle model for thermally activated breakdown is developed using transition state theory to describe the rate of elementary failures. The lifetime distribution, average, variance and their asymptotic limits for uniform fiber failure thresholds are derived and found to be in excellent agreement with simulations. The asymptotic scaling with regards to the number of fibers matches analytical approximations in the low temperature limit derived by Roux and co-workers for a model of thermal breakdown by stationary Gaussian noise. For the case of randomly distributed fiber failure strengths, the lifetime distribution is derived as a multidimensional integral with no closed form solution. Simulations with different fiber strength distributions indicate that, in the limit of large fiber numbers, the statistics of bundle lifetimes shows a similar asymptotic scaling for distributed and for uniform thresholds. Fiber breakage by thermal activation occurs in avalanches triggered by individual thermally activated failure events, and the asymptotic avalanche size distribution obtained from the simulations matches earlier theoretical results derived for quasistatic loading.</description>

      <title>Real-time bubble nucleation and growth for false vacuum decay on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit quantum false vacuum decay for the one-dimensional Ising model, focusing on the real-time nucleation and growth of true vacuum bubbles. Via matrix product state simulations, we demonstrate that for a wide range of parameters, the full time-dependent quantum state is well described by a Gaussian ansatz in terms of domain wall operators, with the associated vacuum bubble wave function evolving according to the linearized time-dependent variational principle. The emerging picture shows three different stages of evolution: an initial nucleation of small bubbles, followed by semi-classical bubble growth, which in turn is halted by the lattice phenomenon of Bloch oscillations. Furthermore, we find that the resonant bubble only plays a significant role in a certain region of parameter-space. However, when significant, it does lead to an approximately constant decay rate during the intermediate stage. Moreover, this rate is in quantitative agreement with the analytical result of Rutkevich (Phys. Rev. B 60, 14525) for which we provide an independent derivation based on the Gaussian ansatz.</description>

      <title>Many-body theory of false vacuum decay in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we theoretically investigate the false vacuum decay process in a ferromagnetic quantum spin-1/2 chain. We develop a many-body theory describing the nucleation and the coherent dynamics of true-vacuum bubbles that is analytically tractable and agrees with numerical matrix product state calculations in all parameter regimes up to intermediate times. This bosonic theory allows us to identify different regimes in the parameter space and unravel the underlying physical mechanisms. In particular, regimes that closely correspond to the cosmological false vacuum decay picture are highlighted and characterized in terms of observable quantities.</description>

      <title>Random cubic graph embedded in a hypercube: Entanglement spectrum and many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The schematic model of interacting spins is introduced, which combines the symmetry of hypercube with the simplicity of random regular graph with degree three, i.e. the random cubic graph. We study the localization transition in this model, which shares essential characteristics with the systems exhibiting many-body localization. Namely, we investigate the transition in terms of the entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum. We also show that the most significant indicator of the localization transition is the failure of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, when the distribution of matrix elements of local operators changes from Gasussian to bimodal. It also provides good estimate for the critical disorder strength.</description>

Abstract: H-theorem provides a microscopic foundation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and is therefore essential to establishing statistical physics, but at the same time, H-theorem has been subject to controversy that in part persists till this day. To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the arrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.</description>

      <title>A blueprint for experiments exploring the Poincar\'e quantum recurrence theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum form of the Poincar\'e recurrence theorem stipulates that a system with a time-independent Hamiltonian and discrete energy levels returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a finite time. Qubit systems, being highly isolated from their dissipative surroundings, provide a possible experimental testbed for studying this theoretical construct. Here we investigate a $N$-qubit system, weakly coupled to its environment. We present quantitative analytical and numerical results on both the revival probability and time, and demonstrate that the system indeed returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a time exponential in the number of qubits $N$. The revival times become astronomically large for systems with just a few tens of qubits. Given the lifetimes achievable in present-day superconducting multi-qubit systems, we propose a realistic experimental test of the theory and scaling of Poincar\'e revivals.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic freedom of dephased charging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries, small-scale energy storage devices based on quantum systems, offer the potential for enhanced charging performance through quantum effects such as coherence and collectivity. In this work, we study the collective charging of a quantum battery consisting of N qubits, coupled to a driven qubit charger in a star configuration, with controlled pure dephasing acting on the charger. We investigate how an "asymptotic freedom"-like behavior, in which all the energy deposited into the battery can be extracted as work, resulting in the ergotropy-to-energy ratio approaching unity, can emerge in the steady state of the battery. We show that the ergotropy-to-energy ratio increases with the number of qubits and approaches unity asymptotically as 1 - O(1/N). In the large-N limit, the emergence of approximate ground-state degeneracy of the collective battery system leads to this asymptotic freedom behavior, despite the battery state remaining mixed. We also discuss the scaling behavior of the charging time of the battery with N.</description>

      <title>Coupling of radial multiple SLE with Gaussian free field, and the hydrodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) has been one of the central topics in the probabilistic study of two-dimensional critical systems. It is a random curve in two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is supposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for SLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected domain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial, a random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point. Multiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random curves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster interfaces found in critical lattice systems.
  In this paper, we study multiple SLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE. We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple SLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been extensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many recent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF occurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motions.
  The circular Dyson Brownian motions is a typical example of stochastic log-gas. This fact motivates us to study the hydrodynamic limit of the corresponding radial multiple SLE, which refers to the dynamical law of large numbers, when the number of curves tends to infinity. In our other main result, we provide explicit description of the hydrodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with varying resolutions, initial redshifts, and box sizes, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A milestone of phase separation kinetics is the emergence of universal power laws $\sim t^{1/z}$ governing the domain growth evolution. We investigate a phase-separating polar active model comprising a scalar density field with an advective coupling to a polarization field. Our analysis reveals a novel $\sim t^{0.6}$ regime, which agrees well with the accelerated growth recently observed in simulations of polar active particles. We provide analytical arguments to explain how advection facilitates the creation of topological defects and compresses the domains leading to faster growth. We also show that the $\sim t^{0.6}$ regime is robust to several model generalizations.</description>

      <title>Analytical phase boundary of a quantum driven-dissipative Kerr oscillator from classical stochastic instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The framework of Keldysh path integral concisely describes quantum systems driven away from thermal equilibrium, such as the two-photon driven Kerr oscillator. Within the thermodynamic limit of diverging photon occupation, we map it to a Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis path integral, and obtain a purely classical, stochastic equivalent where photon self-interaction plays the role of temperature. This perspective sheds light on the difficulties encountered in the search for an effective thermodynamic potential to describe the bistability of the model. It allows us to estimate the bistable tunneling rates using a real-time instanton technique leading to an analytical expression of the phase boundary, the first-ever to our knowledge. It opens the way to powerful semi-analytical techniques to be applied to various quantum optics models displaying bistability.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos Diagnostics for Open Quantum Systems from Bi-Lanczos Krylov Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Hermitian systems, Krylov complexity has emerged as a powerful diagnostic of quantum dynamics, capable of distinguishing chaotic from integrable phases, in agreement with established probes such as spectral statistics and out-of-time-order correlators. By contrast, its role in non-Hermitian settings, relevant for modeling open quantum systems, remains less understood due to the challenges posed by complex eigenvalues and the limitations of standard approaches such as singular value decomposition. Here, we demonstrate that Krylov complexity, computed via the bi-Lanczos algorithm, effectively identifies chaotic and integrable phases in open quantum systems. The results align with complex spectral statistics and complex spacing ratios, highlighting the robustness of this approach. The universality of our findings is further supported through studies of both the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles.</description>

      <title>Circulation Fluctuations of Elementary Turbulent Vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin vortex tubes, with core sizes within the dissipation range, profuse in a homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow. Their intersections with an arbitrary plane define, as a mathematical construct, a dilute gas of localized, intermittently distributed, two-dimensional vortex spots. While their planar density fluctuations are described by a field-theoretical extension of log-normal single-point statistics, known as Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC), they carry circulations which are Gaussian-correlated throughout the inertial range. It is puzzling, then, to find that the circulations of individual vortices are fat-tailed distributed, an apparent paradox that we fix within the GMC framework. The solution, validated through the examination of direct numerical simulation data for a broad range of Reynolds numbers, unveils, as a surprising phenomenological result, an existing coupling between the circulation of vortex structures and the short-distance properties of their spatial distribution fluctuations at sub-Taylor microscales.</description>

      <title>Programmable Anyon Mobility through Higher Order Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling anyon mobility is critical for robust quantum memory and understanding symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases with subsystem symmetries (e.g., line-like, fractal, chaotic, or mixed supports). However, a unified framework for anyon mobility in SET phases with such diverse geometric patterns of symmetry supports has remained a major challenge. In this Letter, by introducing higher-order cellular automata (HOCA) -- a powerful computer science tool -- to SET physics, we establish a unified approach for complete characterization of anyon mobility induced by the complexity of subsystem symmetries. First, we design finite-depth HOCA-controlled unitary quantum circuits, yielding exactly solvable SET models with Abelian anyons and all possible locally generated subsystem symmetries. Then, we present a theorem that precisely programs all excitation mobilities (fractons, lineons, or fully mobile anyons) directly from the HOCA rule, representing the first complete characterization of anyon mobility in SET phases. As a corollary, this theorem yields symmetry-enriched fusion rules which govern mobility transmutation during fusion. Fusion rules with multiple channels are identified, exhibiting non-Abelian characteristics in Abelian anyon systems. Leveraging HOCA, this Letter opens new avenues for characterization of SET phases of matter and programmability of topological quantum codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipartite entanglement entropy is one of the most useful characterizations of universal properties in a many-body quantum system. Far from equilibrium, there exist two highly effective theories describing its dynamics -- the quasiparticle and membrane pictures. In this work we investigate entanglement dynamics, and these two complementary approaches, in a quantum circuit model perturbed by an impurity. In particular, we consider a dual unitary quantum circuit containing a spatially fixed, non-dual-unitary impurity gate, allowing for differing local Hilbert space dimensions to either side. We compute the entanglement entropy for both a semi-infinite and a finite subsystem within a finite distance of the impurity, comparing exact results to predictions of the effective theories. We find that for a semi-infinite subsystem, both theories agree with each other and the exact calculation. For a finite subsystem, however, both theories qualitatively differ, with the quasiparticle picture predicting a non-monotonic growth in contrast to the membrane picture. We show that such non-monotonic behavior can arise even in random chaotic circuits, shedding light on the range of validity of the membrane picture in such systems.</description>

Abstract: These notes are based on the lectures that one of us (HT) gave at the Summer School on the "Theory of Large Deviations and Applications", held in July 2024 at Les Houches in France. They present the basic definitions and mathematical results that form the theory of large deviations, as well as many simple motivating examples of applications in statistical physics, which serve as a basis for the many other lectures given at the school that covered more specific applications in biophysics, random matrix theory, nonequilibrium systems, geophysics, and the simulation of rare events, among other topics. These notes extend the lectures, which can be accessed online, by presenting exercises and pointer references for further reading.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a minimal model consisting of a two-body system with stochastically broken reciprocity (i.e., random violation of Newton's third law) and then investigate its statistical behaviors, including fluctuations of velocity and position, time evolution of probability distribution functions, energy gain, and entropy production. The effective temperature of this two-body system immersed in a thermal bath is also derived. Furthermore, we heuristically present an extremely minimal model where the relative motion adheres to the same rules as in classical mechanics, while the effect of stochastically broken reciprocity only manifests in the fluctuating motion of the center of mass.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Quantum Heat Statistics with the Reaction Coordinate Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The definition of heat in quantum mechanics is ambiguous. Complications arise in particular when the coupling between a quantum system and a thermal environment is non-negligible, as the boundary between the two becomes blurred, making the distinction between system and environment difficult to draw. The reaction coordinate mapping can be used in such regimes to redraw the boundary between the system and environment. In this paper we combine the reaction coordinate technique with a two-point measurement protocol to compare two different definitions of heat: energetic changes with respect to the full environment Hamiltonian (prior to the mapping), and energetic changes with respect to the residual environment Hamiltonian (after the mapping). We find that the latter definition displays behaviour more expected of a heat bath in the highly non-Markovian regime considered.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop a panoramic schematic of quantum thermal analogs of electric circuits in the steady state regime. We establish the foundations of said premise by defining the analogs of Kirchhoff's laws for heat currents and temperature gradients, as well as a quantum thermal step transformer. Using this, we develop two novel quantum thermal circuits, viz., quantum thermal super Wheatstone bridge and quantum thermal adder circuit, paving the way for the corresponding integrated circuits. We further show that our approach encompasses various circuits like thermal diode, transistor, and Wheatstone bridge. This sheds new light on the present architecture of quantum device engineering.</description>

      <title>Modern Approach to 2D Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary aim of these lecture notes is to introduce the modern approach to two-dimensional conformal field theory (2D CFT). The study of analytical methods in two-dimensional conformal field theory has developed over several decades, starting with BPZ. The development of analytical methods, particularly in rational conformal field theory (RCFT), has been remarkable, with complete classifications achieved for certain model groups. One motivation for studying CFT comes from its ability to describe quantum critical systems. Given that realistic quantum critical systems are fundamentally RCFTs, it is somewhat natural that the analytical methods of RCFT have evolved significantly.
  CFTs other than RCFTs are called irrational conformal field theories (ICFTs). Compared to RCFTs, the study of ICFTs has not progressed as much. Leaving aside whether there is physical motivation or not, ICFTs inherently possess a difficulty that makes them challenging to approach. However, with the development of quantum gravity, the advancement of analytical methods for ICFTs has become essential. The reason lies in the AdS/CFT correspondence. AdS/CFT refers to the relationship between $d+1$ dimensional quantum gravity and $d$ dimensional CFT. Within this correspondence, the CFT appears as a non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity. Except in special cases, this CFT belongs to ICFT. Against this backdrop, the methods for ICFTs have developed rapidly in recent years. Many of these ICFT methods are indispensable for modern quantum gravity research. Unfortunately, these cannot be learned from textbooks on 2D CFTs, such as Yellow book. These lecture notes aim to fill this gap. Specifically, we will cover techniques that have already been applied in many studies, such as HHLL block and monodromy method, and significant results that have become proper nouns, such as Hellerman bound and HKS bound.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a compressible lattice gas crystal: Generalized Gibbs-Duhem equation and adsorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compressible lattice gas models are used in material science to understand the coupling between composition and strain in alloys. The seminal work in this field is the 1973 Larch\'{e}-Cahn paper (Acta Metall. 21, 1051-1063). Single-phase crystals in Larch\'{e}-Cahn theory are stable under open constant pressure, constant temperature conditions. The Gibbs free energy does not have to match the product $\mu N$ of the number of particles $N$ and their chemical potential $\mu$. Similarly, the grand potential and the product $pV$ of pressure and volume $V$ may not add up to zero. Discrepancies already arise under hydrostatic stress. The elastic energy is not proportional to volume and the Gibbs-Duhem relation valid for liquids is violated. Extensivity is recovered by treating the number of lattice sites $M$ as an additional thermodynamic variable. The difference $ G-\mu N $ can be identified with $\nu M$ where $\nu$ is the thermodynamic force conjugate to $M$. The reinstated Gibbs-Duhem equation can be cast in the form of an adsorption equation and applied to quantify the tendency to vacancy creation under isothermal isobaric conditions. We have worked this out for a uniform one-component compressible lattice gas crystal. Shear stress is omitted. The coupling between composition and strain is implemented by decomposing pressure in a mechanical component depending on deformed density $N/V$ and an elastic term linear in the volume strain as determined by $V/M$. Various $\left( \mu, p, T \right) $ response functions are compared to the $\left( \mu, V, T \right) $ counterparts.</description>

      <title>Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of certain interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra, and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e., the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$ plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the return amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate the key difference between QMBS and strong ergodicity breaking including their distinctive renormalization group flows on the complex $\beta$ plane. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of spotting scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.</description>

Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems, specifically finite artificial spin-ice systems, including those with geometric frustration. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. We confirm that the time-integrated probability flux exhibits patterns consistent with the pathways identified in the projected hypercubic energy landscapes. Using the mean-field model, we show that dominant state transition pathways tend to emerge around the periphery of the projected hypercubes. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics under continuous measurements for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential by using the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model with hopping rate $J$ and potential strength $V$. On the basis of the quantum trajectory method, we obtain the phase diagram for the steady-state entanglement entropy and demonstrate that robust logarithmic system-size scaling emerges up to a critical potential strength $V_c/J \sim 2.3$. Moreover, we find that the measurement induces entanglement phase transitions from the logarithmic-law phase to the area-law phase for the potential strength $V&lt; V_c$, while any finite measurement stabilizes the area-law phase for $V&gt;V_c$. This result is distinct from the entanglement scaling in the unitary limit, where volume-law and area-law phases undergo a transition at $V/J=2$. To further support the phase diagram, we analyze the connected correlation function and find that it shows algebraic decay in the logarithmic-law phase, while it decays quickly in the area-law phase. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by introducing quasiperiodic potentials and continuously monitoring the local occupation number with an off-resonant probe light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quenched dynamics of fully-connected spin models. The system is prepared in a ground state of the initial Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian is suddenly changed to a different form. We apply the Krylov subspace method to map the system onto an effective tridiagonal Hamiltonian. The state is confined in a potential well and is time-evolved by nonuniform hoppings. The dynamical singularities for the survival probability can occur when the state is reflected from a potential barrier. Although we do not observe any singularity in the spread complexity, we find that the entropy exhibits small dips at the singular times. We find that the presence of metastable state affects long-time behavior of the spread complexity, and physical observables. We also observe a reduction of the state-space dimension when the Hamiltonian reduces to a classical form.</description>

Abstract: Gauge theories compose a large class of interacting conformal field theories in 3d, among which an outstanding category is critical Chern-Simons-matter theories. In this paper, we focus on one of the simplest instances: one complex critical scalar coupled to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ Chern-Simons gauge field. It is theoretically interesting as it is conjectured to exhibit dualities between four simple Lagrangian descriptions, but also practically important as it describes the transition between Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (or $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state) and trivially gapped phase. Using the fuzzy sphere regularisation, we realise this theory as a transition on the spherical lowest Landau level between a $\nu_f=2$ fermionic integer quantum Hall state and a $\nu_b=1/2$ bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that this transition is continuous and has emergent conformal symmetry. By studying the operator spectrum, we show that there exists only one relevant singlet with scaling dimension $\Delta_S=1.52(18)$. We also discuss other higher operators and the consequences of our results.</description>
