      <title>First-order continuum models for nonlinear dispersive waves in the granular crystal lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and analyze, analytically and numerically, two first-order continuum models to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of granular crystal lattices, focusing specifically on solitary waves, periodic waves, and dispersive shock waves. The dispersive shock waves predicted by the two continuum models are studied using modulation theory, DSW fitting techniques, and direct numerical simulations. The PDE-based predictions show good agreement with the DSWs generated by the discrete model simulation of the granular lattice itself, even in cases where no precompression is present and the lattice is purely nonlinear. Such an effective description could prove useful for future, more analytically amenable approximations of the original lattice system.</description>

      <title>Multiscale phase oscillations induced by cluster synchronisation in human connectome core network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain imaging data mapping onto human connectome networks enables the investigation of global brain dynamics, where the brain hubs play an essential role in transferring activity between different brain parts. At this scale, the synchronisation processes are increasingly investigated as one of the key mechanisms revealing many aspects of brain functional coherence in healthy brains and revealing deviations due to various brain disorders. For the human connectome core network, consisting of the eight brain hubs and the higher-order structure attached to them, previous simulations of Kuramoto phase oscillators at network nodes indicate instability of the global order parameter for a range of positive coupling strengths. In this work, we investigate the multiscale oscillations of the global phase order parameter and show that they are connected with the cluster synchronisation processes occurring in this range of couplings below the master stability threshold. We use the spectral graph analysis and eigenvector localisation methodology, where the clusters of nodes playing a similar role in the synchronisation processes have a small mutual distance in the eigenvector space. We determine three significant clusters of brain regions and show the position of hubs in them. With the parallel analysis of the weighted core network and its binary version, we demonstrate the primary role of the network's topology in the formation of synchronised clusters. Meanwhile, the wights of edges contribute to the hub's synchronisation with the surrounding cluster, stabilise the order parameter variations and reduce the multifractal spectrum.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of interacting cavity solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the equations governing the motion of Kerr solitons in pair waveforms. Recent experiments in microresonators have studied a variety of interaction effects in multisoliton waveforms, including collisions and formation of soliton molecules and crystals. Here we analyze the effective interaction that arises from the coupling of soliton-tail overlap nonlinearity with global soliton variables associated with the breaking of translation symmetry. The interaction is either purely repulsive, or alternates between attraction and repulsion, according to whether the decay of soliton tails is monotone or oscillatory. In the latter case, stable fixed points of the effective dynamical system signify stable soliton molecule configuration, but the exponential weakening of the interaction with increasing inter-soliton separation may prevent the molecule from forming in experimentally accessible time scales. Our theory becomes asymptotically exact in the large-separation limit, and we verify the theoretical calculations using soliton trajectories extracted from direct numerical solutions of the wave equation.</description>
