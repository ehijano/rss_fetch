      <title>A New Framework for Explainable Rare Cell Identification in Single-Cell Transcriptomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of rare cell types in single-cell transcriptomics data is crucial for elucidating disease pathogenesis and tissue development dynamics. However, a critical gap that persists in current methods is their inability to provide an explanation based on genes for each cell they have detected as rare. We identify three primary sources of this deficiency. First, the anomaly detectors often function as "black boxes", designed to detect anomalies but unable to explain why a cell is anomalous. Second, the standard analytical framework hinders interpretability by relying on dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which transform meaningful gene expression data into abstract, uninterpretable features. Finally, existing explanation algorithms cannot be readily applied to this domain, as single-cell data is characterized by high dimensionality, noise, and substantial sparsity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a framework for explainable anomaly detection in single-cell transcriptomics data which not only identifies individual anomalies, but also provides a visual explanation based on genes that makes an instance anomalous. This framework has two key ingredients that are not existed in current methods applied in this domain. First, it eliminates the PCA step which is deemed to be an essential component in previous studies. Second, it employs the state-of-art anomaly detector and explainer as the efficient and effective means to find each rare cell and the relevant gene subspace in order to provide explanations for each rare cell as well as the typical normal cell associated with the rare cell's closest normal cells.</description>

      <title>Central Dogma Transformer: Towards Mechanism-Oriented AI for Cellular Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding cellular mechanisms requires integrating information across DNA, RNA, and protein - the three molecular systems linked by the Central Dogma of molecular biology. While domain-specific foundation models have achieved success for each modality individually, they remain isolated, limiting our ability to model integrated cellular processes. Here we present the Central Dogma Transformer (CDT), an architecture that integrates pre-trained language models for DNA, RNA, and protein following the directional logic of the Central Dogma. CDT employs directional cross-attention mechanisms - DNA-to-RNA attention models transcriptional regulation, while RNA-to-Protein attention models translational relationships - producing a unified Virtual Cell Embedding that integrates all three modalities. We validate CDT v1 - a proof-of-concept implementation using fixed (non-cell-specific) RNA and protein embeddings - on CRISPRi enhancer perturbation data from K562 cells, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.503, representing 63% of the theoretical ceiling set by cross-experiment variability (r = 0.797). Attention and gradient analyses provide complementary interpretive windows: in detailed case studies, these approaches highlight largely distinct genomic regions, with gradient analysis identifying a CTCF binding site that Hi-C data showed as physically contacting both enhancer and target gene. These results suggest that AI architectures aligned with biological information flow can achieve both predictive accuracy and mechanistic interpretability.</description>

      <title>From In Silico to In Vitro: A Comprehensive Guide to Validating Bioinformatics Findings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of bioinformatics predictions and experimental validation plays a pivotal role in advancing biological research, from understanding molecular mechanisms to developing therapeutic strategies. Bioinformatics tools and methods offer powerful means for predicting gene functions, protein interactions, and regulatory networks, but these predictions must be validated through experimental approaches to ensure their biological relevance. This review explores the various methods and technologies used for experimental validation, including gene expression analysis, protein-protein interaction verification, and pathway validation. We also discuss the challenges involved in translating computational predictions to experimental settings and highlight the importance of collaboration between bioinformatics and experimental research. Finally, emerging technologies, such as CRISPR gene editing, next-generation sequencing, and artificial intelligence, are shaping the future of bioinformatics validation and driving more accurate and efficient biological discoveries.</description>
