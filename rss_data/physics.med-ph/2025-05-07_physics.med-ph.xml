      <title>The role of friction forces in arterial mechanical thrombectomy: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the superiority of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in treating acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Stent retriever (SR) and aspiration techniques are the standard methods for removing occluded emboli, with evolving technologies improving MT efficiency. However, procedural success remains uncertain. Frictional forces, specifically clot-vessel, clot-SR, and SR-vessel interactions, play a critical role in MT outcomes. This review examines frictional forces during MT and their impact on success, analyzing publications from 2015 to 2025. We focus on studies that calculated friction or retrieval forces using in vitro models. We have also included current trends, limitations, and future perspectives on studying and understanding frictional forces and their implementation into in silico models. Findings indicate that fibrin-rich clots are more difficult to retrieve than red blood cell (RBC)-rich clots due to their higher friction coefficient, three to four times greater, an observation supported by multiple studies. SR-vessel and SR-clot friction also influence MT effectiveness. SR-vessel interaction plays a crucial role in acutely curved vessels, as SR compression reduces its efficiency. In SR-clot interaction, RBC-rich clot fragmentation is linked to relative interaction forces. In summary, obtaining in vivo frictional values remains challenging, and inconsistencies persist in past in vitro studies. Further, a deeper understanding of frictional forces is essential for optimizing MT, improving current SRs, and developing next-generation thrombectomy technologies.</description>

      <title>Physical foundations for trustworthy medical imaging: a review for artificial intelligence researchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medical imaging has seen unprecedented growth in the last years, due to rapid advances in deep learning and computing resources. Applications cover the full range of existing medical imaging modalities, with unique characteristics driven by the physics of each technique. Yet, artificial intelligence professionals entering the field, and even experienced developers, often lack a comprehensive understanding of the physical principles underlying medical image acquisition, which hinders their ability to fully leverage its potential. The integration of physics knowledge into artificial intelligence algorithms enhances their trustworthiness and robustness in medical imaging, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. In this work, we review the fundamentals of physics in medical images and their impact on the latest advances in artificial intelligence, particularly, in generative models and reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we explore the integration of physics knowledge into physics-inspired machine learning models, which leverage physics-based constraints to enhance the learning of medical imaging features.</description>

      <title>Dual Prompting for Diverse Count-level PET Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The to-be-denoised positron emission tomography (PET) volumes are inherent with diverse count levels, which imposes challenges for a unified model to tackle varied cases. In this work, we resort to the recently flourished prompt learning to achieve generalizable PET denoising with different count levels. Specifically, we propose dual prompts to guide the PET denoising in a divide-and-conquer manner, i.e., an explicitly count-level prompt to provide the specific prior information and an implicitly general denoising prompt to encode the essential PET denoising knowledge. Then, a novel prompt fusion module is developed to unify the heterogeneous prompts, followed by a prompt-feature interaction module to inject prompts into the features. The prompts are able to dynamically guide the noise-conditioned denoising process. Therefore, we are able to efficiently train a unified denoising model for various count levels, and deploy it to different cases with personalized prompts. We evaluated on 1940 low-count PET 3D volumes with uniformly randomly selected 13-22\% fractions of events from 97 $^{18}$F-MK6240 tau PET studies. It shows our dual prompting can largely improve the performance with informed count-level and outperform the count-conditional model.</description>

      <title>Nonperiodic dynamic CT reconstruction using backward-warping INR with regularization of diffeomorphism (BIRD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic computed tomography (CT) reconstruction faces significant challenges in addressing motion artifacts, particularly for nonperiodic rapid movements such as cardiac imaging with fast heart rates. Traditional methods struggle with the extreme limited-angle problems inherent in nonperiodic cases. Deep learning methods have improved performance but face generalization challenges. Recent implicit neural representation (INR) techniques show promise through self-supervised deep learning, but have critical limitations: computational inefficiency due to forward-warping modeling, difficulty balancing DVF complexity with anatomical plausibility, and challenges in preserving fine details without additional patient-specific pre-scans. This paper presents a novel INR-based framework, BIRD, for nonperiodic dynamic CT reconstruction. It addresses these challenges through four key contributions: (1) backward-warping deformation that enables direct computation of each dynamic voxel with significantly reduced computational cost, (2) diffeomorphism-based DVF regularization that ensures anatomically plausible deformations while maintaining representational capacity, (3) motion-compensated analytical reconstruction that enhances fine details without requiring additional pre-scans, and (4) dimensional-reduction design for efficient 4D coordinate encoding. Through various simulations and practical studies, including digital and physical phantoms and retrospective patient data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for nonperiodic dynamic CT reconstruction with enhanced details and reduced motion artifacts. The proposed framework enables more accurate dynamic CT reconstruction with potential clinical applications, such as one-beat cardiac reconstruction, cinematic image sequences for functional imaging, and motion artifact reduction in conventional CT scans.</description>

      <title>MRI motion correction via efficient residual-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) significantly degrade image quality and impair quantitative analysis. Conventional mitigation strategies, such as repeated acquisitions or motion tracking, are costly and workflow-intensive. This study introduces Res-MoCoDiff, an efficient denoising diffusion probabilistic model tailored for MRI motion artifact correction. Methods: Res-MoCoDiff incorporates a novel residual error shifting mechanism in the forward diffusion process, aligning the noise distribution with motion-corrupted data and enabling an efficient four-step reverse diffusion. A U-net backbone enhanced with Swin-Transformer blocks conventional attention layers, improving adaptability across resolutions. Training employs a combined l1+l2 loss, which promotes image sharpness and reduces pixel-level errors. Res-MoCoDiff was evaluated on synthetic dataset generated using a realistic motion simulation framework and on an in-vivo dataset. Comparative analyses were conducted against established methods, including CycleGAN, Pix2pix, and MT-DDPM using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). Results: The proposed method demonstrated superior performance in removing motion artifacts across all motion severity levels. Res-MoCoDiff consistently achieved the highest SSIM and the lowest NMSE values, with a PSNR of up to 41.91+-2.94 dB for minor distortions. Notably, the average sampling time was reduced to 0.37 seconds per batch of two image slices, compared with 101.74 seconds for conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing 3D EPI time series by servo navigation and phase equalization exploiting repeated shots (PEERS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To enable run-time head motion control and robust frequency corrections for 3D EPI fMRI. Methods: A short 3D orbital navigator (3 ms) is inserted into a 3D EPI sequence. A linear perturbation model is calibrated to estimate rigid motion and frequency parameters per shot. Rigid motion is corrected by scan geometry updates in run-time, while several techniques are investigated to stabilize navigator-based frequency corrections in the reconstruction. An additional method termed PEERS is proposed that exploits the repetitive structure of fMRI scans to fine-tune shot-wise phase and frequency estimates using the motion-corrected EPI data itself. Results: Servo navigation effectively reduces motion in the raw data of in-vivo fMRI scans in six subjects. PEERS provides high-precision frequency parameters for robust phase-corrected reconstructions in the phantom and in-vivo accounting for scanner drifts and slice encoding-related effects on EPI. In combination, servo navigation and PEERS achieve successful intra-volume corrections and consistent tSNR improvements of 8% on average throughout the brain. The two methods prove to be highly synergetic. Conclusion: Servo navigation achieves high-precision motion correction for 3D-EPI fMRI in run-time and, in synergy with PEERS, provides stable frequency corrections with short navigators even for long echo times. With its automatic self-calibration and no hardware requirements, servo navigation and PEERS enable effective plug-and-play motion correction for 3D fMRI.</description>

      <title>Dosimetric Evaluation of CT-to-RED Calibration Curves on Dosimetric Accuracy in Brain Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate radiotherapy dose calculation depends on converting CT Hounsfield Units (HU) to relative electron density (RED) using calibration curves. This study compared three different CT-to-RED calibration curves-two derived from physical phantoms (CIRS 062M and Catphan 604) and one default curve from the Monaco treatment planning system (TPS) by recalculating ten brain tumor VMAT plans. The analysis showed that using the default TPS curve led to dose overestimation (by 3 5 for target volumes and 2 4 for some critical organs) compared to the CIRS phantom-derived curve, which was the most accurate. The Catphan curve had intermediate results. The findings highlight that the choice of calibration curve significantly affects dose accuracy in brain radiotherapy, and site-specific, phantom-based calibration should be prioritized to improve treatment precision and safety.</description>
