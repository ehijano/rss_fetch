      <title>Learnt Microwave Image Reconstruction with A Conformal Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep learning model is proposed for reconstructing 2D dielectric breast images from time-domain signals. Unlike existing learning models that employ a fixed antenna array, where input data consists solely of measurements, the proposed system integrates antenna positioning into the processing pipeline. This allows for a conformal antenna array that adapts to different breast sizes for optimal data collection across various patients, which eliminates undesired signal attenuation in coupling liquid when implemented for the fixed array. By leveraging antenna positions, the breast surface can be pre-estimated, enabling the neural network to focus on image reconstruction within the region of interest. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model may reconstruct breast images with good quality.</description>

      <title>Spectral micro-CT for quantitative analysis of calcification in fibrocartilage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a quantitative method for assessing calcification in fibrocartilage using spectral micro-computed tomography ($\mu$CT). Tissue samples of hip acetabular labrum from patients with osteoarthritis and femoroacetabular impingement were imaged with a laboratory-based spectral $\mu$CT system equipped with a small-pixel photon-counting detector. The detector operated with two energy thresholds, allowing the simultaneous acquisition of two CT datasets at different X-ray energies. A material decomposition algorithm accounting for the system's spectral response was applied to separate calcium- and water-like components, yielding three-dimensional visualization and quantification of calcified regions within intact paraffin-embedded samples. Unlike the conventional method for calcification assessment based on histology, this spectral \mu CT approach offers volumetric quantification of calcium structures without physical sectioning or staining. The method achieved a voxel size of 20 $\mu$m for samples up to ~3 cm, with a calcium detection threshold of ~0.3 g/cm$^3$ for structures down to 50 $\mu$m. Quantification accuracy was estimated to be 5% by using a calibration phantom. Further comparison with histology demonstrated the correct localization of calcium spatial distributions and a match in the calcium crystal deposition score by providing non-destructive, quantitative 3D calcium maps of preserved tissue samples. This technique complements histology and could enhance the characterization of pathological fibrocartilage calcification in hip joint disorders.</description>

      <title>2bNIRS: a portable, multi-distance, broadband oximeter and cytochrome-c-oxidase monitoring system for in vivo applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) instruments typically employ 2-3 wavelengths for monitoring tissue haemodynamics. However, the use of broadband illumination (hundreds of wavelengths) unlocks also the targeting of tissue metabolism by exploiting the wide differential-redox peak of absorption of cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO). For this purpose, we present here a novel, broadband (780-900nm), multi-distance NIRS system, called 2bNIRS. Compact and portable (20 x 30 x 40 cm3), 2bNIRS was validated using a dynamic, optical phantom con-taining blood and yeast, and benchmarked against a multi-wavelength time-domain NIRS (TD-NIRS) system. Validation confirmed its accuracy in tracking haemody-namic and metabolic changes, with superior oximetry performance achieved via our BRUNO algorithm, which integrates broadband spectral fitting with spatially-re-solved analysis. Preliminary in vivo, human applications demonstrated 2bNIRS ap-plicability to monitoring both muscle tissue, during arm cuff occlusions, and the brain, during frontal cortex activation.</description>

      <title>FENCE: Flexible Electric Noise Cancellation Endo-shield for the Suppression of Electromagnetic Interference in Low-Field MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is a significant challenge for low-field MRI systems operating without conventional Faraday-shielded rooms. Traditional EMI mitigation approaches include external shields, subject grounding via electrodes, or active noise cancellation requiring synchronized receive channels. These methods either limit portability, introduce patient discomfort, or demand expensive hardware. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that EMI primarily couples capacitively from the body to the RF coil. We investigated two methods of blocking capacitive coupling while preserving inductive MRI signal detection: First, we employed capacitive segmentation of the RF coil and studied its effect on EMI coupling. Second, we present FENCE (Flexible Electromagnetic Noise Cancellation Endo-shield), a novel approach blocking capacitive coupling using flexible PCB shields placed inside the RF coil. FENCE can be retrofitted to existing RF coils. Finite element (FE) simulations were used to estimate the expected shielding performance and the impact on RF coil losses prior to practical implementation. Testing in various realistic scenarios then demonstrated that the combination of FENCE with segmented coils is effective against both environmental noise sources and controlled EMI. In phantom experiments, FENCE increased SNR by up to a factor of 9 and reduced EMI levels to near-baseline levels with 9% reduction in coil quality factor (Q factor), showing good agreement with the predictions from the FE simulations. In-vivo head imaging confirmed these results across diverse electromagnetic environments where SNR increased by up to a factor 2 while showing an 18% decrease in Q factor. FENCE's simple design provides a low-cost solution to EMI in low-field MRI, enhancing image quality while maintaining system portability and accessibility.</description>

      <title>Standard audiogram classification from loudness scaling data using unsupervised, supervised, and explainable machine learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the calibration and procedural challenges inherent in remote audiogram assessment for rehabilitative audiology, this study investigated whether calibration-independent adaptive categorical loudness scaling (ACALOS) data can be used to approximate individual audiograms by classifying listeners into standard Bisgaard audiogram types using machine learning. Three classes of machine learning approaches - unsupervised, supervised, and explainable - were evaluated. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to extract the first two principal components, which together explained more than 50 percent of the variance. Seven supervised multi-class classifiers were trained and compared, alongside unsupervised and explainable methods. Model development and evaluation used a large auditory reference database containing ACALOS data (N = 847). The PCA factor map showed substantial overlap between listeners, indicating that cleanly separating participants into six Bisgaard classes based solely on their loudness patterns is challenging. Nevertheless, the models demonstrated reasonable classification performance, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy among supervised approaches. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can predict standard Bisgaard audiogram types, within certain limits, from calibration-independent loudness perception data, supporting potential applications in remote or resource-limited settings without requiring a traditional audiogram.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale tissue properties and electric fields in brain stimulation -- bridging the macroscopic and microscopic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.</description>
