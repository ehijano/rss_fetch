      <title>Fibonacci Numbers and Their Lucas Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for the classical Fibonacci sequence (Fn) and the Lucas sequence (Ln) the following identity holds for every integer n &gt;= 2: (n-1)Fn equals the sum from k=1 to n-1 of Lk multiplied by F(n-k). Equivalently, this gives a representation of the nth Fibonacci number as Fn = (1 / (n-1)) times the same sum. We present a detailed proof by mathematical induction and illustrate the identity with a numeric example.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for the Mayer-Erd\H{o}s phenomenon on similarly ordered Farey fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\frac{a_1}{b_1}, \frac{a_2}{b_2}, \ldots$ be the Farey fractions of order $n$. We then prove that the inequality $(a_l - a_k)(b_l - b_k) \ge 0$ holds for all $k$ and $l &gt; k$ with $l-k \le \left(\frac{1}{12} - o(1) \right)n$, sharpening an old result by Erd\H{o}s. On the other hand, we will show that for all $n \ge 4$ there are $k, l$ with $k &lt; l &lt; k + \frac{n}{4} + 5$ for which the product $(a_l - a_k)(b_l - b_k)$ is negative.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Algorithms for Moser's Problems on Sums of Consecutive Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his 1963 paper on the sum of consecutive primes, Moser posed four open questions related to $f(n)$, the number of ways an integer $n$ can be written as a sum of consecutive primes. (See also problem C2 from Richard K.~Guy's \textit{Unsolved Problems in Number Theory}.) In this paper, we present and analyze two algorithms that, when given a bound $x$, construct a histogram of values of $f(n)$ for all $n\le x$. These two algorithms were described, but not analyzed, by Jean Charles Meyrignac (2000) and Michael S. Branicky (2022). We show the first algorithm takes $O(x\log x)$ time using $x^{2/3}$ space, and the second has two versions, one of which takes $O(x\log x)$ time but only $x^{3/5}$ space, and the other which takes $O(x(\log x)^2)$ time but only $O( \sqrt{x\log x})$ space. However, Meyrinac's algorithm is easier to parallelize. We then present data generated by these algorithms that address all four open questions.</description>

      <title>CM theory, maximal hyperelliptic curves, and Chebyshev polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies hyperelliptic curves $\cH_d$ corresponding to $y^2=\varphi_d(x)$ over finite fields, with $\varphi_d(x)$ a Chebyshev polynomial. Starting from the case where $d=\ell$ is an odd prime number, new cases $(d,q)$ are presented where $\cH_d$ is maximal over the finite field $\FF_{q^2}$ of cardinality $q^2$. In addition, new conditions ruling out the possibility that $\cH_d/\FF_{q^2}$ is maximal for given $(d,q)$, are presented. The arguments involve a mix of results on slopes of Frobenius, explicit descriptions of abelian subvarieties of the jacobian of $\cH_d$ with complex multiplication,
  and a technique from the theory of $2$-descent on jacobians of hyperelliptic curves. In particular, the method used here to prove maximality in characteristics $p\equiv 1\bmod 4$ for $d\equiv 1\bmod 4$ a prime number, deserves attention, as it differs from earlier maximality arguments for other curves. Using the new results as well as extensive calculations with Magma, we pose some questions. A positive answer would completely classify the pairs $(q,d)$ resulting in maximality.</description>

      <title>A new approach in constructing isogenies of elliptic curves in characteristic three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an elliptic curve ${\mathcal E}$ over a field $K$ it is a challenging problem to write down explicit elements of its endomorphism ring ${\rm End}({\mathcal E});$ the problem amounts to find all possible solutions to a functional equation in the field of rational functions $K(X).$ Instead of attempting to describe them directly, we look first for solutions in the larger field of Laurent power series $K((X))$, which we call them {\em formal endomorphisms}. We show that the set of separable formal endomorphisms naturally identifies with a subset of $\frac{1}{X}K[[X]]-$rational points of a plane cubic defined over $K((X)).$ As a by-product, we present a method for finding all formal separable endomorphisms in characteristic $3$. %and an efficient test for determining if a given formal solution is actually rational, yielding to an endomorphism of the given curve.</description>

      <title>Intertwining periods, L-functions and local-global principles for distinction of automorphic representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for non-vanishing of period integrals on automorphic representations of a general linear group over a division algebra. We consider three different periods: linear periods, twisted-linear periods and Galois periods. Our criterion is a local-global principle, which is stated in terms of local distinction, a further local obstruction, and poles of certain global $L$-functions associated to the underlying involution via the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence. Our local-global principle follows from a careful analysis of singularities of local and global intertwing periods. Our results generalize to inner forms, known results for general linear groups. In particular, we complete the proof of one direction of the Guo-Jacquet conjecture.</description>

      <title>Comparing Left and Right Quotient Sets in Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite subset $A$ of a group $G$, we define the right quotient set and the left quotient set of $A$, respectively, as $AA^{-1} := \{a_1a_2^{-1}:a_1,a_2\in A\}$, $A^{-1}A := \{a_1^{-1}a_2:a_1,a_2\in A\}$. While the right and left quotient sets are equal if $G$ is abelian, subtleties arise when $G$ is a nonabelian group, where the cardinality difference $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$ may be take on arbitrarily large values. Using the results of Martin and O'Bryant on the cardinality differences of sum sets and difference sets in $\mathbb{Z}$, we prove in the infinite dihedral group, $D_\infty \cong \mathbb{Z} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, every integer difference is achievable. Further, we prove that in $F_2$, the free group on $2$ generators, an integer difference is achievable if and only if that integer is even, and we explicitly construct subsets of $F_2$ that achieve every even integer. We further determine the minimum cardinality of $A \subset G$ so that the difference between the cardinalities of the left and right quotient sets is nonzero, depending on the existence of order $2$ elements in $G$. To prove these results, we construct difference graphs $D_A$ and $D_{A^{-1}}$ which encode equality, respectively, in the right and left quotient sets. We observe a bijection from edges in $D_A$ to edges in $D_{A^{-1}}$ and count connected components in order to obtain our results on cardinality differences $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$.</description>

      <title>The non-existence of some Galois representations of moderate degree in small characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refining arguments of Hyunsuk Moon, under the assumption of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we prove the non-existence of irreducible mod 2 Galois representations unramified outside 2 of dimensions $\leq 4$, and of totally real such representations of dimensions $\leq 8$. We also prove the non-existence of irreducible totally real mod 3 representations unramified outside 3 of dimensions $\leq 4$.
  We show unconditionally that the image of an irreducible mod 2 symplectic 4-dimensional Galois representation that is unramified outside 2 must be large. Under GRH, we then deduce the non-existence of such representations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we define extended trigonometric functions via series and employ the method of contour integration to investigate the parity of certain cyclotomic Euler sums and multiple polylogarithm function. We can provide the statement of parity results for cyclotomic Euler sums of arbitrary order, explicit formulas for the parity of cyclotomic linear and quadratic Euler sums, as well as some formulas for the parity of cyclotomic cubic Euler sums and multiple polylogarithms. As a direct corollary, we derive known formulas concerning the parity of classical Euler sums and alternating Euler sums.</description>

      <title>On Triple Quadratic Residue Symbols in Real Quadratic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce triple quadratic residue symbols $[\mathfrak{p}_1, \mathfrak{p}_2, \mathfrak{p}_3]$ for certain finite primes $\mathfrak{p}_i$'s of a real quadratic field $k$ with trivial narrow class group. For this, we determine a presentation of the Galois group of the maximal pro-2 Galois extension over $k$ unramified outside $\mathfrak{p}_1, \mathfrak{p}_2, \mathfrak{p}_3$ and infinite primes, from which we derive mod 2 arithmetic triple Milnor invariants $\mu_2(123)$ yielding the triple symbol $[\mathfrak{p}_1, \mathfrak{p}_2, \mathfrak{p}_3] = (-1)^{\mu_2(123)}$. Our symbols $[\mathfrak{p}_1, \mathfrak{p}_2, \mathfrak{p}_3]$ describes the decomposition law of $\mathfrak{p}_3$ in a certain dihedral extension $K$ over $k$ of degree 8, determined by $\mathfrak{p}_1, \mathfrak{p}_2$. The field $K$ and our symbols $[\mathfrak{p}_1, \mathfrak{p}_2, \mathfrak{p}_3]$ are generalizations over real quadratic fields of R\'{e}dei's dihedral extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ and R\'{e}dei's triple symbol of rational primes. We give examples of R\'{e}dei type extensions $K$ over real quadratic fields. We also give a cohomological interpretation of our symbols in terms of Massey products.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Hecke operators and their application II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Borcherds' questions, Guerzhoy constructed a new type of Hecke operators $\mathcal{T}(p)$, called the multiplicative Hecke operators, which acts on the space of meromorphic modular forms on the full modular group ${\rm SL}(\Z)$. By Kim and Shin, this result was extended in two directions: to higher levels and to $\mathcal{T}(n)$ with a positive integer $n$. In this paper, building on the results by Kim and Shin, we further generalize the result in another direction by considering alternative infinite product expansions of meromorphic modular forms. As an application, we demonstrate how multiplicative Hecke operators relate both the divisor of modular forms and traces of singular moduli. Additionally, we prove the existence of a modular form with nonintegral coefficients whose poles or zeros are only supported at the cusps and which is not a multiplicative Hecke eigenform.</description>

      <title>Constructions of Sequences of Alternating Sum and Difference Dominated Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A More Sums Than Difference (MSTD) set is a finite set of integers $A$ where the cardinality of its sumset, $A+A$, is greater than the cardinality of its difference set, $A-A$. Since addition is commutative while subtraction isn't, it was conjectured that MSTD sets are rare. As Martin and O'Bryant proved a small (but positive) percentage are MSTD, it is natural to ask what additional properties can we impose on a chain of MSTD sets; in particular, can we construct a sequence of sets alternating between being MSTD and More Difference Than Sums (MDTS) where each properly contains the previous? We provide several such constructions; the first are trivial and proceed by filling in all missing elements from the minimum to maximum elements of $A$, while the last is a more involved construction that prohibits adding any such elements.</description>

      <title>The distribution of intersections in $\mathrm{SL}(3, \mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathrm{SL}(3, \mathbb{R})$ and lattices related to roots of cubic congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we study the distribution of the intersections between certain translates of closed orbits of the positive diagonal subgroup in $\mathrm{SL}(3, \mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathrm{SL}(3, \mathbb{R})$ with a maximal parabolic subgroup. These intersections are closely connected to roots of congruences for certain monic, irreducible cubic polynomials $F(X) \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$. The the main result is that the intersections, considered as a sequences in the diagonal subgroup and the parabolic subgroup, are jointly equidistributed. This implies that certain affine lattices determined by pairs of roots of the cubic congruences are jointly equidistributed with corresponding ideals in the associated ring of integers. We note that the techniques here roughly parallel those which has been developed to study the multidimensional Farey sequence, and one hopes that techniques to study roots of congruences will continue to develop.</description>

      <title>Lehmer pairs and binomial series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper defines a generalized Hardy function and simulates the zero of the Zeta function that does not lie on a critical line. $$Z_\alpha=\Re\zeta(\alpha+it)e^{i\theta(t)}$$ where \par $$e^{i\theta(t)}=\pi^{-it/2}\frac{\Gamma(1/4+it/2)}{|\Gamma(1/4+it/2)|}$$ \par Using the binomial series and the generalized summation method, the formula for the generalized Hardy function is obtained. $$Z_\alpha =Z_0+\sum^{\infty}_{k=1}(-1)^k\frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)(\alpha-2)...(\alpha-k+1)}{k!}Q_k$$ \par where \par $Z_\alpha$ is a generalized Hardy function on a line $\alpha+it$; \par $Z_0$ is a generalized Hardy function on a line $it$; $$Q_k=\sum^\infty_{n=2}\Big(\frac{n-1}{n}\Big)^kT_n;$$ $$T_n=\cos((\theta(t)-t\log(n))\delta^{(k)}_{m,n};$$ $$\delta^{(k)}_{m,n}=\frac{\sum^m_{n-1}C^{k-1}_{m-k-n}}{ C^k_{m+k}};$$ $\delta^{(k)}_{m,n}$ is the coefficient obtained using Cesaro's generalized summation method of k order. \par Based on the obtained formula, Gram points of the third kind are determined, the formation condition is considered, and a new definition of Lehmer pairs is given. \par The main result of the work is that we obtain a sequence of functions that tends to the Hardy function, and the zeros tend to the zeros of the Hardy function. \par $$Z_{\alpha,0}=Z_0$$ $$Z_{\alpha,k}=Z_{\alpha,k-1}-P_k$$ where $$P_k=(-1)^{k-1}\frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)(\alpha-2)...(\alpha-k+1)}{k!}Q_k$$ \par Based on the analysis of the obtained sequence of functions, it is shown that the distance between pairs of Lehmer can be arbitrarily small, while always remaining greater than zero. \par Thus, all Lehmer pairs of the Hardy function are real zeros, and the assumption formulated in 1956 that the Hardy function can have a negative maximum or a positive minimum turned out to be false.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the number of nonunimodular zeros of a self-reciprocal polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the ratio of the number of roots, not equal to 1 in modulus, of a reciprocal
  polynomial $R_d(x)$ to its degree $d$. For some sequences of reciprocal polynomials we show that the ratio has a
  limit $L$ when $d$ tends to infinity. Each of these sequences is defined using a two-variable polynomial $P(x,y)$ so that $R_d(x) = P(x,x^n)$.
  We present a few methods for approximation of the limit ratio, some of them we originally developed.
  In a previous paper we have calculated the exact value of the limit ratio of polynomials, correlated
  to many bivariate polynomials, of degree two in $y$, having small Mahler measure listed by Boyd and Mossinghoff.
  Now we approximate the limit ratio of $P(y^n,y)$, for all polynomials in the list.
  Knowing some exact values of the limit ratio, we compare the error of the approximation and the time duration of these methods.
  We show that the limit ratio of the sequence $P(x,x^n)$ usually is not equal to the limit ratio of
  the sequence $P(y^n,y)$, unlike the Mahler measure.</description>

      <title>Distance between cubics and rationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the following problem: what is the smallest possible distance between a cubic irrational $\xi$ and a rational number $p/q$ in terms of the height $H(\xi)$ and $q$? More precisely, we consider the set $D_{3,1}$ of all pairs $(u,v)$ of positive real numbers such that $|\xi - p/q| &gt; cH^{-u}(\xi)q^{-v}$ for all cubic irrationals $\xi$ and rationals $p/q$. First, we transform this problem into one about the root separation of cubic polynomials. Second, we establish a conditional result: under the Hall conjecture (a special case of the famous abc-conjecture), every pair $(u,v) = (3+2\epsilon, 5/2+\epsilon)$ belongs to $D_{3,1}$. Third, we show that every pair $(u,v)\in D_{3,1}$ must satisfy $u\ge 10-3v$. Finally, we discuss an analogue of the set $D_{3,1}$ in function fields where we are able to give a complete description.</description>

      <title>The Galois Theory (a ring theoretic approach)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental concepts in the Galois Theory are separable, normal and Galois field extensions. These concepts are central in proofs of the Galois Theory. In the paper, we introduce a new approach, a ring theoretic approach, to the Galois Theory which is based on central simple algebras and none of the above concepts are used or even mentioned. The only concept which is used is `G-extension' (a finite field extension $L/K$ is called a {\em G-extension} if the endomorphism algebra ${\rm End}_K(L)$ is generated by the field $L$ and the automorphism group ${\rm Aut}_{K-{\rm alg}}(L)$). So, G-extensions are the most symmetric field extensions. In this approach, the Galois Correspondences (for subfields and Galois subfields of $L$) are deduced from the Double Centralizer Theorem which is applied to the central simple algebra ${\rm End}_K(L)$ and G-extensions. Since the class of G-extensions {\em coincides} with the class of Galois extensions, all main results of the Galois Theory are obtained from the `corresponding' results for G-extensions. This approach gives a new conceptual (short) proofs of key results of the Galois Theory. It also reveals that the `maximal symmetry' (of field extensions) is the essence of the Galois Theory.</description>

      <title>On a Divisor Modular Form and a Theta Lift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1975, Zagier introduced the highly influential hyperbolic Poincar\'e series $f_{k,D}$. We connect the divisor modular form of $f_{k,D}$ to a new weak Maass form $\omega_{k+1,D}$. Furthermore, we show that the generating function of $\omega_{k+1,D}$ has the same modularity properties as Kohnen and Zagier's fruitful theta kernel generating the $f_{k,D}$'s. This yields a new theta lift.</description>

      <title>Perfect $F$-gauges and finite flat group schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show an equivalence of categories, over general $p$-adic bases, between finite locally $p^n$-torsion commutative group schemes and $\Int/p^n\Int$-modules in perfect $F$-gauges of Tor amplitude $[-1,0]$ with Hodge-Tate weights $0,1$. By relating fppf cohomology of group schemes and syntomic cohomology of $F$-gauges, we deduce some consequences: These include the representability of relative fppf cohomology of finite flat group schemes under proper smooth maps of $p$-adic formal schemes, as well as a reproof of a purity result of \v{C}esnavi\v{c}ius-Scholze. We also give a general criterion for a classification in terms of objects closely related to Zink's windows over frames and Lau's divided Dieudonn\'e crystals, and we use this to recover several known classifications, and also give some new ones.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Y_1$ be a compact arithmetic hyperbolic surface associated to a maximal quaternion order, let $Y_q$ be a cover associated to an Eichler suborder of prime level $q$, and let $\iota_q$ be embedding of $Y_q$ as the Hecke correspondence into $Y_1 \times Y_1$. Let $\mu_1$ and $\mu_q$ be the invariant probability measures on $Y_1$ and $Y_q$, respectively. If $F$ is a newform on $Y_q$, we conjecture that the pushforward measure $(\iota_q)_\ast(\lvert F \rvert^2 \mu_q)$ converges weakly to the uniform measure $\mu_1 \times \mu_1$, as $q$ tends to infinity. We prove this conjecture with an effective rate of equidistribution, assuming GRH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a Dedekind domain with field of fractions $K$ and $\operatorname{char}(R)\neq3$. In this paper, we generalize Bhargava's parametrization of $3$-torsion ideal classes by binary cubic forms to work over $R$. Specifically, we construct arithmetic subgroups of $\operatorname{GL}_2(K)$ whose actions on certain lattices of binary cubic forms over $K$ parametrize $3$-torsion ideal classes in class groups of quadratic rings over $R$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study Euclidean algorithms and the corresponding continued fractions for oriented linear Grassmanians $G(k,n)$. We propose two algorithms: Maximal Element Elimination algorithm and Minimal Element Elimination algorithm. The first algorithm reduces the absolute maximal value of the Pl\"ucker coordinates; the algorithm works only in $G(2,n)$. The second algorithm eliminates the Pl\"ucker coordinate with the smallest absolute values, while all other coordinates may increase; the algorithm works for arbitrary $G(2,n)$. We discuss basic features of these algorithms and formulate several natural open questions for further studies.</description>

      <title>Analogue of the Galois Theory for normal fields and B-extensions (characteristic free approach)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to introduce B-extensions which are the most symmetrical finite field extensions (a finite field extension $L/K$ is called a {\it B-extension} if the endomorphism algebra ${\rm End}_K(L)$ is generated by the algebra of differential operators ${\cal D} (L/K)$ on the $K$-algebra $L$ and the automorphism group $G(L/K):={\rm Aut}_{K-{\rm alg}}(L)$) and to obtain an analogue of the Galois Theory for B-extensions. Surprisingly, the class of B-extensions coincides with the class of {\it normal } finite field extensions. As a result, an analogue of the Galois Theory is obtained for normal field extensions. In particular, all Galois field extensions and all purely inseparable field extensions are B-extensions. Our approach is a ring theoretic (characteristic free) approach which is based on central simple algebras. In this approach, analogues of the Galois Correspondences (for subfields and normal subfields of $L$) are deduced from the Double Centralizer Theorem which is applied to the central simple algebra ${\rm End}_K(L)$ and subfields of B-extensions.
  Since Galois finite field extensions are B-extensions, this approach gives a new conceptual (short) proofs of key results of the Galois Theory, see [2] for details. It also reveals that the `maximal symmetry' (of field extensions) is the essence of the classical Galois Theory and the analogue of the Galois Theory for normal field extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An identity by Ramanujan related to the multisection of Bernoulli numbers is revisited. Two alternative approaches are proposed, both relying on the multisection technique. A geometric approach reveals the role played by the symmetries of the summation domain in the complex plane induced by the multisection technique. The second approach, based on generating functions, allows us to extend Ramanujan's identity to other special functions such as Eisenstein's series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two relatively prime numbers $a$ and $b$, it is known that exactly one of the two Diophantine equations has a nonnegative integral solution $(x,y)$: $$
  ax + by \ =\ \frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}\quad \mbox{ and }\quad 1 + ax + by \ =\ \frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}. $$ Furthermore, the solution is unique. This paper surveys recent results on finding the solution and determining which equation is used when $a$ and $b$ are taken from certain sequences. We contribute to the literature by finding $(x,y)$ when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive terms of sequences having the Fibonacci recurrence and arbitrary initial terms.</description>

Rather than working with explicit equations, we represent these points using the moduli interpretation of necklaces in the $p$-torsion of elliptic curves. We use our methods to investigate for which primes $\ell\neq p$ two rational points with complex multiplication can have equal reduction modulo $\ell$.</description>

      <title>On irrationals with Lagrange value exactly 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $c&gt;0$, let $X_c$ denote the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|&lt;\frac{1}{cq^2}$ has only finitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$. It is a classical fact, known since the 1950s, that $X_c$ is uncountable for $c&gt;3$ and countable for $c&lt;3$. However, the cardinality of $X_3$ does not appear to be present in the literature. We prove that $X_3$ is uncountable.
  More generally, we show that for any $n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$, the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ with Lagrange value exactly $3$ and such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|&lt;\frac{1}{3q^2}$ has exactly $n$ rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ is also uncountable.</description>

      <title>Divisibility by $p$ for Markoff-like Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study orbits in a family of Markoff-like surfaces with extra off-diagonal terms over prime fields $\mathbb{F}_p$. It is shown that, for a typical surface of this form, every non-trivial orbit has size divisible by $p$. This extends a theorem of W.Y. Chen from the Markoff surface itself to others in this family. The proof closely follows and elaborates on a recent argument of D.E. Martin. We expect that there is just one orbit generically. For some special parameters, we prove that there are at least two or four orbits. Cayley's cubic surface plays a role in parametrising the exceptional cases and dictating the number of solutions mod $p$.</description>

      <title>Subconvexity for Rankin Selberg L-Functions at Special Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ and $g$ be normalized Hecke-Maass cusp forms for the full modular group having spectral parameters $t_f$ and $t_g$ respectively with $t_f,t_g\asymp T\rightarrow \infty $. In this paper we show that the Rankin Selberg $L$-function associated to the pair $(f,g)$ at the special points $t=\pm(t_f+t_g)$, satisfies the subconvex bound \begin{align*} L\left(\frac{1}{2}+it,f\otimes g\right)\ll_{\eps} T^{61/84+\eps}. \end{align*} Additionally at the points $t=\pm(t_f-t_g)\asymp T^{\nu}$ with $2/3+\eps&lt;\nu\leq 1$ we show the subconvex bound \begin{align*} L(1/2+it,f\otimes g)\ll_\eps {T^{7/12+\nu/8+\eps}}, \; \text{if }\; 2/3+\eps&lt; \nu\leq 14/17, \end{align*} and \begin{align*} L(1/2+it,f\otimes g)\ll_\eps {T^{1/2+19\nu/84+\eps}}, \; \text{if }\; 14/17\leq \nu\leq 1. \end{align*} With the above results we are able to address the subconvexity problem in the spectral aspect for $GL(2)\times GL(2)$ Rankin Selberg $L$-functions when the parameters of both the forms vary under the additional challenge of a considerable amount conductor dropping occurring due to the special points in question.</description>

Abstract: We give effective asymptotic counting results for pairs of Farey neighbours and for modular symbols in $\mathbb Q$, in imaginary quadratic number fields and in definite quaternion algebras over $\mathbb Q$, using the distribution of common perpendiculars between Margulis cusp neighbourhoods and divergent geodesics in hyperbolic manifolds.

      <description>arXiv:2509.02290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of positive characteristic with no algebraically closed subfield. Let $F$ be a function field over $K$ and $t \in F$ transcendental over $K$. Refining a result of Eisentr{\"a}ger and Shlapentokh, we show that there is no algorithm which, on input a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[t][X_1, \ldots, X_n]$, determines whether $f$ has a zero in $F^n$. To this end, we revisit and partially extend several recent results from the literature on existential definability in function fields.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Chabauty for Atkin-Lehner quotients of modular curves via weakly holomorphic modular forms: Hodge Filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Atkin-Lehner quotients $X_0^+(N)$, of prime level and of genus at least 2, we provide an algorithm for computing one of the main objects in the quadratic Chabauty algorithm in terms of weakly holomorphic modular forms associated to the curve. In particular, the algorithm computes a Hodge filtration on a certain unipotent vector bundle with connection related to $X_0^+(N)$, which is crucial in computing the $p$-adic height which is used to define the finite set of $p$-adic points containing the rational points on $X_0^+(N)$. This improves the current Hodge filtration algorithm by replacing the input of an explicit plane model of the curve with weakly holomorphic modular forms to produce a faster computation. We implement our algorithm on the genus 7 modular curve $X_0^+(193)$, and discover congruences between iterated integrals of weight 2 cusp forms in the plus eigenspace for the Atkin-Lehner involution and single integrals of weight 2 cusp forms in the minus eigenspace for the Atkin-Lehner involution.</description>

      <title>Factorization of periods, construction of automorphic motives and Deligne's conjecture over CM-fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the relations between Deligne's conjecture on critical values of motivic $L$-functions and the multiplicative relations between periods of arithmetically normalized automorphic forms on unitary groups. As an application of our main result, we establish Deligne's conjecture for a class of CM-automorphic motives, which we construct in this paper. Our proof uses the results of our recent joint work with Raghuram in combination with the Ichino--Ikeda--Neal-Harris (IINH) formula for unitary groups -- which is now a theorem -- and an analysis of cup products of coherent cohomological automorphic forms on Shimura varieties to establish relations between certain automorphic periods and critical values of Rankin-Selberg and Asai $L$-functions of $\GL(n)\times\GL(m)$ over CM fields. By reinterpreting these critical values in terms of automorphic periods of holomorphic automorphic forms on unitary groups, we show that the automorphic periods of holomorphic forms can be factored as products of coherent cohomological forms, compatibly with a motivic factorization predicted by the Tate conjecture. All of these results are stated under a certain regularity condition and an hypothesis of rationality on archimedean zeta-integrals.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Sparsity and Cohomological Obstructions in Weighted Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the distribution of rational and algebraic points of bounded weighted height in weighted projective spaces over number fields. For a weighted projective space with weights q over a number field k of degree m, we derive an asymptotic formula for the count of such points, featuring a leading term D times X raised to m e Q, plus an error term, where e is the extension degree and Q is the sum of the weights. The constant D combines geometric aspects of the weights with an arithmetic obstruction given by the reciprocal of the gcd of the least common multiple of the weights and Euler's totient of m e. This obstruction stems from the non-surjectivity of the natural morphism from the weighted space to ordinary projective space on rational points, linked to nontrivial torsors under groups of roots of unity. We provide a cohomological interpretation, analogous to the Brauer-Manin obstruction. These findings refine a weighted version of the Batyrev-Manin conjecture and open avenues for applications in moduli theory and arithmetic geometry.</description>

      <title>Eisenstein series modulo prime powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $p\geq 5$ is prime and $k\geq 4$ is an even integer with $(p-1)\nmid k$ we consider the Eisenstein series $G_k$ on $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ modulo powers of $p$. It is classically known that for such $k$ we have $G_k\equiv G_{k'}\pmod p$ if $k\equiv k'\pmod{p-1}$. Here we obtain a generalization modulo prime powers $p^m$ by giving an expression for $G_k\pmod{p^m}$ in terms of modular forms of weight at most $mp$. As an application we extend a recent result of the first author with Hanson, Raum and Richter by showing that, modulo powers of $E_{p-1}$, every such Eisenstein series is congruent modulo $p^m$ to a modular form of weight at most $mp$. We prove a similar result for the normalized Eisenstein series $E_k$ in the case that $(p-1)\mid k$ and $m&lt;p$.</description>

      <title>Spectral moduli problems for level structures and an integral Jacquet-Langlands dual of Morava E-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an E-infinity ring spectrum R, with motivation from chromatic homotopy theory, we define relative effective Cartier divisors for a spectral Deligne-Mumford stack over Spet(R) and prove that, as a functor from connective R-algebras to topological spaces, it is representable. This enables us to solve various moduli problems of level structures on spectral abelian varieties, overcoming difficulty at primes dividing the level. In particular, we obtain higher-homotopical refinement for finite levels of a Lubin-Tate tower as E-infinity ring spectra, which generalizes Morava, Hopkins, Miller, Goerss, and Lurie's spectral realization of the deformation ring at the ground level. Moreover, passing to the infinite level and then descending along the equivariantly isomorphic Drinfeld tower, we obtain a Jacquet-Langlands dual to the Morava E-theory spectrum, along with homotopy fixed point spectral sequences dual to those studied by Devinatz and Hopkins. These serve as potential tools for computing higher-periodic homotopy types from pro-etale cohomology of p-adic general linear groups.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript is about abelian varieties that are Jacobians of curves. I started writing it for a lecture series at the Arizona Winter School in 2024 on abelian varieties. A longer more descriptive title might be: The Torelli locus in the moduli space of abelian varieties, with applications to Newton polygons of curves in positive characteristic. To elaborate, this manuscript covers two topics: the first is about the geometry of the Torelli locus; the second is about the arithmetic invariants of abelian varieties that occur for Jacobians of smooth curves in positive characteristic.</description>

Abstract: We introduce {\it (W')-specification} in terms of language decompositions of subshifts, and show that any recurrence set of a subshift with this property has full Hausdorff dimension. Our main result applies to a wide class of subshifts without specification, such as all $S$-gap shifts, some coded shifts, and the coding space of any transitive piecewise monotonic interval map with positive entropy. Further, for a wide class of piecewise expanding interval maps we show that any recurrence set has full Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any finite abelian group $G$ contains a collection of not too many subsets with a special structure, so that for every subset $A$ of $G$ with a small doubling, there is a member $F$ of the collection that is fully contained in the sumset $A+A$ and is not much smaller than it. Using this result we obtain improved bounds for the problem of estimating the typical independence number of sparse random Cayley or Cayley-sum graphs, and for the problem of estimating the smallest size of a subset of $G$ which is not a sumset. We also obtain tight bounds for the typical maximum length of an arithmetic progression in the sumset of a sparse random subset of $G$.</description>

Abstract: We construct elements in the $K_4$ group of modular curves using the polylogarithmic complexes of weight 3 defined by Goncharov and De Jeu. The construction is uniform in the level and relies on new modular units arising as cross-ratios of division values of the Weierstrass $\wp$ function. These units provide explicit triangulations of the $3$-term relations in $K_2$, which in turn give rise to elements in $K_4$. Based on numerical computations and on results of Wang, we conjecture that these elements are proportional to the Beilinson elements defined via Eisenstein symbols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ramified Siegel series is an important factor that appears in the Fourier coefficient of the Siegel Eisenstein series.Many formulas for the ramified Siegel series under various conditions are already known.However, an explicit formula for the general case has not yet been obtained.We derive a formula for the Siegel series with arbitrary dimension $n$, assuming that the additive character $\psi$ is primitive.Our results cover nonarchimedean, non-dyadic local fields $F$, including the case $F=\mathbb{Q}_p$.We also give explicit values of the ramified Siegel series for degrees $n=1, 2,$ and $3$.</description>

      <title>Balanced multiple q-zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the balanced multiple q-zeta values. They give a new model for multiple q-zeta values, whose product formula combines the shuffle and stuffle product for multiple zeta values in a natural way. Moreover, the balanced multiple q-zeta values are invariant under a very explicit involution. Thus, all relations among the balanced multiple q-zeta values are conjecturally of a very simple shape. Examples of the balanced multiple q-zeta values are the classical Eisenstein series, and they also contain the combinatorial multiple Eisenstein series. The construction of the balanced multiple q-zeta values is done on the level of generating series. We introduce a general setup relating Hoffman's quasi-shuffle products to explicit symmetries among generating series of words, which gives a clarifying approach to Ecalle's theory of bimoulds. This allows us to obtain an isomorphism between the underlying Hopf algebras of words related to the combinatorial bi-multiple Eisenstein series and the balanced multiple q-zeta values.</description>

      <title>A generalization of formal multiple zeta values related to multiple Eisenstein series and multiple q-zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the $\tau$-invariant balanced quasi-shuffle algebra $\mathcal{G}^{\operatorname{f}}$, whose elements formalize (combinatorial) multiple Eisenstein series as well as multiple q-zeta values. In particular, $\mathcal{G}^{\operatorname{f}}$ has natural maps into these two algebras, and we expect these maps to be isomorphisms. Racinet studied the algebra $\mathcal{Z}^f$ of formal multiple zeta values by examining the corresponding affine scheme DM. Similarly, we present the affine scheme BM corresponding to the algebra $\mathcal{G}^{\operatorname{f}}$. We show that Racinet's affine scheme DM embeds into our affine scheme BM. This leads to a projection from the algebra $\mathcal{G}^{\operatorname{f}}$ onto $\mathcal{Z}^f$. Via the above natural maps, this projection corresponds to extracting the constant terms of multiple Eisenstein series or the limit $q\to1$ of multiple q-zeta values.</description>

      <title>A note on the spaces of Eisenstein series on general congruence subgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10627v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a new approach to studying the spectral Eisenstein series of weight $k$ on a congruence subgroup of $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ using Hecke's theory of Eisenstein series for the principal congruence subgroups. Our method provides a gateway to analytic and arithmetic properties of the spectral Eisenstein series using corresponding results for the principal congruence subgroup. We show that the specializations of the weight $k$ spectral Eisenstein series at $s = 0$ give rise to a basis for the space of Eisenstein series on a general congruence subgroup, and the Fourier coefficients of the basis elements lie in a cyclotomic number field. Our philosophy also yields an explicit basis parameterized by cusps for the space of Eisenstein series with a nebentypus character. We utilize the spectral basis for the space of Eisenstein series to provide a simple proof of the Eichler-Shimura isomorphism theorem for the entire space of modular forms.</description>

Abstract: Borisov and Gunnells have proved that certain linear combinations of products of Eisenstein series are Eisenstein series themselves, in analogy with the Manin relations for modular symbols.

      <title>Proof of the Complete Presence of a Modulo 4 Bias for the Semiprimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2016, Dummit, Granville, and Kisilevsky showed that the proportion of semiprimes (products of two primes) not exceeding a given $x$, whose factors are congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, is more than a quarter when $x$ is sufficiently large. They have also conjectured that this holds from the very beginning, that is, for all $x \geq 9$. Here we give a proof of this conjecture. For $x\geq 1.1 \cdot 10^{13}$ we take an explicit approach based on their work. We rely on classical estimates for prime counting functions, as well as on very recent explicit improvements by Bennett, Martin, O'Bryant, and Rechnitzer, which have wide applications in essentially any setting involving estimations of sums over primes in arithmetic progressions. All $x &lt; 1.1 \cdot 10^{13}$ are covered by a computed assisted verification.</description>

Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, and let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field. Consider an odd prime $p$ at which $E$ has good supersingular reduction with $a_p(E)=0$ and which is inert in $K$. Under the assumption that the signed Selmer groups are cotorsion modules over the corresponding Iwasawa algebra, we prove that the Mordell-Weil ranks of $E$ are bounded over any subextensions of the anticyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $K$. Additionally, we provide an asymptotic formula for the growth of the $p$-parts of the Tate-Shafarevich groups of $E$ over these extensions.</description>

Abstract: We study the property of uniform discreteness within discrete orbits of non-uniform lattices in $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$, acting on $\mathbb{R}^2$ by linear transformations. We provide quantitative consequences of previous results by using Diophantine properties. We give a partial result toward a conjecture of Leli\`evre regarding the set of long cylinder holonomy vectors of the "golden L" translation surface: for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, three points of this set can be found on a horizontal line within a distance of $\epsilon$ of each other.</description>

      <title>Strength is bounded linearly by Birch rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a homogeneous polynomial over a field. For many fields, including number fields and function fields, we prove that the strength of $f$ is bounded above by a constant multiple of the Birch rank of $f.$ The constant depends only on the degree of $f$ and the absolute transcendence degree of the field. This is the first linear bound obtained for forms of degree greater than three, partially resolving a conjecture of Adiprasito, Kazhdan and Ziegler.
  Our result has applications for the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. The circle method yields an asymptotic formula for counting integral zeros of (collections of) homogeneous polynomials, provided the Birch rank is sufficiently large -- a natural geometric condition. Our main theorem implies that these formulas hold even if we only assume a similar lower bound on the strength of the (collection of) homogeneous polynomials -- an arithmetic condition which is a priori weaker. This answers questions of Cook-Magyar and Skinner, and also yields a new proof of a seminal result of Schmidt as a consequence of Birch's earlier work.
  Over finite fields we obtain a quasi-linear bound for partition rank of tensors in terms of analytic rank, improving Moshkovitz-Zhu's state of the art bound.</description>

Abstract: The article generalizes an observation of Zagier and Gangl to show that the image of the spectral Eisenstein series on a general congruence subgroup of $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, under the Eichler-Shimura isomorphism, is defined over a cyclotomic number field. We use the same technique to generalize an invariant attached to imaginary quadratic fields in connection with the polylogarithm conjecture on the special values of $L$-functions. Our treatment also provides an elementary derivation of the Fourier expansion of the Maass Eisenstein series on congruence subgroups presented as a power series.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of polynomial Farey points and Chebyshev's bias phenomenon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two types of problems for polynomial Farey fractions. For a positive integer $Q$, and polynomial $P(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[X]$ with $P(0)=0$, we define polynomial Farey fractions as \[\mathcal{F}_{Q,P}:=\left\{\frac{a}{q}: 1\leq a\leq q\leq Q,\ \gcd (P(a),q)=1\right\}.\] The classical Farey fractions are obtained by considering $P(x)=x$. In this article, we determine the global and local distribution of the sequence of polynomial Farey fractions via discrepancy and pair correlation measure, respectively. In particular, we establish that the sequence of polynomial Farey fractions is uniformly distributed modulo one and show that the limit superior of the pair correlation measure of $(\mathcal{F}_{Q,P})_{Q\ge1}$ is bounded. For the specific polynomial $P(x)=x(x+1)$, we show the existence of the limiting pair correlation measure of $(\mathcal{F}_{Q,P})_{Q\ge1}$ and also provide an explicit formula for the pair correlation function which is non-Poissonian. Further, restricting the polynomial Farey denominators to certain subsets of primes, we explicitly find the pair correlation measure and show it to be Poissonian. Finally, we study Chebyshev's bias type of questions for the classical and polynomial Farey denominators along arithmetic progressions and obtain an $\Omega$-result for the error term of its counting function.</description>

      <title>On an analogue of the doubling method in coding theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that there is a deep relationship between codes and lattices. Concepts from coding theory are related to concepts of lattice theory as, for example, weight enumerators to theta series, MacWilliams identity to Jacobi identity, and Gleason's theorem to Hecke's theorem. In this framework, higher-genus (or multiple) weight enumerators are related to Siegel theta series, which opens up the possibility of introducing concepts from the theory of higher-rank modular forms to coding theory. There has been important work in this direction, for example Runge introduced a coding theory analogue of Siegel's $\Phi$-operator and Nebe analogues of Hecke operators. In this paper, we show that the celebrated Doubling Method from the theory of higher-rank modular forms has a coding theory analogue. Given the impact that the Doubling Method has had in the study of higher-rank modular forms, one may expect that its analogue may prove useful to the study of higher-genus weight enumerators. In this paper we use it to solve an analogue of the "basis problem". That is, we express "cuspidal" polynomials which are invariant under a Clifford-Weil type group as an explicit linear combination of higher-genus weight enumerators of self-dual codes of that type.</description>

Let $Z(N)$ be the number of zeros in the character table of $S_N$, and $Z_{t}(N)$ be defined as
  $$
  Z_{t}(N):= \#\{(\lambda,\mu): \chi_{\lambda}(\mu) = 0 \; \text{with $\lambda$ a $t$-core}\}.
  $$
  We prove
  $$
  Z(N) \ge \frac{2\, p(N)^{2}}{\log N} \left( 1 + O\left(\frac{\log\log N}{\log N} \right)\right),
  $$
  where $p(N)$ denotes the number of partitions of $N$. We also give explicit lower bounds for $Z_t(N)$ in various ranges of $t$.</description>

      <title>Hecke polynomials for the mock modular form arising from the Delta-function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a mock modular form $M_{\Delta}(\tau)$ that arises naturally from Ramanujan's Delta-function. It is a weight $-10$ harmonic Maass form whose nonholomorphic part is the "period integral function'' of $\Delta(\tau)$. The Hecke operator $T_{-10}(m)$ acts on this mock modular form in terms of Ramanujan's $\tau(m)$ and a monic degree $m$ polynomial $F_m(x),$ evaluated at $x=j(\tau).$ In analogy with results by Asai, Kaneko, and Ninomiya on the zeros of Hecke polynomials for the $j$-function, we prove that the zeros of each $F_m(x)$, including $x=0$ and $x=1728,$ are distinct and lie in $[0, 1728]$. Additionally, as $m \to +\infty,$ these zeros become equidistributed in $[0, 1728].$</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the existence and uniqueness property on a finite sum involving a polynomial and a homogeneous linear recurrence sequence. This finite sum is of the form $\sum_{k=1}^n P(k)s_{hk+r}$ where $n$ is a positive integer, $P(x)$ is a polynomial in $\mathbb C[x]$, $h$ and $r$ are some integers, and $(s_k)_{k\in\mathbb Z}$ is a homogeneous linear recurrence sequence of degree $m\geq 2$ with some constraints.</description>

      <title>Regulators of the fixed elliptic curve over rank-one imaginary quadratic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a one-sided central limit theorem for the logarithms of regulators of a fixed rational non-CM elliptic curve $E$ over imaginary quadratic fields of rank one, motivated by the Gross--Zagier formula and a result of Radziwi\l\l and Soundararajan.
  We also establish the existence of many imaginary quadratic fields whose regulators grow at least as fast as the square root of the conductor of the field.
  When the central value of the $L$-function of $E$ is non-vanishing, these results also hold for the regulator of the quadratic twist $E^{(d)}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.
  Moreover, assuming the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, we obtain the uniform boundedness of the Shafarevich--Tate groups and Tamagawa numbers for these rank-one quadratic twists.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the vanishing of the module of universal norms associated with a de Rham Galois representation whose Hodge-Tate weights are not all non-positive characterises the algebraic extensions of the field of $p$-adic numbers whose completion is a perfectoid field. We thereby generalise results by Coates and Greenberg for abelian varieties, and by Bondarko for $p$-divisible groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the construction of Castella and Do of an anticyclotomic Euler system for the $p$-adic Galois representation of a modular form, using diagonal classes. Combining this construction and some previous results of ours, we obtain new results towards the Bloch--Kato conjecture in analytic rank one, assuming that the fixed prime $p$ is inert in the relevant imaginary quadratic field.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and Dynamical Systems of Dickson Polynomials in Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical properties of Dickson polynomials over finite fields, focusing on the periodicity and structural behavior of their iterated sequences. We introduce and analyze the sequence $[D_n(x, \alpha) \mod (x^q - x)]_n$, where $D_n(x, \alpha)$ denotes a Dickson polynomial of the first kind, and explore its periodic nature when reduced modulo $x^q - x$. We derive explicit formulas for the period of these sequences, particularly in the case when $n$ is coprime to $q^2 - 1$. In addition, we identify a symmetric property of the polynomial coefficients that plays a crucial role in the analysis of these sequences. Using tools from combinatorics, elementary number theory, and finite fields, we present algorithms to compute the exact period and investigate the dynamical structure of these polynomials. We also highlight open problems in cases where the degree $n$ is not coprime to $q^2 - 1$. Our results offer deep insights into the algebraic structure of Dickson polynomials and their role in dynamical systems over finite fields.</description>

      <title>On $q$-analogs of the $3x+1$ Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers.
  In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series.
  We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points.
  Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</description>

      <title>A triple convolution sum of the divisor function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the triple convolution sum of the divisor function given by $$\sum_{n\leq x} d(n)d(n-h)d(n+h)$$ for $h\neq 0$ and $d(n)$ denotes the number of positive divisors of $n$. Based on algebraic and geometric considerations, Browning conjectured that the above sum is asymptotic to $c_hx(\log x)^3$, for a suitable constant $c_h\neq 0$, as $x\to \infty$. This conjecture is still unproved. Using sieve-theoretic results of Wolke and Nair (respectively), it is possible to derive the exact order of the sum. The lower bound of the correct order of magnitude can also be derived by very elementary arguments. In this paper, using the Tauberian theory for multiple Dirichlet series, we prove an explicit lower bound and provide a new theoretical framework to predict Browning's conjectured constant $c_h$.</description>

      <title>Weight-Shifting Operators of Hypergeometric Type for Maass Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explicitly constructs the integral kernels for a family of weight-shifting operators mapping from the space of weight-k smooth automorphic functions to the space of weight-t automorphic functions. These operators are defined as integral transforms whose kernel, K, is the product of a covariant factor P and a G-invariant function F. The key assumption in the kernel's construction is the spectral condition that K is an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian, Delta_t. This partial differential equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation for the invariant function F, which is shown to be equivalent to the Hypergeometric Differential Equation (HDE). The main result of this paper is the explicit determination of the HDE parameters (a,b,c) as functions of the automorphic data (k,t,q) and the spectral parameter lambda_K. As a foundational step toward the rigorous realization of the operator, we conclude with an analysis of the absolute convergence of the corresponding integral transform. This analysis establishes a region where the operator is well-defined and frames the problem of its global definition via analytic continuation, a task deferred to a subsequent investigation.</description>

      <title>Bohr sets in sumsets I: Compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.11997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact abelian group and $\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3$ be continuous endomorphisms on $G$. Under certain natural assumptions on the $\phi_i$'s, we prove the existence of Bohr sets in the sumset $\phi_1(A) + \phi_2(A) + \phi_3(A)$, where $A$ is either a set of positive Haar measure, or comes from a finite partition of $G$. The first result generalizes theorems of Bogolyubov and Bergelson-Ruzsa. As a variant of the second result, we show that for any partition $\mathbb{Z} = \bigcup_{i=1}^r A_i$, there exists an $i$ such that $A_i - A_i + sA_i$ contains a Bohr set for any $s \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{ 0 \}$. The latter is a step toward an open question of Katznelson and Ruzsa.</description>

      <title>The Hasse Principle for Geometric Variational Problems: An Illustration via Area-minimizing Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</description>
