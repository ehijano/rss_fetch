      <title>Achieving Distributed MIMO Performance with Repeater-Assisted Cellular Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G systems are being deployed all over the world and one key enabler of these systems is massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). This technology has brought large performance gains in terms of serving many users. Despite the possibility to further exploit the spatial domain, there are situations where it is not possible to offer more than a single, or a few, data streams per user and where cell-edge coverage is an issue due to the lack of enough efficient channel scatterers. Looking ahead, distributed MIMO systems, where the antennas are spread over a larger area, are investigated for next generation systems. However, distributed MIMO comes with many practical deployment issues, making it a big challenge to adopt. As another way forward, we envision repeater-assisted cellular massive MIMO, where repeaters are deployed to act as channel scatterers to increase the rank of the channel and provide macro diversity for improved coverage and reliability. After elaborating on the requirements and hardware aspects of repeaters that enable this vision, we demonstrate through simulations the potential of repeater-assisted cellular massive MIMO to achieve distributed MIMO performance. Following this, we discuss open questions and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Plug-in UL-CSI-Assisted Precoder Upsampling Approach in Cellular FDD Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring downlink channel state information (CSI) is crucial for optimizing performance in massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems operating under Frequency-Division Duplexing (FDD). Most cellular wireless communication systems employ codebook-based precoder designs, which offer advantages such as simpler, more efficient feedback mechanisms and reduced feedback overhead. Common codebook-based approaches include Type II and eType II precoding methods defined in the 3GPP standards. Feedback in these systems is typically standardized per subband (SB), allowing user equipment (UE) to select the optimal precoder from the codebook for each SB, thereby reducing feedback overhead. However, this subband-level feedback resolution may not suffice for frequency-selective channels. This paper addresses this issue by introducing an uplink CSI-assisted precoder upsampling module deployed at the gNodeB. This module upsamples SB-level precoders to resource block (RB)-level precoders, acting as a plug-in compatible with existing gNodeB or base stations.</description>

      <title>Patterned Beam Training: A Novel Low-Complexity and Low-Overhead Scheme for ELAA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) can provide higher spectral efficiency. However, the use of narrower beams for data transmission significantly increases the overhead associated with beam training. In this letter, we propose a novel patterned beam training (PBT) scheme characterized by its low overhead and complexity. This scheme requires only a single linear operation by both the base station and the user equipment to determine the optimal beam, reducing the training overhead to half or even less compared to traditional exhaustive search methods. Furthermore, We discuss the pattern design principles in detail and provide specific forms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the compared methods in terms of beam alignment accuracy and achieves a balance between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions and training overhead, making it a promising alternative.</description>

      <title>Optimizing 6G Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) via Expert Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is one of the core technologies of 6G, which combines sensing and communication functions into a single system. However, limited computing and storage resources make it impractical to combine multiple sensing models into a single device, constraining the system's function and performance. Therefore, this article proposes enhancing ISAC with the mixture of experts (MoE) architecture. Rigorously, we first investigate ISAC and MoE, including their concepts, advantages, and applications. Then, we explore how MoE can enhance ISAC from the perspectives of signal processing and network optimization. Building on this, we propose an MoE based ISAC framework, which uses a gating network to selectively activate multiple experts in handling sensing tasks under given communication conditions, thereby improving the overall performance. The case study demonstrates that the proposed framework can effectively increase the accuracy and robustness in detecting targets by using wireless communication signal, providing strong support for the practical deployment and applications of the ISAC system.</description>

      <title>Exploring Channel Estimation and Signal Detection for ODDM-based ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by providing reliable communications for high-mobility scenarios, in this letter, we investigate the channel estimation and signal detection in integrated sensing and communication~(ISAC) systems based on the orthogonal delay-Doppler multiplexing~(ODDM) modulation, which consists of a pulse-train that can achieve the orthogonality with respect to the resolution of the delay-Doppler~(DD) plane. To enhance the communication performance in the ODDM-based ISAC systems, we first propose a low-complexity approximation algorithm for channel estimation, which addresses the challenge of the high complexity from high resolution in the ODDM modulation, and achieves performance close to that of the maximum likelihood estimator scheme. Then, we employ the orthogonal approximate message-passing scheme to detect the symbols in the communication process based on the estimated channel information. Finally, simulation results show that the detection performance of ODDM is better than other multi-carrier modulation schemes. Specifically, the ODDM outperforms the orthogonal time frequency space scheme by 2.3 dB when the bit error ratio is $10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>Joint Detection and Classification of Communication and Radar Signals in Congested RF Environments Using YOLOv8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the application of YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art computer vision (CV) model, to the challenging problem of joint detection and classification of signals in a highly dynamic and congested RF environment. Using our synthetic RF datasets, we explored three different scenarios with congested communication and radar signals. In the first study, we applied YOLOv8 to detect and classify multiple digital modulation signals coexisting within a highly congested and dynamic spectral environment with significant overlap in both frequency and time domains. The trained model was able to achieve an impressive mean average precision (mAP) of 0.888 at an IoU threshold of 50%, signifying its robustness against spectral congestion. The second part of our research focuses on the detection and classification of multiple polyphase pulse radar signals, including Frank code and P1 through P4 codes. We were able to successfully train YOLOv8 to deliver a nearly perfect mAP50 score of 0.995 in a densely populated signal environment, further showcasing its capability in radar signal processing. In the last scenario, we demonstrated that the model can also be applied to the multi-target detection problem for continuous-wave radar. The synthetic datasets used in these experiments reflect a realistic mix of communication and radar signals with varying degrees of interference and congestion - a setup that has been overlooked by many past research efforts, which have primarily focused on ML-based classification of digital communication signal modulation schemes. Our study demonstrated the potential of advanced CV models in addressing spectrum sensing challenges in congested and dynamic RF environments involving both communication and radar signals. We hope our findings will spur further collaborative efforts to tackle the complexities of congested RF spectrum environments.</description>

      <title>Multipath Exploitation for Fluctuating Target Detection in RIS-Assisted ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems are typically deployed in multipath environments, which is usually deemed as a challenging issue for wireless communications. However, the multipath propagation can also provide extra illumination and observation perspectives for radar sensing, which offers spatial diversity gain for detecting targets with spatial radar cross-section (RCS) fluctuations. In this letter, we propose to utilize reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in ISAC systems to provide high-quality and controllable multipath propagation for improving the performance of fluctuating target detection and simultaneously enhancing the quality of communication services. To effectively exploit the spatial diversity offered by RIS-empowered multipath, the dual-functional transmit beamforming and the RIS reflection beamforming are jointly designed to maximize the expectation of radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To solve the resulting complex non-convex optimization problem, we develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm that utilizes majorization-minimization (MM) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithms. Simulation results illustrate the advantages of multipath exploitation and the proposed beamforming design algorithm for fluctuating target detection in RIS-assisted ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Wave Property Inspired Radio Environment Knowledge Construction and AI-based Verification for 6G Digital Twin Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the underlying foundation of a digital twin network (DTN), a digital twin channel (DTC) can accurately depict the process of radio propagation in the air interface to support the DTN-based 6G wireless network. Since radio propagation is affected by the environment, constructing the relationship between the environment and radio wave propagation is the key to improving the accuracy of DTC, and the construction method based on artificial intelligence (AI) is the most concentrated. However, in the existing methods, the environment information input into the neural network (NN) has many dimensions, and the correlation between the environment and the channel relationship is unclear, resulting in a highly complex relationship construction process. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a construction method of radio environment knowledge (REK) inspired by the electromagnetic wave property to quantify the contribution of radio propagation. Specifically, a range selection scheme for effective environment information based on random geometry is proposed to reduce the redundancy of environment information. We quantify the contribution of radio propagation reflection, diffraction and scatterer blockage using environment information and propose a flow chart of REK construction to replace the feature extraction process partially based on NN. To validate REK's effectiveness, we conduct a path loss prediction task based on a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) employing a simple two-layer convolutional structure. The results show that the accuracy of the range selection method reaches 90\%; the constructed REK maintains the prediction error of 0.3 and only needs 0.04 seconds of testing time, effectively reducing the network complexity.</description>

      <title>Detection of Acetone as a Gas Biomarker for Diabetes Based on Gas Sensor Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous development and improvement of medical services, there is a growing demand for improving diabetes diagnosis. Exhaled breath analysis, characterized by its speed, convenience, and non-invasive nature, is leading the trend in diagnostic development. Studies have shown that the acetone levels in the breath of diabetes patients are higher than normal, making acetone a basis for diabetes breath analysis. This provides a more readily accepted method for early diabetes prevention and monitoring. Addressing issues such as the invasive nature, disease transmission risks, and complexity of diabetes testing, this study aims to design a diabetes gas biomarker acetone detection system centered around a sensor array using gas sensors and pattern recognition algorithms. The research covers sensor selection, sensor preparation, circuit design, data acquisition and processing, and detection model establishment to accurately identify acetone. Titanium dioxide was chosen as the nano gas-sensitive material to prepare the acetone gas sensor, with data collection conducted using STM32. Filtering was applied to process the raw sensor data, followed by feature extraction using principal component analysis. A recognition model based on support vector machine algorithm was used for qualitative identification of gas samples, while a recognition model based on backpropagation neural network was employed for quantitative detection of gas sample concentrations. Experimental results demonstrated recognition accuracies of 96% and 97.5% for acetone-ethanol and acetone-methanol mixed gases, and 90% for ternary acetone, ethanol, and methanol mixed gases.</description>

      <title>Joint Frame Structure, Beamwidth, and Power Allocation for UAV-Aided Localization and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wireless sensors networks, integrating localization and communications techniques is crucial for efficient spectrum and hardware utilization. In this paper, we present a novel framework of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided localization and communication for ground node (GN), where the average spectral efficiency (SE) is used to reveal the intricate relationship among frame structure, channel estimation error, and localization accuracy. In particular, we first derive the lower bounds for channel estimation error and the three dimensional location prediction error. Leveraging these comprehensive analysis, we formulate a problem to maximize the average SE in UAV-GN communication, where the frame structure, beamwidth and power allocation are jointly optimized. Subsequently, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to address this non-convex problem with closed-form expressions for beamwidth and power allocation. Numerical results demonstrate that the performance of our proposed method can approach the upper bound with much lower complexity, and achieve over 70\% performance gain compared to non-localization benchmarks. Additionally, the analysis highlights the dominant impacts from the Doppler effect over noise on the average SE.</description>

      <title>Noise And Artifacts Elimination In ECG Signals Using Wavelet, Variational Mode Decomposition And Nonlocal Means Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals can frequently be affected by the introduction of noise and artifacts. Since these types of signal corruptions disrupt the accurate interpretation of ECG signals, noise and artifacts must be eliminated during the preprocessing phase. In this paper, we introduced a comprehensive pre-processing phase that eliminates motion artifacts and noise prior to detecting and extracting entirely corrupted ECG signal segments. The first method, denoted as the WLNH method, is constructed using wavelet multiresolution analysis (MRA), the Lillifors test, NLM, and a high-pass filter. The second method entails substituting the wavelet MRA decomposition with the variational mode decomposition (VMD) while retaining all other stages from the first method. This technique is denoted as the VLWNH. The two proposed methods differ from some existing methods in that they first employ the Lilliefors test to identify whether a component is white Gaussian noise and then utilize the High Pass Filter to eliminate motion anomalies. The simulation results show that the offered solutions are effective, particularly when dealing with white Gaussian noise and base-line wander (BW) noise.</description>

      <title>Comparison of 5G Performance Post-Merger between Two Network Operators Using Field Tests in Urban Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In late Q1/2023, DTAC and TRUE officially completed their merger. Consequently, this study was initiated to ascertain whether their respective 5G networks had been seamlessly integrated several months following the merger. The investigation involved conducting drive tests along two predefined routes within the urban areas of Bangkok, employing the G-NetTrack Pro tool for testing and data collection. Additionally, stationary tests were conducted in two crowded places using an application called Speedtest. Subsequently, an array of Quality of Service (QoS) metrics, including Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP), Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Download (DL), Upload (UL) speeds, and latency, were meticulously analyzed and presented. The findings of this study unveiled that, despite the successful completion of the DTAC and TRUE merger from a business standpoint, the technical integration of their respective 5G networks had not been finalized, although there were no significant differences between DTAC and TRUE for DL (p-value = 0.542) and UL (p-value = 0.090). Notably, significant differences were found between DTAC and TRUE for four metrics, including RSRP, RSRQ, SNR, and latency (p-values &lt; 0.05). Remarkably, roaming functionalities were still operational between the two networks.</description>

      <title>A time-to-digital converter with steady calibration through single-photon detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-to-Digital Converters (TDCs) are a crucial tool in a wide array of fields, in particular for quantum communication, where time taggers performance can severely affect the quality of the entire application. Nowadays, FPGA-based TDCs present a viable alternative to ASIC ones, once the nonlinear behaviour due to the intrinsic nature of the device is properly mitigated. To compensate said nonlinearities, a calibration procedure is required, usually based on an interpolation methods. Here we present the design and the demonstration of a TDC that is FPGA-based and showing a residual jitter of 27 ps, that is scalable for multichannel operation. The application in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is discussed with a unique calibration method based on the exploitation of single-photon detection that does not require to stop the data acquisition or to use any interpolation methods, thus increasing accuracy and removing data loss. The calibration was tested in a relevant environment, investigating the device behaviour between 5{\deg}C and 80{\deg}C. Moreover, our design is capable of continuously streaming up to 12 Mevents/s for up to ~1 week without the TDC overflowing.</description>

Against this backdrop, Edge Computing (EC) is an emerging paradigm that can address the shortcomings of traditional centralized Cloud Computing (CC). Its use is associated with improved performance, productivity, and security. Some of its use cases include smart grids, healthcare Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR). EC uses servers strategically placed near end users, reducing latency and proving to be particularly well-suited for time-sensitive IoT applications. It is expected to play a pivotal role in 6G and Industry 5.0. Within the IoT-edge environment, artificial intelligence (AI) plays an important role in automating decision and control, including but not limited to resource allocation activities, drawing inferences from large volumes of data, and enabling powerful security mechanisms. The use cases in the IoT-Edge-cloud environment tend to be complex resulting in large AI models, big datasets, and complex computations. This has led to researchers proposing techniques that partition data, tasks, models, or hybrid to achieve speed, efficiency, and accuracy of processing. This survey comprehensively explores the IoT-Edge-AI environment, application cases, and the partitioning techniques used. We categorize partitioning techniques and compare their performance. The survey concludes by identifying open research challenges in this domain.</description>

Abstract: The anticipated launch of the Sixth Generation (6G) of mobile technology by 2030 will mark a significant milestone in the evolution of wireless communication, ushering in a new era with advancements in technology and applications. 6G is expected to deliver ultra-high data rates and almost instantaneous communications, with three-dimensional coverage for everything, everywhere, and at any time. In the 6G Radio Access Networks (RANs) architecture, the Fronthaul connects geographically distributed Remote Units (RUs) to Distributed/Digital Units (DUs)pool. Among all possible solutions for implementing 6G fronthaul, optical technologies will remain crucial in supporting the 6G fronthaul, as they offer high-speed, low-latency, and reliable transmission capabilities to meet the 6G strict requirements. This survey provides an explanation of the 5G and future 6G optical fronthaul concept and presents a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art and future research directions in 6G optical fronthaul, highlighting the key technologies and research perspectives fundamental in designing fronthaul networks for 5G and future 6G. Additionally, it examines the benefits and drawbacks of each optical technology and its potential applications in 6G fronthaul networks. This paper aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and industry professionals about the current state and future prospects of 6G optical fronthaul technologies, facilitating the development of robust and efficient wireless networks of the future.</description>

      <title>Representation and De-interleaving of Mixtures of Hidden Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: De-interleaving of the mixtures of Hidden Markov Processes (HMPs) generally depends on its representation model. Existing representation models consider Markov chain mixtures rather than hidden Markov, resulting in the lack of robustness to non-ideal situations such as observation noise or missing observations. Besides, de-interleaving methods utilize a search-based strategy, which is time-consuming. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel representation model and corresponding de-interleaving methods for the mixtures of HMPs. At first, a generative model for representing the mixtures of HMPs is designed. Subsequently, the de-interleaving process is formulated as a posterior inference for the generative model. Secondly, an exact inference method is developed to maximize the likelihood of the complete data, and two approximate inference methods are developed to maximize the evidence lower bound by creating tractable structures. Then, a theoretical error probability lower bound is derived using the likelihood ratio test, and the algorithms are shown to get reasonably close to the bound. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods are highly effective and robust for non-ideal situations, outperforming baseline methods on simulated and real-life data.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effectiveness Analysis and Design of Cost-Efficient Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) has recently attracted much attention, attributed to its potential to deliver uniform service quality. However, the adoption of a cell-free architecture raises concerns about the high implementation costs associated with deploying numerous distributed access points (APs) and the need for fronthaul network installation. To ensure the sustainability of next-generation wireless networks, it is crucial to improve cost-effectiveness, alongside achieving high performance. To address this, we conduct a cost analysis of cell-free massive MIMO and build a unified model with varying numbers of antennas per AP. Our objective is to explore whether employing multi-antenna APs could reduce system costs while maintaining performance. The analysis and evaluation result in the identification of a cost-effective design for cell-free massive MIMO, providing valuable insights for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Lens-Type Redirective Intelligent Surfaces for Multi-User MIMO Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the idea of using redirective reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RedRIS) to overcome many of the challenges associated with the conventional reflective RIS. We develop a framework for jointly optimizing the switching matrix of the lens-type RedRIS ports along with the active precoding matrix at the base station (BS) and the receive scaling factor. A joint non-convex optimization problem is formulated under the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion with the aim to maximize the spectral efficiency of each user. In the single-cell scenario, the optimum active precoding matrix at the multi-antenna BS and the receive scaling factor are found in closed-form by applying Lagrange optimization, while the optimal switching matrix of the lens-type RedRIS is obtained by means of a newly developed alternating optimization algorithm. We then extend the framework to the multi-cell scenario with single-antenna base stations that are aided by the same lens-type RedRIS. We further present two methods for reducing the number of effective connections of the RedRIS ports that result in appreciable overhead savings while enhancing the robustness of the system. The proposed RedRIS-based schemes are gauged against conventional reflective RIS-aided systems under both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI). The simulation results show the superiority of the proposed schemes in terms of overall throughput while incurring much less control overhead.</description>

      <title>Reflection Map Construction: Enhancing and Speeding Up Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00563v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an indoor localization method using fixed reflector objects within the environment, leveraging a base station (BS) equipped with Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Time of Arrival (ToA) measurement capabilities. The localization process includes two phases. In the offline phase, we identify effective reflector points within a specific region using significantly fewer test points than typical methods. In the online phase, we solve a maximization problem to locate users based on BS measurements and offline phase information. We introduce the reflectivity parameter (\(n_r\)), which quantifies the typical number of first-order reflection paths from the transmitter to the receiver, demonstrating its impact on localization accuracy. The log-scale accuracy ratio (\(R_a\)) is defined as the logarithmic function of the localization area divided by the localization ambiguity area, serving as an accuracy indicator. We show that in scenarios where the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) approaches infinity, without a line of sight (LoS) link, \(R_a\) is upper-bounded by \(n_r \log_{2}\left(1 + \frac{\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_A)}{\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_{\epsilon}(\mathcal{M}_s))}\right)\). Here, \(\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_A)\) and \(\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_{\epsilon}(\mathcal{M}_s))\) represent the areas of the localization region and the area containing all reflector points with a probability of at least \(1 - \epsilon\), respectively.</description>

      <title>An Unsupervised Approach for Periodic Source Detection in Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of periodic patterns of interest within noisy time series data plays a critical role in various tasks, spanning from health monitoring to behavior analysis. Existing learning techniques often rely on labels or clean versions of signals for detecting the periodicity, and those employing self-supervised learning methods are required to apply proper augmentations, which is already challenging for time series and can result in collapse -- all representations collapse to a single point due to strong augmentations. In this work, we propose a novel method to detect the periodicity in time series without the need for any labels or requiring tailored positive or negative data generation mechanisms with specific augmentations. We mitigate the collapse issue by ensuring the learned representations retain information from the original samples without imposing any random variance constraints on the batch. Our experiments in three time series tasks against state-of-the-art learning methods show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms prior works, achieving performance improvements of more than 45--50\%, showing its effectiveness.

      <title>A Gaussian Process-based Streaming Algorithm for Prediction of Time Series With Regimes and Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online prediction of time series under regime switching is a widely studied problem in the literature, with many celebrated approaches. Using the non-parametric flexibility of Gaussian processes, the recently proposed INTEL algorithm provides a product of experts approach to online prediction of time series under possible regime switching, including the special case of outliers. This is achieved by adaptively combining several candidate models, each reporting their predictive distribution at time $t$. However, the INTEL algorithm uses a finite context window approximation to the predictive distribution, the computation of which scales cubically with the maximum lag, or otherwise scales quartically with exact predictive distributions. We introduce LINTEL, which uses the exact filtering distribution at time $t$ with constant-time updates, making the time complexity of the streaming algorithm optimal. We additionally note that the weighting mechanism of INTEL is better suited to a mixture of experts approach, and propose a fusion policy based on arithmetic averaging for LINTEL. We show experimentally that our proposed approach is over five times faster than INTEL under reasonable settings with better quality predictions.</description>

      <title>Log-Scale Quantization in Distributed First-Order Methods: Gradient-based Learning from Distributed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized strategies are of interest for learning from large-scale data over networks. This paper studies learning over a network of geographically distributed nodes/agents subject to quantization. Each node possesses a private local cost function, collectively contributing to a global cost function, which the proposed methodology aims to minimize. In contrast to many existing literature, the information exchange among nodes is quantized. We adopt a first-order computationally-efficient distributed optimization algorithm (with no extra inner consensus loop) that leverages node-level gradient correction based on local data and network-level gradient aggregation only over nearby nodes. This method only requires balanced networks with no need for stochastic weight design. It can handle log-scale quantized data exchange over possibly time-varying and switching network setups. We analyze convergence over both structured networks (for example, training over data-centers) and ad-hoc multi-agent networks (for example, training over dynamic robotic networks). Through analysis and experimental validation, we show that (i) structured networks generally result in a smaller optimality gap, and (ii) logarithmic quantization leads to smaller optimality gap compared to uniform quantization.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication Exploiting Prior Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the hybrid beamforming design for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) with hybrid analog-digital transmit antenna arrays sends dual-functional signals to communicate with a multi-antenna user and simultaneously sense the location information of a point target based on the reflected echo signals. Specifically, we aim to sense the target's unknown and random angle information by exploiting its prior distribution information, with posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) employed as the sensing performance metric. First, we consider a sensing-only case and study the hybrid beamforming optimization to minimize the sensing PCRB. We analytically prove that hybrid beamforming can achieve the same performance as the optimized digital beamforming as long as the number of radio frequency (RF) chains is larger than 1. Then, we propose a convex relaxation based algorithm for the hybrid beamforming design with a single RF chain. Next, we study the hybrid beamforming optimization to minimize the PCRB subject to a communication rate target. Due to the intractability of the exact PCRB expression, we replace it with a tight upper bound. Although this problem is still non-convex and challenging to solve, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm for finding a high-quality suboptimal solution based on the feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation (FPP-SCA) method. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid beamforming design.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communications: the New Paradigm Behind Beyond 5G Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Each generation of cellular networks is characterized by its distinct capabilities and innovations, which reflect the significant milestones reached with each new release. 5G has made substantial progress through the deployment of advanced encoding and modulation techniques, nearly reaching the Shannon physical capacity limit. In light of the requirements of Beyond-5G technologies, there is the need of a paradigm shift in the development of communication systems.
  Recent developments in the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enabled the deployment of tools with high abstraction capabilities, relevant for feature extraction processes and End-to-End system optimization tasks. In this context, Semantic Communications has emerged as a novel information transmission system, with AI as one of the core components in its implementation. This communication paradigm relies on the extraction and transmission of the "semantic meaning" of the source information using AI techniques, diverging from the conventional systems that primarily focus on ensuring the successful reception of the transmitted bits.
  The purpose of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental concepts underlying Semantic Communications, including Shannon's Information Theory, classical and modern theories of semantic information, and an examination of the framework and system design of Semantic Communications. Additionally, recent implementations are reviwed, including the analysis of Semantic Communications systems according to the information object transmitted and the objective of the information transmission. Moreover, an in-depth study of prototypes and demonstrations are presented, supporting the viability of the Semantic Communications systems. Finally, some of the most relevant open challenges are detailed, highlighting open research questions to be pursued in Semantic Communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring sufficiently accurate models is crucial in target tracking systems. If the assumed models deviate too much from the truth, the tracking performance might be severely degraded. While the models are in general defined using multivariate conditions, the measures used to validate them are most often scalar-valued. In this paper, we propose matrix-valued measures for both offline and online assessment of target tracking systems. Recent results from Wishart statistics, and approximations thereof, are adapted and it is shown how these can be incorporated to infer statistical properties for the eigenvalues of the proposed measures. In addition, we relate these results to the statistics of the baseline measures. Finally, the applicability of the proposed measures are demonstrated using two important problems in target tracking: (i) distributed track fusion design; and (ii) filter model mismatch detection.</description>

      <title>3D Trajectory Design for Energy-constrained Aerial CRNs Under Probabilistic LoS Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been attracting significant attention because there is a high probability of line-of-sight links being obtained between them and terrestrial nodes in high-rise urban areas. In this work, we investigate cognitive radio networks (CRNs) by jointly designing three-dimensional (3D) trajectory, the transmit power of the UAV, and user scheduling. Considering the UAV's onboard energy consumption, an optimization problem is formulated in which the average achievable rate of the considered system is maximized by jointly optimizing the UAV's 3D trajectory, transmission power, and user scheduling. Due to the non-convex optimization problem, a lower bound on the average achievable rate is utilized to reduce the complexity of the solution. Subsequently, the original optimization problem is decoupled into four subproblems by using block coordinate descent, and each subproblem is transformed into manageable convex optimization problems by introducing slack variables and successive convex approximation. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that the 3D trajectories of UAVs can enhance the average achievable rate of aerial CRNs.</description>

      <title>Performance Trade-off of Integrated Sensing and Communications for Multi-User Backscatter Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the performance trade-off in a multi-user backscatter communication (BackCom) system for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), where the multi-antenna ISAC transmitter sends excitation signals to power multiple single-antenna passive backscatter devices (BD), and the multi-antenna ISAC receiver performs joint sensing (localization) and communication tasks based on the backscattered signals from all BDs. Specifically, the localization performance is measured by the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) on the transmission delay and direction of arrival (DoA) of the backscattered signals, whose closed-form expression is obtained by deriving the corresponding Fisher information matrix (FIM), and the communication performance is characterized by the sum transmission rate of all BDs. Then, to characterize the trade-off between the localization and communication performances, the CRB minimization problem with the communication rate constraint is formulated, and is shown to be non-convex in general. By exploiting the hidden convexity, we propose an approach that combines fractional programming (FP) and Schur complement techniques to transform the original problem into an equivalent convex form. Finally, numerical results reveal the trade-off between the CRB and sum transmission rate achieved by our proposed method.</description>

      <title>PolyCLEAN: When H\"ogbom meets Bayes -- Fast Super-Resolution Imaging with Bayesian MAP Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: We address two issues for the adoption of convex optimization in radio interferometric imaging. First, a method for a fine resolution setup is proposed which scales naturally in terms of memory usage and reconstruction speed. Second, a new tool to localize a region of uncertainty is developed, paving the way for quantitative imaging in radio interferometry. Methods: The classical $\ell_1$ penalty is used to turn the inverse problem into a sparsity-promoting optimization. For efficient implementation, the so-called Frank-Wolfe algorithm is used together with a \textit{polyatomic} refinement. The algorithm naturally produces sparse images at each iteration, leveraged to reduce memory and computational requirements. In that regard, PolyCLEAN reproduces the numerical behavior of CLEAN while guaranteeing that it solves the minimization problem of interest. Additionally, we introduce the dual certificate image, which appears as a numerical byproduct of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. This image is proposed as a tool for uncertainty quantification on the location of the recovered sources. Results: PolyCLEAN demonstrates good scalability performance, in particular for fine-resolution grids. On simulations, the Python-based implementation is competitive with the fast numerically-optimized CLEAN solver. This acceleration does not affect image reconstruction quality: PolyCLEAN images are consistent with CLEAN-obtained ones for both point sources and diffuse emission recovery. We also highlight PolyCLEAN reconstruction capabilities on observed radio measurements. Conclusions: PolyCLEAN can be considered as an alternative to CLEAN in the radio interferometric imaging pipeline, as it enables the use of Bayesian priors without impacting the scalability and numerical performance of the imaging method.</description>

      <title>CE-NAS: An End-to-End Carbon-Efficient Neural Architecture Search Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach to neural architecture search (NAS) that aims to increase carbon efficiency for the model design process. The proposed framework CE-NAS addresses the key challenge of high carbon cost associated with NAS by exploring the carbon emission variations of energy and energy differences of different NAS algorithms. At the high level, CE-NAS leverages a reinforcement-learning agent to dynamically adjust GPU resources based on carbon intensity, predicted by a time-series transformer, to balance energy-efficient sampling and energy-intensive evaluation tasks. Furthermore, CE-NAS leverages a recently proposed multi-objective optimizer to effectively reduce the NAS search space. We demonstrate the efficacy of CE-NAS in lowering carbon emissions while achieving SOTA results for both NAS datasets and open-domain NAS tasks. For example, on the HW-NasBench dataset, CE-NAS reduces carbon emissions by up to 7.22X while maintaining a search efficiency comparable to vanilla NAS. For open-domain NAS tasks, CE-NAS achieves SOTA results with 97.35% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 1.68M parameters and a carbon consumption of 38.53 lbs of CO2. On ImageNet, our searched model achieves 80.6% top-1 accuracy with a 0.78 ms TensorRT latency using FP16 on NVIDIA V100, consuming only 909.86 lbs of CO2, making it comparable to other one-shot-based NAS baselines.</description>

      <title>Enabling ASR for Low-Resource Languages: A Comprehensive Dataset Creation Approach</title>

Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have significantly improved, especially in languages with a vast amount of transcribed speech data. However, ASR systems tend to perform poorly for low-resource languages with fewer resources, such as minority and regional languages. This study introduces a novel pipeline designed to generate ASR training datasets from audiobooks, which typically feature a single transcript associated with hours-long audios. The common structure of these audiobooks poses a unique challenge due to the extensive length of audio segments, whereas optimal ASR training requires segments ranging from 4 to 15 seconds. To address this, we propose a method for effectively aligning audio with its corresponding text and segmenting it into lengths suitable for ASR training. Our approach simplifies data preparation for ASR systems in low-resource languages and demonstrates its application through a case study involving the Armenian language. Our method, which is "portable" to many low-resource languages, not only mitigates the issue of data scarcity but also enhances the performance of ASR models for underrepresented languages.</description>

Abstract: The calibration of sensors comprising inertial measurement units is crucial for reliable and accurate navigation. Such calibration is usually performed with specialized expensive rotary tables or requires sophisticated signal processing based on iterative minimization of nonlinear functions, which is prone to get stuck at local minima. We propose a novel calibration algorithm based on principal component analysis. The algorithm results in a closed-form formula for the sensor sensitivity axes and scale factors. We illustrate the proposed algorithm with simulation experiments, in which we assess the calibration accuracy in the case of calibration of a system consisting of 12 single-axis gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Satellite-borne Passive Radiometry and Terrestrial NextG Wireless Networks in the Restricted L-Band</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of active wireless communications technologies has fostered research on spectrum coexistence worldwide. One idea that is gaining attention is sharing frequency bands solely devoted to passive applications, such as passive remote sensing. One such option is the 27 MHz L-band spectrum from 1.400 to 1.427 GHz. Active wireless transmissions are prohibited in this passive band due to radio regulations aimed at preventing Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) on highly sensitive passive radiometry instruments. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), is a recent space-based remote sensing mission that passively scans the Earth's electromagnetic emissions in this 27 MHz band to assess soil moisture on a global scale periodically. In this paper, leveraging stochastic geometry, we assess the feasibility of using this passive band for the downlink (base station to user equipment) of a large-scale terrestrial NextG wireless network exposed to SMAP, while ensuring that the error induced on SMAP's measurements due to RFI is below a given threshold. Although the methodology established here is based on SMAP's specifications, it is adaptable to various passive sensing satellites regardless of their orbits or operating frequencies.</description>

Abstract: Automatic and precise fitness activity recognition can be beneficial in aspects from promoting a healthy lifestyle to personalized preventative healthcare. While IMUs are currently the prominent fitness tracking modality, through iMove, we show bio-impedence can help improve IMU-based fitness tracking through sensor fusion and contrastive learning.To evaluate our methods, we conducted an experiment including six upper body fitness activities performed by ten subjects over five days to collect synchronized data from bio-impedance across two wrists and IMU on the left wrist.The contrastive learning framework uses the two modalities to train a better IMU-only classification model, where bio-impedance is only required at the training phase, by which the average Macro F1 score with the input of a single IMU was improved by 3.22 \% reaching 84.71 \% compared to the 81.49 \% of the IMU baseline model. We have also shown how bio-impedance can improve human activity recognition (HAR) directly through sensor fusion, reaching an average Macro F1 score of 89.57 \% (two modalities required for both training and inference) even if Bio-impedance alone has an average macro F1 score of 75.36 \%, which is outperformed by IMU alone. In addition, similar results were obtained in an extended study on lower body fitness activity classification, demonstrating the generalisability of our approach.Our findings underscore the potential of sensor fusion and contrastive learning as valuable tools for advancing fitness activity recognition, with bio-impedance playing a pivotal role in augmenting the capabilities of IMU-based systems.</description>

      <title>Multiobject Tracking for Thresholded Cell Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many multiobject tracking applications, including radar and sonar tracking, after prefiltering the received signal, measurement data is typically structured in cells. The cells, e.g., represent different range and bearing values. However, conventional multiobject tracking methods use so-called point measurements. Point measurements are provided by a preprocessing stage that applies a threshold or detector and breaks up the cell's structure by converting cell indexes into, e.g., range and bearing measurements. We here propose a Bayesian multiobject tracking method that processes measurements that have been thresholded but are still cell-structured. We first derive a likelihood function that systematically incorporates an adjustable detection threshold which makes it possible to control the number of cell measurements. We then propose a Poisson Multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter based on the likelihood function for cell measurements. Furthermore, we establish a link to the conventional point measurement model by deriving the likelihood function for point measurements with amplitude information (AM) and discuss the PMB filter that uses point measurements with AM. Our numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method that relies on thresholded cell measurements compared to the conventional multiobject tracking based on point measurements with and without AM.</description>

      <title>Active Sensing for Multiuser Beam Tracking with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a beam tracking problem in which an access point (AP), in collaboration with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), dynamically adjusts its downlink beamformers and the reflection pattern at the RIS in order to maintain reliable communications with multiple mobile user equipments (UEs). Specifically, the mobile UEs send uplink pilots to the AP periodically during the channel sensing intervals, the AP then adaptively configures the beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent data transmission based on the received pilots. This is an active sensing problem, because channel sensing involves configuring the RIS coefficients during the pilot stage and the optimal sensing strategy should exploit the trajectory of channel state information (CSI) from previously received pilots. Analytical solution to such an active sensing problem is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing a recurrent neural network (RNN) to automatically summarize the time-varying CSI obtained from the periodically received pilots into state vectors. These state vectors are then mapped to the AP beamformers and RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent downlink data transmissions, as well as the RIS reflection coefficients for the next round of uplink channel sensing. The mappings from the state vectors to the downlink beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for both channel sensing and downlink data transmission are performed using graph neural networks (GNNs) to account for the interference among the UEs. Simulations demonstrate significant and interpretable performance improvement of the proposed approach over the existing data-driven methods with nonadaptive channel sensing schemes.</description>

      <title>Spatial Impulse Response Analysis and Ensemble Learning for Efficient Precision Level Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an innovative method for determining the fill level of containers, such as trash cans, addressing a critical aspect of waste management. The method combines spatial impulse response analysis with machine learning (ML) techniques, offering a unique and effective approach for sound-based classification that can be extended to various domains beyond waste management. By employing a buzzer-generated sine sweep signal, we create a distinctive signature specific to the fill level of the waste container. This signature, once accurately decoded, is then interpreted by a specially developed ensemble learning algorithm. Our approach achieves a classification accuracy of over 90% when implemented locally on a development board, optimizing operational efficiencies and eliminating the need to delegate complex classification tasks to external entities. Using low-cost and energy-efficient hardware components, our method offers a cost-effective approach that contributes to sustainable and efficient waste management practices, providing a reliable and locally deployable solution.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Wideband Beamforming for Extremely Large Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The natural integration of extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) and terahertz (THz) communications can potentially achieve Tbps data rates in 6G networks. However, due to the extremely large array aperture and wide bandwidth, a new phenomenon called "near-field beam split" emerges. This phenomenon causes beams at different frequencies to focus on distinct physical locations, leading to a significant gain loss of beamforming. To address this challenging problem, we first harness a piecewise-far-field channel model to approximate the complicated near-field wideband channel. In this model, the entire large array is partitioned into several small sub-arrays. While the wireless channel's phase discrepancy across the entire array is modeled as near-field spherical, the phase discrepancy within each sub-array is approximated as far-field planar. Built on this approximation, a phase-delay focusing (PDF) method employing delay phase precoding (DPP) architecture is proposed. Our PDF method could compensate for the intra-array far-field phase discrepancy and the inter-array near-field phase discrepancy via the joint control of phase shifters and time delayers, respectively. Theoretical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed PDF method in mitigating the near-field beam split effect.Finally, we define and derive a novel metric termed the "effective Rayleigh distance" by the evaluation of beamforming gain loss. Compared to classical Rayleigh distance, the effective Rayleigh distance is more accurate in determining the near-field range for practical communications.</description>

      <title>Deep Optimal Transport for Domain Adaptation on SPD Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.05745v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The machine learning community has shown increasing interest in addressing the domain adaptation problem on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds. This interest is primarily driven by the complexities of neuroimaging data generated from brain signals, which often exhibit shifts in data distribution across recording sessions. These neuroimaging data, represented by signal covariance matrices, possess the mathematical properties of symmetry and positive definiteness. However, applying conventional domain adaptation methods is challenging because these mathematical properties can be disrupted when operating on covariance matrices. In this study, we introduce a novel geometric deep learning-based approach utilizing optimal transport on SPD manifolds to manage discrepancies in both marginal and conditional distributions between the source and target domains. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in three cross-session brain-computer interface scenarios and provide visualized results for further insights. The GitHub repository of this study can be accessed at https://github.com/GeometricBCI/Deep-Optimal-Transport-for-Domain-Adaptation-on-SPD-Manifolds.</description>

      <title>Secure SWIPT in the Multiuser STAR-RIS Aided MISO Rate Splitting Downlink</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) have emerged as a novel technology that provides 360 coverage and new degrees-of-freedom (DoFs). They are also capable of manipulating signal propagation and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). This paper introduces a novel STAR-RIS-aided secure SWIPT system for downlink multiple input single output rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) networks. The transmitter concurrently communicates with the information receivers (IRs) and sends energy to untrusted energy receivers (UERs). The UERs are also capable of wiretapping the IR streams. We assume that the channel state information (CSI) of the IRs is known at the information transmitter, but only imperfect CSI for the UERs is available at the energy transmitter. By exploiting RSMA, the base station splits the messages of the IRs into common and private parts. The former is encoded into a common stream that can be decoded by all IRs, while the private messages are individually decoded by their respective IRs. We find the precoders and STAR-RIS configuration that maximizes the achievable worst-case sum secrecy rate of the IRs under a total transmit power constraint, a sum energy constraint for the UERs, and subject to constraints on the transmission and reflection coefficients. The formulated problem is non-convex and has intricately coupled variables. To tackle this challenge, a suboptimal two-step iterative algorithm based on the sequential parametric convex approximation method is proposed. Simulations demonstrate that the RSMA-based algorithm implemented with a STAR-RIS enhances both the rate of confidential information transmission and the total spectral efficiency. Furthermore, our method surpasses the performance of both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-OMA (NOMA).</description>

Abstract: Massive MIMO OFDM waveforms help support a large number of users in the same time-frequency resource and also provide significant array gain for uplink reception in cellular systems. However, channel estimation in such large antenna systems can be tricky as pilot assignment for multiple users becomes more challenging with increasing number of users. Additionally, the pilot overhead especially for wideband rapidly changing channels can diminish the system throughput quite significantly. In this paper, we propose an iterative matrix decomposition algorithm for the blind demodulation of massive MIMO OFDM signals without using any pilots. This new decomposition technique provides estimates of both the user symbols and the user channel in the frequency domain simultaneously (to a scaling factor) without any pilots. We discuss methods for finding the appropriate initial points for the algorithm that ensure its convergence in different types of wireless channels. We also propose new methods for resolving the scaling factor in the estimated signal that do not increase pilot overhead. We show how the method can be adapted to both single-user and multi-user systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the lack of pilots does not affect the error performance of the proposed algorithm when compared to the conventional pilot-based channel estimation and equalization methods across a wide range of channels for both single and multi-user cases. We also demonstrate techniques to reduce the complexity of the estimation algorithm over multiple OFDM symbols in a 5G MIMO system by leveraging the temporal correlations in the channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a promising approach to tackling power allocation problems in wireless networks. Since unpaired transmitters and receivers are often spatially distant, the distance-based threshold is proposed to reduce the computation time by excluding or including the channel state information in GNNs. In this paper, we are the first to introduce a neighbour-based threshold approach to GNNs to reduce the time complexity. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of both distance-based and neighbour-based thresholds and provide recommendations for selecting the appropriate value in different communication channel scenarios. We design the corresponding neighbour-based Graph Neural Networks (N-GNN) with the aim of allocating transmit powers to maximise the network throughput. Our results show that our proposed N-GNN offer significant advantages in terms of reducing time complexity while preserving strong performance and generalisation capacity. Besides, we show that by choosing a suitable threshold, the time complexity is reduced from O(|V|^2) to O(|V|), where |V| is the total number of transceiver pairs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transmit Antenna Deployment and Power Allocation for Wireless Power Supply in an Indoor Space</title>

Abstract: As Internet of Things (IoT) devices proliferate, sustainable methods for powering them are becoming indispensable. The wireless provision of power enables battery-free operation and is crucial for complying with weight and size restrictions. For the energy harvesting (EH) components of these devices to be small, a high operating frequency is necessary. In conjunction with a large transmit antenna, the receivers may be located in the radiating near-field (Fresnel) region, e.g., in indoor scenarios. In this paper, we propose a wireless power transfer (WPT) system ensuring reliable supply of power to an arbitrary number of mobile, low-power, and single-antenna receivers, whose locations in a three-dimensional cuboid room are unknown. A max-min optimisation problem is formulated to determine the optimal transmit power distribution. We rigorously prove that the optimal transmit power distribution's support has a lower dimensionality than its domain and thus, the employment of a continuous aperture antenna, utilised in Holographic MIMO (HMIMO), is unnecessary in the context of the considered WPT problem. Indeed, deploying a discrete transmit antenna architecture, i.e., a transmit antenna array, is sufficient and our proposed solution provides the optimal transmit antenna deployment and power allocation. Moreover, for a one-dimensional transmit antenna architecture, a finite number of transmit antennas is proven to be optimal. The proposed optimal solution is validated through computer simulations. Our simulation results indicate that the optimal transmit antenna architecture requires a finite number of transmit antennas and depends on the geometry of the environment and the dimensionality of the transmit antenna array.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies Flag sequences for low-complexity delay-Doppler estimation by exploiting their distinctive peak-curtain ambiguity functions (AFs). Unlike the existing Flag sequence designs that are limited to prime lengths and periodic auto-AFs, we aim to design Flag sequence sets of arbitrary lengths with low (nontrivial) periodic/aperiodic auto- and cross-AFs. Since every Flag sequence consists of a Curtain sequence and a Peak sequence, we first investigate the algebraic design of Curtain sequence sets of arbitrary lengths. Our proposed design gives rise to novel Curtain sequence sets with ideal curtain auto-AFs and zero/near-zero cross-AFs within the delay-Doppler zone of operation. Leveraging these Curtain sequence sets, two optimization problems are formulated to minimize the Weighted Integrated masked Sidelobe Level (WImSL) of the Flag sequence set. Accelerated Parallel Partially Majorization-Minimization Algorithms are proposed to jointly optimize the transmit Flag sequences and symmetric/asymmetric reference sequences stored in the receiver. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed Flag sequences lead to improved WImSL and peak-to-max-masked-sidelobe ratio compared with the existing Flag sequences. Additionally, our Flag sequences under the Flag method exhibit Mean Squared Errors that approach the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound and the Sampling Bound at high signal-to-noise power ratios.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph-MLP: Learning on Hypergraphs without Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are vital in modelling data with higher-order relations containing more than two entities, gaining prominence in machine learning and signal processing. Many hypergraph neural networks leverage message passing over hypergraph structures to enhance node representation learning, yielding impressive performances in tasks like hypergraph node classification. However, these message-passing-based models face several challenges, including oversmoothing as well as high latency and sensitivity to structural perturbations at inference time. To tackle those challenges, we propose an alternative approach where we integrate the information about hypergraph structures into training supervision without explicit message passing, thus also removing the reliance on it at inference. Specifically, we introduce Hypergraph-MLP, a novel learning framework for hypergraph-structured data, where the learning model is a straightforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) supervised by a loss function based on a notion of signal smoothness on hypergraphs. Experiments on hypergraph node classification tasks demonstrate that Hypergraph-MLP achieves competitive performance compared to existing baselines, and is considerably faster and more robust against structural perturbations at inference.</description>

      <title>Assessment of cryptographic approaches for a quantum-resistant Galileo OSNMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing becomes more of a reality as time passes, bringing several cybersecurity challenges. Modern cryptography is based on the computational complexity of specific mathematical problems, but as new quantum-based computers appear, classical methods might not be enough to secure communications. In this paper, we analyse the state of the Galileo Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA) to overcome these new threats. This analysis and its assessment have been performed using OSNMA documentation, reviewing the available Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms competing in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardization process, and studying the possibility of its implementation in the Galileo service. The main barrier to adopting the PQC approach is the size of both the signature and the key. The analysis shows that OSNMA is not yet prepared to face the quantum threat, and a significant change would be required. This work concludes by assessing different temporal countermeasures that can be implemented to sustain the system's integrity in the short term.</description>

      <title>Secure Spatial Signal Design for ISAC in a Cell-Free MIMO Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a cell-free multiple-input multiple-output network equipped with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) access points (APs). The distributed APs are used to jointly serve the communication needs of user equipments (UEs) while sensing a target, assumed to be an eavesdropper (Eve). To increase the system's robustness towards said Eve, we develop an ISAC waveform model that includes artificial noise (AN) aimed at degrading the Eve channel quality. The central processing unit receives the observations from each AP and calculates the optimal precoding and AN covariance matrices by solving a semi-definite relaxation of a constrained Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) minimization problem. Simulation results highlight an underlying trade-off between sensing and communication performances: in particular, the UEs signal-to-noise and interference ratio and the maximum Eve's signal to noise ratio are directly proportional to the CRB. Furthermore, the optimal AN covariance matrix is rank-1 and has a peak in the eve's direction, leading to a surprising inverse-proportionality between the UEs-Eve distance and optimal-CRB magnitude.</description>

      <title>Regime Learning for Differentiable Particle Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentiable particle filters are an emerging class of models that combine sequential Monte Carlo techniques with the flexibility of neural networks to perform state space inference. This paper concerns the case where the system may switch between a finite set of state-space models, i.e. regimes. No prior approaches effectively learn both the individual regimes and the switching process simultaneously. In this paper, we propose the neural network based regime learning differentiable particle filter (RLPF) to address this problem. We further design a training procedure for the RLPF and other related algorithms. We demonstrate competitive performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art algorithms on a pair of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Motor Imagery Task Alters Dynamics of Human Body Posture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motor Imagery (MI) is gaining traction in both rehabilitation and sports settings, but its immediate influence on human postural control is not yet clearly understood. The focus of this study is to examine the effects of MI on the dynamics of the Center of Pressure (COP), a crucial metric for evaluating postural stability. In the experiment, thirty healthy young adults participated in four different scenarios: normal standing with both open and closed eyes, and kinesthetic motor imagery focused on mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) sway movements. A mathematical model was developed to characterize the nonlinear dynamics of the COP and to assess the impact of MI on these dynamics. Our results show a statistically significant increase (p-value&lt;0.05) in variables such as COP path length and Long-Range Correlation (LRC) during MI compared to the closed-eye and normal standing conditions. These observations align well with psycho-neuromuscular theory, which suggests that imagining a specific movement activates neural pathways, consequently affecting postural control. This study presents compelling evidence that motor imagery not only has a quantifiable impact on COP dynamics but also that changes in the Center of Pressure (COP) are directionally consistent with the imagined movements. This finding holds significant implications for the field of rehabilitation science, suggesting that motor imagery could be strategically utilized to induce targeted postural adjustments. Nonetheless, additional research is required to fully understand the complex mechanisms that underlie this relationship and to corroborate these results across a more diverse set of populations.</description>
