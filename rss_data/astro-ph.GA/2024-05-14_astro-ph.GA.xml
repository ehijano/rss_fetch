      <title>The Sunburst Arc with JWST: II. Observations of an Eta Carinae Analog at $z=2.37$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Godzilla" is a peculiar object within the gravitationally lensed Sunburst Arc at $z=2.37$. Despite being very bright, it appears in only one of the twelve lensed images of the source galaxy, and shows exotic spectroscopic properties not found elsewhere in the galaxy. We use JWST's unique combination of spatial resolution and spectroscopic sensitivity to provide a unified, coherent explanation of the physical nature of Godzilla. We measure fluxes and kinematic properties of rest-optical emission lines in Godzilla and surrounding regions. Using standard line ratio-based diagnostic methods in combination with NIRCam imaging and ground based rest-UV spectra, we characterize Godzilla and its surroundings. We find that Godzilla is most likely an extremely magnified, non-erupting LBV star with dense gas condensations in close proximity. Among around 60 detected lines, we find a cascade of strong O I lines pumped by intense Ly$\beta$ emission, as well as Ly$\alpha$-pumped rest-optical Fe II lines, reminiscent of the Weigelt blobs in the local LBV star Eta Carinae. Godzilla is surrounded by dusty, inhomogeneous gas common to massive, evolved stars. Spectra and images of Godzilla and adjacent objects and the detection of a low-surface brightness foreground galaxy in the NIRCam data support the interpretation that Godzilla is a stellar-scale object extremely magnified by alignment with lensing caustics. To explain the dusty surroundings, strong [Ne III] and line kinematics simultaneously, we argue that Godzilla is a post-eruption LBV accompanied by a hotter companion and/or gas condensations exposed to more intense radiation compared to the Weigelt blobs. We expect periodic spectroscopic variations if Godzilla is a binary system. If Godzilla is confirmed to be an LBV star, it expands the distance to the furthest known LBV from a dozen Mpc to several Gpc.</description>

      <title>A Complete 16 $\mu$m selected Galaxy Sample at $z \sim 1$. II: Morphological Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present morphological analysis of the 16$\mu$m flux-density-limited galaxy sample at 0.8$&lt;z&lt;$1.3 from arXiv:2103.04585. At the targeted redshift, the 16$\mu$m emission corresponds to the Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature from intense star formation, or dust heated by AGN (Active galactic nuclei). Our sample of 479 galaxies are dominated by Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs, 67\%) in three CANDLES fields (EGS, GOODS-N, and GOODS-S), and are further divided into AGN dominated, star-forming dominated, composite, and blue compact galaxies by their spectral energy distribution (SED) types. The majority of our sample (71\%) have disky morphologies, with the few AGN dominated galaxies being more bulge-dominanted than the star-forming dominated and composite galaxies. The distribution of our sample on the Gini vs. M$_{\text{20}}$ plane is consistent with previous studies, where the S\'ersic index $n$ shows an increasing trend towards the smaller M$_{\text{20}}$ and higher Gini region below the dividing line for mergers. The subsample of ULIRGs follow a steep size-mass relation that is closer to the early-type galaxies. In addition, as the 4.5 $\mu$m luminosity excess ($L_{4.5}^{Exc}$, proxy for AGN strength) increases, our sample appear to be more bulge-dominated (i.e. higher $n$). Based on the sSFR and compactness ($log_{10}\Sigma_{1.5}, \Sigma_{1.5}=M_*/R_e^{1.5}$) diagram, the majority of our LIRG-dominated galaxy sample follow a secular evolution track, and their distribution can be explained without involving any merging activities. Out of the 16 ULIRGs in our sample, six are compact with strong AGN contributions, likely evolving along the fast-track from more violent activities.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary Disks from Pre-Main Sequence Bondi-Hoyle Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are routinely described as finite mass reservoirs left over by the gravitational collapse of the protostar, an assumption that strongly constrains both disk evolution and planet formation models. We propose a different scenario where protoplanetary disks of pre-main sequence stars are assembled primarily by Bondi-Hoyle accretion from the parent gas cloud. We demonstrate that Bondi-Hoyle accretion can supply not only the mass, but also the angular momentum necessary to explain the observed size of protoplanetary disks, and we predict the dependence of the disk specific angular momentum on the stellar mass. Our results are based on an analytical derivation of the scaling of the angular momentum in a turbulent flow, which we also confirm with a numerical simulation of supersonic turbulence. This new scenario for disk formation and evolution may alleviate a number of observational problems as well as compel major revisions of disk and planet formation models.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Polarization Survey. IV. Characterizing the magnetic field strength and turbulent dispersion using optical starlight polarization in the diffuse interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular dispersion functions are typically used to estimate the fluctuations in polarization angle around the mean magnetic field orientation in dense regions, such as molecular clouds. The technique provides accurate turbulent to regular magnetic field ratios, $\langle B_t^2\rangle^{1/2}/B_{pos}$, which are often underestimated by the classic Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. We assess the technique's suitability to characterize the turbulent and regular plane-of-sky magnetic field in low-density structures of the nearby interstellar medium (ISM), particularly when the turbulence outer scale, $\delta$, is smaller than the smallest scale observed, $\ell_{min}$. We use optical polarization maps of three intermediate-latitude fields ($|b| \gtrsim 7.\!\!^{\circ}5$) with dimensions of $0.\!\!^{\circ}3 \times 0.\!\!^{\circ}3$, sourced from the Interstellar Polarization Survey--General ISM (IPS-GI) catalog. We decomposed the HI emission detected by the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS) within our fields to estimate the multiphase ISM properties associated with the structure coupled to the magnetic field. We produced maps of the plane-of-sky magnetic field strength ($B_{pos}$), mass density ($\rho$), and turbulent velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{v,turb}$). In the regions with well-defined structures at $d&lt;400$ pc, the average $B_{pos}$ ranges from ${\sim}3 \mu$G to ${\sim}9 \mu$G, depending on the method and physical properties. In the region where structures extend up to $1000$ pc, $B_{pos}$ varies from ${\sim}1 \mu$G to ${\sim}3 \mu$G. The results agree with previous estimations in the local, diffuse ISM. Finally, optical starlight polarization and thermal dust polarization at 353 GHz consistently reveal a highly regular plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation unfazed by diffuse dust structures observed at $12 \mu$m.</description>

      <title>The evolution of supermassive blackhole mass--bulge mass relation by a semi-analytic model, $\nu^2$GC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the redshift evolution of the relationship between supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and host bulge mass using a semi-analytical galaxy formation model $\nu^2$GC. Our model reproduces the relation in the local universe well. We find that, at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 3$), two sequences appear in the SMBH mass--bulge mass plane. The emergence of these two sequences can be attributed to the primary triggers of the growth of the SMBHs and bulges: galaxy mergers and disc instabilities. The growth of SMBHs and bulges as a result of galaxy mergers is responsible for giving rise to the high-mass sequence, in which SMBHs are more massive for a given host bulge mass than in the low-mas sequence. Conversely, disc instabilities are accountable for the emergence of the low-mass sequence. At lower redshifts, galaxy mergers tend to become increasingly deficient in gas, resulting in a preferential increase of bulge mass without a corresponding growth in SMBH mass. This has the effect of causing galaxies in the upper sequence to shift towards the lower one on the SMBH mass-bulge mass plane. The galaxies that undergo dry mergers serve to bridge the gap between the two sequences, eventually leading to convergence into a single relation known in the local universe. Our results suggest that the observations of the SMBH mass-bulge mass relation in high redshifts can provide insight into their growth mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Influence of Black Hole Kick Velocity on Microlensing Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natal kick velocity distribution for black holes (BHs) is unknown regardless of its importance for understanding the BH formation process. Gravitational microlensing is a unique tool for studying the distribution of BHs in our Galaxy, and the first isolated stellar-mass BH event, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462/MOA-2011-BLG-191 (OB110462), was recently identified by astrometric microlensing. This study investigates how the natal kick velocity for Galactic BHs affects the microlensing event rate distribution. We consider a Maxwell distribution with various average kick velocities, as well as the consequent variation of the spatial distribution of BHs. We find that the event rate for the BH lenses toward the Galactic bulge decreases as $v_{\rm avg}$ increases, mainly due to the scale height inflation. We focus on the unique microlensing parameters measured for OB110462, with microlens parallax $\pi_{\rm E}$ larger than 0.06 for its long timescale of $t_{\rm E} &gt; 200~$ days. We calculate the expected number of BH events occurring with parameters similar to OB110462 during the OGLE-IV survey by Mr\'oz et al. (2017, 2019) and compare it with the actual number that occurred, at least one. Our fiducial model predicts 0.26, 0.19, 0.095, 0.020, and $1.8 \times 10^{-3}$ events occurring for $v_{\rm avg} =$ 25 km/sec, 50 km/sec, 100 km/sec, 200 km/sec, and 400 km/sec, respectively, which suggests that the average kick velocity is likely to be $v_{\rm avg} \lesssim 100~{\rm km/sec}$. The expected number smaller than unity even at maximum might indicate our luckiness of finding OB110462, which can be tested with future surveys by e.g. the Roman space telescope.</description>

      <title>On the Flux-Intensity Relation of Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report a study on the relationship between flux and intensity for molecular clouds. Our analysis is established on high-quality CO images from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project. The new flux-intensity relation characterizes the flux variation of molecular clouds above specific intensity levels. We found that the flux-intensity relation exhibits two prominent features. First, the flux-intensity relation generally follows exponential shapes; secondly, hierarchical structures of molecular clouds are imprinted on flux-intensity relations. Specifically, 12CO flux-intensity relations are composed of one or more exponential segments, and for molecular clouds with segmented flux-intensity relations, the edge and the flux of the high-temperature component are strikingly consistent with 13CO emission. Further analysis shows that a similar relationship also exists between 13CO flux-intensity relations and C18O emission. The mean brightness temperature of molecular clouds is tightly associated with the decay rate of flux, the break temperature of exponential segments, and, to a certain extent, the flux fraction of the high-temperature component. Broadly, the flux-intensity relation of a molecular tracer, either in optically thick or in optically thin cases, has the capability to outline the silhouette of internal structures of molecular clouds, proving to be a potent tool for probing structures of molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Formation of N-bearing complex organic molecules in molecular clouds: Ketenimine, acetonitrile, acetaldimine, and vinylamine via the UV photolysis of C$_2$H$_2$ ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solid-state C$_2$H$_2$ chemistry in interstellar H$_2$O-rich ice has been proposed to explain astronomically observed complex organic molecules (COMs), including ketene (CH$_2$CO), acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH), toward early star-forming regions. This formation mechanism is supported by recent laboratory studies and theoretical calculations for the reactions of C$_2$H$_2$+OH/H. However, the analog reaction of C$_2$H$_2$+NH$_2$ forming N-bearing species has been suggested to have a relatively low rate constant that is orders of magnitude lower than the value of C$_2$H$_2$+OH. This work extends our previous laboratory studies on O-bearing COM formation to investigate the interactions between C$_2$H$_2$ and NH$_3$ ice triggered by cosmic ray-induced secondary UV photons under molecular cloud conditions. Experiments were performed in an ultra-high vacuum chamber to investigate the UV photolysis of the C$_2$H$_2$:NH$_3$ ice mixture at 10 K. The studied ice chemistry of C$_2$H$_2$ with NH$_2$ radicals and H atoms resulting from the UV photodissociation of NH$_3$ leads to the formation of several N-bearing COMs, including vinylamine (CH$_2$CHNH$_2$), acetaldimine (CH$_3$CHNH), acetonitrile (CH$_3$CN), ketenimine (CH$_2$CNH), and tentatively ethylamine (CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$). The experimental results show an immediate and abundant CH$_2$CHNH$_2$ yield as the first-generation product, which is further converted into other chemical derivatives. The effective destruction and formation cross-section values of parent species and COMs were derived, and we discuss the chemical links among these molecules and their astronomical relevance.</description>

      <title>The oldest stars with low neutron-capture element abundances and origins in ancient dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed chemical abundance and kinematic analysis of six extremely metal-poor ($-4.2 \leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq-$2.9) halo stars with very low neutron-capture abundances ([Sr/H] and [Ba/H]) based on high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra. Three of our stars have [Sr/Ba] and [Sr/H] ratios that resemble those of metal-poor stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). Since early UFDs may be the building blocks of the Milky Way, extremely metal-poor halo stars with low, UFD-like Sr and Ba abundances may thus be ancient stars from the earliest small galactic systems that were accreted by the proto-Milky Way. We label these objects as Small Accreted Stellar System (SASS) stars, and we find an additional 61 similar ones in the literature. A kinematic analysis of our sample and literature stars reveals them to be fast-moving halo objects, all with retrograde motion, indicating an accretion origin. Because SASS stars are much brighter than typical UFD stars, identifying them offers promising ways towards detailed studies of early star formation environments. From the chemical abundances of SASS stars, it appears that the earliest accreted systems were likely enriched by a few supernovae whose light element yields varied from system to system. Neutron-capture elements were sparsely produced and/or diluted, with $r$-process nucleosynthesis playing a role. These insights offer a glimpse into the early formation of the Galaxy. Using neutron-capture elements as a distinguishing criterion for early formation, we have access to a unique metal-poor population that consists of the oldest stars in the universe.</description>

      <title>The rotation of classical bulges in barred galaxies in the presence of gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barred galaxies often develop a box/peanut pseudobulge, but they can also host a nearly spherical classical bulge, which is known to gain rotation due to the bar. We aim to explore how the presence of gas impacts the rotation of classical bulges. We carried out a comprehensive set of hydrodynamical N-body simulations with different combinations of bulge masses and gas fractions. In these models, both massive bulges and high gas content tend to inhibit the formation of strong bars. For low-mass bulges, the resulting bar is stronger in cases of low gas content. In the stronger bar models, bulges acquire more angular momentum and thus display considerable rotational velocity. Such bulges also develop anisotropic velocity dispersions and become triaxial in shape. We found that the rotation of the bulge becomes less pronounced as the gas fraction is increased from 0 to 30%. These results indicate that the gas content has a significant effect on the dynamics of the classical bulge, because it influences bar strength. Particularly in the case of the low-mass bulges (10% bulge mass fraction), all of the measured rotational and structural properties of the classical bulge depend strongly and systematically on the gas content of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>A radial decrease in kinetic temperature measured with formaldehyde in 30 Doradus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback from star formation is a critical component of the evolution of galaxies and their interstellar medium. At parsec scales internal to molecular clouds, however, the observed signatures of that feedback on the physical properties of CO-emitting gas have often been weak or inconclusive. We present sub-parsec observations of H2CO in the 30 Doradus region, which contains the massive star cluster R136 that is clearly exerting feedback on its neighboring gas. H2CO provides a direct measure of gas kinetic temperature, and we find a trend of decreasing temperature with projected distance from R136 that may be indicative of gas heating by the stars. While it has been suggested that mechanical heating affects H2CO-measured temperature, we do not observe any correlation between TK and line width. The lack of an enhancement in mechanical feedback close to R136 is consistent with the absence of a radial trend in gravitational boundedness seen the ALMA CO observations. Estimates of cosmic ray flux in the region are quite uncertain but can plausibly explain the observed temperatures, if R136 itself is the dominant local source of energetic protons. The observations presented here are also consistent with the H2CO-emitting gas near R136 being dominated by direct radiation from R136 and photoelectric heating in the photodissociation regions.</description>

      <title>JWST's PEARLS: resolved study of the stellar and dust components in starburst galaxies at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) contribute significantly to the stellar buildup at cosmic noon. Major mergers and gas accretion are often invoked to explain DSFGs' prodigious star-formation rates (SFRs) and large stellar masses. We conducted a spatially-resolved morphological analysis of the rest-frame UV/NIR emission in three DSFGs at z~2.5. Initially discovered as CO emitters by NOEMA observations of a bright Herschel source, we observed them with the JWST/NIRCam as part of the PEARLS program. The NIRCam data reveal the galaxies' stellar population and dust distribution on scales of 250 pc. Spatial variations in stellar mass, SFR, and dust extinction are determined in resolved maps obtained through pixel-based SED fitting. The CO emitters are massive, dusty starburst galaxies with SFRs ranging from 340 to 2500 Msun/yr, positioning them among the most active SFGs at 2&lt;z&lt;3. Notably, they belong to the ~1.5% of the entire JWST population with extremely red colors. Their morphologies are disk-like, with effective radii of 2.0-4.4 kpc, and exhibit sub-structures such as clumps and spiral arms. The galaxies have dust extinctions up to Av=5-7 mag with asymmetric distributions extending over several kpc and including off-center regions resembling bent spiral arms and clumps. The NIR dust-attenuation curve in these sources deviates from standard laws, implying different dust grain properties than commonly assumed in starburst galaxies. The proximity of galaxies with consistent redshifts, strong color gradients, overall disturbed appearance, asymmetric dust obscuration, and wide-spread star formation favor interactions (minor mergers and flybys) as the mechanism driving the CO galaxies' exceptional SFRs. Their large masses and rich environment hint at membership in two proto-structures, as initially inferred from their association with a Planck-selected high-z source.</description>

      <title>Scattering of dark pions in Sp(4) gauge theory</title>

Abstract: Analyzes of astrophysical data provide first hints on the self-interactions of dark matter at low energies. Lattice calculations of dark matter theories can be used to investigate them, especially in the case of strongly-interacting dark matter. We consider Sp(4) gauge theory with two fundamental fermions as a candidate theory. We compute the scattering phase shift for the scattering of two identical dark pions and determine the parameters of the effective range expansion. Our exploratory results in the supposedly most common interaction channel provide a lower limit for the dark matter mass when compared to astrophysical data. We also provide first benchmarks of velocity-weighted cross-sections in the relevant non-relativistic domain.</description>

      <title>Radiation hydrodynamical simulations of super-Eddington mass transfer and black hole growth in close binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation-driven outflows play a crucial role in extracting mass and angular momentum from binary systems undergoing rapid mass transfer at super-Eddington rates. To study the mass transfer process from a massive donor star to a stellar-mass black hole (BH), we perform multi-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamical simulations that follow accretion flows from the first Lagrange point down to about a hundred times the Schwarzschild radius of the accreting BH. Our simulations reveal that rapid mass transfer occurring at over a thousand times the Eddington rate leads to significant mass loss from the accretion disk via radiation-driven outflows. Consequently, the inflow rates at the innermost radius are regulated by two orders of magnitude smaller than the transfer rates. We find that convective motions within the accretion disk drive outward energy and momentum transport, enhancing the radiation pressure in the outskirts of the disk and ultimately generating large-scale outflows with sufficient energy to leave the binary. Furthermore, we observe strong anisotropy in the outflows, which occur preferentially toward both the closest and furthest points from the donor star. However, when averaged over all directions, the specific angular momentum of the outflows is nearly comparable to the value predicted in the isotropic emission case. Based on our simulation results, we propose a formula that quantifies the mass growth rates on BHs and the mass loss rates from binaries due to radiation-driven outflows. This formula provides important implications for the binary evolution and the formation of merging binary BHs.</description>

      <title>Testing Cotton gravity as dark matter substitute with weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harada proposed a modified theory of gravity called Cotton gravity, and argued that it successfully explains the rotation curves of $84$ galaxies without the need of dark matter. In this work we use galaxy-galaxy lensing technique to test whether the modification effect of Cotton gravity can indeed be a viable substitute for dark matter. Using the spherically symmetric solution of Cotton gravity, we obtain the deflection angle via Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the weak lensing shear. We use five galaxy catalogs divided in 5 stellar mass bins from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7), each of which is further divided into blue star forming galaxy and red passive galaxy sub-catalogs. We find that Cotton gravity on its own has significant deviation from the measured galaxy-galaxy lensing signals, thus it cannot replace the role of dark matter. If we consider the combination of dark matter and Cotton gravity, the modification is tightly constrained. Our analysis also applies to other modified gravity theories whose an additional linear term appears in the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>A systematic study of the ultra-fast outflow responses to luminosity variations in active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extreme velocities and high ionization states of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) make them a promising candidate for AGN feedback on the evolution of the host galaxy. However, their exact underlying driving mechanism is not yet fully understood. Given that the variability of UFOs may be used to distinguish among different launching mechanisms, we aim to search for and characterize the responses of the UFO properties to the variable irradiating luminosity. We performed a high-resolution spectroscopy of archival XMM-Newton observations on six highly-accreting NLS1 galaxies. The state-of-the-art methods of the blind Gaussian line scan and photoionization model scan are used to identify UFO solutions. We search for ionized winds and investigate the structure of ionized winds and their responses to the luminosity variations. The powerful photoionization model scan reveals three previously unreported UFOs in RE J1034+396, PG 1244+026 and I ZW 1, and two new WAs in RE J1034+396. The entrained UFOs are discovered in 4 (66%) AGN, supporting the shocked outflow interpretation for AGN ionized winds. 2 out of 7 (28%) UFOs seem to respond to the continuum and 3 (43%) UFOs hint at a radiatively accelerated nature. Combined with published works, we do not find any correlations between UFO responses and AGN properties except for a tentative ($\sim1.8\sigma$) anti-correlation between the UFO acceleration and the Eddington ratio, to be confirmed by further observations and an enlarged sample. The kinetic energy of UFOs, mostly detected in soft X-rays, is found to have a large uncertainty. We, therefore, cannot conclude whether soft X-ray UFOs have sufficient energy to drive the AGN feedback, although they are very promising based on some reasonable assumptions.</description>

      <title>KMT-2023-BLG-1866Lb: Microlensing super-Earth around an M dwarf host</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the short-term anomaly that appears in the lensing light curve of KMT-2023-BLG-1866. The anomaly was only partly covered due to its short duration, less than a day, coupled with cloudy weather conditions and restricted nighttime duration. Considering intricacy of interpreting partially covered signals, we thoroughly explore all potential degenerate solutions. Through this process, we identify three planetary scenarios that equally well account for the observed anomaly. These scenarios are characterized by the specific planetary parameters: $(s, q)_{\rm inner} = [0.9740 \pm 0.0083, (2.46 \pm 1.07) \times 10^{-5}]$, $(s, q)_{\rm intermediate} = [0.9779 \pm 0.0017, (1.56 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-5}]$, and $(s, q)_{\rm outer} = [0.9894 \pm 0.0107, (2.31 \pm 1.29)\times 10^{-5}]$, where $s$ and $q$ denote the projected separation (scaled to the Einstein radius) and mass ratio between the planet and its host, respectively. We identify that the ambiguity between the inner and outer solutions stems from the inner-outer degeneracy, while the similarity between the intermediate solution and the others is due to an accidental degeneracy caused by incomplete anomaly coverage. Through Bayesian analysis utilizing the constraints derived from measured lensing observables and blending flux, our estimation indicates that the lens system comprises a very low-mass planet orbiting an early M-type star situated approximately (6.2 -- 6.5)~kpc from Earth in terms of median posterior values for the different solutions. The median mass of the planet host is in the range of (0.48 -- 0.51)~$M_\odot$, and that of the planet's mass spans a range of (2.6 -- 4.0)~$M_{\rm E}$, varying across different solutions. The detection of KMT-2023-BLG-1866Lb signifies the extension of the lensing surveys to very low-mass planets that have been difficult to be detected from earlier surveys.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a shock-compressed magnetic field in the north-western rim of the young supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946 with X-ray polarimetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) provide insights into cosmic-ray acceleration and magnetic field dynamics at shock fronts. Recent X-ray polarimetric measurements by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) have revealed radial magnetic fields near particle acceleration sites in young SNRs, including Cassiopeia A, Tycho, and SN 1006. We present here the spatially-resolved IXPE X-ray polarimetric observation of the northwestern rim of SNR RX J1713.7-3946. For the first time, our analysis shows that the magnetic field in particle acceleration sites of this SNR is oriented tangentially with respect to the shock front. Because of the lack of precise Faraday-rotation measurements in the radio band, this was not possible before. The average measured polarization degree (PD) of the synchtrotron emission is 12.5 {\pm} 3.3%, lower than the one measured by IXPE in SN 1006, comparable to the Tycho one, but notably higher than the one in Cassiopeia A. On sub-parsec scales, localized patches within RX J1713.7-3946 display PD up to 41.5 {\pm} 9.5%. These results are compatible with a shock-compressed magnetic field. However, in order to explain the observed PD, either the presence of a radial net magnetic field upstream of the shock, or partial reisotropization of the turbulence downstream by radial magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities, can be invoked. From comparison of PD and magnetic field distribution with {\gamma}-rays and 12 CO data, our results provide new inputs in favor of a leptonic origin of the {\gamma}-ray emission.</description>

      <title>An impressionist view of V Hydrae. When MATISSE paints Asymmetric Giant Blobs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our purpose is to study the effect of binary companions located within the first 10 stellar radii from the primary AGB star. In this work, we target the mass-losing carbon star V Hydrae (V Hya), looking for signatures of its companion in the dust forming region of the atmosphere. The star was observed in the L- and N-bands with the VLTI/MATISSE instrument at low spectral resolution. We reconstructed images of V Hya's photosphere and surroundings using the two bands and compared our interferometric observables with VLTI/MIDI and VISIR archival data. To constrain the dust properties, we used DUSTY to model the spectral energy distribution. The star is dominated by dust emission in the L- and N- bands. The VISIR image confirms the presence of a large-scale dusty circumstellar envelope surrounding V Hya. The MATISSE reconstructed images show asymmetric and elongated structures in both infrared bands. In the L-band, we detected an elongated shape of approximately 15 mas, likely to be of photospheric origin. In the N-band, we found a 20 mas extension North-East from the star, and perpendicular to the L-band elongated axis. The position angle and the size of the N-band extension match the prediction of the companion position at MATISSE epoch. By comparing MATISSE N-band with MIDI data, we deduce that the elongation axis in the N-band has rotated since the previous interferometric measurements 13 years ago, supporting the idea that the particle enhancement is related to the dusty clump moving along with the companion. The MATISSE images unveil the presence of a dust enhancement at the companion position, opening new doors for further analysis on the binary interaction with an AGB component.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Binary Precession: Impact on Eccentric Binary Accretion and Multi-Messenger Astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent hydrodynamical simulations have shown that circumbinary gas disks drive the orbits of binary black holes to become eccentric, even when general relativistic corrections to the orbit are significant. Here, we study the general relativistic (GR) apsidal precession of eccentric equal-mass binary black holes in circumbinary disks (CBDs) via two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We perform a suite of simulations comparing precessing and non-precessing binaries across a range of eccentricities, semi-major axes, and precession rates. We find that the GR precession of the binary's semi-major axis can introduce a dominant modulation in the binary's accretion rate and the corresponding high-energy electromagnetic light-curves. We discuss the conditions under which this occurs and its detailed characteristics and mechanism. Finally, we discuss the potential to observe these precession signatures in electromagnetic and gravitational wave (GW) observations, as well as the precession signal's unique importance as a potential tool to constrain the mass, eccentricity, and semi-major axis of binary merger events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of future-generation interferometers a huge number of Gravitational Wave (GW) signals is expected to be measured without an electromagnetic counterpart. Although these signals do not allow a simultaneous measurement of the redshift and the luminosity distance, it is still possible to infer cosmological parameters. In this paper, we focus on the systematic biases that could arise from mismodeling the GW host probability when inferring the Hubble constant ($H_0$) with GW dark sirens jointly with galaxy catalogues. We discuss the case in which the GW host probability is a function of galaxies' luminosity and redshift as it has been predicted by state-of-the-art compact binary coalescences (CBCs) synthetic catalogues. We show that, in the limiting case in which the analysis is done with a complete galaxy catalog covering a footprint of $\sim 10~\rm {deg}^2$, mismatching the host probability in terms of galaxy's luminosity will introduce a bias on $H_0$. In this case, the magnitude of the bias will depend on the distribution of the Large-Scale Structure over the line-of-sight. Instead, in the limit of a complete wide-field of view galaxy catalog and GW events localized at O$({\rm Gpc})$ distance, mismatching the redshift dependence of the GW hosting probability is more likely to introduce a systematic bias.</description>

Abstract: A model is developed for an idealised spherical galaxy evolving from a uniform mass distribution at the epoch of galactic separation until attaining an equilibrium state through gravitational collapse. The final theoretical radial surface density is computed and shows a good fit to the observational data for two globular clusters, M15 and M80. The mean cycle time and velocity are computed, the velocity-radius curve is developed and Gaussian RMS values derived, from which half-light radius vs. mass are plotted for 544 ellipticals plus compact, massive, and intermediate-mass objects. These show a linear mean log-log $R$-$M_{vir}$ slope of ${0.604\pm0.003}$, equivalent to a Faber-Jackson slope of $\gamma=3.66{\pm}0.009$ over a mass range of 7 decades. and a slope of $0.0045\pm0.0001$ on a semi-log plot of $R_{1/2}-\sigma$. Globular clusters, dwarf elliptical and dwarf spherical galaxies show a distinct anomaly on these plots, consistent with the ellipticals containing a supermassive black hole (SMBH) whose mass increases as the velocity dispersion increases, compared with the remaining types of spherical or irregular galaxies without a massive core. Analysis of the equations of motion suggested the generalised rule that all spherical galaxies expand from their initial radius at the epoch of galactic separation to a stable maximum radius of $\simeq1.136$ times their initial radius in their relaxed state.</description>

      <title>Star Formation Shut Down by Multiphase Gas Outflow in a Galaxy at a Redshift of 2.45</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale outflows driven by supermassive black holes are thought to play a fundamental role in suppressing star formation in massive galaxies. However, direct observational evidence for this hypothesis is still lacking, particularly in the young universe where star formation quenching is remarkably rapid, thus requiring effective removal of gas as opposed to slow gas heating. While outflows of ionized gas are commonly detected in massive distant galaxies, the amount of ejected mass is too small to be able to suppress star formation. Gas ejection is expected to be more efficient in the neutral and molecular phases, but at high redshift these have only been observed in starbursts and quasars. Here we report JWST spectroscopy of a massive galaxy experiencing rapid quenching at redshift z=2.445. We detect a weak outflow of ionized gas and a powerful outflow of neutral gas, with a mass outflow rate that is sufficient to quench the star formation. Neither X-ray or radio activity are detected; however, the presence of a supermassive black hole is suggested by the properties of the ionized gas emission lines. We thus conclude that supermassive black holes are able to rapidly suppress star formation in massive galaxies by efficiently ejecting neutral gas.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Drift Map of the Milky Way disk Populations between 8$-$16 kpc with LAMOST and Gaia datasets</title>

Abstract: The application of asymmetric drift (AD) tomography across different populations provides valuable insights into the kinematics, dynamics, and rotation curves of the Galactic disk. By leveraging common stars identified in both the LAMOST and Gaia surveys, alongside Gaia DR3's circular velocity curve, we conducted a qualitative exploration of asymmetric drift distributions within the Galactic disk spanning distances from 8 to 16 kpc. In the R-Z plane, we observed that the asymmetric drift is minimal near the mid-plane of the Galactic disk and gradually increases with vertical distance, resulting in a distinctive ``horn" shape. Additionally, our analysis revealed that populations with higher [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios exhibit greater asymmetric drift compared to those with lower [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios. Specifically, we found the asymmetric drift around the solar location to be approximately 6 km s$^{-1}$, with a median value of 16 km s$^{-1}$ across the entire sample. Notably, the median asymmetric drift in the northern region of the Galactic disk (20 km s$^{-1}$) surpasses that in the southern region (13 km s$^{-1}$), with errors remaining within 2 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, our investigation into mono-age stellar populations unveiled that older stellar populations tend to exhibit larger asymmetric drift and velocity dispersion, aligning closely with predictions from previous numerical models. Finally, based on chemical compositions, we observed that the median asymmetric drift of the thick disk significantly exceeds that of the thin disk and found that star formation within the thick disk primarily occurred 8-10 billion years ago, whereas the thin disk's predominant star formation period spanned 6-8 billion years ago.</description>

      <title>Filaments of The Slime Mold Cosmic Web And How They Affect Galaxy Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method for identifying cosmic web filaments using the IllustrisTNG (TNG100) cosmological simulations and investigate the impact of filaments on galaxies. We compare the use of cosmic density field estimates from the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator (DTFE) and the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM), which is inspired by the slime mold organism, in the DisPerSE structure identification framework. The MCPM-based reconstruction identifies filaments with higher fidelity, finding more low-prominence/diffuse filaments and better tracing the true underlying matter distribution than the DTFE-based reconstruction. Using our new filament catalogs, we find that most galaxies are located within 1.5-2.5 Mpc of a filamentary spine, with little change in the median specific star formation rate and the median galactic gas fraction with distance to the nearest filament. Instead, we introduce the filament line density, Sigma_fil(MCPM), as the total MCPM overdensity per unit length of a local filament segment, and find that this parameter is a superior predictor of galactic gas supply and quenching. Our results indicate that most galaxies are quenched and gas-poor near high-line density filaments at z&lt;=1. At z=0, quenching in log(M*/Msun)&gt;10.5 galaxies is mainly driven by mass, while lower-mass galaxies are significantly affected by the filament line density. In high-line density filaments, satellites are strongly quenched, whereas centrals have reduced star formation, but not gas fraction, at z&lt;=0.5. We discuss the prospect of applying our new filament identification method to galaxy surveys with SDSS, DESI, Subaru PFS, etc. to elucidate the effect of large-scale structure on galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>UNCOVER NIRSpec/PRISM Spectroscopy Unveils Evidence of Early Core Formation in a Massive, Centrally Dusty Quiescent Galaxy at $z_{spec}=3.97$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a massive ($\log(M_\star/M_\odot)=10.34 \pm_{0.07}^{0.06}$), HST-dark ($m_\mathrm{F150W} - m_\mathrm{F444W} = 3.6$) quiescent galaxy at $z_{spec}=3.97$ in the UNCOVER survey. NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy and a non-detection in deep ALMA imaging surprisingly reveals that the galaxy is consistent with a low ($&lt;$10 $M_\odot \ \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$) star formation rate despite evidence for moderate dust attenuation. The F444W image is well modeled with a two component \sersic fit that favors a compact, $r_e\sim200$ pc, $n\sim2.9$ component and a more extended, $r_e\sim1.6$ kpc, $n\sim1.7$ component. The galaxy exhibits strong color gradients: the inner regions are significantly redder than the outskirts. Spectral energy distribution models that reproduce both the red colors and low star formation rate in the center of UNCOVER 18407 require both significant ($A_v\sim1.4$ mag) dust attenuation and a stellar mass-weighted age of 900 Myr, implying 50\% of the stars in the core already formed by $z=7.5$. Using spatially resolved annular mass-to-light measurements enabled by the galaxy's moderate magnification ($\mu=2.12\pm_{0.01}^{0.05}$) to reconstruct a radial mass profile from the best-fitting two-component \sersic model, we infer a total mass-weighted $r_\mathrm{eff} = 0.72 \pm_{0.11}^{0.15}$ kpc and log$(\Sigma_\mathrm{1 kpc} \ [\mathrm{M_\odot/kpc^2}]) = 9.61 \pm_{0.10}^{0.08}$. The early formation of a dense, low star formation rate, and dusty core embedded in a less attenuated stellar envelope suggests an evolutionary link between the earliest-forming massive galaxies and their elliptical descendants. Furthermore, the disparity between the global, integrated dust properties and the spatially resolved gradients highlights the importance of accounting for radially varying stellar populations when characterizing the early growth of galaxy structure.</description>

      <title>Dark progenitors and massive descendants: A first ALMA perspective on Radio-Selected NIRdark galaxies in the COSMOS field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first spectroscopic ALMA follow-up for a pilot sample of nine Radio-Selected NIRdark galaxies in the COSMOS field. These sources were initially selected as radio-detected sources (S(3GHz)&gt;12.65 uJy), lacking an optical/NIR counterpart in the COSMOS2015 catalog (Ks&gt;24.7 mag), with just three of them subsequently detected in the deeper COSMOS2020. Several studies highlighted how this selection could provide a population of highly dust-obscured, massive, and star-bursting galaxies. With these new ALMA observations, we assess the spectroscopic redshifts of this pilot sample of sources and improve the quality of the physical properties estimated through SED-fitting. Moreover, we measure the quantity of molecular gas present inside these galaxies and forecast their potential evolutionary path, finding that the RS-NIRdark galaxies could represent a likely population of high-z progenitors of the massive and passive galaxies discovered at z~3. Finally, we present some initial constraints on the kinematics of the ISM within the analyzed galaxies, reporting a high fraction (~55%) of double-peaked lines that can be interpreted as the signature of a rotating structure in our targets or with the presence of major mergers in our sample. Our results presented in this paper showcase the scientific potential of (sub)mm observations for this elusive population of galaxies and highlight the potential contribution of these sources in the evolution of the massive and passive galaxies at high-z.</description>

      <title>Discovery of widespread non-metastable ammonia masers in the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for ammonia maser emission in 119 Galactic high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs) known to host 22 GHz H$_2$O maser emission. Our survey has led to the discovery of non-metastable NH$_3$ inversion line masers toward 14 of these sources. This doubles the number of known non-metastable ammonia masers in our Galaxy, including nine new very high excitation ($J,K$)~=~(9,6) maser sources. These maser lines, including NH$_3$ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,8), (10,8), and (11,9), arise from energy levels of 342 K, 513 K, 465 K, 606 K, 834 K, 1090 K, 942 K, 1226 K, and 1449 K above the ground state. Additionally, we tentatively report a new metastable NH$_3$ (3,3) maser in G048.49 and an NH$_3$ (7,7) maser in G029.95. Our observations reveal that all of the newly detected NH$_3$ maser lines exhibit either blueshifted or redshifted velocities with respect to the source systemic velocities. Among the non-metastable ammonia maser lines, larger velocity distributions, offset from the source systemic velocities, are found in the ortho-NH$_3$ ($K=3n$) than in the para-NH$_3$ ($K\neq3n$) transitions.</description>

      <title>The Huge Magnetic Toroids in the Milky Way Halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic fields in our Milky Way can be revealed by the distribution of Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of radio sources behind the Galaxy and of radio pulsars inside the Galaxy. Based on the antisymmetry of the Faraday sky in the inner Galaxy to the Galactic coordinates, the magnetic field toroids above and below the Galactic plane with reversed field directions exist in the Galactic halo and have been included in almost all models for the global magnetic structure in the Milky Way. However, the quantitative parameters, such as the field strength, the scale height, and the scale radius of the toroids are hard to determine from observational data. It has long been argued that the RM antisymmetry could be dominated by the local contributions of the interstellar medium. Here we discount the local RM contributions measured by pulsars mostly located within 5 kpc and get the first quantitative estimate of the size of magnetic toroids in the Galactic halo. They are huge, starting from a Galactocentric radius of less than 2 kpc to at least 15 kpc without field direction reversals. Such magnetic toroids in the Galactic halo should naturally constrain the physical processes in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Forming off-center massive black hole binaries in dwarf galaxies through Jacobi capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established that black holes reside in the central regions of virtually all types of known galaxies. Recent observational and numerical studies however challenge this picture, suggesting that intermediate-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies may be found on orbits far from the center. In particular, constant-density cores minimize orbital energy losses due to dynamical friction, and allow black holes to settle on stable off-center orbits. Using controlled simulations, we study the dynamics of off-center black holes in dwarf galaxies with such cores. We propose a new scenario to describe off-center mergers of massive black holes, starting with a Jacobi capture. We focus on initially circular and co-planar black hole orbits and explore a large parameter space of black hole masses and orbital parameters. We find that Jacobi captures are a complex and chaotic phenomenon that occurs in about 13% of cases in this simplified setup, and we quantify how the likelihood of capture depends on the simulation parameters. We note that this percentage is likely an upper limit of the general case. Nevertheless, we show that Jacobi captures in cored dwarf galaxies can facilitate the formation of off-center black hole binaries, and that this process is sufficiently common to have a substantial effect on black hole growth. While our setup only allows for temporary captures, we expect dissipative forces from baryons and post-Newtonian corrections to maintain the captures over time and to lead to the formation of stable binary systems. This motivates future studies of the effectiveness of such dissipative forces, within stripped nuclei or globular clusters, in forming stable bound systems.</description>

      <title>Exploration of morphological coherence in open clusters with a "core-shell'' structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of their morphological coherence allows us to obtain a better understanding of the morphological evolution of open clusters. We employed the ellipsoid fitting method to delineate the 3D spatial structure of the sample clusters while using the morphological dislocation (MD) defined in our previous work and the ellipticity ratio (ER) of the clusters' inner and outer structures to characterize the morphological coherence of the sample clusters. The results show an inverse correlation between the ER of the sample clusters and the number of their members, indicating that sample clusters with a much more elliptical external morphology than internal shape generally tend to host a large number of members. Meanwhile, a slight shrinking of the MD of the sample clusters with their members' number may shed light on the significant role of the gravitational binding of the sample clusters in maintaining their morphological stability. Moreover, there are no correlations between the MD and ER of the sample clusters and their age. They are also not significantly correlated with the X-axis, the Y-axis, their orbital eccentricities, and the radial and vertical forces on them. However, the ER of the sample clusters displays some fluctuations in the distributions between it and the above covariates, implying that the morphologies of the sample clusters are sensitive to the external environment if sample effects are not taken into account. Finally, the analysis of the 3D spatial shapes of sample clusters with a small ER or a large ER demonstrates that the number of members lays an important foundation for forming a dense internal system for sample clusters. At the same time, the MD of the sample clusters can serve well as an indicator of their morphological stability, which is built upon a certain amount of member stars.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Dark Energy with a Quadratic Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel late-time effective dark energy model characterized by a quadratic equation of state (EoS) and rigorously examine its observational constraints. Initially, we delve into the background dynamics of this model, tracing the evolution of fluctuations in linear order. Our approach involves substituting the conventional cosmological constant with a dynamically effective dark energy fluid. Leveraging a diverse array of observational datasets encompassing the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and a prior on the Hubble constant $H_0$ (R21), we constrain the model parameters. We establish the model's consistency by comparing the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift against observational Hubble data (OHD), benchmarking its performance against the Standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Additionally, our investigation delves into studies of the model's dynamical behavior by computing cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, relative Hubble parameter, and the evolution of the Hubble rate. Furthermore, employing Bayesian analysis, we determine the Bayesian Evidence for our proposed model compared to the reference $\Lambda$CDM model. While our analysis unveils the favorable behavior of the model in various observational tests, the well-known cosmological tensions persist when the full dataset combination is explored.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization measurement of the gold standard of radio-quiet active galactic nuclei : NGC 1068</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We used the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite to measure, for the first time, the 2-8 keV polarization of NGC 1068. We pointed IXPE for a net exposure time of 1.15 Ms on the target, in addition to two ~ 10 ks each Chandra snapshots in order to account for the potential impact of several ultraluminous X-ray source (ULXs) within IXPE's field-of-view. We measured a 2 - 8 keV polarization degree of 12.4% +/- 3.6% and an electric vector polarization angle of 101{\deg} +/- 8{\deg} at 68% confidence level. If we exclude the spectral region containing the bright Fe K lines and other soft X-ray lines where depolarization occurs, the polarization fraction rises up to 21.3% +/- 6.7% in the 3.5 - 6.0 keV band, with a similar polarization angle. The observed polarization angle is found to be perpendicular to the parsec scale radio jet. Using a combined Chandra and IXPE analysis plus multi-wavelength constraints, we estimated that the circumnuclear "torus" may sustain a half-opening angle of 50{\deg} - 55{\deg} (from the vertical axis of the system). Thanks to IXPE, we have measured the X-ray polarization of NGC 1068 and found comparable results, both in terms of polarization angle orientation with respect to the radio-jet and torus half-opening angle, to the X-ray polarimetric measurement achieved for the other archetypal Compton-thick AGN : the Circinus galaxy. Probing the geometric arrangement of parsec-scale matter in extragalactic object is now feasible thanks to X-ray polarimetry.</description>

      <title>Time Delay of Light in the Gravitational lensing of Supermassive Black Holes in Dark Matter Halos</title>

Abstract: The dark matter halo has non-negligible effects on the gravitational lensing of supermassive black hole in the galaxy center. Our work presents a study on the time-delay of light in gravitational lensing of black holes enclosed by dark matter halos. To provide a precise description on the distribution of dark matter in galaxies, we choose several famous phenomenological dark matter halo models in astrophysics, including the NFW, Beta, Burkert and Moore models, to carry out the present study. Through numerically calculating the time-delay of light in gravitational lensing, a comparative analysis of the dark matter effects within different halo models has been performed. Assuming typical length scales associated with the galactic gravitational lensing, numerical results indicate that the NFW, Beta, Burkert and Moore dark matter halos can significantly enhance the time delay of light in gravitational lenisng of central supermassive black holes. The enhancing effect becomes more pronounced with a small dark matter halo scale and an increasing dark matter halo mass.

      <title>The galaxy-galaxy strong lensing cross section and the internal distribution of matter in {\Lambda}CDM substructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe of the detailed distribution of matter in lenses, while magnifying and bringing faint background sources into view. Observed strong lensing by massive galaxy clusters, which are often in complex dynamical states, has also been used to map their dark matter substructures on smaller scales. Deep high resolution imaging has revealed the presence of strong lensing events associated with these substructures, namely galaxy-scale sub-halos. However, an inventory of these observed galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) events is noted to be discrepant with state-of-the-art {\Lambda}CDM simulations. Cluster sub-halos appear to be over-concentrated compared to their simulated counterparts yielding an order of magnitude higher value of GGSL. In this paper, we explore the possibility of resolving this observed discrepancy by redistributing the mass within observed cluster sub-halos in ways that are consistent within the {\Lambda}CDM paradigm of structure formation. Lensing mass reconstructions from data provide constraints on the mass enclosed within apertures and are agnostic to the detailed mass profile within them. Therefore, as the detailed density profile within cluster sub-halos currently remains unconstrained by data, we are afforded the freedom to redistribute the enclosed mass. We investigate if rearranging the mass to a more centrally concentrated density profile helps alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. We report that refitting cluster sub-halos to the ubiquitous {\Lambda}CDM-motivated Navarro-Frenk-White profile, and further modifying them to include significant baryonic components, does not resolve this tension. A resolution to this persisting GGSL discrepancy may require more careful exploration of alternative dark matter models.</description>
