Abstract: In this paper, we proved that for every non-degenerate $C^3$ compact star-shaped hypersurface $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{R}^{8}$ which carries no prime closed characteristic of Maslov-type index $-1$, there exist at least four prime closed characteristics on $\Sigma$.</description>

      <title>Some estimates on stable minimal hypersurfaces in Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive some estimates for stable minimal hypersurfaces in $\R^{n+1}$. The estimates are related to recent proofs of Bernstein theorems for complete stable minimal hypersurfaces in $\R^{n+1}$ for $3\le n\le 5$ by Chodosh-Li, Chodosh-Li-Minter-Stryker and Mazet. In particular, the estimates indicate that the methods in their proofs may not work for $n=6$, which is observed also by Antonelli-Xu. The method of derivation in this work might also be applied to other problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between an analytic compactification of the moduli space of flat $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ connections on a closed, oriented 3-manifold $M$ defined by Taubes, and the Morgan-Shalen compactification of the $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ character variety of the fundamental group of $M$. We exhibit an explicit correspondence between $\mathbb{Z}/2$ harmonic 1-forms, measured foliations, and equivariant harmonic maps to $\mathbb{R}$-trees, as initially proposed by Taubes.</description>

      <title>A Note on Ricci-pinched three-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M, g)$ be a complete, connected, non-compact Riemannian $3$-manifold. Suppose that $(M,g)$ satisfies the Ricci--pinching condition $\mathrm{Ric}\geq\varepsilon\mathrm{R} g$ for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$, where $\mathrm{Ric}$ and $\mathrm{R}$ are the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature, respectively. In this short note, we give an alternative proof based on potential theory of the fact that if $(M,g)$ has Euclidean volume growth, then it is flat. Deruelle-Schulze-Simon and by Huisken-K\"{o}rber have already shown this result and together with the contributions by Lott and Lee-Topping led to a proof of the so-called Hamilton's pinching conjecture.</description>

      <title>Explicit formulas for the Hattori-Stong theorem and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ combinatorial techniques to present an explicit formula for the coefficients in front of Chern classes involving in the Hattori-Stong integrability conditions. We also give an evenness condition for the signature of stably almost-complex manifolds in terms of Chern numbers. As an application, it can be showed that the signature of a $2n$-dimensional stably almost-complex manifold whose possibly nonzero Chern numbers being $c_n$ and $c_ic_{n-i}$ is even, which particularly rules out the existence of such structure on rational projective planes. Some other related results and remarks are also discussed in this article.</description>

      <title>Universal central extension of the Lie algebra of exact divergence-free vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the universal central extension of the Lie algebra of exact divergence-free vector fields, proving a conjecture by Claude Roger from 1995. The proof relies on the analysis of a Leibniz algebra that underlies these vector fields. As an application, we construct the universal central extension of the (infinite-dimensional) Lie group of exact divergence-free diffeomorphisms of a compact 3-dimensional manifold.</description>

      <title>Failure of famous functional inequalities on Finsler manifolds: the influence of $S$-curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The validity of functional inequalities on Finsler metric measure manifolds is based on three non-Riemannian quantities, namely, the reversibility, flag curvature and $S$-curvature induced by the measure. Under mild assumptions on the reversibility and flag curvature, it turned out that famous functional inequalities -- as Hardy inequality, Heisenberg--Pauli--Weyl uncertainty principle and Caffarelli--Kohn--Nirenberg inequality -- usually hold on forward complete Finsler manifolds with non-positive $S$-curvature, cf. Huang, Krist\'aly and Zhao [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 2020]. In this paper however we prove that -- under similar assumptions on the reversibility and flag curvature as before -- the aforementioned functional inequalities fail whenever the $S$-curvature is positive. Accordingly, our results clearly reveal the deep dependence of functional inequalities on the $S$-curvature. As a consequence of these results, we establish surprising analytic aspects of Finsler manifolds: if the flag curvature is non-positive, the Ricci curvature is bounded from below and the $S$-curvature is positive, then the reversibility turns out to be infinite. Examples are presented on general Funk metric spaces, where the $S$-curvature plays again a decisive role.</description>

      <title>On the Dirac spectrum on degenerating Riemannian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the spectrum of the Dirac operator on degenerating families of compact Riemannian surfaces, when the length $t$ of a simple closed geodesic shrinks to zero, under the hypothesis that the spin structure along the pinched geodesic is non-trivial. The difficulty of the problem stems from the non-compactness of the limit surface, which has finite area and two cusps. The main idea in this investigation is to construct an adapted pseudodifferential calculus, in the spirit of the celebrated b-algebra of Melrose, which includes both the family of Dirac operators on the family of compact surfaces and the Dirac operator on the limit non-compact surface, together with their resolvents. We obtain smoothness of the spectral projectors, and $t^2 \log t$ regularity for the cusp-surgery trace of the relative resolvent in the degeneracy process as $t \searrow 0$.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Reduction in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of symplectic reduction in the infinite-dimensional setting, covering both the regular and singular case. Extending the classical work of Marsden, Weinstein, Sjamaar and Lerman, we address challenges unique to infinite dimensions, such as the failure of the Darboux theorem and the absence of the Marle-Guillemin-Sternberg normal form. Our novel approach centers on a normal form of only the momentum map, for which we utilize new local normal form theorems for smooth equivariant maps in the infinite-dimensional setting. This normal form is then used to formulate the theory of singular symplectic reduction in infinite dimensions. We apply our results to important examples like the Yang-Mills equation and the Teichm\"uller space over a Riemann surface.</description>

      <title>The distribution of dilating sets: a journey from Euclidean to hyperbolic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey the distributional properties of progressively dilating sets under projection by covering maps, focusing on manifolds of constant sectional curvature. In the Euclidean case, we review previously known results and formulate some generalizations, derived as a direct byproduct of recent developments on the problem of Fourier decay of finite measures. In the hyperbolic setting, we consider a natural upgrade of the problem to unit tangent bundles; confining ourselves to compact hyperbolic surfaces, we discuss an extension of our recent result with Ravotti on expanding circle arcs, establishing a precise asymptotic expansion for averages along expanding translates of homogeneous curves.</description>

      <title>Spectral invariants and equivariant monopole Floer homology for rational homology three-spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a model for $S^1$-equivariant monopole Floer homology for rational homology three-spheres via a homological device called $\mathcal{S}$-complex. Using the Chern-Simons-Dirac functional, we define an $\mathbf{R}$-filtration on the (equivariant) complex of monopole Floer homology $HM$. This $\mathbf{R}$-filtration fits $HM$ into a persistent homology theory, from which one can define a numerical quantity called the spectral invariant $\rho$. The spectral invariant $\rho$ is tied with the geometry of the underlying manifold. The main result of the papers shows that $\rho$ provides an obstruction to the existence of positive scalar curvature metric on a ribbon homology cobordism.</description>

      <title>Sharp $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ estimates for fully non-linear elliptic equations on compact complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sharp $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ estimates for fully non-linear elliptic equations on compact complex manifolds. For the case of K\"ahler manifolds, we prove that the oscillation of any admissible solution to a degenerate fully non-linear elliptic equation satisfying several structural conditions can be controlled by the $\mathrm{L}^1(\log\mathrm{L})^n(\log\log\mathrm{L})^r(r&gt;n)$ norm of the right-hand function (in a regularized form). This result improves that of Guo-Phong-Tong. In addition to their method of comparison with auxiliary complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations, our proof relies on an inequality of H\"older-Young type and an iteration lemma of De Giorgi type. For the case of Hermitian manifolds with non-degenerate background metrics, we prove a similar $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ estimate which improves that of Guo-Phong. An explicit example is constucted to show that the $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ estimates given here may fail when $r\leqslant n-1$. The construction relies on a gluing lemma of smooth, radial, strictly plurisubharmonic functions.</description>

Moreover we show that the result remains true for the entire range of $|a_0|/m_0$ for which stability can be established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct Witten instanton complexes for K\"ahler Hamiltonian Morse functions on stratified pseudomanifolds with wedge K\"ahler metrics satisfying a local conformally totally geodesic condition. We use this to extend Witten's holomorphic Morse inequalities for the $L^2$ cohomology of Dolbeault complexes, deriving versions for Poincar\'e Hodge polynomials, the spin Dirac and signature complexes for which we prove rigidity results, in particular establishing the rigidity of $L^2$ de Rham cohomology for these circle actions. We study formulas for Rarita Schwinger operators, generalize formulas studied by Witten and Gibbons-Hawking for the equivariant signature and extend formulas used to compute NUT charges of gravitational instantons. We discuss conjectural inequalities extending known Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch formulas for other cohomology theories including those of Baum-Fulton-Quart. This article contains the first extension of Witten's holomorphic Morse inequalities and instanton complexes to singular spaces.</description>

      <title>Notes on scalar curvature lower bounds of steady gradient Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new type of decay estimate for scalar curvatures of steady gradient Ricci solitons. We also give certain upper bound for the diameter of a Riemannian manifold whose $\infty$-Bakry--Emery Ricci tensor is bounded by some positive constant from below. For the proofs, we use $\mu$-bubbles introduced by Gromov.</description>

      <title>Generalized complex Stein manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a generalized complex (GC) Stein manifold and provide complete characterizations in three fundamental aspects. First, we extend Cartan's Theorem A and B within the framework of GC geometry. Next, we define $L$-plurisubharmonic functions and develop an associated $L^2$ theory. This leads to a characterization of GC Stein manifolds using $L$-plurisubharmonic exhaustion functions. Finally, we establish the existence of a proper GH embedding from any GC Stein manifold into $\mathbb{R}^{2n-2k} \times \mathbb{C}^{2k+1}$, where $2n$ and $k$ denote the dimension and type of the GC Stein manifold, respectively. This provides a characterization of GC Stein manifolds via GH embeddings. Several examples of GC Stein manifolds are given.</description>

      <title>Optimal regularity for Lagrangian mean curvature type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.04613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify regularity for Lagrangian mean curvature type equations, which include the potential equation for prescribed Lagrangian mean curvature and those for Lagrangian mean curvature flow self-shrinkers and expanders, translating solitons, and rotating solitons. Convex solutions of the second boundary value problem for certain such equations were constructed by Brendle-Warren 2010, Huang 2015, and Wang-Huang-Bao 2023. We first show that convex viscosity solutions are regular provided the Lagrangian angle or phase is $C^2$ and convex in the gradient variable. We next show that for merely H\"older continuous phases, convex solutions are regular if they are $C^{1,\beta}$ for sufficiently large $\beta$. Singular solutions are given to show that each condition is optimal and that the H\"older exponent is sharp. Along the way, we generalize the constant rank theorem of Bian and Guan to include arbitrary dependence on the Legendre transform.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of smooth projective horospherical varieties of Picard number one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective horospherical variety of Picard number one. We show that a uniruled projective manifold of Picard number one is biholomorphic to $X$ if its variety of minimal rational tangents at a general point is projectively equivalent to that of $X$. To get a local flatness of the geometric structure arising from the variety of minimal rational tangents, we apply the methods of $W$-normal complete step prolongations. We compute the associated Lie algebra cohomology space of degree two and show the vanishing of holomorphic sections of the vector bundle having this cohomology space as a fiber.</description>

      <title>Dimension two holomorphic distributions on four-dimensional projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08901v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional holomorphic distributions on $\mathbb{P}^4$. We classify dimension two distributions, of degree at most $2$, with either locally free tangent sheaf or locally free conormal sheaf and whose singular scheme has pure dimension one. We show that the corresponding sheaves are split. Next, we investigate the geometry of such distributions, studying from maximally non-integrable to integrable distributions. In the maximally non-integrable case, we show that the distribution is either of Lorentzian type or a push-forward by a rational map of the Cartan prolongation of a singular contact structure on a weighted projective 3-fold. We study distributions of dimension two in $\mathbb{P}^4$ whose the conormal sheaves are the Horrocks-Mumford sheaves, describing the numerical invariants of their singular schemes which are smooth and connected. Such distributions are maximally non-integrable, uniquely determined by their singular schemes and invariant by a group $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5) \subset Sp(4, \mathbb{Q})$, where $H_5$ is the Heisenberg group of level $5$. We prove that the moduli spaces of Horrocks-Mumford distributions are irreducible quasi-projective varieties and we determine their dimensions. Finally, we observe that the space of codimension one distributions, of degree $d\geq 6$, on $\mathbb{P}^4$ have a family of degenerated flat holomorphic Riemannian metrics. Moreover, the degeneracy divisors of such metrics consist of codimension one distributions invariant by $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5)$ and singular along a degenerate abelian surface with $(1,5)$-polarization and level-$5$-structure.</description>

      <title>The fine structure of the singular set of area-minimizing integral currents II: rectifiability of flat singular points with singularity degree larger than $1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11555v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an area-minimizing integral current $T$ of codimension higher than $1$ in a smooth Riemannian manifold $\Sigma$. In a previous paper we have subdivided the set of interior singular points with at least one flat tangent cone according to a real parameter, which we refer to as ``singularity degree''. This parameter determines the infinitesimal order of contact at the point in question between the ``singular part'' of $T$ and its ``best regular approximation''. In this paper we show that the set of points for which the singularity degree is strictly larger than $1$, is $(m-2)$-rectifiable. In a subsequent work we prove that the remaining flat singular points form an $(m-2)$-null set, thus concluding that the singular set of $T$ is $m-2$-rectifiable.</description>

      <title>On Closed-Form Expressions for the Fisher-Rao Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fisher-Rao distance is the geodesic distance between probability distributions in a statistical manifold equipped with the Fisher metric, which is a natural choice of Riemannian metric on such manifolds. It has recently been applied to supervised and unsupervised problems in machine learning, in various contexts. Finding closed-form expressions for the Fisher-Rao distance is generally a non-trivial task, and those are only available for a few families of probability distributions. In this survey, we collect examples of closed-form expressions for the Fisher-Rao distance of both discrete and continuous distributions, aiming to present them in a unified and accessible language. In doing so, we also: illustrate the relation between negative multinomial distributions and the hyperbolic model, include a few new examples, and write a few more in the standard form of elliptical distributions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic curvature and existence of a closed magnetic geodesic on low energy levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ endowed with a magnetic form ${\sigma}$ and its Lorentz operator ${\Omega}$ we associate an operator $M^{\Omega}$, called the magnetic curvature operator. Such an operator encloses the classical Riemannian curvature of the metric $g$ together with terms of perturbation due to the magnetic interaction of ${\sigma}$. From $M^{\Omega}$ we derive the magnetic sectional curvature $Sec^{\Omega}$ and the magnetic Ricci curvature $Ric^{\Omega}$ which generalize in arbitrary dimension the already known notion of magnetic curvature previously considered by several authors on surfaces. On closed manifolds, under the assumption of $Ric^{\Omega}$ being positive on an energy level below the Ma\~n\'e critical value, with a Bonnet-Myers argument, we establish the existence of a contractible periodic orbit. In particular, when ${\sigma}$ is nowhere vanishing, this implies the existence of a contractible periodic orbit on every energy level close to zero. Finally, on closed oriented even dimensional manifolds, we discuss about the topological restrictions which appear when one requires $Sec^{\Omega}$ to be positive.</description>

      <title>Integrable hierarchies and F-manifolds with compatible connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the interplay between geometry and integrability, we show that F-manifolds with compatible connection $(\nabla,\circ,e)$ are the geometric counterpart of integrable systems of quasilinear first order evolutionary PDEs. We consider F-manifolds equipped with an Euler vector field and assume that the operator $L=E\circ$ is regular. This generalises previous results in the semisimple context. As an example we study regular F-manifolds with compatible connection $(\nabla,\circ,e,E)$ associated with integrable hierarchies obtained from the solutions of the equation $d\cdot d_L \,a_0=0$ by applying the construction of [27]. We show that $n$-dimensional F-manifolds associated to operators $L$ with $r\le n$ Jordan blocks $L_\alpha$ of size $m_\alpha$ are classified by $n$ arbitrary functions of a single variable, where each block $L_\alpha$ contributes with $m_\alpha$ functions of the variable appearing in the diagonal of the block. In the case of a single Jordan block of arbitrary size we show that flat connections $\nabla$ correspond to linear solutions $a_0$. This generalises part of the construction of [31] where special linear solutions were considered. We illustrate the construction in dimensions $2,3,$ and $4$ for any choice of Jordan canonical form and any choice of the corresponding solution $a_0$. In these dimensions we have that linear solutions define bi-flat F-manifolds, and that the special linear solutions studied in [31] are related to Riemannian F-manifolds with Killing unit vector field. We conjecture that this is true in general.</description>
