      <title>Advancing Precision Oncology Through Modeling of Longitudinal and Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer evolves continuously over time through a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, microenvironmental, and phenotypic changes. This dynamic behavior drives uncontrolled cell growth, metastasis, immune evasion, and therapy resistance, posing challenges for effective monitoring and treatment. However, today's data-driven research in oncology has primarily focused on cross-sectional analysis using data from a single modality, limiting the ability to fully characterize and interpret the disease's dynamic heterogeneity. Advances in multiscale data collection and computational methods now enable the discovery of longitudinal multimodal biomarkers for precision oncology. Longitudinal data reveal patterns of disease progression and treatment response that are not evident from single-timepoint data, enabling timely abnormality detection and dynamic treatment adaptation. Multimodal data integration offers complementary information from diverse sources for more precise risk assessment and targeting of cancer therapy. In this review, we survey methods of longitudinal and multimodal modeling, highlighting their synergy in providing multifaceted insights for personalized care tailored to the unique characteristics of a patient's cancer. We summarize the current challenges and future directions of longitudinal multimodal analysis in advancing precision oncology.</description>

      <title>Design of an Automated Ethanol Vapor Generating System for Alcohol Use Disorder(AUD) Animal Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a prevalent addictive disorder affecting an estimated 29.5 million Americans. It is characterized by impaired control over alcohol consumption despite negative consequences. The number of diagnostic criteria met by an individual typically determines the severity of AUD. Research into AUD focuses on understanding individual susceptibility differences and developing preventive strategies. Alcohol vapor inhalation has emerged as a promising method for pathophysiological investigations in animals, allowing researchers to control the dose and duration of alcohol exposure. This approach is crucial for studying the escalation of voluntary alcohol-drinking behavior. Current commercial systems for alcohol vapor generation have limitations, including combustion risks and the need to adjust multiple parameters. Other methods, like bubbling or blow-over evaporation, face challenges in maintaining equilibrium and avoiding aerosolization. To address these issues, a new type of ethanol vapor generating system is proposed that relies solely on temperature control, creating a vacuum into which ethanol evaporates under thermodynamic control. This approach eliminates the need to adjust multiple parameters and offers improved accuracy and precision in vapor dose delivery. We validated the system as anticipated, achieving stable ethanol vapor after a few priming cycles. Using a 1.2 L cylinder, we obtained approximately 3.6 L of saturated vapor/air mix in 1 minute. Gravimetric results showed that each cycle produced about 100 mg/L or ~10,000 ppm vapor-to-air mixture. The intended use of the ethanol vapor generator is to provide a concentrated ethanol vapor / air mixture to be further diluted before delivering to the animals.</description>

      <title>An affordable, wearable, fiber-free pulsed-mode diffuse speckle contrast flowmetry (PM-DSCF) sensor for noninvasive measurements of deep cerebral blood flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significance: Measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) is crucial for diagnosing various cerebral diseases. An affordable, wearable, and fiber-free continuous-wave speckle contrast flowmetry (CW-DSCF) technique has been developed for continuous monitoring of CBF variations. However, its application in adult humans is limited by shallow tissue penetration. Aim: To develop an innovative pulse-mode DSCF (PM-DSCF) system for continuous monitoring of CBF variations in adult humans. Approach: The PM-DSCF utilizes an 808 nm laser diode and a small NanEye camera to capture diffuse laser speckle fluctuations caused by red blood cell movement in the brain (i.e., CBF). Operating in short-pulse mode (duty cycle &lt; 5%), the system maximizes peak pulse light power for deeper tissue penetration, while ensuring that the average power density remains within ANSI safety standards for skin exposure. The PM-DSCF was evaluated on tissue-simulating phantoms and in adult humans. Results: The maximum effective source-detector distance increased from 15 mm (CW-DSCF) to 35 mm (PM-DSCF). The PM-DSCF successfully detected CBF variations in adult brains during head-up-tilting experiments, consistent with physiological expectations. Conclusions: Switching from CW mode to PM mode significantly increases the maximum tissue penetration depth from ~7.5 mm (CW-DSCF) to ~17.5 mm (PM-DSCF), enabling successful CBF measurements in adult humans.</description>

      <title>Foliar Uptake of Biocides: Statistical Assessment of Compartmental and Diffusion-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global population increase leads to a high food demand, and to reach this target products such as pesticides are needed to protect the crops. Research is focusing on the development of new products that can be less harmful to the environment, and mathematical models are tools that can help to understand the mechanism of uptake of pesticides and then guide in the product development phase. This paper applies a systematic methodology to model the foliar uptake of pesticides, to take into account the uncertainties in the experimental data and in the model structure. A comparison between different models is conducted, focusing on the identifiability of model parameters through dynamic sensitivity profiles and correlation analysis. Lastly, data augmentation studies are conducted to exploit the model for the design of experiments and to provide a practical support to future experimental campaigns, paving the way for further application of model-based design of experiments techniques in the context of foliar uptake.</description>

      <title>New tools for comparing classical and neural ODE models for tumor growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new computational tool TumorGrowth.jl for modeling tumor growth is introduced. The tool allows the comparison of standard textbook models, such as General Bertalanffy and Gompertz, with some newer models, including, for the first time, neural ODE models. As an application, we revisit a human meta-study of non-small cell lung cancer and bladder cancer lesions, in patients undergoing two different treatment options, to determine if previously reported performance differences are statistically significant, and if newer, more complex models perform any better. In a population of examples with at least four time-volume measurements available for calibration, and an average of about 6.3, our main conclusion is that the General Bertalanffy model has superior performance, on average. However, where more measurements are available, we argue that more complex models, capable of capturing rebound and relapse behavior, may be better choices.</description>

      <title>Unbiased and Error-Detecting Combinatorial Pooling Experiments with Balanced Constant-Weight Gray Codes for Consecutive Positives Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial pooling schemes have enabled the measurement of thousands of experiments in a small number of reactions. This efficiency is achieved by distributing the items to be measured across multiple reaction units called pools. However, current methods for the design of pooling schemes do not adequately address the need for balanced item distribution across pools, a property particularly important for biological applications. Here, we introduce balanced constant-weight Gray codes for detecting consecutive positives (DCP-CWGCs) for the efficient construction of combinatorial pooling schemes. Balanced DCP-CWGCs ensure uniform item distribution across pools, allow for the identification of consecutive positive items such as overlapping biological sequences, and enable error detection by keeping the number of tests on individual and consecutive positive items constant. For the efficient construction of balanced DCP-CWGCs, we have released an open-source python package codePub, with implementations of the two core algorithms: a branch-and-bound algorithm (BBA) and a recursive combination with BBA (rcBBA). Simulations using codePub show that our algorithms can construct long, balanced DCP-CWGCs that allow for error detection in tractable runtime.</description>

      <title>UniZyme: A Unified Protein Cleavage Site Predictor Enhanced with Enzyme Active-Site Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enzyme-catalyzed protein cleavage is essential for many biological functions. Accurate prediction of cleavage sites can facilitate various applications such as drug development, enzyme design, and a deeper understanding of biological mechanisms. However, most existing models are restricted to an individual enzyme, which neglects shared knowledge of enzymes and fails generalize to novel enzymes. Thus, we introduce a unified protein cleavage site predictor named UniZyme, which can generalize across diverse enzymes. To enhance the enzyme encoding for the protein cleavage site prediction, UniZyme employs a novel biochemically-informed model architecture along with active-site knowledge of proteolytic enzymes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniZyme achieves high accuracy in predicting cleavage sites across a range of proteolytic enzymes, including unseen enzymes. The code is available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UniZyme-4A67.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Characterization of Similarity Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing judgments of similarity within a perceptual or semantic domain, and making inferences about the underlying structure of this domain from these judgments, has an increasingly important role in cognitive and systems neuroscience. We present a new framework for this purpose that makes limited assumptions about how perceptual distances are converted into similarity judgments. The approach starts from a dataset of empirical judgments of relative similarities: the fraction of times that a subject chooses one of two comparison stimuli to be more similar to a reference stimulus. These empirical judgments provide Bayesian estimates of underling choice probabilities. From these estimates, we derive indices that characterize the set of judgments in three ways: compatibility with a symmetric dis-similarity, compatibility with an ultrametric space, and compatibility with an additive tree. Each of the indices is derived from rank-order relationships among the choice probabilities that, as we show, are necessary and sufficient for local consistency with the three respective characteristics. We illustrate this approach with simulations and example psychophysical datasets of dis-similarity judgments in several visual domains and provide code that implements the analyses at https://github.com/jvlab/simrank.</description>
