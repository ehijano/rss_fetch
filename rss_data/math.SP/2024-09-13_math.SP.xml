      <title>Perron similarities and the nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The longstanding \emph{nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem} (NIEP) is to determine which multisets of complex numbers occur as the spectrum of an entry-wise nonnegative matrix. Although there are some well-known necessary conditions, a solution to the NIEP is far from known.
  An invertible matrix is called a \emph{Perron similarity} if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Johnson and Paparella developed the theory of real Perron similarities. Here, we fully develop the theory of complex Perron similarities.
  Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone and polytope of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). The extremals of these convex sets are finite in number, and their determination for each Perron similarity would solve the diagonalizable NIEP, a major portion of the entire problem. By considering Perron similarities of certain realizing matrices of Type I Karpelevich arcs, large portions of realizable spectra are generated for a given positive integer. This is demonstrated by producing a nearly complete geometrical representation of the spectra of $4 \times 4$ stochastic matrices.
  Similar to the Karpelevich region, it is shown that the subset of complex Euclidean space comprising the spectra of stochastic matrices is compact and star-shaped. \emph{Extremal} elements of the set are defined and shown to be on the boundary.
  It is shown that the polyhedral cone and convex polytope of the \emph{discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix} corresponds to the conical hull and convex hull of its rows, respectively. Similar results are established for multifold Kronecker products of DFT matrices and multifold Kronecker products of DFT matrices and Walsh matrices. These polytopes are of great significance with respect to the NIEP because they are extremal in the region comprising the spectra of stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the perturbed Landau-Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the Dirac operator with constant magnetic field in $\mathbb R^2$. Its spectrum consists of eigenvalues of infinite multiplicities, known as the Landau-Dirac levels. Under compactly supported perturbations, we study the distribution of the discrete eigenvalues near each Landau-Dirac level. Similarly to the Landau (Schr\"odinger) operator, we demonstrate that a three-terms asymptotic formula holds for the eigenvalue counting function. One of the main novelties of this work is the treatment of some perturbations of variable sign. In this context we explore some remarkable phenomena related to the finiteness or infiniteness of the discrete eigenvalues, which depend on the interplay of the different terms in the matrix perturbation.</description>

      <title>The restricted discrete Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the restriction of the discrete Fourier transform $F_N : L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N \mathbb{Z}) \to L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N \mathbb{Z})$ to the space $\mathcal C_a$ of functions with support on the discrete interval $[-a,a]$, whose transforms are supported inside the same interval. A periodically tridiagonal matrix $J$ on $L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N \mathbb{Z})$ is constructed having the three properties that it commutes with $F_N$, has eigenspaces of dimensions 1 and 2 only, and the span of its eigenspaces of dimension 1 is precisely $\mathcal C_a$. The simple eigenspaces of $J$ provide an orthonormal eigenbasis of the restriction of $F_N$ to $\mathcal C_a$. The dimension 2 eigenspaces of $J$ have canonical basis elements supported on $[-a,a]$ and its complement. These bases give an interpolation formula for reconstructing $f(x)\in L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$ from the values of $f(x)$ and $\widehat f(x)$ on $[-a,a]$, i.e., an explicit Fourier uniqueness pair interpolation formula. The coefficients of the interpolation formula are expressed in terms of theta functions. Lastly, we construct an explicit basis of $\mathcal C_a$ having extremal support and leverage it to obtain explicit formulas for eigenfunctions of $F_N$ in $C_a$ when $\dim \mathcal C_a \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>The Pascal Matrix, Commuting Tridiagonal Operators and Fourier Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the (symmetric) Pascal matrix, in its finite and infinite versions, and prove the existence of symmetric tridiagonal matrices commuting with it by giving explicit expressions for these commuting matrices. This is achieved by studying the associated Fourier algebra, which as a byproduct, allows us to show that all the linear relations of a certain general form for the entries of the Pascal matrix arise from only three basic relations. We also show that pairs of eigenvectors of the tridiagonal matrix define a natural eigenbasis for the binomial transform. Lastly, we show that the commuting tridiagonal matrices provide a numerically stable means of diagonalizing the Pascal matrix.</description>
