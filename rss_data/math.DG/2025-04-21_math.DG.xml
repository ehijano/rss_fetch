      <title>Diameter and focal radius of submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we give a characterization of immersed submanifolds of simply-connected space forms for which the quotient of the extrinsic diameter by the focal radius achieves the minimum possible value of $2$. They are essentially round spheres, or the ``Veronese'' embeddings of projective spaces. The proof combines the classification of submanifolds with planar geodesics due to K. Sakamoto with a version of A. Schur's Bow Lemma for space curves. Open problems and the relation to recent work by M. Gromov and A. Petrunin are discussed.</description>

      <title>Torqued and Anti-Torqued Vector Fields on Hyperbolic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of torqued and anti-torqued vector fields on the hyperbolic ambient space $\mathbb{H}^n$. Although there are examples of proper torqued vector fields on open subsets on $\mathbb{H}^n$, we prove that there is no a proper torqued vector field globally defined on $\mathbb{H}^n$. Similarly, we have another non-existence result for anti-torqued vector fields as long as their conformal scalar is a non-constant function. When the conformal scalar is constant some examples of anti-torqued vector fields are provided.</description>

      <title>Anti-torqued slant helices and Torqued Curves in Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of an anti-torqued slant helix in a Riemannian manifold, defined as a curve whose principal vector field makes a constant angle with an anti-torqued vector field globally defined on the ambient manifold. We characterize and classify such curves through systems of differential equations involving their invariants. Several illustrative examples are also provided. Finally, we study torqued curves, defined as curves for which the inner product function of the principal vector field and a torqued vector field along the curve is a given constant.</description>

      <title>Behaviors of Gauss curvatures and mean curvatures of Lightcone framed surfaces in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the differential geometric properties of lightcone framed surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space. In general, a mixed type surface is a connected regular surface with non-empty spacelike and timelike point sets. While a lightcone framed surface is a mixed type surface with singular points at least locally. We introduce a useful tool, so called modified frame along the lightcone framed surface, to study the differential geometric properties of the lightcone framed surface. As results, we show the behaviors of the Gaussian curvature and mean curvature of the lightcone framed surface at not only lightlike points but also singular points.</description>

      <title>Topics in representation theory and Riemannian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These are notes for a Ph.D.\ course I held at SISSA, Trieste, in the Winter 2025. We review well-known topics in Riemannian geometry where Lie groups play a fundamental role. Part of the theory of compact connected Lie groups, their invariants, and representations is discussed, with particular emphasis on low dimensional examples. We go through a number of applications in Riemannian geometry, in particular the classification of Riemannian holonomy groups, and the first construction of exceptional holonomy metrics. Some more recent advances in the field of Riemannian geometry with symmetries are mentioned.</description>

      <title>Lie Superheaps and their Groupification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Lie superheaps as a generalisation of Lie supergroups. We show that the well-known `groupification' and `heapification' functors generalise to the ambience of supergeometry. In particular, we show that there is an isomorphism between the categories of pointed Lie superheaps and Lie supergroups. To do this we make extensive use of the functor of points.</description>

      <title>Hypoellipticit{\'e} de polyn{\^o}mes de champs de vecteurs et conjectures de Helffer etNourrigat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study here the sub-Riemannian geometry on a manifold $M$ induced by a finite family $F$ of vector fields satisfying the H{\"o}rmander condition, as well as the differential operators obtained as polynomials in the elements of $F$. Such an operator $D$ is hypoelliptic if, for any smooth function $f$, the solutions $u$ of the equation $Du=f$ are also smooth. A more refined notion, that of maximal hypoelliptic operators, extends this property in terms of Sobolev regularity, offering a parallel in sub-Riemannian geometry to elliptic operators. In 1979, Helffer and Nourrigat proposed a conjecture characterizing maximal hypoellipticity, generalizing the main regularity theorem for elliptic operators. This conjecture has recently been confirmed using tools from non-commutative geometry. A central element of this work is a natural generalisation in sub-Riemannian geometry, introduced by Mohsen, of the Connes tangent groupoid, in which appear all the tangent cones, key ingredients in the work of Helffer and Nourrigat. In collaboration with Androulidakis and Yuncken, Mohsen developed a pseudodifferential calculus in this context, introducing in particular the notion of principal symbol. They obtained that the invertibility of this symbol is equivalent to maximal hypoellipticity, thus validating the conjecture. This talk will present the ingredients and broad outlines of these innovative advances.</description>

      <title>Minimal graphs over non-compact domains in 3-manifolds fibered by a Killing vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09240v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{E}$ be a connected and orientable Riemannian 3-manifold with a non-singular Killing vector field whose associated one-parameter group of the isometries of $\mathbb{E}$ acts freely and properly on $\E$. Then, there exists a Killing Submersion from $\E$ onto a connected and orientable surface $M$ whose fibers are the integral curves of the Killing vector field. In this setting, assuming that $M$ is non-compact and the fibers have infinite length, we solve the Dirichlet problem for minimal Killing graphs over certain unbounded domains of $M$, prescribing piecewise continuous boundary values. We obtain general Collin-Krust type estimates. In the particular case of the Heisenberg group, we prove a uniqueness result for minimal Killing graphs with bounded boundary values over a strip. We also prove that isolated singularities of Killing graphs with prescribed mean curvature are removable.</description>

      <title>The Light ray transform for pseudo-Euclidean metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ray transform $L$ over null (light) rays in the pseudo-Euclidean space with signature $(n',n'')$, $n'\ge2$, $n''\ge2$. We analyze the normal operator $L'L$, derive an inversion formula, and prove stability estimates. We show that the symbol $p(\xi)$ is elliptic but singular at the light cone. We analyze $L$ as an Fourier Integral Operator as well. Finally, we compare this to the Minkowski case.</description>

      <title>Family Floer SYZ singularities for the conifold transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a mathematically precise version of the SYZ conjecture, proposed in the family Floer context, for the conifold with a conjectural mirror relation between smoothing and crepant resolution. The singular T-duality fibers are explicitly written and exactly correspond to the codimension-2 `missing points' in the mirror cluster variety, which confirms the speculation of Chan, Pomerleano, and Ueda but only in the non-archimedean setting. Concerning purely the area of Berkovich geometry and forgetting all the mirror symmetry background, our B-side analytic fibration is also a new explicit example of affinoid torus fibration with singular extension.</description>
