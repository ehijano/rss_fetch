      <title>Frustration In Physiology And Molecular Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecules provide the ultimate language in terms of which physiology and pathology must be understood. Myriads of proteins participate in elaborate networks of interactions and perform chemical activities coordinating the life of cells. To perform these often amazing tasks, proteins must move and we must think of them as dynamic ensembles of three dimensional structures formed first by folding the polypeptide chains so as to minimize the conflicts between the interactions of their constituent amino acids. It is apparent however that, even when completely folded, not all conflicting interactions have been resolved so the structure remains "locally frustrated". Over the last decades it has become clearer that this local frustration is not just a random accident but plays an essential part of the inner workings of protein molecules. We will review here the physical origins of the frustration concept and review evidence that local frustration is important for protein physiology, protein-protein recognition, catalysis and allostery. Also, we highlight examples showing how alterations in the local frustration patterns can be linked to distinct pathologies. Finally we explore the extensions of the impact of frustration in higher order levels of organization of systems including gene regulatory networks and the neural networks of the brain.</description>

      <title>R3F: An R package for evolutionary dates, rates, and priors using the relative rate framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relative rate framework (RRF) can estimate divergence times from branch lengths in a phylogeny, which is the theoretical basis of the RelTime method frequently applied, a relaxed clock approach for molecular dating that scales well for large phylogenies. The use of RRF has also enabled the development of computationally efficient and accurate methods for testing the autocorrelation of lineage rates in a phylogeny (CorrTest) and selecting data-driven parameters of the birth-death speciation model (ddBD), which can be used to specify priors in Bayesian molecular dating. We have developed R3F, an R package implementing RRF to estimate divergence times, infer lineage rates, conduct CorrTest, and build a ddBD tree prior for Bayesian dating in molecular phylogenies. Here, we describe R3F functionality and explain how to interpret and use its outputs in other visualization software and packages, such as MEGA, ggtree, and FigTree. Ultimately, R3F is intended to enable the dating of the Tree of Life with greater accuracy and precision, which would have important implications for studies of organism evolution, diversification dynamics, phylogeography, and biogeography. Availability and Implementation: The source codes and related instructions for installing and implementing R3F are available from GitHub (https://github.com/cathyqqtao/R3F).</description>

      <title>Bioregionalization analyses with the bioregion R-package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bioregionalization consists in the identification of spatial units with similar species composition and is a classical approach in the fields of biogeography and macroecology. The recent emergence of global databases, improvements in computational power, and the development of clustering algorithms coming from the network theory have led to several major updates of the bioregionalizations of many taxa. A typical bioregionalization workflow involves five different steps: formatting the input data, computing a (dis)similarity matrix, selecting a bioregionalization algorithm, evaluating the resulting bioregionalization, and mapping and interpreting the bioregions. For most of these steps, there are many options available in the methods and R packages. Here, we present bioregion, a package that includes all the steps of a bioregionalization workflow under a single architecture, with an exhaustive list of the bioregionalization algorithms used in biogeography and macroecology. These algorithms include (non-)hierarchical algorithms as well as community detection algorithms coming from the network theory. Some key methods from the literature, such as the network community detection algorithm Infomap or OSLOM (Order Statistics Local Optimization Method), that were not available in the R language are included in bioregion. By combining different methods coming from different fields to communicate easily, bioregion will allow a reproducible and complete comparison of the different bioregionalization methods, which is still missing in the literature.</description>
