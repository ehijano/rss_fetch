      <title>Analogue simulation of quantum gravity black hole models in a dc-SQUID array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an analog quantum simulation for studying the collapse and bounce of a star from infinity. In this spacetime, which encompasses both a black hole and a white hole, we place a massless scalar field that propagates at the speed of light, which is modified by the curvature. We simulate this system using an SQUID array, in which we can alter the propagation of light using an external magnetic field. We consider both infalling and outfalling radiation, giving rise to two different scenarios: downstream and upstream radiation. We compute the magnetic flux profile required by the simulation in both cases and find out that the former is more experimentally suitable.</description>

      <title>The Chirality Trinity: Chirality, Chirality Prime and Time Chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow of time moves in one direction in any spatial position and orientation in this universe. Chiral objects, which lack mirror symmetry, retain their chirality regardless of their position or orientation. Despite being seemingly independent, time and chirality share common features such as universality -- applying to 'any position and orientation' -- and a binary nature, such as forward/backward time flow versus left/right chirality. We introduce the concept of Time Chirality and discuss the conjugate relationship between time chirality and traditional chirality. We explore how time chirality can manifest in certain magnetic states, and examine the novel physical phenomena associated with time-chiral magnetic states. This discussion offers a fresh perspective on true time reversal symmetry breaking and temporal nonreciprocity.</description>

      <title>The BRS Cohomology of the Wess Zumino Chiral Scalar supersymmetric model with exotic pairs and exotic triplets (E2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the spectral sequence method, this paper advances some of the construction of the BRS cohomology of the Wess Zumino supersymmetric action. An important missing part was the inclusion of the sources for the variations of the fields. In this paper, these sources are called pseudofields. Since the most interesting part of the result contains unsaturated spinor indices, we include a constant spinor to saturate those indices. At dimension zero, this gives rise to a new set of invariants and a closely related new set of possible supersymmetry anomalies in the theory, and we call this an `exotic pair'. At dimension one, this becomes more complicated, and the theory adds a new ghost charge - 1 term, which we call a change, and we call this an `exotic triplet'. For higher dimension and higher spin, it appears that more complications are likely to occur.
  These exotic pairs and triplets are constrained by some simple equations which arise from the spectral sequence. The invariants of the exotic pairs are all dependent on the pseudofields, which means that the field parts of these invariants are not supersymmetric, though the invariants are in the cohomology space of supersymmetry. In this paper we examine the BRS cohomology for low spins and low dimensions.</description>

      <title>Finite Nonlocal Holomorphic Unified Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the non-local finite quantum-gravity framework is incorporated into the Complex non-Riemannian Holomorphic Unified Field Theory formulated on a complexified four-dimensional manifold. By introducing entire-function regulators $F(\Box) = \exp\!\bigl(\Box / M_*^2\bigr)$ into the holomorphic Einstein-Hilbert action, we achieve perturbative UV finiteness at all loop orders, while preserving BRST invariance and holomorphic gauge symmetry. We derive the modified gauge-gravity coupling sector, perform a one-loop effective-action computation in a contour-regularized metric background, and demonstrate the absence of new counterterms and problematic complex-pole structures. Extending the construction to nontrivial curved backgrounds, we verify infrared recovery of General Relativity and full holomorphic gauge invariance. Finally, we explore phenomenological consequences, including corrected graviton and gauge-boson scattering amplitudes in self-dual backgrounds, finite Hawking spectra for regularized Schwarzschild and Kerr geometries, and proposed tests of the equivalence principle. This work lays the foundation for a self-consistent, unitary four-dimensional quantum-gravity and Holomorphic Unified Field Theory framework.</description>

      <title>Constraints on R\'{e}nyi Entropy through Primordial Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis and Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R\'{e}nyi entropy, a one-parameter generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, offers a promising framework for probing quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. By modifying the entropy-area relation of the apparent horizon, R\'{e}nyi entropy can alter the expansion dynamics of the early universe, with potential implications for Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. In this work, we derive the modified Friedmann equations within the R\'{e}nyi entropy paradigm and investigate their impact on the primordial abundances of light elements Deuterium ($D$), Helium-4 ($_{}^{4}\textit{He}$), Lithium-7 ($_{}^{7}\textit{Li}$) and baryogenesis. Using observational constraints from Planck, primordial abundance data and observational data on baryogenesis, we put stringent bounds on the R\'{e}nyi parameter. Furthermore, we explore whether R\'{e}nyi entropy corrections could mitigate the long-standing Lithium discrepancy. This study provides the first systematic constraints on R\'{e}nyi cosmology from BBN and highlights the role of nonextensive thermodynamics in early-universe physics. Our analysis shows that the obtained ranges for the R\'{e}nyi parameter $\lambda$ exhibit a overlap for the Helium-4 and Deuterium, but this overlapping region-despite a small discrepancy-is inconsistent with the range obtained from Lithium-7. This small mismatch between the ranges raises the possibility of alleviating the \textit{Lithium Problem} in the modified cosmology scenarios. Furthermore, we present the relationship between the cosmic time and temperature within the framework of R\'{e}nyi cosmology. We observe that an increase in the R\'{e}nyi parameter increase the temperature of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Quantum determinism and completeness restored by indistinguishability and long-time particle detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that measurement data in quantum physics can be rigorously interpreted only as a result of a statistical, macroscopic process, taking into account the indistinguishable character of identical particles. Quantum determinism is in principle possible on the condition that a fully-fledged quantum-field-theoretic model is used to describe the measurement device in interaction with the studied object as one system. In contrast, any approach that relies on Born's rule discriminates the dynamics of a quantum system from that of the detector with which it interacts during measurement. In this work, we critically analyze the validity of this measurement postulate applied to single-event signals. In fact, the concept of ``individual'' particle becomes inadequate once both indistinguishability and a scattering approach allowing an unlimited interaction time for an effective detection, are considered as they should be, hence preventing the separability of two successive measurement events. In this context, measurement data should therefore be understood only as a result of statistics over many events. Accounting for the intrinsic noise of the sources and the detectors, we also show with the illustrative cases of the Schr\"odinger cat and the Bell experiment that once the Born rule is abandoned on the level of a single particle, realism, locality and causality are restored. We conclude that indiscernibility and long-time detection process make quantum physics not fundamentally probabilistic.</description>

      <title>Separation out of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18495v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the separability properties of quantum states described by an extended Werner density matrix, where the classical component exhibits statistical dependence. By generalizing the classical part to allow correlations, we demonstrate that within a specific parameter range the separable region expands compared to the standard Werner state with an independent classical component. This result suggests that increasing classical correlation can enhance the separability of the overall quantum state, providing new insights into the interplay between classical and quantum correlations.</description>
