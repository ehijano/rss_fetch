      <title>Josephson Diode Effect for a Kitaev Ladder System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Josephson diode effect realized purely by geometry in a Kitaev-ladder Josephson junction composed of two parallel spinless $p$-wave chains coupled by an interleg hopping $t_\perp$. The junction is governed by two phases: the superconducting phase difference across the weak link, $\theta$, and the leg-to-leg phase difference, $\phi$. For $\phi\notin \{0, \pi\}$ (mod $2\pi$), time-reversal symmetry is broken, and the absence of leg-exchange symmetry leads to a breakdown of the antisymmetry of the current-phase relation, yielding nonreciprocal Josephson transport without magnetic fields or spin-orbit coupling. By resolving transport into bonding and antibonding channels defined by $t_\perp$, it is shown that the leg phase acts as an effective phase shift for interband ($p_\nu/p_{-\nu}$) tunneling, whereas the same-band ($p_\nu/p_\nu$) contribution remains unshifted. These channels arise at different perturbative orders and, together with the $4\pi$-periodic Majorana channel that emerges near the topological transition, interfere to produce a pronounced diode response. The class-D Pfaffian invariant identifies the parameter regime where the ladder hosts Majorana zero modes. Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations reveal a dome-like dependence of the diode efficiency $\eta$ on $t_\perp$: $\eta\to 0$ for $t_\perp\to 0$ and for large $t_\perp$, with a maximum at intermediate coupling that is tunable by $\phi$. The present results establish a field-free, geometry-based route to superconducting rectification in one-dimensional topological systems and specify symmetry and topology conditions for optimizing the effect in ladder and network devices.</description>

      <title>Controllable Superconductivity in Suspended van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable superconductors provide a versatile platform for advancing next-generation quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate controllable superconductivity in suspended NbSe2 thin layers, achieved through local strain and thermal modulation of the superconducting state. Our results show that suspended NbSe2 structures enable strain modulation of the critical temperature by up to approximately 0.92 K (about 12.5% of the critical temperature) and allow the realization of gate-tunable superconducting critical currents. We further demonstrate configurable hysteretic transport characteristics exhibiting multistability and negative differential resistance, providing easily reconfigurable, spatially dependent superconducting states. These phenomena are well explained by calculations of electron-phonon coupling using density functional theory, together with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau dynamics coupled to the thermal diffusion equation. Our work provides profound insight into strain and thermal modulation of van der Waals superconductors and opens new opportunities for tunable on-chip superconductor devices, integrated superconducting circuits, and quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Robustness of bipolaronic superconductivity to electron-density-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bipolaron formation and bipolaronic superconductivity on a square lattice, where electrons couple to both local Holstein phonons via on-site charge density and nonlocal bond Su-Schrieffer-Heeger phonons via modulation of hopping amplitudes. Using an unbiased Diagrammatic Monte Carlo method, we investigate how the interplay between these two types of electron-phonon coupling affects the bipolaron binding energy, effective mass, spatial extent (quantified by the mean-squared radius), and the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$. We find that, in some parameter space, the moderate Holstein coupling, though detrimental to $T_c$ when acting alone, can enhance superconductivity when combined with the bond SSH coupling by further compressing the bipolaron without significantly increasing its mass. Similarly, introducing bond SSH coupling into a Holstein bipolaron reduces its size while keeping the effective mass nearly unchanged, leading a higher $T_c$. These effects give rise to nonmonotonic behavior and reveal a cooperative regime in which both couplings work together to enhance superconductivity. We further examine phonon frequency asymmetry, particularly the case $\omega_H/t = 2\omega_B/t$, and show that in the deep adiabatic regime, adding Holstein coupling can even raise $T_c$ when combined with bond SSH coupling. These results highlight the distinct and complementary roles of local Holstein and non-local bond SSH electron-phonon couplings, and suggest strategies for optimizing high-$T_c$ superconductivity in systems with multiple phonon modes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of magnetism and chiral d+id-wave superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a large-scale, unbiased constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method to systematically simulate the effective two-orbital Hubbard model for twisted bilayer graphene in order to gain deeper insight into the relationship between correlated states and the superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted bilayer graphene, as well as the influence of the twist angle on superconductivity. Initially, we investigate the modulation of superconductivity by nearest-neighbor attractive Coulomb interactions, demonstrating that electron-phonon coupling plays a significant role in the system. Our numerical results reveal that the superconducting state is dominated by chiral NN-d+id superconducting electron pairing symmetry, and that such nearest-neighbor attractive Coulomb interactions significantly enhance the effective long-range pairing correlation function of chiral NN-d+id wave. Then, we explore how the twist angle affects the superconducting state. Our results show that as the twist angle deviates downward from 1.08{\deg}, the effective pairing correlation function of the chiral NN-d+id wave increases substantially. Through these investigations, our numerical findings not only contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of strongly correlated systems such as twisted bilayer graphene, but also provide guidance for identifying twist-angle systems with potentially higher superconducting transition temperatures.</description>

      <title>KTaO3-based editable superconducting diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting diodes, which enable dissipationless supercurrent flow in one direction while blocking it in the reverse direction, are emerging as pivotal components for superconducting electronics. The development of editable superconducting diodes could unlock transformative applications, including dynamically reconfigurable quantum circuits that adapt to operational requirements. Here, we report the first observation of the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in LaAlO3/KTaO3 heterostructures, a two-dimensional oxide interface superconductor with exceptional tunability. We observe a strong SDE in Hall-bar (or strip-shaped) devices under perpendicular magnetic fields (&lt; 15 Oe), with efficiencies above 40% and rectification signals exceeding 10 mV. Through conductive atomic force microscope lithography, we demonstrate reversible nanoscale editing of the SDE's polarity and efficiency by locally modifying the superconducting channel edges. This approach enables multiple nonvolatile configurations within a single device, realizing an editable superconducting diode. Our work establishes LAO/KTO as a platform for vortex-based nonreciprocal transport and provides a pathway toward designer quantum circuits with on-demand functionalities.</description>

      <title>High-resolution magnetostriction measurements of the Pauli-limited superconductor Sr2RuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed high-resolution magnetostriction measurements on the Pauli-limited superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using high-quality single crystals. A first-order superconducting transition, accompanied by pronounced hysteresis, was observed under in-plane magnetic fields, where the relative length change of the sample, $\Delta L/L$, was on the order of $10^{-8}$. To ensure the reliability of the measurements, particular attention was paid to minimizing the influence of magnetic torque, which can significantly affect data under in-plane field configurations, via field-angle-resolved magnetostriction. Within the hysteresis regime, slightly below the Pauli-limited upper critical field, a hump-like anomaly in the magnetostriction coefficient was identified. Furthermore, a characteristic double-peak structure in the field-angle derivative of the magnetostriction provides additional support for this anomaly. Although these findings may reflect a lattice response associated with the emergence of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, the possibility of a broadened first-order transition cannot be excluded. Notably, this magnetostriction anomaly qualitatively deviates from the FFLO phase boundary suggested by previous NMR measurements, highlighting the necessity for further experimental and theoretical investigations to elucidate the nature of the FFLO state in this material.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Negative Capacitance for Unconventional Coulomb Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the many-body ground state of a two-dimensional electron system can be tuned through Coulomb engineering by controlling the permittivity of the surrounding media. However, permittivities are traditionally restricted to positive values. In this paper we argue that the negative capacitance effect demonstrated in appropriately engineered structures can open new vistas in Coulomb engineering. Negative permittivities transform the natural repulsive interaction of electrons into an attractive one raising the intriguing possibility of a superconducting ground state. Using models of two-dimensional electron systems with linear and parabolic dispersion relations coupled to environments with negative capacitance, we estimate the strength and sign of the engineered Coulomb interaction and outline parameter regimes that could stabilize correlated electronic phases.</description>

      <title>Prevailing orbital excitations in paramagnetic kagome superconductor Cs(V$_{0.95}$Ti$_{0.05}$)$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the muon as a sensitive local magnetic probe, we investigated the layered kagome superconductor Cs(V$_{0.95}$Ti$_{0.05}$)$_3$Sb$_5$, a material notably devoid of both static magnetic moments and long-range charge order. Our transverse-field $\mu$SR measurements reveal that the local magnetic susceptibility, obtained via the muon Knight shift, is dominated by orbital excitations with a split energy levels around 20 meV. Meanwhile, the persistence of itinerant electron paramagnetism down to 5 K and 7 T confirms the absence of static magnetism within this regime. In addition, zero-field (ZF) $\mu$SR experiments detect a significant increase in the inhomogeneous nuclear dipolar field distribution below a featured temperature at 70 K. We attribute this ZF-$\mu$SR feature to the emergence of local lattice distortions at low temperatures, potentially arising from orbital ordering. Significantly, our study establishes that orbital excitations constitute an intrinsic property of the layered V-Sb kagome lattice. Despite its small magnitude, spin-orbit coupling plays a crucial role in governing the lattice dynamics, potentially driving the emergence of novel phenomena such as phonon carrying angular momentum in crystals with non-chiral point groups.</description>

      <title>Resonating valence bond pairing energy in graphene by quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state in graphene using real-space quantum Monte Carlo with correlated variational wave functions. Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations with Jastrow-Slater-determinant and Jastrow-antisymmetrized-geminal-power ansatze are employed to evaluate the RVB pairing energy. Using a rectangular graphene sample that lacks $\pi/3$ rotational symmetry, we found that the single-particle energy gap near the Fermi level depends on the system size along the $x$-direction. The gap vanishes when the length satisfies $L_x=3n\sqrt{3}d$, where $n$ is an integer and $d$ is the carbon-carbon bond length, otherwise, the system, exhibits a finite gap. Our DMC results show no stable RVB pairing in the zero-gap case, whereas the opening of a finite gap near the Fermi level stabilizes the electron pairing. The DMC predicted absolute value of pairing energy at the thermodynamic limit for a finite-gap system is $\sim 0.48(1)$ mHa/atom. Our results reveal a feometry-driven electron pairing mechanism in the confined graphene nanostructure.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of period-four stripe charge-density-wave in kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between unconventional density waves and exotic superconductivity has attracted growing interest. Kagome superconductors $A\rm{V}_3\rm{Sb}_5$ ($A = \rm{K}, \rm{Rb}, \rm{Cs}$) offer a platform for studying quantum phase transitions and the resulting symmetry breaking. Among these quantum phases, the $4a_0$ stripe charge-density-wave (CDW) has been widely observed for $A=\rm{Rb}$ and $\rm{Cs}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. However, the microscopic origin of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW remains elusive, and no theoretical studies addressing this phenomenon have been reported so far. In this paper, we propose a microscopic mechanism for the emergence of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW. We analyze the CDW instability in the 12-site kagome lattice Hubbard model with the $2\times2$ bond order driven by the paramagnon-interference mechanism by focusing on the short-range magnetic fluctuations due to the geometrical frustration of kagome lattice. We reveal that the nesting vector of the reconstructed Fermi surface, formed by the $2\times 2$ bond order, gives rise to a $4a_0$-period CDW. Remarkably, the obtained stripe CDW is composed of both the off-site hopping integral modulations and on-site potentials. The real-space structure of the stripe CDW obtained here is in good qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed stripe pattern.</description>

Abstract: Cold and dense matter is expected to be in a color-superconducting state. Here we review two calculations, relevant for fundamental properties and applications of color superconductivity, respectively: the weak-coupling QCD calculation of the fermionic energy gap together with the magnetic screening masses of the gauge bosons, and the calculation of bulk viscosity from a non-leptonic electroweak process. These calculations are supplemented by a discussion of color superconductors with mismatched Fermi momenta, and they are embedded in the context of the state of the art by giving an overview of previous and ongoing work and future directions.</description>

      <title>Sublattice Dichotomy in Monolayer FeSe Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pairing mechanism behind the monolayer FeSe is one essential question for iron-based superconductors. In this work, we show the sublattice degree of freedoms of monolayer FeSe plays a special role in its pairing properties, namely the sublattice dichotomy. The high-quality monolayer FeSe samples with atomic flat $1\times1$ topography on the SrTiO$_3$(001) substrates are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By comparing the tunneling spectra at $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fe sublattices, we find the coherence peak of $\alpha$-Fe at the inner gap $+V_i$ is higher than $\beta$-Fe while the coherence peak of $\beta$-Fe at $-V_i$ is higher than $\alpha$-Fe with a similar amount. We also observed a reversed effect at the outer gap $\pm V_o$. We propose the $\eta$-pairing mechanism between $k$ and $-k+Q$ is the key mechanism for this unconventional sublattice dichotomy effect.</description>

      <title>Persistence of small polarons into the superconducting phase of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$BiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipolaronic superconductivity is an exotic pairing mechanism proposed for materials like Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$BiO$_3$ (BKBO); however, conclusive experimental evidence for a (bi)polaron metallic state in this material remains elusive. Here, we combine resonant inelastic x-ray and neutron total scattering techniques with advanced modelling to study the local lattice distortions, electronic structure, and electron-phonon coupling ($e$-ph) in BKBO as a function of doping. Data for the parent compound ($x = 0$) indicates that the electronic gap opens in predominantly oxygen-derived states strongly coupled to a long-range ordered breathing distortion of the oxygen sublattice. Upon doping, short-range breathing distortions and sizable ($e$-ph) coupling persist into the superconducting regime ($x = 0.4$). Comparisons with exact diagonalization and determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations further support this conclusion. Our results provide compelling evidence that BKBO's metallic phase hosts a liquid of small (bi)polarons derived from local breathing distortions of the lattice, with implications for understanding the low-temperature superconducting instability</description>

Abstract: Superconducting qubits have motivated the exploration of Josephson-junction technologies beyond quantum computing, with emerging applications in low-energy photon and phonon detection for astrophysics and dark matter searches. Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium (Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior, enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current, superconducting gap and normal-state resistance. This work presents the first comprehensive study of Hf-based junctions and their potential for next-generation superconducting detectors and qubit architectures leveraging low superconducting gap energies.</description>

      <title>Full Counting Statistics of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04758</link>

Abstract: With the help of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) it has become possible to address single magnetic impurities on superconducting surfaces and to investigate the peculiar properties of the in-gap states known as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. However, until very recently YSR states were only investigated with conventional tunneling spectroscopy, missing the crucial information contained in other transport properties such as shot noise. Here, we adapt the concept of full counting statistics (FCS) to provide a very deep insight into the spin-dependent transport in these hybrid systems. We illustrate the power of FCS by analyzing different situations in which YSR states show up including single-impurity junctions, as well as double-impurity systems where one can probe the tunneling between individual YSR states. The FCS concept allows us to unambiguously identify every tunneling process that plays a role in these situations. Moreover, FCS provides all the relevant transport properties, including current, shot noise and all the cumulants of the current distribution. Our approach can reproduce the experimental results recently reported on the shot noise of a single-impurity junction with a normal STM tip. We also predict the signatures of resonant (and non-resonant) multiple Andreev reflections in the shot noise of single-impurity junctions with two superconducting electrodes. In the case of double-impurity junctions we show that the direct tunneling between YSR states is characterized by a strong reduction of the Fano factor that reaches a minimum value of 7/32, a new fundamental result in quantum transport. The FCS approach presented here can be naturally extended to investigate the spin-dependent superconducting transport in a variety of situations, and it is also suitable to analyze multi-terminal superconducting junctions, irradiated contacts, and many other basic situations.</description>

      <title>First Sub-MeV Dark Matter Search with the QROCODILE Experiment Using Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first results from the Quantum Resolution-Optimized Cryogenic Observatory for Dark matter Incident at Low Energy (QROCODILE). The QROCODILE experiment uses a microwire-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a target and sensor for dark matter scattering and absorption, and is sensitive to energy deposits as low as 0.11 eV. We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons. We discuss the potential for improvements to both the energy threshold and effective volume of the experiment in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Melting Points and Formation Free Energies of Carbon Compounds with Sodalite Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the melting temperatures $T_{\rm m}$ and formation free energy of carbon compounds with sodalite structures, $X$C$ _6$, $X$C$ _{10}$, and $X$C$ _{12}$, where $X$ is F, Na, Cl, and so on. These compounds are expected to be phonon-mediated superconductors exhibiting high transition temperatures $T_{\rm c}$ of up to about 100 K. We estimate $T_{\rm m}$ as a function of pressure $P$ by using the first-principles molecular dynamics method and show the results as phase diagrams on the $P$-$T$ plane together with the results of $T_{\rm c}$. It indicates that the $T_{\rm m}$ of NaC$_{\rm 6}$, which has a $T_{\rm c}$ up to about 100 K, is about $1300$ K or more at $P=30$ GPa. Furthermore, the $T_{\rm m}$ of FC$_{\rm 6}$ is about 2200 K even at $P=0$ GPa, where its $T_{\rm c}$ is about 80 K. Similar results are obtained for FC$_{\rm 10}$ and ClC$_{\rm 10}$ systems. These results suggest that some compounds can stably exist as high-temperature superconductors even at room temperature and pressure. To examine the feasibility of synthesizing these compounds, we estimate the formation enthalpies and formation free energies. These results suggest that NaC$_6$ could be formed under a sufficiently high pressure of about 300 GPa and a high temperature of about 6500 K.</description>

      <title>Reflectionless modes as a source of Weyl nodes in multiterminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to study non-trivial topology in engineered quantum systems. Yet, experimentally meaningful insight into what exactly makes these systems topologically non-trivial remains elusive. In this work, we show that zero energy reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs) of the normal scattering matrix result in topological phase boundaries. By analyzing two different setups, we explain the origin of each topological phase boundary and furthermore provide generalizable insight into these systems. The considerations here can be of help for experimentalists as it connects the properties of the normal scattering region to the Andreev bound state spectrum of superconducting junctions in a multiterminal setup.</description>

      <title>Quantum action of the Josephson dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the beyond-mean-field Josephson dynamics of the relative phase between two coupled macroscopic quantum systems. Using a covariant background field method, we derive the one-loop only-phase quantum effective action and the corresponding equation of motion for the quantum average of the phase. These analytical results are benchmarked against the exact quantum dynamics of the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, demonstrating a relevant improvement over the standard mean-field predictions across a wide range of interaction strengths.</description>
