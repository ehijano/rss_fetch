      <title>Canonical Descriptors for Periodic Lattice Truss Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades, aspects of the topological architecture, and of the mechanical as well as other physical behaviors of periodic lattice truss materials (PLTMs) have been massively studied. Their approximate infinite design space presents a double-edged sword, implying on one hand dramatic designability in fulfilling the requirement of various performance, but on the other hand unexpected intractability in determining the best candidate with tailoring properties. In recent years, the development of additive manufacturing and artificial intelligence spurs an explosion in the methods exploring the design space and searching its boundaries. However, regrettably, a normative description with sufficient information of PLTMs applying to machine learning has not yet been constructed, which confines the inverse design to some discrete and small scrutinized space. In the current paper, we develop a system of canonical descriptors for PLTMs, encoding not only the geometrical configurations but also mechanical properties into matrix forms to establish good quantitative correlations between structures and mechanical behaviors. The system mainly consists of the geometry matrix for the lattice node configuration, density, stretching and bending stiffness matrices for the lattice strut properties, as well as packing matrix for the principal periodic orientation. All these matrices are theoretically derived based on the intrinsic nature of PLTMs, leading to concise descriptions and sufficient information. The characteristics, including the completeness and uniqueness, of the descriptors are analyzed. In addition, we discuss how the current system of descriptors can be applied to the database construction and material discovery, and indicate the possible open problems.</description>

      <title>Application of advanced ultrasonic testing methods to Dissimilar Metal Welds -- Comparison of simulated and experimental results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Widely present in the primary circuit of Nuclear Power Plants (NPP), Dissimilar Metal Welds (DMW) are inspected using Ultrasonic nondestructive Testing (UT) techniques to ensure the integrity of the structure and detect defects such as Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC).In a previous collaborative research, CRIEPI and CEA have worked on the understanding of the propagation of ultrasonic waves in complex materials. Indeed, the ultrasonic propagation can be disturbed due to the anisotropic and inhomogeneous properties of the medium and the interpretation of inspection results can then be difficult. An analytical model, based on a dynamic ray theory, developed by CEA-LIST and implemented in the CIVA software had been used to predict the ultrasonic propagation in a DMW. The model evaluates the ray trajectories, the travel-time and the computation of the amplitude along the ray tube in a medium described thanks to a continuously varying description of its physical properties. In this study, the weld had been described by an analytical law of the crystallographic orientation. The simulated results of the detection of calibrated notches located in the buttering and the weld had been compared with experimental data and had shown a good agreement.The new collaborative program presented in this paper aims at detecting a real SCC defect located close to the root of the DMW. Thus, simulations have been performed for a DMW described with an analytical law and a smooth cartography of the crystallographic orientation. Furthermore, advanced ultrasonic testing methods have been used to inspect the specimen and detect the real SCC defect. Experimental and simulated results of the mock-up inspection have been compared.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the data analysis problem of shock-ramp compression, i.e., ramp compression after a relatively strong initial shock, a characteristics-based method that strictly deals with the initial hydrodynamic shock is described in detail. Validation of this analysis method using simulated shock-ramp data generated by molecular dynamics and one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic code is also presented.</description>

      <title>On the moments of Cox rate-and-state models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate-and-state models are widely used physical models for the relation between changes in pore pressure due to fluid injection or gas extraction and the induced seismic hazard in a field. We consider the modification where the pore pressure measurements are affected by noise and provide explicit expressions for the first and second moments of the state variable. We show that when the pressure increases, there is positive correlation. In the case of decreasing pressure, both positive and negative correlation is possible. Using the delta method, approximate first and second moments of the rate variable are derived and compared to empirical moments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry Models for Texture Synthesis of Machined Metallic Surfaces: Sandblasting and Milling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training defect detection algorithms for visual surface inspection systems requires a large and representative set of training data. Often there is not enough real data available which additionally cannot cover the variety of possible defects. Synthetic data generated by a synthetic visual surface inspection environment can overcome this problem. Therefore, a digital twin of the object is needed, whose micro-scale surface topography is modeled by texture synthesis models. We develop stochastic texture models for sandblasted and milled surfaces based on topography measurements of such surfaces. As the surface patterns differ significantly, we use separate modeling approaches for the two cases. Sandblasted surfaces are modeled by a combination of data-based texture synthesis methods that rely entirely on the measurements. In contrast, the model for milled surfaces is procedural and includes all process-related parameters known from the machine settings.</description>

      <title>Defining metric-aware size-shape measures to validate and optimize curved high-order meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a regularized size-shape distortion (quality) measure for curved high-order elements on a Riemannian space. To this end, we measure the deviation of a given element, straight-sided or curved, from the stretching, alignment, and sizing determined by a target metric. The defined distortion (quality) is suitable to check the validity and the quality of straight-sided and curved elements on Riemannian spaces determined by constant and point-wise varying metrics. The examples illustrate that the distortion can be minimized to curve (deform) the elements of a given high-order (linear) mesh and try to match with curved (linear) elements the point-wise stretching, alignment, and sizing of a discrete target metric tensor. In addition, the resulting meshes simultaneously match the curved features of the target metric and boundary. Finally, to verify if the minimization of the metric-aware size-shape distortion leads to meshes approximating the target metric, we compute the Riemannian measures for the element edges, faces, and cells. The results show that, when compared to anisotropic straight-sided meshes, the Riemannian measures of the curved high-order mesh entities are closer to unit. Furthermore, the optimized meshes illustrate the potential of curved $r$-adaptation to improve the accuracy of a function representation.</description>

      <title>A globalized and preconditioned Newton-CG solver for metric-aware curved high-order mesh optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a specific-purpose globalized and preconditioned Newton-CG solver to minimize a metric-aware curved high-order mesh distortion. The solver is specially devised to optimize curved high-order meshes for high polynomial degrees with a target metric featuring non-uniform sizing, high stretching ratios, and curved alignment -- exactly the features that stiffen the optimization problem. To this end, we consider two ingredients: a specific-purpose globalization and a specific-purpose Jacobi-$\text{iLDL}^{\text{T}}(0)$ preconditioning with varying accuracy and curvature tolerances (dynamic forcing terms) for the CG method. These improvements are critical in stiff problems because, without them, the large number of non-linear and linear iterations makes curved optimization impractical. Finally, to analyze the performance of our method, the results compare the specific-purpose solver with standard optimization methods. For this, we measure the matrix-vector products indicating the solver computational cost and the line-search iterations indicating the total amount of objective function evaluations. When we combine the globalization and the linear solver ingredients, we conclude that the specific-purpose Newton-CG solver reduces the total number of matrix-vector products by one order of magnitude. Moreover, the number of non-linear and line-search iterations is mainly smaller but of similar magnitude.</description>

      <title>Improving the Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) stochastic optimizer through an Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) time-stepping approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adam optimizer, often used in Machine Learning for neural network training, corresponds to an underlying ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the limit of very small learning rates. This work shows that the classical Adam algorithm is a first order implicit-explicit (IMEX) Euler discretization of the underlying ODE. Employing the time discretization point of view, we propose new extensions of the Adam scheme obtained by using higher order IMEX methods to solve the ODE. Based on this approach, we derive a new optimization algorithm for neural network training that performs better than classical Adam on several regression and classification problems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Protein Language Model for Unified Molecular Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein language models have demonstrated significant potential in the field of protein engineering. However, current protein language models primarily operate at the residue scale, which limits their ability to provide information at the atom level. This limitation prevents us from fully exploiting the capabilities of protein language models for applications involving both proteins and small molecules. In this paper, we propose ms-ESM (multi-scale ESM), a novel approach that enables multi-scale unified molecular modeling. ms-ESM achieves this by pre-training on multi-scale code-switch protein sequences and utilizing a multi-scale position encoding to capture relationships among residues and atoms. Experimental results indicate that ms-ESM surpasses previous methods in protein-molecule tasks, demonstrating the full utilization of protein language models. Further investigations reveal that through unified molecular modeling, ms-ESM not only gains molecular knowledge but also retains its understanding of proteins.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Multiscale Modeling of the Facet Capsular Ligament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new neural network architecture that strictly enforces constitutive constraints such as polyconvexity, frame-indifference, zero strain energy with zero deformations, and the symmetry of the stress and material stiffness. Additionally, we show that for this neural network, the accuracy is significantly improved by using a Sobolev minimization strategy that includes derivative terms. Using our network and Sobolev minimization, we obtain a NMSE of 0.15% for the energy, 0.815% averaged across the components of the stress, and 5.4% averaged across the components of the stiffness. This machine learned constitutive model was deployed in a finite element simulation of a facet capsular ligament. The displacement fields and stress-strain curves where compared to a multiscale simulation that required running on a GPU based supercomputer. At 70% strain, the model using the neural network had less than 10% relative error in the mean stress value.</description>

      <title>Influence of concentration-dependent material properties on the fracture and debonding of electrode particles with core-shell structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-shell electrode particle designs offer a route to improved lithium-ion battery performance. However, they are susceptible to mechanical damage such as fracture and debonding, which can significantly reduce their lifetime. Using a coupled finite element model, we explore the impacts of diffusion-induced stresses on the failure mechanisms of an exemplar system with an NMC811 core and an NMC111 shell. In particular, we systematically compare the implications of assuming constant material properties against using Li concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient and partial molar volume. With constant material properties, our results show that smaller cores with thinner shells avoid debonding and fracture regimes. When factoring in a concentration-dependent partial molar volume, the maximum values of tensile hoop stress in the shell are found to be significantly lower than those predicted with constant properties, reducing the likelihood of fracture. Furthermore, with a concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient, significant barriers to full electrode utilisation are observed due to reduced lithium mobility at high states of lithiation. This provides a possible explanation for the reduced accessible capacity observed in experiments. Shell thickness is found to be the dominant factor in precluding structural integrity once the concentration dependency is accounted for. These findings shed new light on the performance and effective design of core-shell electrode particles.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Triaging Spoofing using Temporal Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As algorithmic trading and electronic markets continue to transform the landscape of financial markets, detecting and deterring rogue agents to maintain a fair and efficient marketplace is crucial. The explosion of large datasets and the continually changing tricks of the trade make it difficult to adapt to new market conditions and detect bad actors. To that end, we propose a framework that can be adapted easily to various problems in the space of detecting market manipulation. Our approach entails initially employing a labelling algorithm which we use to create a training set to learn a weakly supervised model to identify potentially suspicious sequences of order book states. The main goal here is to learn a representation of the order book that can be used to easily compare future events. Subsequently, we posit the incorporation of expert assessment to scrutinize specific flagged order book states. In the event of an expert's unavailability, recourse is taken to the application of a more complex algorithm on the identified suspicious order book states. We then conduct a similarity search between any new representation of the order book against the expert labelled representations to rank the results of the weak learner. We show some preliminary results that are promising to explore further in this direction</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical methods for the Maxey-Riley equations with Basset history term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Maxey-Riley equations (MRE) describe the motion of a finite-sized, spherical particle in a fluid. Because of wake effects, the force acting on a particle depends on its past trajectory. This is modelled by an integral term in the MRE, also called Basset force, that makes its numerical solution challenging and memory intensive. A recent approach proposed by Prasath, Vasan and Govindarajan exploits connections between the integral term and fractional derivatives to reformulate the MRE as a time-dependent partial differential equation on a semi-infinite pseudo-space. They also propose a numerical algorithm based on polynomial expansions. This paper develops a numerical approach based on finite difference instead, by adopting techniques by Koleva and Fazio and Janelli to cope with the issues of having an unbounded spatial domain. We compare convergence order and computational efficiency for particles of varying size and density of the polynomial expansion by Prasath et al., our finite difference schemes and a direct integrator for the MRE based on multi-step methods proposed by Daitche.</description>

      <title>Data-informed uncertainty quantification for laser-based powder bed fusion additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient approach to quantify the uncertainties associated with the numerical simulations of the laser-based powder bed fusion of metals processes. Our study focuses on a thermomechanical model of an Inconel 625 cantilever beam, based on the AMBench2018-01 benchmark proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The proposed approach consists of a forward uncertainty quantification analysis of the residual strains of the cantilever beam given the uncertainty in some of the parameters of the numerical simulation, namely the powder convection coefficient and the activation temperature. The uncertainty on such parameters is modelled by a data-informed probability density function obtained by a Bayesian inversion procedure, based on the displacement experimental data provided by NIST. To overcome the computational challenges of both the Bayesian inversion and the forward uncertainty quantification analysis we employ a multi-fidelity surrogate modelling technique, specifically the multi-index stochastic collocation method. The proposed approach allows us to achieve a 33\% reduction in the uncertainties on the prediction of residual strains compared with what we would get basing the forward UQ analysis on a-priori ranges for the uncertain parameters, and in particular the mode of the probability density function of such quantities (i.e., its ``most likely value'', roughly speaking) results to be in good agreement with the experimental data provided by NIST, even though only displacement data were used for the Bayesian inversion procedure.</description>

      <title>Bayesian estimation and uncertainty quantification of a temperature-dependent thermal conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a temperature-dependent thermal conductivity model (curve) from temperature measurements. We apply a Bayesian estimation approach that takes into account measurement errors and limited prior information of system properties. The approach intertwines system simulation and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We investigate the impact of assuming different model classes - cubic polynomials and piecewise linear functions - their parametrization, and different types of prior information - ranging from uninformative to informative. Piecewise linear functions require more parameters (conductivity values) to be estimated than the four parameters (coefficients or conductivity values) needed for cubic polynomials. The former model class is more flexible, but the latter requires less MCMC samples. While parametrizing polynomials with coefficients may feel more natural, it turns out that parametrizing them using conductivity values is far more natural for the specification of prior information. Robust estimation is possible for all model classes and parametrizations, as long as the prior information is accurate or not too informative. Gaussian Markov random field priors are especially well-suited for piecewise linear functions.</description>

Abstract: Despite the promising progress in multi-modal tasks, current large multi-modal models (LMMs) are prone to hallucinating inconsistent descriptions with respect to the associated image and human instructions. This paper addresses this issue by introducing the first large and diverse visual instruction tuning dataset, named Large-scale Robust Visual (LRV)-Instruction. Our dataset comprises 400k visual instructions generated by GPT4, covering 16 vision-and-language tasks with open-ended instructions and answers. Unlike existing studies that primarily focus on positive instruction samples, we design LRV-Instruction to include both positive and negative instructions for more robust visual instruction tuning. Our negative instructions are designed at three semantic levels: (i) Nonexistent Object Manipulation, (ii) Existent Object Manipulation and (iii) Knowledge Manipulation. To efficiently measure the hallucination generated by LMMs, we propose GPT4-Assisted Visual Instruction Evaluation (GAVIE), a stable approach to evaluate visual instruction tuning like human experts. GAVIE does not require human-annotated groundtruth answers and can adapt to diverse instruction formats. We conduct comprehensive experiments to investigate the hallucination of LMMs. Our results demonstrate existing LMMs exhibit significant hallucinations when presented with our negative instructions, particularly Existent Object and Knowledge Manipulation instructions. Moreover, we successfully mitigate hallucination by finetuning MiniGPT4 and mPLUG-Owl on LRV-Instruction while improving performance on several public datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we observed that a balanced ratio of positive and negative instances in the training data leads to a more robust model.
