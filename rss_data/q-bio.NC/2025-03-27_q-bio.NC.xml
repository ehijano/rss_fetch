      <title>Neural Learning Rules from Associative Networks Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Associative networks theory is increasingly providing tools to interpret update rules of artificial neural networks. At the same time, deriving neural learning rules from a solid theory remains a fundamental challenge. We make some steps in this direction by considering general energy-based associative networks of continuous neurons and synapses that evolve in multiple time scales. We use the separation of these timescales to recover a limit in which the activation of the neurons, the energy of the system and the neural dynamics can all be recovered from a generating function. By allowing the generating function to depend on memories, we recover the conventional Hebbian modeling choice for the interaction strength between neurons. Finally, we propose and discuss a dynamics of memories that enables us to include learning in this framework.</description>

      <title>Mapping fMRI Signal and Image Stimuli in an Artificial Neural Network Latent Space: Bringing Artificial and Natural Minds Together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this study is to investigate whether latent space representations of visual stimuli and fMRI data share common information. Decoding and reconstructing stimuli from fMRI data remains a challenge in AI and neuroscience, with significant implications for understanding neural representations and improving the interpretability of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In this preliminary study, we investigate the feasibility of such reconstruction by examining the similarity between the latent spaces of one autoencoder (AE) and one vision transformer (ViT) trained on fMRI and image data, respectively. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we found that the latent spaces of the two domains appear different. However, these initial findings are inconclusive, and further research is needed to explore this relationship more thoroughly.</description>

      <title>Human Brain State Analysis Unveils Complexity of Brain Dynamics: Insights from General Anesthesia and ADHD EEG signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain is a complex system exhibiting rich dynamical behavior across various states, including those induced by anesthesia or neurological disorders. Using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, our study investigates the underlying complexity and universal patterns in human brain dynamics across states induced by general anesthesia and neurological disorder of inattentive-type attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We extract relative phase dynamics time series, $\beta(t)$, from EEG signals and compute permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity across the different states using the framework of ordinal patterns. Our results reveal several key findings. First, different brain states exhibit distinct PE values, indicating distinct signatures of information content across states. We find an inverse correlation between entropy and the level of consciousness during general anesthesia. Further, when mapped onto the complexity-entropy causality plane, all brain states, regardless of condition, individual, or $\beta(t)$ time series, align along a single curve, suggesting an underlying universal pattern in brain dynamics. Moreover, compared to well-known stochastic processes (linear underdamped Langevin dynamics, active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and fractional Brownian motion), brain data consistently exhibits higher complexity for any given PE value. Multifractal analysis shows this enhanced complexity likely arises from greater multifractal scaling properties compared to stochastic processes. Our findings highlight the power of ordinal patterns in distinguishing various dynamic brain states and uncovering hidden universal patterns in brain dynamics. Our comprehensive characterization of human brain complexity across states offers valuable insights for future research into consciousness, attention disorders, and neural information processing.</description>

      <title>Pupillary reactions depend on disgust sensitivity in conceptual pavlovian disgust conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exposure-based interventions rely on inhibitory learning, often studied through Pavlovian conditioning. While disgust conditioning is increasingly linked to psychiatric disorders, it has been less researched than fear conditioning. In this study, we applied a categorical Pavlovian disgust conditioning paradigm with two CS categories (animals and tools) and disgusting images as US (e.g., feces). During categorization, acquisition, and extinction phases, we measured eye movements and pupil responses in 44 participants. Consistent with previous results, subjective disgust and US expectancy increased from categorization to acquisition for CS+, along with greater pupil dilation for CS+ than CS-. Higher disgust sensitivity was associated with more generalized and longer lasting disgust experiences, as well as higher expectancy for disgusting images. Pupil response during acquisition and extinction depended on disgust sensitivity: Participants with lower disgust sensitivity showed greater pupil dilation. These findings suggest that individuals with high disgust sensitivity and prolonged expectancy may exhibit physiological differences from less sensitive individuals as early as the acquisition phase. This could inform contamination-based OCD treatments by integrating interventions which focus on attentional deployment or physiological reactions. To our knowledge, this is the first study using pupillometry and eye tracking in categorical disgust conditioning.</description>

      <title>Tracking the topology of neural manifolds across populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural manifolds summarize the intrinsic structure of the information encoded by a population of neurons. Advances in experimental techniques have made simultaneous recordings from multiple brain regions increasingly commonplace, raising the possibility of studying how these manifolds relate across populations. However, when the manifolds are nonlinear and possibly code for multiple unknown variables, it is challenging to extract robust and falsifiable information about their relationships. We introduce a framework, called the method of analogous cycles, for matching topological features of neural manifolds using only observed dissimilarity matrices within and between neural populations. We demonstrate via analysis of simulations and \emph{in vivo} experimental data that this method can be used to correctly identify multiple shared circular coordinate systems across both stimuli and inferred neural manifolds. Conversely, the method rejects matching features that are not intrinsic to one of the systems. Further, as this method is deterministic and does not rely on dimensionality reduction or optimization methods, it is amenable to direct mathematical investigation and interpretation in terms of the underlying neural activity. We thus propose the method of analogous cycles as a suitable foundation for a theory of cross-population analysis via neural manifolds.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dissipation of the Kuramoto model on fruit-fly connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distance from equilibrium using the Kuramoto model via the degree of fluctuation-dissipation violation as the consequence of different levels of edge weight anisotropies. This is achieved by solving the synchronization equations on the raw, homeostatic weighted and a random inhibitory edge variant of a real full fly (FF) connectome, containing $\simeq 10^5$ neuron cell nodes. We investigate these systems close to their synchronization transition critical points. While the topological(graph) dimension is high: $d \simeq 6$ the spectral dimensions of the variants, relevant in describing the synchronization behavior, are lower than the upper critical dimension: $d_s \simeq 2 &lt; d_c=4$, suggesting relevant fluctuation effects and non mean-field scaling behavior. By measuring the auto-correlations and the auto-response functions for small perturbations we calculate the fluctuation-dissipation ratios (FDR) for the different variants of different anisotropy levels of the FF connectome. Numerical evidence is presented that the FDRs follow the level of anisotropy of these non-equilibrium systems in agreement with the expectations. We also compare these results with those on a symmetric random graph of similar size. We provide a detailed network analysis of the FF connectome and calculate the level of hierarchy, also related to the anisotropy. Finally, we provide some partial results for the periodic forced Kuramoto, the Shinomoto-Kuramoto model.</description>

      <title>Development and Validation of a Deep-Learning Model for Differential Treatment Benefit Prediction for Adults with Major Depressive Disorder Deployed in the Artificial Intelligence in Depression Medication Enhancement (AIDME) Study</title>

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The pharmacological treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) relies on a trial-and-error approach. We introduce an artificial intelligence (AI) model aiming to personalize treatment and improve outcomes, which was deployed in the Artificial Intelligence in Depression Medication Enhancement (AIDME) Study. OBJECTIVES: 1) Develop a model capable of predicting probabilities of remission across multiple pharmacological treatments for adults with at least moderate major depression. 2) Validate model predictions and examine them for amplification of harmful biases. METHODS: Data from previous clinical trials of antidepressant medications were standardized into a common framework and included 9,042 adults with moderate to severe major depression. Feature selection retained 25 clinical and demographic variables. Using Bayesian optimization, a deep learning model was trained on the training set, refined using the validation set, and tested once on the held-out test set. RESULTS: In the evaluation on the held-out test set, the model demonstrated achieved an AUC of 0.65. The model outperformed a null model on the test set (p = 0.01). The model demonstrated clinical utility, achieving an absolute improvement in population remission rate in hypothetical and actual improvement testing. While the model did identify one drug (escitalopram) as generally outperforming the other drugs (consistent with the input data), there was otherwise significant variation in drug rankings. On bias testing, the model did not amplify potentially harmful biases. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the first model capable of predicting outcomes for 10 different treatment options for patients with MDD, intended to be used at or near the start of treatment to personalize treatment. The model was put into clinical practice during the AIDME randomized controlled trial whose results are reported separately.</description>

      <title>Two pathways to resolve relational inconsistencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When individuals encounter observations that violate their expectations, when will they adjust their expectations and when will they maintain them despite these observations? For example, when individuals expect objects of type A to be smaller than objects B, but observe the opposite, when will they adjust their expectation about the relationship between the two objects (to A being larger than B)? Naively, one would predict that the larger the violation, the greater the adaptation. However, experiments reveal that when violations are extreme, individuals are more likely to hold on to their prior expectations rather than adjust them. To address this puzzle, we tested the adaptation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) capable of relational learning and found a similar phenomenon: Standard learning dynamics dictates that small violations would lead to adjustments of expected relations while larger ones would be resolved using a different mechanism -- a change in object representation that bypasses the need for adaptation of the relational expectations. These results suggest that the experimentally-observed stability of prior expectations when facing large expectation violations is a natural consequence of learning dynamics and does not require any additional mechanisms. We conclude by discussing the effect of intermediate adaptation steps on this stability.</description>

      <title>CATD: Unified Representation Learning for EEG-to-fMRI Cross-Modal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal neuroimaging analysis is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of brain function and pathology, as it allows for the integration of different imaging techniques, thus overcoming the limitations of individual modalities. However, the high costs and limited availability of certain modalities pose significant challenges. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Condition-Aligned Temporal Diffusion (CATD) framework for end-to-end cross-modal synthesis of neuroimaging, enabling the generation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-detected Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals from more accessible Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. By constructing Conditionally Aligned Block (CAB), heterogeneous neuroimages are aligned into a latent space, achieving a unified representation that provides the foundation for cross-modal transformation in neuroimaging. The combination with the constructed Dynamic Time-Frequency Segmentation (DTFS) module also enables the use of EEG signals to improve the temporal resolution of BOLD signals, thus augmenting the capture of the dynamic details of the brain. Experimental validation demonstrates that the framework improves the accuracy of brain activity state prediction by 9.13% (reaching 69.8%), enhances the diagnostic accuracy of brain disorders by 4.10% (reaching 99.55%), effectively identifies abnormal brain regions, enhancing the temporal resolution of BOLD signals. The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal synthesis of neuroimaging by unifying heterogeneous neuroimaging data into a latent representation space, showing promise in medical applications such as improving Parkinson's disease prediction and identifying abnormal brain regions.</description>

      <title>Desynchronization Index: a New Approach for Exploring Complex Epileptogenic Networks in Stereoelectroencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16347v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new computational framework to assist neurophysiologists in Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) analysis, with the final aim of improving the definition of the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We design a new algorithm, named Desynchronization Index (DI), that classifies as most epileptogenic those SEEG channels that show independent behavior during the seconds preceding the seizure propagation. We test the proposed DI algorithm against the Epileptogenic Index (EI) algorithm on a clinical dataset of 11 patients, considering the neurophysiological evaluation of the EZ as the clinical ground truth. Our results denote that DI overcomes EI in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC=0.81 vs AUC=0.74) while combining the two algorithms as a unique tool leads to the best performance (AUC=0.87). The DI algorithm underscores connectivity dynamics that can hardly be identified with a pure visual analysis, increasing the accuracy of the EZ definition compared to traditional methods. This technique can lead to the definition of a new effective biomarker of the EZ, reducing the burden required by the SEEG review in the case of extensive implants and improving our understanding of the dynamics leading to the generation of seizures.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the Primacy Effect in Structured State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human and animal memory for sequentially presented items is well-documented to be more accurate for those at the beginning and end of the sequence, phenomena known as the primacy and recency effects, respectively. By contrast, artificial neural network (ANN) models are typically designed with a memory that decays monotonically over time. Accordingly, ANNs are expected to show the recency effect but not the primacy effect. Contrary to this theoretical expectation, however, the present study reveals a counterintuitive finding: a recently developed ANN architecture, called structured state-space models, exhibits the primacy effect when trained and evaluated on a synthetic task that mirrors psychological memory experiments. Given that this model was originally designed for recovering neuronal activity patterns observed in biological brains, this result provides a novel perspective on the psychological primacy effect while also posing a non-trivial puzzle for the current theories in machine learning.</description>
