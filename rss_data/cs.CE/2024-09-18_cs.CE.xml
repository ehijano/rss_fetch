      <title>Micropolar elastoplasticity using a fast Fourier transform-based solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a micromechanical spectral formulation for obtaining the full-field and homogenized response of elastoplastic micropolar composites. A closed-form radial-return mapping is derived from thermodynamics-based micropolar elastoplastic constitutive equations to determine the increment of plastic strain necessary to return the generalized stress state to the yield surface, and the algorithm implementation is verified using the method of numerically manufactured solutions. Then, size-dependent material response and micro-plasticity are shown as features that may be efficiently simulated in this micropolar elastoplastic framework. The computational efficiency of the formulation enables the generation of large datasets in reasonable computing times.</description>

      <title>A Knowledge-Inspired Hierarchical Physics-Informed Neural Network for Pipeline Hydraulic Transient Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-pressure transportation process of pipeline necessitates an accurate hydraulic transient simulation tool to prevent slack line flow and over-pressure, which can endanger pipeline operations. However, current numerical solution methods often face difficulties in balancing computational efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, few studies attempt to reform physics-informed learning architecture for pipeline transient simulation with magnitude different in outputs and imbalanced gradient in loss function. To address these challenges, a Knowledge-Inspired Hierarchical Physics-Informed Neural Network is proposed for hydraulic transient simulation of multi-product pipelines. The proposed model integrates governing equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions into the training process to ensure consistency with physical laws. Furthermore, magnitude conversion of outputs and equivalent conversion of governing equations are implemented to enhance the training performance of the neural network. To further address the imbalanced gradient of multiple loss terms with fixed weights, a hierarchical training strategy is designed. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models and can still produce accurate simulation results under complex hydraulic transient conditions, with mean absolute percentage errors reduced by 87.8\% and 92.7 \% in pressure prediction. Thus, the proposed model can conduct accurate and effective hydraulic transient analysis, ensuring the safe operation of pipelines.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Analysis of Limit Cycle Oscillations in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems with the Fourier Generalized Polynomial Chaos Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In engineering, simulations play a vital role in predicting the behavior of a nonlinear dynamical system. In order to enhance the reliability of predictions, it is essential to incorporate the inherent uncertainties that are present in all real-world systems. Consequently, stochastic predictions are of significant importance, particularly during design or reliability analysis. In this work, we concentrate on the stochastic prediction of limit cycle oscillations, which typically occur in nonlinear dynamical systems and are of great technical importance. To address uncertainties in the limit cycle oscillations, we rely on the recently proposed Fourier generalized Polynomial Chaos expansion (FgPC), which combines Fourier analysis with spectral stochastic methods. In this paper, we demonstrate that valuable insights into the dynamics and their variability can be gained with a FgPC analysis, considering different benchmarks. These are the well-known forced Duffing oscillator and a more complex model from cell biology in which highly non-linear electrophysiological processes are closely linked to diffusive processes. With our spectral method, we are able to predict complicated marginal distributions of the limit cycle oscillations and, additionally, for self-excited systems, the uncertainty in the base frequency. Finally we study the sparsity of the FgPC coefficients as a basis for adaptive approximation.</description>

      <title>A clustering adaptive Gaussian process regression method: response patterns based real-time prediction for nonlinear solid mechanics problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulation is powerful to study nonlinear solid mechanics problems. However, mesh-based or particle-based numerical methods suffer from the common shortcoming of being time-consuming, particularly for complex problems with real-time analysis requirements. This study presents a clustering adaptive Gaussian process regression (CAG) method aiming for real-time prediction for nonlinear structural responses in solid mechanics. It is a data-driven machine learning method featuring a small sample size, high accuracy, and high efficiency, leveraging nonlinear structural response patterns. Similar to the traditional Gaussian process regression (GPR) method, it operates in offline and online stages. In the offline stage, an adaptive sample generation technique is introduced to cluster datasets into distinct patterns for demand-driven sample allocation. This ensures comprehensive coverage of the critical samples for the solution space of interest. In the online stage, following the divide-and-conquer strategy, a pre-prediction classification categorizes problems into predefined patterns sequentially predicted by the trained multi-pattern Gaussian process regressor. In addition, dimension reduction and restoration techniques are employed in the proposed method to enhance its efficiency. A set of problems involving material, geometric, and boundary condition nonlinearities is presented to demonstrate the CAG method's abilities. The proposed method can offer predictions within a second and attain high precision with only about 20 samples within the context of this study, outperforming the traditional GPR using uniformly distributed samples for error reductions ranging from 1 to 3 orders of magnitude. The CAG method is expected to offer a powerful tool for real-time prediction of nonlinear solid mechanical problems and shed light on the complex nonlinear structural response pattern.</description>

      <title>An Exploration of Effects of Dark Mode on University Students: A Human Computer Interface Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research dives into exploring the dark mode effects on students of a university. Research is carried out implementing the dark mode in e-Learning sites and its impact on behavior of the users. Students are spending more time in front of the screen for their studies especially after the pandemic. The blue light from the screen during late hours affects circadian rhythm of the body which negatively impacts the health of humans including eye strain and headache. The difficulty that students faced during the time of interacting with various e-Learning sites especially during late hours was analyzed using different techniques of HCI like survey, interview, evaluation methods and principles of design. Dark mode is an option which creates a pseudo inverted adaptable interface by changing brighter elements of UI into a dim-lit friendly environment. It is said that using dark mode will lessen the amount of blue light emitted and benefit students who suffer from eye strain. Students' interactions with dark mode were investigated using a survey, and an e-learning site with a dark mode theme was created. Based on the students' comments, researchers looked into the effects of dark mode on HCI in e-learning sites. The findings indicate that students have a clear preference for dark mode: 79.7% of survey participants preferred dark mode on their phones, and 61.7% said they would be interested in seeing this feature added to e-learning websites.</description>

      <title>Inside Alameda Research: A Multi-Token Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the token transfer network on Ethereum, focusing on accounts associated with Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency trading firm implicated in the misuse of FTX customer funds. Using a multi-token network representation, we examine node centralities and the network backbone to identify critical accounts, tokens, and activity groups. The temporal evolution of Alameda accounts reveals shifts in token accumulation and distribution patterns leading up to its bankruptcy in November 2022. Through network analysis, our work offers insights into the activities and dynamics that shape the DeFi ecosystem.</description>

      <title>CSP-free adaptive Kriging surrogate model method for reliability analysis with small failure probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07010v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of reliability engineering, the Active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo Simulation (AK-MCS) has been developed and demonstrated to be effective in reliability analysis. However, the performance of AK-MCS is sensitive to the size of Candidate Sample Pool (CSP), particularly for systems with small failure probabilities. To address the limitations of conventional AK-MCS that relies on CSP, this paper proposes a CSP-free AK-MCS. The proposed methodology consists of two stages: surrogate model construction and Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the failure probability. In the stage of surrogate model construction, the surrogate model is iteratively refined based on the representative samples selected by solving the optimization problem facilitated by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. To achieve an optimal balance between solution accuracy and efficiency, the penalty intensity control and the density control for the experimental design points are introduced to modify the objective function in optimization. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using numerical examples, and results indicate that by leveraging an optimization algorithm to select representative samples, the proposed CSP-free AK-MCS overcomes the limitations of conventional CSP-based AK-MCS and exhibits exceptional performance in addressing small failure probabilities.</description>
