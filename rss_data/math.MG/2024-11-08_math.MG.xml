      <title>A generalization of the second Pappus-Guldin theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the question of how to calculate the volume of a body in the three-dimensional Euclidean space when it is cut into slices perpendicular to a given curve. The answer is provided by a formula that can be considered as a generalized version of the second Pappus-Guldin theorem. It turns out that the computation becomes very simple if the curve passes directly through the centroids of the perpendicular cross-sections. In this context, the question arises whether a curve with this centroid property exists. We investigate this problem for a convex body $K$ by using the volume distance and certain features of the so-called floating bodies of $K$. As an example, we further determine the non-trivial centroid curves of a triaxial ellipsoid, and finally we apply our results to derive a rather simple formula for determining the centroid of a bent rod.</description>

      <title>Improved kissing numbers in seventeen through twenty-one dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the kissing numbers in 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21 dimensions are at least 5730, 7654, 11692, 19448, and 29768, respectively. The previous records were set by Leech in 1967, and we improve on them by 384, 256, 1024, 2048, and 2048. Unlike the previous constructions, the new configurations are not cross sections of the Leech lattice minimal vectors. Instead, they are constructed by modifying the signs in the lattice vectors to open up more space for additional spheres.</description>

      <title>Volume entropy and rigidity for RCD-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the barycenter technique of Besson--Courtois--Gallot so that it can be applied on RCD metric measure spaces. Given a continuous map $f$ from a non-collapsed RCD$(-(N-1),N)$ space $X$ without boundary to a locally symmetric $N$-manifold we show a version of BCG's entropy-volume inequality. The lower bound involves homological and homotopical indices which we introduce. We prove that when equality holds and these indices coincide $X$ is a locally symmetric manifold, and $f$ is homotopic to a Riemannian covering whose degree equals the indices. Moreover, we show a measured Gromov--Hausdorff stability of $X$ and $Y$ involving the homotopical invariant. As a byproduct, we extend a Lipschitz volume rigidity result of Li--Wang to RCD$(K,N)$ spaces without boundary. Finally, we include an application of these methods to the study of Einstein metrics on $4$-orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Coarse homological invariants of metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by group cohomology, we define several coarse topological invariants of metric spaces. We define the coarse cohomological dimension of a metric space, and demonstrate that if G is a countable group, then the coarse cohomological dimension of G as a metric space coincides with the cohomological dimension of $G$ as a group whenever the latter is finite. Extending a result of Sauer, it is shown that coarse cohomological dimension is monotone under coarse embeddings, and hence is invariant under coarse equivalence. We characterise unbounded quasi-trees as quasi-geodesic metric spaces of coarse cohomological dimension one. A classical theorem of Hopf and Freudenthal states that if G is a finitely generated group, then the number of ends of G is either 0, 1, 2 or $\infty$. We prove a higher-dimensional analogue of this result, showing that if F is a field, G is countable, and $H^k(G,FG)=0$ for k&lt;n, then $\dim H^n(G,FG)$=0,1 or $\infty$, significantly extending a result of Farrell from 1975. Moreover, in the case $\dim H^n(G,FG)=1$, then G must be a coarse Poincar\'e duality group. We prove an analogous result for metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Shannon's inequality on non-collapsing RCD spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Shannon's inequality on non-collapsing $\mathsf{RCD}(0,N)$ spaces. In the proof, we use the characterization of the $\mathsf{EVI}_{0,N}$-gradient flow of the relative entropy and the infinitesimal behavior of the heat kernel. Also we have a cone rigidity result. As an application, we have the so-called uncertainty principle inequality on such spaces.</description>

      <title>Unit and distinct distances in typical norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s' unit distance problem and Erd\H{o}s' distinct distances problem are among the most classical and well-known open problems in discrete mathematics. They ask for the maximum number of unit distances, or the minimum number of distinct distances, respectively, determined by $n$ points in the Euclidean plane. The question of what happens in these problems if one considers normed spaces other than the Euclidean plane has been raised in the 1980s by Ulam and Erd\H{o}s and attracted a lot of attention over the years. We give an essentially tight answer to both questions for almost all norms on $\mathbb{R}^d$, in a certain Baire categoric sense.
  For the unit distance problem we prove that for almost all norms $\|.\|$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, any set of $n$ points defines at most $\frac{1}{2} d \cdot n \log_2 n$ unit distances according to $\|.\|$. We also show that this is essentially tight, by proving that for every norm $\|.\|$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, for any large $n$, we can find $n$ points defining at least $\frac{1}{2}(d-1-o(1))\cdot n \log_2 n$ unit distances according to $\|.\|$.
  For the distinct distances problem, we prove that for almost all norms $\|.\|$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ any set of $n$ points defines at least $(1-o(1))n$ distinct distances according to $\|.\|$. This is clearly tight up to the $o(1)$ term.
  We also answer the famous Hadwiger--Nelson problem for almost all norms on $\mathbb{R}^2$, showing that their unit distance graph has chromatic number $4$.
  Our results settle, in a strong and somewhat surprising form, problems and conjectures of Brass, Matou\v{s}ek, Brass-Moser-Pach, Chilakamarri, and Robertson. The proofs combine combinatorial and geometric ideas with tools from Linear Algebra, Topology and Algebraic Geometry.</description>
