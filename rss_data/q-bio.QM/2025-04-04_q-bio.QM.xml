      <title>Test-time Adaptation for Foundation Medical Segmentation Model without Parametric Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation medical segmentation models, with MedSAM being the most popular, have achieved promising performance across organs and lesions. However, MedSAM still suffers from compromised performance on specific lesions with intricate structures and appearance, as well as bounding box prompt-induced perturbations. Although current test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for medical image segmentation may tackle this issue, partial (e.g., batch normalization) or whole parametric updates restrict their effectiveness due to limited update signals or catastrophic forgetting in large models. Meanwhile, these approaches ignore the computational complexity during adaptation, which is particularly significant for modern foundation models. To this end, our theoretical analyses reveal that directly refining image embeddings is feasible to approach the same goal as parametric updates under the MedSAM architecture, which enables us to realize high computational efficiency and segmentation performance without the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Under this framework, we propose to encourage maximizing factorized conditional probabilities of the posterior prediction probability using a proposed distribution-approximated latent conditional random field loss combined with an entropy minimization loss. Experiments show that we achieve about 3\% Dice score improvements across three datasets while reducing computational complexity by over 7 times.</description>

      <title>Quantitative assessment of biological dynamics with aggregate data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and apply a learning framework for parameter estimation in initial value problems that are assessed only indirectly via aggregate data such as sample means and/or variances. Our comprehensive framework follows Bayesian principles and consists of specialized Markov chain Monte Carlo computational schemes that rely on modified Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to align with summary statistic constraints and a novel elliptical slice sampler adapted to the parameters of biological models. We benchmark our methods with synthetic data on microbial growth in batch culture and test them on real growth curve data from laboratory replication experiments on $\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ microbes. The results indicate that our learning framework can utilize experimental or historical data and lead to robust parameter estimation and data assimilation in ODE models of biological dynamics that outperform least-squares fitting.</description>

      <title>SCMPPI: Supervised Contrastive Multimodal Framework for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) prediction is a key task in uncovering cellular functional networks and disease mechanisms. However, traditional experimental methods are time-consuming and costly, and existing computational models face challenges in cross-modal feature fusion, robustness, and false-negative suppression. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised contrastive multimodal framework, SCMPPI, for PPI prediction. By integrating protein sequence features (AAC, DPC, CKSAAP-ESMC) with PPI network topology information (Node2Vec graph embedding), and combining an improved supervised contrastive learning strategy, SCMPPI significantly enhances PPI prediction performance. For the PPI task, SCMPPI introduces a negative sample filtering mechanism and modifies the contrastive loss function, effectively optimizing multimodal features. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including yeast, human, and H.pylori, show that SCMPPI outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods (such as DF-PPI and TAGPPI) in key metrics such as accuracy ( 98.01%) and AUC (99.62%), and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-species prediction (AUC &gt; 99% on multi-species datasets). Furthermore, SCMPPI has been successfully applied to CD9 networks, the Wnt pathway, and cancer-specific networks, providing a reliable tool for disease target discovery. This framework also offers a new paradigm for multimodal biological information fusion and contrastive learning in collaborative optimization for various combined predictions.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Representations of scRNA-seq Data for Improved Clustering with Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data is often conducted through network projections such as coexpression networks, primarily due to the abundant availability of network analysis tools for downstream tasks. However, this approach has several limitations: loss of higher-order information, inefficient data representation caused by converting a sparse dataset to a fully connected network, and overestimation of coexpression due to zero-inflation. To address these limitations, we propose conceptualizing scRNA-seq expression data as hypergraphs, which are generalized graphs in which the hyperedges can connect more than two vertices. In the context of scRNA-seq data, the hypergraph nodes represent cells and the edges represent genes. Each hyperedge connects all cells where its corresponding gene is actively expressed and records the expression of the gene across different cells. This hypergraph conceptualization enables us to explore multi-way relationships beyond the pairwise interactions in coexpression networks without loss of information. We propose two novel clustering methods: (1) the Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (DIPHW) and (2) the Coexpression and Memory-Integrated Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (CoMem-DIPHW). They outperform established methods on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. The improvement brought by our proposed methods is especially significant when data modularity is weak. Furthermore, CoMem-DIPHW incorporates the gene coexpression network, cell coexpression network, and the cell-gene expression hypergraph from the single-cell abundance counts data altogether for embedding computation. This approach accounts for both the local level information from single-cell level gene expression and the global level information from the pairwise similarity in the two coexpression networks.</description>

      <title>Anti-pathogenic property of thermophile-fermented compost as a feed additive and its in vivo external diagnostic imaging in a fish model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermentation of organisms for recycling is important for the efficient cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus resources for a sustainable society, but the functionality of fermented products needs to be evaluated. Here, we clarify the anti-pathogenic properties for fish of a compost-type feed additive fermented by thermophilic Bacillaceae using non-edible marine resources as raw materials. After prior administration of the compost extract to seabream as a fish model for 70 days, the mortality rate after 28 days of exposure to the fish pathogen Edwardsiella reached a maximum of 20%, although the rate was 60% without prior administration. Under such conditions, the serum complement activity of seabream increased, and the recovery time after anesthesia treatment was also fasten. Furthermore, texture and HSV analysis using field photos statistically visualized differences in the degree of smoothness and gloss of the fish body surface depending on the administration. These results suggest that thermophile-fermented compost is effective as a functional feed additive against fish disease infection, and that such soundness can be estimated by body surface analysis. This study provides a new perspective for the natural symbiosis industry, as well as for the utilization of field non-invasive diagnosis to efficiently estimate the quality of its production activities.</description>

      <title>Topology of surface electromyogram signals: hand gesture decoding on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\textit{Objective.}$ In this article, we present data and methods for decoding hand gestures using surface electromyogram (EMG) signals. EMG-based upper limb interfaces are valuable for amputee rehabilitation, artificial supernumerary limb augmentation, gestural control of computers, and virtual and augmented reality applications. $\textit{Approach.}$ To achieve this, we collect EMG signals from the upper limb using surface electrodes placed at key muscle sites involved in hand movements. Additionally, we design and evaluate efficient models for decoding EMG signals. $\textit{Main results.}$ Our findings reveal that the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices serves as an effective embedding space for EMG signals. Moreover, for the first time, we quantify the distribution shift of these signals across individuals. $\textit{Significance.}$ Overall, our approach demonstrates significant potential for developing efficient and interpretable methods for decoding EMG signals. This is particularly important as we move toward the broader adoption of EMG-based wrist interfaces.</description>

      <title>Generalists vs. Specialists: Evaluating LLMs on Highly-Constrained Biophysical Sequence Optimization Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22296v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in biomolecule optimization problems, they incur heavy computational costs and struggle to satisfy precise constraints. On the other hand, specialized solvers like LaMBO-2 offer efficiency and fine-grained control but require more domain expertise. Comparing these approaches is challenging due to expensive laboratory validation and inadequate synthetic benchmarks. We address this by introducing Ehrlich functions, a synthetic test suite that captures the geometric structure of biophysical sequence optimization problems. With prompting alone, off-the-shelf LLMs struggle to optimize Ehrlich functions. In response, we propose LLOME (Language Model Optimization with Margin Expectation), a bilevel optimization routine for online black-box optimization. When combined with a novel preference learning loss, we find LLOME can not only learn to solve some Ehrlich functions, but can even outperform LaMBO-2 on moderately difficult Ehrlich variants. However, LLOME is comparable to LaMBO-2 on very easy or difficult variants, exhibits some likelihood-reward miscalibration, and struggles without explicit rewards. Our results indicate LLMs can provide significant benefits in some cases, but specialized solvers are still competitive and incur less overhead.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Molecule Synthesizability via Retrosynthetic Planning and Reaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant challenge in wet lab experiments with current drug design generative models is the trade-off between pharmacological properties and synthesizability. Molecules predicted to have highly desirable properties are often difficult to synthesize, while those that are easily synthesizable tend to exhibit less favorable properties. As a result, evaluating the synthesizability of molecules in general drug design scenarios remains a significant challenge in the field of drug discovery. The commonly used synthetic accessibility (SA) score aims to evaluate the ease of synthesizing generated molecules, but it falls short of guaranteeing that synthetic routes can actually be found. Inspired by recent advances in top-down synthetic route generation and forward reaction prediction, we propose a new, data-driven metric to evaluate molecule synthesizability. This novel metric leverages the synergistic duality between retrosynthetic planners and reaction predictors, both of which are trained on extensive reaction datasets. To demonstrate the efficacy of our metric, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of round-trip scores across a range of representative molecule generative models.</description>
