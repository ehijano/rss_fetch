      <title>A possible wave-optical effect in lensed FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic extragalactic bursts whose properties are still largely unknown, but based on their extremely small time duration, they are proposed to have a compact structure, making them candidates for wave-optical effects if gravitational lensed. If an FRB is lensed into multiple-images bursts at different times by a galaxy or cluster, a likely scenario is that only one image is detected, because the others fall outside the survey area and time frame. Aims: In this work we explore the FRB analog of quasar microlensing, namely the collective microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy, now with wave optics included. The eikonal regime is applicable here. Methods. We study the voltage (rather than the intensity) in a simple simulation consisting of (a) microlensing stars, and (b) plasma scattering by a turbulent interstellar medium. Results: The auto-correlation of the voltage shows peaks (at order-microsecond separations) corresponding to wave-optical interference between lensed micro-images. The peaks are frequency dependent if plasma-scattering is significant. While qualitative and still in need of more realistic simulations, the results suggest that a strongly-lensed FRB could be identified from a single image. Conclusions: Microlensing could sniff out macro-lensed FRBs</description>

      <title>Chemical enrichment of ICM within the A3266 cluster I: radial profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the elemental abundances distribution of the intracluster medium (ICM) within the A3266 cluster using {\it XMM-Newton} observations. This analysis uses EPIC-pn data, including a new energy scale calibration, which allows us to measure velocities with uncertainties down to $\Delta v \sim 80$ km/s, and MOS observations. We measured radial O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe profiles. This is the first study of elemental abundances beyond Fe using X-ray observations within the A3266 cluster. The abundance profiles display discontinuities similar to those obtained for the temperature. We modeled the X/Fe ratio profiles with a linear combination of type~Ia supernovae (SNIa) and core-collapse supernovae (SNcc) models. We found that the SNIa ratio over the total cluster enrichment tends to be uniform, with a $42\pm 5\%$ contribution. Such a trend supports an early ICM enrichment scenario, with most metals produced before clustering.</description>

      <title>Dust continuum radiation maps from MHD simulations of accretion-ejection systems around single and binary stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the launching of magnetized jets from a resistive circumstellar disk within a binary system, employing a unique combination of 3D MHD jet launching simulations (PLUTO code) and post-processed 3D radiative transfer modeling (RADMC-3D code). Our findings reveal a well-defined jet originating from the inner region of the disk, extending to a larger disk area. While the model attains steady states for a single star, a binary system leads to the emergence of tidal effects such as the formation of ``spiral arms'' in the disk and inside the jet. Here we have consistently implemented a time-dependent Roche potential for the gravity of the binary. As a major step forward, we further present the first 3D radiation maps of the dust continuum for the disk-jet structure. In principle, this allows us to compare MHD simulation results to observed disk-outflow features. We, therefore, present convolved images of the dust continuum emission, employing exemplary point spread functions of the MIRI instrument (5~$\mu m$ band) and the ALMA array (320~$\mu m$ band). In these bands, we identify distinguishable features of the disk-jet structure, such as "spiral arms," which we have also seen in the MHD dynamics.For gas density increased by an order of magnitude, the disk become optically thick at 5~$\mu m$, but remains bright at 320~$\mu$m. At this wavelength, 320~$\mu$m, enhanced structural features in the disk and the base of the wind become more pronounced and are well resolved in the convolved image.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Magnetic Field Amplification in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a binary neutron stars merger is governed by physics under the most extreme conditions, including strong spacetime curvature, ultra-high matter densities, luminous neutrino emission and the rapid amplification of the initial neutron star magnetic fields. Here we systematically explore how sensitive the magnetic field evolution is to the total mass of the merging binary, to the mass ratio of its components, the stellar spins and to the equation of state. For this purpose, we analyze 16 state-of-the-art GRMHD simulations that employ a subgrid-scale model to account for the unresolved small-scale turbulence. We find that strong and rapid amplification of the magnetic field to volume-averaged values of $\sim 10^{16}$~G in the high-density regions is a very robust outcome of a neutron star merger and this result is only marginally impacted by either mass, mass ratio, spin or equation of state.</description>

      <title>The nature of spectral variability of the accreting pulsar Centaurus X-3 unveiled by NuSTAR observation covering two orbital cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a $369\;{\rm ks}$ NuSTAR observation on the X-ray pulsar Centaurus X-3, which covered two consecutive orbital cycles of the source, including two eclipse durations. We investigated the orbital-phase spectral variability over the two orbital cycles. We divided the entire observation data into multiple segments, each covering an orbital interval of $\Delta\Phi=0.005$. The phenomenological spectral modeling applied to these orbital-phase-resolved spectra reveals that the photon index is the key parameter with the most variability and a strong correlation with the continuum flux. The photon index becomes softer during the high-flux phases and harder in the low-flux phases. The relation between the photon index and continuum flux remains consistent when investigating specific spin phases, suggesting that the spectral variability originates from extrinsic factors apart from the neutron star. Furthermore, the 3-5 keV pulse fraction also exhibits variability, being enhanced in the high-flux phases and suppressed in the low-flux phases, which indicates the presence of multiple emission components with different pulse fractions. These phenomenological analysis results enabled us to estimate the physical origin of the spectral variability. We successfully fitted the orbital-phase-resolved spectra with a physical model that assumes (1) stable emission from the neutron star, (2) attenuation by inhomogeneous, clumpy stellar wind, and (3) an additional non-pulsed emission component arising from thermal emission from the accretion disk. The thermal emission from the accretion disk can be described by a blackbody with a temperature of $kT\sim0.5\;{\rm keV}$ and a luminosity of $\sim10^{37}\;{\rm erg\;s^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic r-Process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae III: Self-Consistent Spectral and Light Curve Modeling of the GW170817 Kilonova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed spectra and light curves of the kilonova produced by the GW170817 binary neutron star merger provide complementary insights, but self-consistently modeling both the spectral- and time-domain has proven challenging. Here, we model the optical/infrared light curves of the GW170817 kilonova, using the properties and physical conditions of the ejecta as inferred from detailed modeling of its spectra. Using our software tool SPARK, we first infer the $r$-process abundance pattern of the kilonova ejecta from spectra obtained at 1.4, 2.4, 3.4, and 4.4 days post-merger. From these abundances, we compute time-dependent radioactive heating rates and the wavelength-, time-, and velocity-dependent opacities of the ejecta. We use these inferred heating rates and opacities to inform a kilonova light curve model, to self-consistently reproduce the observed early-time light curves and to infer a total ejecta mass of $M_{\mathrm{ej}} = {0.11}~M_{\odot}$, towards the higher end of that inferred from previous studies. The combination of a large ejecta mass from our light curve modeling and the presence of both red and blue ejecta from our spectral modeling suggests the existence of a highly magnetized hypermassive neutron star remnant that survives for $\sim$$0.01 - 0.5$ s and launches a blue wind, followed by fast, red neutron-rich winds launched from a magnetized accretion disk. By modeling both spectra and light curves together, we demonstrate how combining information from both the spectral and time domains can more robustly determine the physical origins of the ejected material.</description>

      <title>Unified Solar Modulation Potential for Same-Charge Cosmic Rays and Implications for Local Interstellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy spectra of cosmic rays (CRs) below tens of GeV are significantly modulated by solar activity within the heliosphere. To investigate the properties of Galactic CRs, it is important to determine the unmodulated local interstellar spectrum (LIS). Recent high-precision temporal measurements of CR energy spectra, released by the AMS-02 collaboration, provide a crucial observational foundation for this endeavor. In this study, we employ the widely used force-field approximation (FFA) model to analyze the AMS-02 data, and attempt to derive the LIS for CR protons and positrons. By applying a non-LIS method, we derive temporal variations of the relative solar modulation potential, $\Delta\phi$, for individual particle species. Our analysis demonstrates that the FFA provides sufficient accuracy in explaining the AMS-02 spectral measurements of all particles during the low solar activity period. Notably, the derived $\Delta\phi(t)$ for protons and positrons, as well as for electrons and antiprotons, exhibit excellent consistency, indicating that particles with the same charge sign can be effectively described within a unified FFA framework during the low solar activity period. Having established a well-constrained proton LIS and its associated modulation potential, we apply the common modulation behavior between positrons and protons to demodulate the AMS-02 positron measurements, and derive the positron LIS without necessitating prior knowledge of its characteristics. This LIS is useful for quantitative investigations into potential exotic origins of CR positrons.</description>

      <title>The origin of X-ray intra-day variability in HBL PKS 2155-304</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin and physics of X-ray intra-day variability (IDV) in blazars, which is a long-standing issue, is studied by modelling the broad-band X-ray spectrum, the light curves (LCs), and the Fourier time lags. We present the timing analysis of three archived XMM-Newton observations with a total exposure of $&gt;80$ ks of PKS 2155-304, which is one of the brightest and most studied HBLs in the X-ray band. For each observation, we constructed averaged X-ray spectra in 0.5-10 keV band, as well as 100 s binned LCs in various sub-bands. We performed the Bayesian power spectral density (PSD) analysis and Fourier time-lag analyses of the variable LCs. The results are carefully modelled in the context of a multi-zone jet model. PSD analysis reveals that the X-ray variability can be characterised by red noise. The lag-frequency spectra measured in two observations show only the soft or negative lags, with the magnitude of the lags increasing as the frequency decreases. For another observation, the lag-frequency spectra are characterised by small positive or zero time lags at the lowest frequencies, which drops to negative values at higher frequencies. The magnitude of the soft lags ranges from $\sim5$ to $\sim40$ minutes, and increases with the energy difference of two compared LCs. The observed X-ray spectra and lag-frequency spectra can both be successfully described by our proposed two-zone model, with the physical parameters constrained in a fully acceptable space. Moreover, the LC profiles at different energy bands can be satisfactorily reproduced by only varying the injection rate of the energetic electrons. The IDV of PKS 2155-304 should be caused by the injection of energetic electrons, and accelerated by shocks formed in a weakly magnetised jet.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Constraints on the Flux of Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of a $\simeq220$~PeV muon neutrino by the KM3NeT neutrino telescope offers an unprecedented opportunity to probe the Universe at extreme energies. We analyze the origin of this event under three scenarios, viz., a transient point source, a diffuse astrophysical emission, and line-of-sight interaction of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECR; $E \gtrsim 0.1$~EeV). Our analysis includes the flux from both a KM3NeT-only fit and a joint fit, incorporating data from KM3NeT, IceCube, and Pierre Auger Observatory. If the neutrino event originates from transients, it requires a new population of transient that is energetic, gamma-ray dark, and more abundant than known ones. In the framework of diffuse astrophysical emission, we compare the required local UHECR energy injection rate at $\gtrsim4$ EeV, assuming a proton primary, with the rate derived from the flux measurements by Auger. This disfavors the KM3NeT-only fit at all redshifts, while the joint fit remains viable for $z\gtrsim 1$, based on redshift evolution models of known source populations. For cosmogenic origin from point sources, our results suggest that the luminosity obtained at redshifts $z \lesssim 1$ from the joint fit is compatible with the Eddington luminosity of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Evidence for GeV Gamma-Ray Emission from Intense GRB 240529A During the Afterglow's Shallow Decay Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray light curves of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows exhibit various features, with the shallow decay phase being particularly puzzling. While some studies report absence of the X-ray shallow decay for hyper-energetic GRBs, recently discovered GRB 240529A shows a clear shallow decay phase with an isotropic gamma-ray energy of \SI{2.2e54}{erg}, making it a highly unusual case compared to typical GRBs. In order to investigate the physical mechanism of the shallow decay, we perform the \textit{Fermi}-LAT analysis of GRB 240529A along with \textit{Swift}-XRT analysis. We find no jet break feature in the X-ray light curve and then give the lower bound of the collimation-corrected jet energy of $&gt;10^{52}$~erg, which is close to the maximum rotational energy of a magnetar. Our LAT data analysis reveals evidence of GeV emission with a statistical significance of $4.5\sigma$ during the shallow decay phase, which can be interpreted as the first case for hyper-energetic GRBs with a typical shallow decay phase. The GeV to keV flux ratio is calculated to be $4.2\pm2.3$. Together with X-ray spectral index, this indicates an inverse Compton origin of the GeV emission. Multiwavelength modeling based on time-dependent simulations tested two promising models, the energy injection and wind models. Both models can explain the X-ray and gamma-ray data, while our modeling demonstrates that gamma-ray observations, along with future GeV--TeV observations by CTAO, will distinguish between them.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization of accreting black holes: Cyg X-1 and Swift J1727.8-1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer is an X-ray observatory measuring the X-ray polarization in the 2-8 keV energy range. Highly sensitive to the system's geometry, X-ray polarization is a unique method to probe the structure of X-ray binaries. The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observed the High-Mass X-ray Binary Cygnus X-1 and the Low-Mass X-ray Binary Swift J1727.8-1613 in different accretion states: in the hard state and in the soft state. The X-ray polarimetry analysis of both sources shows a linear polarization degree increasing with energy, with higher values in the hard state than in the soft state. However, the linear polarization angle stays similar in both states and is aligned with the radio jet within $5^\circ$. Furthermore, the Low-Mass X-ray Binary Swift J1727.8-1613 has a lower optical intrinsic polarization and a lower X-ray polarization degree for a softer spectrum. The similarities observed in this analysis between the X-ray polarization results of different types of X-ray Binaries show that the innermost accretion processes are independent of the companion star's type.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Measurement of Supermassive Black Hole Masses: QPE Timing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. More and more analyses show that (at least a fraction of) QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. Previous studies have shown that the SMO trajectory can be reconstructed from QPE timing data, consequently the SMBH mass can be robustly measured from tracing a single SMO. In this Letter, we construct a comprehensive Bayesian framework for implementing the QPE timing method, explore the optimal QPE observation strategy for measuring SMBH masses, and forecast the measurement precision expected in the era of multi-target X-ray telescope, Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters (CATCH). As a result, we find the QPE timing method is of great potential in precise measurement of SMBH masses (and spins), especially in the lower mass end ($\lesssim 10^7 M_\odot$) where QPEs prevail and relevant dynamical timescales are reasonably short to be measured.</description>

      <title>Interstellar scintillation of sources B0821+394 and B1812+412 as observed by the LPA LPI radio telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for long-term variability of compact components of radio sources B0821+394 and B1812+412 over an interval of 10 years was carried out. The LPA LPI radio telescope with an operating frequency of 111 MHz was used for observations. According to our estimates, the characteristic time of variability for both sources is 1.5-2.5 years. It is shown that the observed variability is not related to intrinsic variations in the radiation flux, but is due to refractive scintillation on inhomogeneities of the interstellar medium. From the obtained upper estimates of the apparent angular dimensions of the sources, it follows that the main contribution to the scattering of radio emission is made by turbulent plasma concentrated in sufficiently thin screens, the distance to which does not exceed 300-400 pc.</description>

      <title>Bright bursts with sub-millisecond structures of FRB 20230607A in a highly magnetized environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observations of a repeating FRB 20230607A for 15.6 hours spanning 16 months using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) with the detection of 565 bursts. We present three bright bursts with detailed temporal/spectral structures. We also report that one burst carries a narrow component with a width of only 0.3 ms, which is surrounded by broader components. This suggests that repeaters can make both narrow and broad components in one burst. With the narrow spike, we precisely measure the dispersion measure (DM) of $362.85 \pm 0.15 \;{\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}$ and the Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of and $-12249.0\pm 1.5 \; {\rm rad\,m^{-2}}$. We also analyze the statistical distribution of the burst parameters, including waiting times, temporal widths, central frequencies and frequency widths, fluences and energies, all showing typical distributions of known active repeaters. In particular, most bursts show narrow spectra with $\Delta\nu/\nu_0 = 0.125\pm 0.001$. This fact, together with the narrow 0.3 ms spike, strongly suggests a magnetospheric origin of the FRB emission. Based on a predicted correlation between RM and the luminosity of a persistent radio source (PRS) by Yang et al., we predict that PRS should have a specific luminosity of the order of $10^{29} \ {\rm erg \ s^{-1} \ Hz^{-1}}$ and encourage a search for such a PRS.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a bimodal luminosity distribution in persistent Be/X-ray pulsar 2RXP J130159.6-635806</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of 2RXP J130159.6-635806, a persistent low-luminosity Be/X-ray pulsar, focusing on its transition to a spin equilibrium state and the discovery of a bimodal luminosity distribution revealing possibly a new accretion regime. Using data from NuSTAR, Swift, XMM-Newton, and Chandra observatories, we investigate changes in the pulsar's timing and spectral properties. After more than 20 years of continuous spin-up, the pulsar's spin period stabilized, marking the onset of spin equilibrium. This transition was accompanied by the emergence of a previously unobserved accretion regime at $L_{\rm bol} = (2.0_{-1.0}^{+2.3})\times 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, an order of magnitude lower than its earlier quiescent state. After that, the source occasionally switched between these regimes, remaining in each state for extended periods, with the transition time from a luminosity of $10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ taking less than 2.3 day. The analysis of the spectral data collected during this new low-luminosity state revealed a two-hump shape which is different from the cutoff power-law spectra observed at higher luminosities. The discovery of pulsations in this state, together with the hard spectral shape, demonstrates ongoing accretion. We estimate the magnetic field strength to be $\sim 10^{13}$ G based on indirect methods. Additionally, we report a hint of a previously undetected $\sim$90-day orbital period in the system.</description>

      <title>Role of Matter Inhomogeneity on Fast Flavor Conversion of Supernova Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the impact of a spatially varying matter potential $\lambda$, coming from neutrino-electron forward scattering, on the emergence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC) triggered by the presence of zero crossings in the angular distribution of the neutrino electron lepton number (ELN). We find that FFC can be significantly affected as the spatial variation rate of $\lambda$ increases, and strong spatial variations can completely stabilize initially unstable systems. Using stability analysis based solely on initial conditions, we identified for the first time a critical variation rate above which no FFC occurs even if the flavor instability exists. By analyzing several representative matter profiles based on an 18 $M_{\odot}$ SN model, we show that spatially inhomogeneous $\lambda$ can suppress the occurrence of FFC associated with shallow ELN zero crossings in most of the SN's radial region, especially during the accretion phase. Our finding highlights the need to consider the impact of matter inhomogeneity in the development of improved SN models that aim to include the effect of neutrino flavor conversions.</description>

      <title>The morphology of supernova remnant G0.9+0.1 implies explosion by jittering-jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I examine the morphology of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (SNR) G0.9+0.1 and reveal a point-symmetrical morphology that implies shaping by three or more pairs of jets, as expected in the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The large northwest protrusion, the ear (or lobe), has two bright rims. I compare this ear with its rims to an ear with three rims of a jet-shaped planetary nebula and jets from an active galactic nucleus that shaped several rims on one side. Based on this similarity, I argue that two jets or more shaped the northwest ear of SNR G0.9+0.1 and its two rims. I identified the bright region south of the main shell of SNR G0.9+0.1 as a jet-shaped blowout formed by a jet that broke out from the main SNR shell. I base this on the similarity of the blowout of SNR G0.9+0.1 with that of SNR G309.2-00.6, argued in the past to be shaped by jets. I identify four symmetry axes along different directions that compose the point-symmetric morphology of SNR G0.9+0.1. I show that the morphological features of holes, granular texture, and random filaments exist in CCSNe and planetary nebulae and are unlikely to result from some unique processes in CCSNe. These structures result from similar instabilities in the JJEM and the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism and, unlike a point-symmetric morphology, cannot determine the explosion mechanism. Identifying SNR G0.9+0.1 as a new point-symmetric CCSN strengthens the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>A magnetar powers the luminous supernova 2023pel, associated with a long gamma-ray burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore SN 2023pel, the most recent event associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), specifically GRB 230812B. SN 2023pel has a high luminosity and low expansion velocities compared to other GRB-SNe. These properties seem difficult to reconcile with a single nickel power source. We searched for models that can explain the properties of this event. We calculated a grid of hydrodynamic models based on pre-SN structures derived from evolutionary calculations. We compared our models with observations of SN~2023pel and selected our preferred model using statistical analysis, taking both light curves and expansion velocities into account. This allowed us to derive a set of physical properties for SN~2023pel. Our models suggest that the most probable scenario involves a millisecond magnetar as the primary power source, supplemented by energy from radioactive decay. Our preferred model has a spin period of P = 3.2 ms, a magnetic field of B = 28 x 10^14 G, an explosion energy of 2.3 foe, a nickel mass of M_Ni= 0.24 solar masses, and an ejected mass of 3.4 solar masses. Alternatively, we find that a purely nickel-powered model also provides a good match with the observations, though M_Ni &gt; 0.8 solar masses are always required. However, the combination of such high values of M_Ni and low M_ej is difficult to reconcile, indicating that this scenario is less probable. We have also identified a specific region within the peak luminosity-velocity plane where an additional energy source beyond nickel may be necessary to power SNe with characteristics similar to SN~2023pel. Our study indicates that an additional energy source beyond radioactive decay is essential to explain the high brightness and relatively low expansion velocities of SN 2023pel. A magnetar-powered model, similar to the models proposed for the very luminous GRB-SN 2011kl, aligns well with these characteristics.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Lens Caustics with Gravitational Waves: A Uniform Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near fold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA), focusing on binary mass lenses-axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave methods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due to highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate description of the wave field near folds, resolving the breakdown of Geometrical Optics at caustics and improving upon Transitional Asymptotics-based on Airy function approximations-which lack global validity. Central to our approach is the concept of the caustic width, $d_c$, a characteristic length scale defining the region where diffraction significantly alters wave propagation. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the gravitational wavelength as ~ $ \lambda^{2/3}$ and inversely with the redshifted lens mass as ~ $ M_{Lz}^{-2/3}$. The wave amplification near the fold grows as ~ $ d_c^{-1/4}$, substantially enhancing the signal and potentially playing a key role in the detection of gravitational waves lensed near caustics. Notably, for lens masses below the galactic scale, the caustic width for gravitational waves is not negligible compared to the Einstein radius-as it is in electromagnetic lensing-making the UA essential for accurately capturing wave effects.</description>

      <title>High-$z$ radio Quasars in RACS I: Selection, identification, and multi-wavelength properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio-bright, jetted quasars at $z&gt;5$ serve as unique laboratories for studying supermassive black hole activity in the early Universe. In this work, we present a sample of high-$z$ jetted quasars selected from the combination of the radio Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) with deep wide-area optical/near-infrared surveys. From this cross-match we selected 45 new high-$z$ radio quasar candidates with S$_{888MHz}&gt;1$ mJy and mag$z&lt;21.3$ over an area of 16000deg$^2$. Using spectroscopic observations, we confirmed the high-$z$ nature of 24 new quasars, 13 at $4.5&lt;z&lt;5$ and 11 at $z&gt;5$. If we also consider similar, in terms of radio/optical fluxes and sky position, quasars at $z&gt;5$ already reported in the literature, the overall $z&gt;5$ RACS sample is composed by 33 powerful quasars, expected to be ~90% complete at mag$z&lt;21.3$ and S$_{888MHz}&gt;1$ mJy. Having rest-frame radio luminosities in the range $\nu L_{1.4GHz}=10^{41.5}-10^{44.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$, this sample contains the most extreme radio quasars currently known in the early Universe. We also present all X-ray and radio data currently available for the sample, including new, dedicated {\it Chandra}, uGMRT, MeerKAT and ATCA observations for a sub-set of the sources. from the modelling of their radio emission, either with a single power law or a broken power law, we found that these systems have a wide variety of spectral shapes with most quasars (22) having a flat radio emission (i.e., $-0.5&lt;\alpha_{r}&lt;0.5$). At the same time, the majority of the sources with X-ray coverage present a high-energy luminosity larger than the one expected from the X-ray corona only. Both the radio and X-ray properties of the high-$z$ RACS sample suggest that many of these sources have relativistic jets oriented close to our line of sight. (i.e., blazars) and can therefore be used to perform statistical studies on the entire jetted population at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Cosmogenic neutrinos as probes of new physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering of extremely energetic cosmic rays with both cosmic microwave background and extragalactic background light, can produce $\mathcal{O}(10^{18} \,{\rm eV})$ neutrinos, known as cosmogenic neutrinos. These neutrinos are the only messengers from the extreme cosmic accelerators that can reveal the origin of the most energetic cosmic rays. Consequently, much effort is being devoted to achieving their detection. In particular, the GRAND project aims to observe the $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar \nu_\tau$ components of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in the near future using radio antennas. In this work, we investigate how the detection of cosmogenic neutrinos by GRAND can be used to probe beyond the Standard Model physics. We identify three well-motivated scenarios which induce distinct features in the cosmogenic neutrino spectrum at Earth: neutrino self-interactions mediated by a light scalar ($\nu$SI), pseudo-Dirac neutrinos (PD$\nu$) and neutrinos scattering on ultra-light Dark Matter ($\nu$DM). We show these scenarios can be tested by GRAND, using 10 years of cosmogenic neutrino data, in a region of parameter space complementary to current experiments. For the $\nu$SI model,, we find that GRAND can constrain the coupling to $\nu_\tau$ in the range [$10^{-2},10^{-1}$] for a scalar with mass in the range 0.1 to 1 GeV. For PD$\nu$, we find that GRAND is sensitive to sterile-active mass squared splitting in the range [$10^{-15},10^{-13}$] ${\rm eV}^2$. Finally, for the $\nu$DM model, assuming a heavy mediator, GRAND can do substantially better than the current limits from other available data. These results rely on the fact that the actual cosmogenic flux is around the corner, not far from the current IceCube limit.</description>

Abstract: In the coming age of precision neutrino physics, neutrinos from the Sun become robust probes of the conditions of the solar core. Here, we focus on $^8$B neutrinos, for which there are already high precision measurements by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory and Super-Kamiokande. Using only basic physical principles and straightforward statistical tools, we calculate projected constraints on the temperature and density of the $^8$B neutrino production zone compared to a reference solar model. We outline how to better understand the astrophysics of the solar interior using forthcoming neutrino data and solar models.</description>

      <title>An obscured quasar census with the 4MOST IR AGN survey: design, predicted properties, and scientific goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the 4MOST IR AGN survey, the first large-scale optical spectroscopic survey characterizing mid-infrared (MIR) selected obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). The survey targets $\approx 212,000$ obscured infrared (IR) AGN candidates over $\approx 10,000 \rm \: deg^2$ down to a magnitude limit of $r_{\rm AB}=22.8 \, \rm mag$ and will be $\approx 100 \times$ larger than any existing obscured IR AGN spectroscopic sample. We select the targets using a MIR colour criterion applied to the unWISE catalogue from the WISE all-sky survey, and then apply a $r-W2\geq 5.9 \rm \: mag$ cut; we demonstrate that this selection will mostly identify sources obscured by $N_{\rm H}&gt;10^{22} \rm \: cm^{-2}$. The survey complements the 4MOST X-ray survey, which will follow up $\sim 1\rm M$ eROSITA-selected (typically unobscured) AGN. We perform simulations to predict the quality of the spectra that we will obtain and validate our MIR-optical colour-selection method using X-ray spectral constraints and UV-to-far IR spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling in four well-observed deep-sky fields. We find that: (1) $\approx 80-87\%$ of the WISE-selected targets are AGN down to $r_{\rm AB}=22.1-22.8 \: \rm mag$ of which $\approx 70\%$ are obscured by $N_{\rm H}&gt;10^{22} \: \rm cm^{-2}$, and (2) $\approx 80\%$ of the 4MOST IR AGN sample will remain undetected by the deepest eROSITA observations due to extreme absorption. Our SED fitting results show that the 4MOST IR AGN survey will primarily identify obscured AGN and quasars ($\approx 55\%$ of the sample is expected to have $L_{\rm AGN,IR}&gt;10^{45} \rm \: erg \: s^{-1}$) residing in massive galaxies ($M_{\star}\approx 10^{10}-10^{12} \rm \: M_{\odot}$) at $z\approx 0.5-3.5$ with $ \approx 33\%$ expected to be hosted by starburst galaxies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling faint X-ray AGN populations in the NewAthena era: Insights from cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations expanded our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, yet key challenges persist in the X-ray regime, crucial for studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These limitations drive the development of next-generation observatories such as ESA's NewAthena. Now in phase B (preliminary design), the mission requires extensive testing to ensure compliance with its scientific goals, particularly given the uncertainties surrounding high redshift AGN. This work leverages the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to build an X-ray AGN mock catalogue and assess the performance of NewAthena's WFI. We created a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) light cone, spanning 10 deg2, with corrections to account for the limited resolution of the simulation and X-ray properties derived in post-processing. The resulting catalogue reveals a 5* overabundance of faint AGN compared to current X-ray constraints, an inconsistency potentially resolved by invoking a higher Compton-thick (CTK) fraction and intrinsic X-ray weakness, as suggested by recent JWST findings. An end-to-end survey simulation using SIXTE predicts 250000 AGN detections, including 20,000 at z &gt; 3 and 35 in the Epoch of Reionization (z &gt; 6); notably, only AGN with LX &gt; 43.5 erg/s are detectable at z &gt; 6. The analysis also forecasts a significant population of detectable CTK AGN, even beyond z &gt; 4. These findings suggest X-ray observations will, for the first time, probe a significant AGN population in the EoR, offering new insights into SMBH growth. They also provide key input for refining NewAthena's mission design and optimizing its survey strategy.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theories in Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We briefly review the recent developments in magnetohydrodynamics, which in particular deal with the evolution of magnetic fields in turbulent plasmas. We especially emphasize (i) the necessity of renormalizing equations of motion in turbulence where velocity and magnetic fields become H\"older singular; (ii) the breakdown of Laplacian determinism (spontaneous stochasticity) for turbulent magnetic fields; and (iii) the possibility of eliminating the notion of magnetic field lines, using instead magnetic path lines as trajectories of Alfvenic wave-packets. These methodologies are then exemplified with their application to the problem of magnetic reconnection -- rapid change in magnetic field pattern that accelerates plasma -- a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysics and laboratory plasmas. The necessity of smoothing out rough velocity and magnetic fields on a finite scale L implies that magnetohydrodynamic equations should be regarded as effective field theories with running parameters depending upon the scale L.</description>

      <title>Cataclysmic Variable Candidates Identified in eROSITA-DE DR1,XMM-Newton, Swift, and ROSAT Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10794v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary systems with a white dwarf accreting matter from a low-mass star, making them significant sources of X-ray emission in the Galaxy. We present a systematic search for X-ray emitting CV candidates by cross-matching four X-ray catalogs (eROSITA, XMM-Newton, Swift, and ROSAT) with Gaia sources located in the bridge region between the main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. From 444 candidates (267 confirmed CVs and 177 new candidates), we detect orbital modulation in 56 sources using ZTF/TESS light curves. The eROSITA catalog contributes 51% of candidates, outperforming other surveys due to its wider sky coverage and higher sensitivity (~10^{-14} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}). Our method demonstrates the efficiency of combining X-ray data with time-domain analysis for CV identification, with future eROSITA observations expected to expand the population of X-ray emitting CVs.</description>

      <title>Radiative-transfer models for dusty Type II supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust is expected to form on a year timescale in core-collapse supernova (SN) ejecta. Its existence is revealed through an infrared brightening, an optical dimming, or a blue-red emission-line profile asymmetry. To investigate how the dust location and amount impact observations, we computed ultraviolet-to-optical spectra of interacting and standard, noninteracting Type II SNe using state-of-the-art models -- for simplicity we adopted 0.1micron silicate grains. These models account for the full ejecta and treat both radioactive decay and shock power that arises from interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material. In a Type IIn SN such as 1998S at one year, approximately 3e-4Msun of dust within the dense shell reproduces the broad, asymmetric Halpha profile. It causes an optical dimming of ~2mag (which obscures any emission from the inner, metal-rich ejecta) but, paradoxically, a more modest dimming of the ultraviolet, which originates from the outer parts of the dense shell. In Type II SNe with late-time interaction, such as SN2017eaw, dust in the low-mass, fast outer ejecta dense shell tends to be optically thin, impacting little the optical spectrum for dust masses of order 1e-4Msun. In such SNe II with interaction, dust in the inner metal-rich ejecta has negligible effect on observed spectra in the ultraviolet and optical. In noninteracting SNe II, dust within the metal-rich ejecta preferentially quenches the [OI]6300,6364 and [CaII]7291,7323 metal lines, biasing the emission in favor of the H-rich material which generates the Halpha and FeII emission below 5500A. Our model with 5e-4Msun of dust below 2000km/s matches closely the optical spectrum of SN1987A at 714d. Modeling historical SNe requires treating both the ejecta material and the dust, as well as multiple power sources, although interaction power will generally dominate.</description>

      <title>Investigating the light curve variation of magnetic white dwarfs induced by the axion-photon conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-photon oscillation refers to the process of mutual conversion between photons and axions when they propagate in a magnetic field. This process depends on the strength of the background magnetic field, and magnetic white dwarfs provide a natural laboratory for testing this process. In this work, we study the behavior of axion-photon oscillation near magnetic white dwarfs: as the magnetic white dwarf rotates, its magnetic field structure rotates accordingly, causing a periodic change of the magnetic field along the path of photons. These variations affect the axion-photon oscillation process experienced by the photons emitted from the white dwarf, thereby inducing a periodic modulation in the intensity and polarization of the white dwarf's thermal emission that we observe. Our study focuses on the impact of axion effects on the observed light curve variation and conducts a detailed investigation through numerical calculations. Using the light curve data of the white dwarf PG1015+014 obtained from the observations by the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope, which has a photometric precision of $\sim1\%$, we derive the constraints on axion parameters. In the axion mass range of $\lesssim10^{-8}\,{\rm eV}$, the 95\% credible interval upper limit of the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ is constrained to $&lt;8.1 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Analytical coordinate time at the second post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the analytical expression of the coordinate time $t$ in terms of the eccentric anomaly $u$ at the second post-Newtonian order in General Relativity for a compact binary system moving on eccentric orbits. The parametrization of $t$ with $u$ permits to reduce at the minimum the presence of discontinuous trigonometric functions. This is helpful as they must be properly connected via accumulation functions to finally have a smooth coordinate time $t(u)$. Another difficulty relies on the presence of an infinite sum, about which we derive a compact form. This effort reveals to be extremely useful for application purposes. Indeed, we need to truncate the aforementioned sum to a certain finite threshold, which strongly depends on the selected parameter values and the accuracy error we would like to achieve. Thanks to our work, this analysis can be easily carried out.</description>

      <title>Statistical complexity as a probe of mass and phase structure in compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic study of the statistical complexity, originally introduced by L\'opez-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet [Phys. Lett. A 209, 321-326 (1995)], across a broad range of compact star models. We explore how complexity correlates not only with macroscopic observables such as mass and radius, but also with the microscopic characteristics of the underlying equation of state. By incorporating both realistic equations of state and analytical solutions to Einstein's field equations, we demonstrate that gravitational mass plays a dominant role in determining the behavior of complexity. Furthermore, we show that strong phase transitions within the stellar interior, such as those hypothesized in hybrid stars, can manifest as distinct features in the complexity profile, offering a potential informational signature of such transitions. This work offers new insights into the link between information theory and compact object physics, highlighting complexity's potential as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>From existing and new nuclear and astrophysical constraints to stringent limits on the equation of state of neutron-rich dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through continuous progress in nuclear theory and experiment and an increasing number of neutron-star observations, a multitude of information about the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities is available. To constrain the EOS across its entire density range, this information needs to be combined consistently. However, the impact and model-dependency of individual observations vary. We present a broad compendium of different constraints and apply them individually to a large set of EOS candidates within a Bayesian framework. Specifically, we explore different ways how chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics can be used to place a likelihood on EOS candidates. We also investigate the impact of nuclear experimental constraints, as well as different radio and X-ray observations of neutron star (NS) masses and radii. This is augmented by reanalyses of the existing data from BNS coalescences, in particular of GW170817, with improved models for the tidal waveform and kilonova light curves, which we also utilize to construct a tight upper limit of 2.39$\,$M$_\odot$ on the TOV mass based on GW170817's remnant. Our diverse set of constraints is eventually combined to obtain stringent limits on NS properties. We organize the combination in a way to distinguish between constraints where the systematic uncertainties are deemed small and those that rely on less conservative assumptions. For the former, we find the radius of the canonical 1.4$\,$M$_\odot$ neutron star to be $R_{1.4}= 12.26_{-0.91}^{+0.80}\,$km and the TOV mass at $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.25_{-0.22}^{+0.42}\,$M$_\odot$ (95% credibility). Including all the presented constraints yields $R_{1.4}= 12.20_{-0.48}^{+0.50}\,$km and $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.30_{-0.20}^{+0.07}\,$M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Quasars can Signpost Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found in the centers of massive galaxies, and galaxy mergers should eventually lead to SMBH mergers. Quasar activity has long been associated with galaxy mergers, so here we investigate if supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are preferentially found in quasars. Our multimessenger investigation folds together a gravitational wave background signal from NANOGrav, a sample of periodic AGN candidates from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, and a quasar mass function, to estimate an upper limit on the fraction of quasars which could host a SMBHB. We find at 95\% confidence that quasars are at most five times as likely to host a SMBHB as a random galaxy. Pulsar timing arrays may therefore be more likely to find SMBHBs by prioritizing quasars over a random selection of galaxies in their searches.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Machine Learning for Classifying CHIME Fast Radio Bursts and Investigating Empirical Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic millisecond-duration astrophysical phenomena typically categorized as repeaters or non-repeaters. However, observational limitations may result in misclassifications, potentially leading to a higher proportion of repeaters than currently identified. In this study, we leverage unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs using data from the CHIME/FRB catalogs, including both the first catalog and a recent repeater catalog. By employing Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms (k-means and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), we successfully segregate repeaters and non-repeaters into distinct clusters, identifying over 100 potential repeater candidates. Our analysis reveals several empirical relations within the clusters, including the ${\rm log \,}\Delta t_{sc}-{\rm log \,}\Delta t_{rw}$, ${\rm log \,}\Delta t_{sc}-{\rm log \,}T_B$, and $r - \gamma$ correlations, where ${\Delta t_{sc}, \Delta t_{rw}, T_B, r, \gamma}$ represent scattering time, rest-frame width, brightness temperature, spectral running, and spectral index, respectively. The Chow test results reveal that while some repeaters and non-repeaters share similar empirical relationships, the overall distinctions between the two groups remain significant, reinforcing the classification of FRBs into repeaters and non-repeaters. These findings provide new insights into the physical properties and emission mechanisms of FRBs. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of unsupervised learning in classifying FRBs and identifying potential repeaters, paving the way for more precise investigations into their origins and applications in cosmology. Future improvements in observational data and machine learning methodologies are expected to further enhance our understanding of FRBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino quantum kinetics in dense astrophysical environments is investigated relying on the mean-field approximation. In this paper, we heuristically explore whether beyond-mean-field effects due to neutrino degeneracy could hinder flavor instabilities that are otherwise foreseen. Our results show that these corrections shift the stability regions for a suite of (anti)neutrino ensembles: the flavor conversion of previously unstable distributions can be damped, but angular distributions that are stable in the mean-field case can also become unstable. Our work should serve as a motivation to further investigate the limitations of the mean-field treatment.</description>

      <title>Emission and Absorption Lines in Photospheric Radius Expansion Bursts of 4U 1820$-$30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the emission and absorption lines during photospheric radius expansion (PRE) X-ray bursts from the ultracompact binary 4U 1820--30, observed with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). Using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the significance, we identified a 1 keV emission line from 14 bursts, a 3 keV absorption line from 12 bursts, and 1.6 keV absorption from one burst. By coadding the burst spectra at the maximum radius phase, we detected a 1.034 keV emission line with significance of $14.2\sigma$, and absorption lines at 1.64 and 3 keV with significances of $10.8\sigma$ and $11.7\sigma$, respectively. The observed energy shifts are consistent with the prediction from the burst-driven wind model, indicating that all three spectral features are produced by the PRE wind. Analysis of the ratios between the emission and absorption line energies suggests that the 1 keV feature is a superposition of several narrower Fe L-shell lines. To evaluate the scientific capabilities of the Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS), we simulated mock observations of multiple narrow lines near 1 keV. The results demonstrate that HUBS is well suited for detailed studies of the 1 keV emission line during bursts, offering significant potential to advance our understanding of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Embers of Active Galactic Nuclei: Tidal Disruption Events and Quasiperiodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations have confirmed the direct association between tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs). In addition, TDE hosts and QPE hosts are statistically found to be similar in their morphological properties and in the strong overrepresentation of poststarburst galaxies. Particularly, both of them show an intriguing preference for extending emission line regions (EELRs), which are indicative of recently faded active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This further suggests that QPEs might be produced following TDEs involving supermassive black holes at a particular stage, when the AGN activity has recently ceased. Moreover, in the framework of "QPEs=extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) + accretion disk" model, a large fraction of QPE EMRIs are inferred to be quasi-circular from the QPE timing, indicating that they are wet EMRIs that were formed in the AGN disk during a previous AGN phase. Based on these facts, we propose a unified scenario that connects these three phenomena: AGN activities boost both the TDE rate and the formation rate of low-eccentricity EMRIs, consequently TDEs are preferentially found in recently faded AGNs instead of in ongoing AGNs due to selection effects, and QPEs are also preferentially found in recently faded AGNs where TDEs frequently feed a misaligned accretion disk to the EMRI.</description>

      <title>Limiting on ALP-photon Coupling through GRB221009A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the constraints on ALPs parameters through the photon-ALP oscillation model, based on the high-energy photon propagation characteristics of the gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A. We briefly describe the Primakoff process and use it to derive the oscillation probability. Numerical simulations incorporate the GMF, IGMF, and EBL, utilizing the open-source code gammaALPs to simulate photon propagation from the source to Earth. By employing the chi2 statistical method and segmented spectral fitting of low-energy and high-energy observational data from HXMT-GECAM, the dependence of photon survival probability on ALP mass (ma) and coupling strength (ga) is analyzed. Results show that for the ALP mass range 10^-7 &lt; ma &lt; 10^2 neV, the upper limit on the coupling strength is ga &lt; 0.27 * 10^-11 GeV^-1, improving constraints by one order of magnitude compared to the CAST experiment (6.6 * 10^-11 GeV^-1). Notably, high-energy data exhibit significantly stronger constraining power. This work provides a novel theoretical framework and observational basis for indirectly probing ALPs through extreme astrophysical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: With a small sample of fast X-ray transients (FXTs) with multi-wavelength counterparts discovered to date, the progenitors of FXTs and their connections to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and supernovae (SNe) remain ambiguous. Here, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2025kg, the supernova counterpart to the FXT EP 250108a. At $z=0.17641$, this is the closest known SN discovered following an Einstein Probe (EP) FXT. We show that SN 2025kg's optical spectra reveal the hallmark features of a broad-lined Type Ic SN. Its light curve evolution and expansion velocities are also comparable to those of GRB-SNe, including SN 1998bw, and several past FXT SNe. We present JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy taken around SN 2025kg's maximum light, and find weak absorption due to He I $\lambda 1.0830, \lambda 2.0581$ $\mu$m and a broad, unidentified feature at $\sim$ 4-4.5 $\mu$m. Further, we observe clear evidence for broadened H$\alpha$ in optical data at 42.5 days that is not detected at other epochs, indicating interaction with hydrogen-rich material. From its light curve, we derive a $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.2 - 0.6 $M_{\odot}$. Together with our companion paper (Eyles-Ferris et al. 2025), our broadband data of EP 250108a/SN 2025kg are consistent with a trapped or low energy ($\lesssim 10^{51}$ ergs) jet-driven explosion from a collapsar with a zero-age main sequence mass of 15-30 $M_{\odot}$. Finally, we show that the sample of EP FXT SNe support past rate estimates that low-luminosity jets seen through FXTs are more common than successful (GRB) jets, and that similar FXT-like signatures are likely present in at least a few percent of the brightest Ic-BL SNe.</description>

      <title>Finding radio transients with anomaly detection and active learning based on volunteer classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the applicability of unsupervised machine learning algorithms to finding radio transients. Facilities such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will provide huge volumes of data in which to detect rare transients; the challenge for astronomers is how to find them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of anomaly detection algorithms using 1.3 GHz light curves from the SKA precursor MeerKAT. We make use of three sets of descriptive parameters ('feature sets') as applied to two anomaly detection techniques in the Astronomaly package and analyse our performance by comparison with citizen science labels on the same dataset. Using transients found by volunteers as our ground truth, we demonstrate that anomaly detection techniques can recall over half of the radio transients in the 10 per cent of the data with the highest anomaly scores. We find that the choice of anomaly detection algorithm makes a minor difference, but that feature set choice is crucial, especially when considering available resources for human inspection and/or follow-up. Active learning, where human labels are given for just 2 per cent of the data, improves recall by up to 20 percentage points, depending on the combination of features and model used. The best performing results produce a factor of 5 times fewer sources requiring vetting by experts. This is the first effort to apply anomaly detection techniques to finding radio transients and shows great promise for application to other datasets, and as a real-time transient detection system for upcoming large surveys.</description>

      <title>Semi-confined supernova feedback in HII region bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic-scale simulations rely on sub-grid models to provide prescriptions for the coupling between supernova (SN) feedback and the interstellar medium (ISM). Many of these models are computed in 1-D to allow for an efficient way to account for the variability of properties of their local environment. However, small-scale simulations revealed that the release of energy from SNe within molecular clouds can be highly asymmetrical. This is largely due to the presence of pre-SN feedback, such as ionizing radiation, that are able to carve cavities and channels around the progenitors prior to their detonation. Being partially confined, the SN energy escapes into the outer ISM preferentially through these channels, departing from the spherically symmetric 1-D descriptions. To understand by how much the feedback output could differ, we present a theoretical model for a semi-confined SN. The problem concerns a SN expanding into an evolved HII region, bounded by a molecular cloud with pre-existing vents. With the aid of simple 3-D hydrodynamical simulations, we show that this mode of energy release increases the local dynamical impact of the outflows, and extends the timescales over which the SN is energetically coupled to the surrounding matter. We also show that the amount of small-scale solenoidal turbulence driven by semi-confined SNe may be amplified.</description>

      <title>Axial perturbations of black holes with primary scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study axial perturbations of static black holes with primary hair in a family of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. These solutions possess a scalar charge, fully independent of the mass, leading to a continuous one-parameter deformation of the standard Schwarzschild black hole. Starting from these solutions, we also construct new black holes, solutions of other DHOST theories, obtained via disformal transformations of the metric. In particular, we investigate two specific types of disformal transformations: the first leading to a theory where gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light, the second to a Horndeski theory, where the equations of motion remain second order. The dynamics of axial perturbations can be formally related to the general relativistic equations of motion of axial perturbations in an effective metric. The causal structure of the effective metric differs from that of the background metric, leading to distinct gravitational and luminous horizons. Using a WKB approximation, we compute the quasi-normal modes for the Schr\"odinger-like equation associated with the effective metric outside the gravitational horizon.</description>
