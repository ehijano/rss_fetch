      <title>The theory DCF$_p$A exists for $p&gt;0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the (elementary) class of differential-difference fields in characteristic $p&gt;0$ admits a model-companion. In the terminology of Chatzidakis-Pillay, this says that the class of differentially closed fields of characteristic $p$ equipped with a generic differential-automorphism is elementary; i.e., DCF$_p$A exists. Along the way, we provide alternative first-order axiomatisations for DCF (differentially closed fields) and also for DCF$_0$A.</description>

      <title>Smullyan's truth and provability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Smullyan's paper ``Truth and Provability'' for three purposes. First, we introduce the notion of Smullyan models to give a precise definition for Smullyan's framework discussed in that paper. Second, we clarify the relationship between Theorems F, T, and G proved by Smullyan and other newly introduced properties for Smullyan models in terms of both implications and non-implications. Third, we construct two Smullyan models based on arithmetic and show the correspondence between the properties of these Smullyan models and those concerning truth and provability in arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Simply-typed constant-domain modal lambda calculus I: distanced beta reduction and combinatory logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\upsilon}$ is developed that combines modal logic and simply-typed lambda calculus, and that generalizes the system studied by Montague and Gallin. Whereas Montague and Gallin worked with Church's simple theory of types, the system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\upsilon}$ is developed in the typed base theory most commonly used today, namely the simply-typed lambda calculus. Further, the system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\upsilon}$ is controlled by a parameter $\upsilon$ which allows more options for state types and state variables than is present in Montague and Gallin. A main goal of the paper is to establish the basic metatheory of $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\upsilon}$: (i) a completeness theorem is proven for $\beta\eta$-reduction, and (ii) an Andrews-like characterization of Henkin models in terms of combinatory logic is given; and this involves a distanced version of $\beta$-reduction and a $\mathsf{BCKW}$-like basis rather than $\mathsf{SKI}$-like basis. Further, conservation of the maximal system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\omega}$ over $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\upsilon}$ is proven, and expressibility of $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\omega}$ in $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\upsilon}$ is proven; thus these modal logics are highly expressive. Similar results are proven for the relation between $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\omega}$ and $\boldsymbol\lambda$, the corresponding ordinary simply-typed lambda calculus. This answers a question of Zimmerman in the simply-typed setting. In a companion paper this is extended to Church's simple theory of types.</description>

      <title>Limits of sparse hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize ultraproducts and local-global limits of graphs to hypergraphs and other structures. We show that the local statistics of an ultraproduct of a sequence of hypergraphs are the ultralimits of the local statistics of the hypergraphs. Using some standard results from model theory, we conclude that the space of (equivalence classes of) pmp hypergraphs with the topology of local-global convergence is compact, and that any countable set of local statistics for a pmp hypergraph can be realized as the statistics of a set of labellings (rather than just approximated) in a local-global equivalent hypergraph.
  We give two applications. First, we characterize those structures where any solution to the corresponding CSP can be turned into a measurable solution. These turn out to be the width-1 structures. We can also use the limit machinery to extract from this theorem a purely finitary characterizations of width-1 structures involving asymptotic solutions.
  Second, we prove two measurable versions of the Frankl--R\"odl matching theorem using measurable nibble and differential equation arguments. The measurable proofs are much softer than the purely finitary results. And, we can recover the finitary theorems using the limit machinery.</description>

      <title>Higher inductive types in $(\infty,1)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a definition of higher inductive types in $(\infty,1)$-categories with finite limits. We show that the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-categories with higher inductive types is finitarily presentable. In particular, the initial $(\infty,1)$-category with higher inductive types exists. We prove a form of canonicity: the global section functor for the initial $(\infty,1)$-category with higher inductive types preserves higher inductive types.</description>

      <title>Cut-free sequent calculi for the provability logic D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a Kripke model is a GL-model if the accessibility relation $\prec$ is transitive and converse well-founded. We say that a Kripke model is a D-model if it is obtained by attaching infinitely many worlds $t_1, t_2, \ldots$, and $t_\omega$ to a world $t_0$ of a GL-model so that $t_0 \succ t_1 \succ t_2 \succ \cdots \succ t_\omega$. A non-normal modal logic D, which was studied by Beklemishev (1999), is characterized as follows. A formula $\varphi$ is a theorem of D if and only if $\varphi$ is true at $t_\omega$ in any D-model. D is an intermediate logic between the provability logics GL and S. A Hilbert-style proof system for D is known, but there has been no sequent calculus. In this paper, we establish two sequent calculi for D, and show the cut-elimination theorem. We also introduce new Hilbert-style systems for D by interpreting the sequent calculi. Moreover, we show that D-models can be defined using an arbitrary limit ordinal as well as $\omega$. Finally, we show a general result as follows. Let $X$ and $X^+$ be arbitrary modal logics. If the relationship between semantics of $X$ and semantics of $X^+$ is equal to that of GL and D, then $X^+$ can be axiomatized based on $X$ in the same way as the new axiomatization of D based on GL.</description>

      <title>A general theory of iterated forcing using finitely additive measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the work of Shelah, Kellner, and T\u{a}nasie (Fund. Math., 166(1-2):109-136, 2000 and Comment. Math. Univ. Carolin., 60(1):61-95, 2019), and the recent developments in the third author's master's thesis, we develop a general theory of iterated forcing using finitely additive measures. For this purpose, we introduce two new notions: on the one hand, we define a new linkedness property, called $\mu$-$\mathrm{FAM}$-linked and, on the other hand, we generalize the notion of intersection number to forcing notions, which justifies the limit steps of our iteration theory. Our theory also generalizes iterations with ultrafilters, which have played an important role in the proof of the consistency of Cicho\'n's maximum.
  We further show that any iteration constructed with our theory preserves strong unbounded families and what we call anti-Bendixson families, which play a central role in preserving witnesses of $\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{N})$ of singular size (even of countable cofinality). We also show that our iteration method does not increase $\mathrm{non}(\mathcal{E})$, the smallest size of a set of reals that cannot be covered by an $F_\sigma$ measure zero set. Finally, we apply our theory to prove a new separation of the left-hand side of Cicho\'n's diagram where $\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{N})$ is possibly singular, even with countable cofinality.</description>

      <title>Factor maps for automorphism groups via Cayley diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.14604v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We leverage a correspondence between group actions and edge-labelled graphs in two ways. First, we give a unified presentation of several folklore results connecting weak containment, local-global convergence, and continuous model theory. Second, we investigate the difference between $\operatorname{Aut}(\operatorname{Cay}(\Gamma))$-fiid combinatorics and $\Gamma$-fiid combinatorics for various marked groups $\Gamma$. It's straightforward to see that these differences vanish when $\operatorname{Cay}(\Gamma)$ admits an $\operatorname{Aut}(\operatorname{Cay}(\Gamma))$-fiid Cayley diagram. We extend this to show that the approximate combinatorics are the same when $\operatorname{Cay}(\Gamma)$ admits an approximate fiid Cayley diagram, and we give several examples and nonexamples of groups whose Cayley graphs admit (approximate) fiid Cayley diagrams.
  In particular, we show that trees admit approximate Cayley diagrams for any group whose Cayley graph is a tree; Cayley graphs of torsion free nilpotent groups do not admit fiid Cayley diagrams; and there are groups with isomorphic Cayley graphs so that only one them admits even an approximate Cayley diagram (in fact our construction answers a question of Weilacher).</description>

      <title>Formalization of Aristotle's Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03269v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The following paper continues a series of papers we have dedicated formalizing Aristotle's modal syllogistic \cite{pro} and the theory of definition in the Topics \cite{pro2} and well as studying the adequacy for dealing with multiple generality of Aristotelian and other currents of ancient logic\cite{pro3}. Taking the cue from \cite{pro3} we first ask the question: what is the metalogic implicit in the Organon ? We argue that this is plausibly a certain fragment of third-order logic. Not only can we express Aristotle's theorems and proofs in the Analytics (and subsume our system in \cite{pro}) but, following the interpretation of \cite{pro2}, we can express the various topoi in the Topics is a very accurate way such that their variants geared to debate appear as non-trivial logical derivations (which are only left implicit) - thus furnishing further evidence for the sophistication of ancient logic with regards to quantifier logic over non-necessarily monadic predicates.
  The fact that we are dealing here with a variant of second-order logic (to which is added some third-order predicates) allows us to make interesting connections to Frege and to the problems of extensionality and intensionality.
  In this paper we focus on the topoi of genus and property.</description>

      <title>Stable functions and F{\o}lner's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is an amenable group and $A\subseteq G$ has positive upper Banach density, then there is an identity neighborhood $B$ in the Bohr topology on $G$ that is almost contained in $AA^{-1}$ in the sense that $B\backslash AA^{-1}$ has upper Banach density $0$. This generalizes the abelian case (due to F{\o}lner) and the countable case (due to Beiglb\"{o}ck, Bergelson, and Fish). The proof is indirectly based on local stable group theory in continuous logic. The main ingredients are Grothendieck's double-limit characterization of relatively weakly compact sets in spaces of continuous functions, along with results of Ellis and Nerurkar on the topological dynamics of weakly almost periodic flows.</description>
