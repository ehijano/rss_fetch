      <title>Robust Channel Estimation for Optical Wireless Communications Using Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) has gained significant attention due to its high-speed data transmission and throughput. Optical wireless channels are often assumed to be flat, but we evaluate frequency selective channels to consider high data rate optical wireless or very dispersive environments. To address this for optical scenarios, this paper presents a robust channel estimation framework with low-complexity to mitigate frequency-selective effects, then to improve system reliability and performance. This channel estimation framework contains a neural network that can estimate general optical wireless channels without prior channel information about the environment. Based on this estimate and the corresponding delay spread, one of several candidate offline-trained neural networks will be activated to predict this channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has improved and robust normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional estimation methods while maintaining computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of neural network solutions in enhancing the performance of OWC systems under indoor channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Performance of a Keyhole-based Multi-user System with Multiple Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the secrecy performance of a keyhole-aided multi-user communication network in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. The communication happens through the same keyhole for legitimate users and eavesdroppers. In this context, the secrecy performance is evaluated for a user scheduling technique by obtaining the exact closed-form expression of secrecy outage probability (SOP). Further, a simplified asymptotic SOP expression is derived assuming high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenario for a better understanding of the impact of system parameters. The effect of the keyhole parameters, number of users, number of eavesdroppers, and threshold secrecy rate on the SOP performance are also investigated for the considered system model. In the high-SNR regime, the asymptotic SOP saturates to a constant value and does not depend on the keyhole parameter and the channel parameter of the source-to-keyhole channel.</description>

      <title>Beyond Traditional Coherence Time: An Electromagnetic Perspective for Mobile Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel coherence time has been widely regarded as a critical parameter in the design of mobile systems. However, a prominent challenge lies in integrating electromagnetic (EM) polarization effects into the derivation of the channel coherence time. In this paper, we develop a framework to analyze the impact of polarization mismatch on the channel coherence time. Specifically, we first establish an EM channel model to capture the essence of EM wave propagation. Based on this model, we then derive the EM temporal correlation function, incorporating the effects of polarization mismatch and beam misalignment. Further, considering the random orientation of the mobile user equipment (UE), we derive a closed-form solution for the EM coherence time in the turning scenario. When the trajectory degenerates into a straight line, we also provide a closed-form lower bound on the EM coherence time. The simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and reveal that neglecting the EM polarization effects leads to overly optimistic estimates of the EM coherence time.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity Function Analysis of Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a chirp-based multicarrier waveform that was recently proposed for communication over doubly dispersive channels. Given its chirp nature, AFDM is expected to have superior sensing capabilities compared to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and is thus a promising candidate for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) applications. In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the ambiguity function of AFDM waveforms modulated with $M$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) data symbols. We determine the condition on the chirp rate of the AFDM waveform that minimizes the sidelobes in the delay/range domain in the presence of random $M$-ary QAM symbols, thereby improving overall sensing performance. Additionally, we find an approximate statistical distribution for the magnitude of the derived ambiguity function. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the sensing performance of the AFDM waveform for various system parameters and to compare its peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) and integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR) with those of OFDM.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted 5G Networks: Mobility-Aware 3D Trajectory Optimization and Resource Allocation for Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for robust design of UAV-assisted wireless networks that combine 3D trajectory optimization with user mobility prediction to address dynamic resource allocation challenges. We proposed a sparse second-order prediction model for real-time user tracking coupled with heuristic user clustering to balance service quality and computational complexity. The joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum rate. It is then decomposed into user association, 3D trajectory design, and resource allocation subproblems, which are solved iteratively via successive convex approximation (SCA). Extensive simulations demonstrate: (1) near-optimal performance with $\epsilon \approx 0.67\%$ deviation from upper-bound solutions, (2) $16\%$ higher minimum rates for distant users compared to non-predictive 3D designs, and (3) $10-30\%$ faster outage mitigation than time-division benchmarks. The framework's adaptive speed control enables precise mobile user tracking while maintaining energy efficiency under constrained flight time. Results demonstrate superior robustness in edge-coverage scenarios, making it particularly suitable for $5G/6G$ networks.</description>

      <title>Utilizing 5G NR SSB Blocks for Passive Detection and Localization of Low-Altitude Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the exponential growth of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry and a broad range of applications expected to appear in the coming years, the employment of traditional radar systems is becoming increasingly cumbersome for UAV supervision. Motivated by this emerging challenge, this paper investigates the feasibility of employing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems implemented over current and future wireless networks to perform this task. We propose a sensing mechanism based on the synchronization signal block (SSB) in the fifth-generation (5G) standard that performs sensing in a passive bistatic setting. By assuming planar arrays at the sensing nodes and according to the 5G standard, we consider that the SSB signal is sent in a grid of orthogonal beams that are multiplexed in time, with some of them pointing toward a surveillance region where low-altitude drones can be flying. The Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) is derived as the theoretical bound for range and velocity estimation. Our results demonstrate the potential of employing SSB signals for UAV-like target localization at low SNR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on the measurement and evolution modeling of Standardized Kalman filtering in brain activity estimation when non-invasive electroencephalography measurements are used as the data. Here, we propose new parameter tuning and model utilizing the change rate of brain activity distribution to improve the stability of the otherwise accurate estimation. Namely, we pose a backward differentiation-based measurement model for the change rate that increased the stability of the tracking notably.

      <title>OAM-Assisted Self-Healing Is Directional, Proportional and Persistent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the postulated mechanism of self-healing specifically due to orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) in radio vortex beams having equal beam-widths. In previous work we experimentally demonstrated self-healing effects in OAM beams at 28 GHz and postulated a theoretical mechanism to account for them. In this work we further characterize the OAM self-healing mechanism theoretically and confirm those characteristics with systematic and controlled experimental measurements on a 28 GHz outdoor link. Specifically, we find that the OAM self-healing mechanism is an additional self-healing mechanism in structured electromagnetic beams which is directional with respect to the displacement of an obstruction relative to the beam axis. We also confirm our previous findings that the amount of OAM self-healing is proportional to the OAM order, and additionally find that it persists beyond the focusing region into the far field. As such, OAM-assisted self-healing brings an advantage over other so-called non-diffracting beams both in terms of the minimum distance for onset of self-healing and the amount of self-healing obtainable. We relate our findings by extending theoretical models in the literature and develop a unifying electromagnetic analysis to account for self-healing of OAM-bearing non-diffracting beams more rigorously.</description>

      <title>Liquid Neural Networks: Next-Generation AI for Telecom from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology with immense potential to reshape the next-generation of wireless networks. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, AI offers unprecedented capabilities in optimizing network performance, enhancing data processing efficiency, and enabling smarter decision-making processes. However, existing AI solutions face significant challenges in terms of robustness and interpretability. Specifically, current AI models exhibit substantial performance degradation in dynamic environments with varying data distributions, and the black-box nature of these algorithms raises concerns regarding safety, transparency, and fairness. This presents a major challenge in integrating AI into practical communication systems. Recently, a novel type of neural network, known as the liquid neural networks (LNNs), has been designed from first principles to address these issues. In this paper, we explore the potential of LNNs in telecommunications. First, we illustrate the mechanisms of LNNs and highlight their unique advantages over traditional networks. Then we unveil the opportunities that LNNs bring to future wireless networks. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and design directions for the implementation of LNNs. Finally, we summarize the performance of LNNs in two case studies.</description>

      <title>Handover and SINR-Aware Path Optimization in 5G-UAV mmWave Communication using DRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path planning and optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted next-generation wireless networks is critical for mobility management and ensuring UAV safety and ubiquitous connectivity, especially in dense urban environments with street canyons and tall buildings. Traditional statistical and model-based techniques have been successfully used for path optimization in communication networks. However, when dynamic channel propagation characteristics such as line-of-sight (LOS), interference, handover, and signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) are included in path optimization, statistical and model-based path planning solutions become obsolete since they cannot adapt to the dynamic and time-varying wireless channels, especially in the mmWave bands. In this paper, we propose a novel model-free actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (AC-DRL) framework for path optimization in UAV-assisted 5G mmWave wireless networks, which combines four important aspects of UAV communication: \textit{flight time, handover, connectivity and SINR}. We train an AC-RL agent that enables a UAV connected to a gNB to determine the optimal path to a desired destination in the shortest possible time with minimal gNB handover, while maintaining connectivity and the highest possible SINR. We train our model with data from a powerful ray tracing tool called Wireless InSite, which uses 3D images of the propagation environment and provides data that closely resembles the real propagation environment. The simulation results show that our system has superior performance in tracking high SINR compared to other selected RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>TeleMoM: Consensus-Driven Telecom Intelligence via Mixture of Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized domains like telecommunication (Telecom) due to technical complexity, specialized terminology, and rapidly evolving knowledge. Traditional methods, such as scaling model parameters or retraining on domain-specific corpora, are computationally expensive and yield diminishing returns, while existing approaches like retrieval-augmented generation, mixture of experts, and fine-tuning struggle with accuracy, efficiency, and coordination. To address this issue, we propose Telecom mixture of models (TeleMoM), a consensus-driven ensemble framework that integrates multiple LLMs for enhanced decision-making in Telecom. TeleMoM employs a two-stage process: proponent models generate justified responses, and an adjudicator finalizes decisions, supported by a quality-checking mechanism. This approach leverages strengths of diverse models to improve accuracy, reduce biases, and handle domain-specific complexities effectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that TeleMoM achieves a 9.7\% increase in answer accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness in Telecom applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Green AI-Native Networks: Evaluation of Neural Circuit Policy for Estimating Energy Consumption of Base Stations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization of radio hardware and AI-based network management software yield significant energy savings in radio access networks. The execution of underlying Machine Learning (ML) models, which enable energy savings through recommended actions, may require additional compute and energy, highlighting the opportunity to explore and adopt accurate and energy-efficient ML technologies. This work evaluates the novel use of sparsely structured Neural Circuit Policies (NCPs) in a use case to estimate the energy consumption of base stations. Sparsity in ML models yields reduced memory, computation and energy demand, hence facilitating a low-cost and scalable solution. We also evaluate the generalization capability of NCPs in comparison to traditional and widely used ML models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), via quantifying their sensitivity to varying model hyper-parameters (HPs). NCPs demonstrated a clear reduction in computational overhead and energy consumption. Moreover, results indicated that the NCPs are robust to varying HPs such as number of epochs and neurons in each layer, making them a suitable option to ease model management and to reduce energy consumption in Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) in telecommunications.</description>

      <title>GMR-Conv: An Efficient Rotation and Reflection Equivariant Convolution Kernel Using Gaussian Mixture Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry, where certain features remain invariant under geometric transformations, can often serve as a powerful prior in designing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While conventional CNNs inherently support translational equivariance, extending this property to rotation and reflection has proven challenging, often forcing a compromise between equivariance, efficiency, and information loss. In this work, we introduce Gaussian Mixture Ring Convolution (GMR-Conv), an efficient convolution kernel that smooths radial symmetry using a mixture of Gaussian-weighted rings. This design mitigates discretization errors of circular kernels, thereby preserving robust rotation and reflection equivariance without incurring computational overhead. We further optimize both the space and speed efficiency of GMR-Conv via a novel parameterization and computation strategy, allowing larger kernels at an acceptable cost. Extensive experiments on eight classification and one segmentation datasets demonstrate that GMR-Conv not only matches conventional CNNs' performance but can also surpass it in applications with orientation-less data. GMR-Conv is also proven to be more robust and efficient than the state-of-the-art equivariant learning methods. Our work provides inspiring empirical evidence that carefully applied radial symmetry can alleviate the challenges of information loss, marking a promising advance in equivariant network architectures. The code is available at https://github.com/XYPB/GMR-Conv.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\textit{Objective.}$ In this article, we present data and methods for decoding hand gestures using surface electromyogram (EMG) signals. EMG-based upper limb interfaces are valuable for amputee rehabilitation, artificial supernumerary limb augmentation, gestural control of computers, and virtual and augmented reality applications. $\textit{Approach.}$ To achieve this, we collect EMG signals from the upper limb using surface electrodes placed at key muscle sites involved in hand movements. Additionally, we design and evaluate efficient models for decoding EMG signals. $\textit{Main results.}$ Our findings reveal that the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices serves as an effective embedding space for EMG signals. Moreover, for the first time, we quantify the distribution shift of these signals across individuals. $\textit{Significance.}$ Overall, our approach demonstrates significant potential for developing efficient and interpretable methods for decoding EMG signals. This is particularly important as we move toward the broader adoption of EMG-based wrist interfaces.</description>

      <title>On the Security of Directional Modulation via Time Modulated Arrays Using OFDM Waveforms</title>

Abstract: Time-modulated arrays (TMAs) transmitting information bearing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals can achieve directional modulation. By turning its antennas on and off in a periodic fashion, the TMA can be configured to transmit the OFDM signal undistorted in the direction of a legitimate receiver and scrambled everywhere else. This capability has been proposed as means of securing the transmitted information from unauthorized users. In this paper, we investigate how secure the TMA OFDM system is, by looking at the transmitted signal from an eavesdropper's point of view. We demonstrate that the symbols observed by the eavesdropper across the OFDM subcarriers are linear combinations of the source symbols, with mixing coefficients that are unknown to the eavesdropper. We propose the use of independent component analysis (ICA) theory to obtain the mixing matrix and provide methods to resolve the column permutation and scaling ambiguities, which are inherent in the ICA problem, by leveraging the structure of the mixing matrix and assuming knowledge of the characteristics of the TMA OFDM system. In general, resolving the ambiguities and recovering the symbols requires long data. Specifically for the case of the constant modulus symbols, we propose a modified ICA approach, namely the constant-modulus ICA (CMICA), that provides a good estimate of the mixing matrix using a small number of received samples. We also propose countermeasures which the TMA could undertake in order to defend the scrambling. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of our scrambling defying and defending schemes.</description>

      <title>Diffraction Aided Wireless Positioning</title>

Abstract: Wireless positioning in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios presents significant challenges due to multipath effects that lead to biased measurements and reduced positioning accuracy. This paper revisits electromagnetic field theory related to diffraction and in the context of wireless positioning and proposes a novel positioning technique that greatly improves accuracy in NLoS environments dominated by diffraction. The method is applied to a critical public safety use case: precisely locating at-risk individuals within buildings, with a particular focus on improving 3D positioning and z-axis accuracy. By leveraging the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD), the approach introduces an innovative NLoS path length model and a new NLOS positioning technique. Using Fisher information analysis, we establish the conditions required for 3D positioning and derive lower bounds on positioning performance for both 3D and z-axis estimates for the proposed NLOS positioning technique. Additionally, we propose an algorithmic implementation of the proposed NLoS positioning method using non-linear least squares estimation, which we term D-NLS. The positioning performance of our proposed NLOs positioning technique is validated using an extensive ray-tracing simulation. The numerical results highlight the superiority of our approach in outdoor-to-indoor environments, which directly estimates NLoS path lengths and delivers significant performance enhancements over existing methods for both 3D and z-axis positioning scenarios.</description>

      <title>A database of upper limb surface electromyogram signals from demographically diverse individuals</title>

Abstract: Upper limb based neuromuscular interfaces aim to provide a seamless way for humans to interact with technology. Among noninvasive interfaces, surface electromyogram (EMG) signals hold significant promise. However, their sensitivity to physiological and anatomical factors remains poorly understood, raising questions about how these factors influence gesture decoding across individuals or groups. To facilitate the study of signal distribution shifts across individuals or groups of individuals, we present a dataset of upper limb EMG signals and physiological measures from 91 demographically diverse adults. Participants were selected to represent a range of ages (18 to 92 years) and body mass indices (healthy, overweight, and obese). The dataset also includes measures such as skin hydration and elasticity, which may affect EMG signals. This dataset provides a basis to study demographic confounds in EMG signals and serves as a benchmark to test the development of fair and unbiased algorithms that enable accurate hand gesture decoding across demographically diverse subjects. Additionally, we validate the quality of the collected data using state-of-the-art gesture decoding techniques.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Waveform Channel Modeling for Wideband Optical Fiber Transmission: Model Comparisons, Challenges and Potential Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07830</link>

Abstract: Fast and accurate waveform simulation is critical for understanding fiber channel characteristics, developing digital signal processing (DSP) technologies, optimizing optical network configurations, and advancing the optical fiber transmission system towards wideband. Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for waveform modeling, offering high accuracy and low complexity compared to traditional split-step Fourier method (SSFM), due to its strong nonlinear fitting capabilities and efficient parallel computation. However, most DL methods are designed for few-channel and low-rate WDM systems, leaving their scalability to wideband systems uncertain. Moreover, the lack of a standardized accuracy evaluation method and the inconsistent results between waveform errors and transmission performance errors, hinders fair comparisons of various DL schemes. In this paper, we introduce a DSP-assisted accuracy evaluation method integrated with nonlinear DSP, providing a fair benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of DL models. Using this method, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of DL schemes, ranging from simple configurations to more complex wideband setups. The feature decoupled distributed method combining with bidirectional long short-term memory achieves the better performance compared to other DL schemes. Furthermore, in scenarios with more-channel and higher-rate, the performance advantages of FDD-BiLSTM will be further improved. However, as the number of channels and symbol rates increase, the performance of FDD-BiLSTM still gradually deteriorate. We analyze these challenges from three perspectives: the more intricate linear and nonlinear effects, the higher sampling rate required for SSFM. To address these challenges, we discuss potential solutions from two aspects: incorporating more prior physical knowledge and optimizing the structure of DL models.</description>

      <title>A New Twist on Low-Complexity Digital Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel low-complexity digital backpropagation (DBP) method, with the goal of optimizing the trade-off between backpropagation accuracy and complexity. The method combines a split step Fourier method (SSFM)-like structure with a simplified logarithmic perturbation method to obtain a high accuracy with a small number of DBP steps. Subband processing and asymmetric steps with optimized splitting ratio are also employed to further reduce the number of steps required to achieve a prescribed performance. The first part of the manuscript is dedicated to the derivation of a simplified logarithmic-perturbation model for the propagation of signal in an optical fiber, which serves for the development of the proposed coupled-band enhanced split step Fourier method (CB-ESSFM) and for the analytical calculation of the model coefficients. Next, the manuscript presents a DSP algorithm for the implementation of DBP based on a discrete-time version of the model and an overlap-and-save processing strategy. Practical approaches for the optimization of the coefficients used in the algorithm and of the splitting ratio of the asymmetric steps are also discussed. A detailed analysis of the computational complexity is presented. Finally, the performance and complexity of the proposed DBP method are investigated through simulations. In a five-channel 100 GHz-spaced wavelength division multiplexing system over a 15x80 km single-mode-fiber link, the proposed CB-ESSFM achieves a gain of about 1dB over simple dispersion compensation with only 15 steps (corresponding to 681 real multiplications per 2D symbol), with an improvement of 0.9 dB over conventional SSFM and almost 0.4dB over our previously proposed ESSFM. Significant gains and improvements are obtained also at lower complexity. A similar analysis is performed also for longer links, confirming the good performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>An Electrocardiogram Foundation Model Built on over 10 Million Recordings with External Evaluation across Multiple Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in ECG analysis and cardiovascular disease assessment. Recently, foundation models have played a remarkable role in advancing medical AI. The development of an ECG foundation model holds the promise of elevating AI-ECG research to new heights. However, building such a model faces several challenges, including insufficient database sample sizes and inadequate generalization across multiple domains. Additionally, there is a notable performance gap between single-lead and multi-lead ECG analyses. We introduced an ECG Foundation Model (ECGFounder), a general-purpose model that leverages real-world ECG annotations from cardiology experts to broaden the diagnostic capabilities of ECG analysis. ECGFounder was trained on over 10 million ECGs with 150 label categories from the Harvard-Emory ECG Database, enabling comprehensive cardiovascular disease diagnosis through ECG analysis. The model is designed to be both an effective out-of-the-box solution, and a to be fine-tunable for downstream tasks, maximizing usability. Importantly, we extended its application to lower rank ECGs, and arbitrary single-lead ECGs in particular. ECGFounder is applicable to supporting various downstream tasks in mobile monitoring scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ECGFounder achieves expert-level performance on internal validation sets, with AUROC exceeding 0.95 for eighty diagnoses. It also shows strong classification performance and generalization across various diagnoses on external validation sets. When fine-tuned, ECGFounder outperforms baseline models in demographic analysis, clinical event detection, and cross-modality cardiac rhythm diagnosis. The trained model and data will be publicly released upon publication through the bdsp.io. Our code is available at https://github.com/PKUDigitalHealth/ECGFounder</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Path loss prediction is a beneficial tool for efficient use of the radio frequency spectrum. Building on prior research on high-resolution map-based path loss models, this paper studies convolutional neural network input representations in more detail. We investigate different methods of representing scalar features in convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we compare using frequency and distance as input channels to convolutional layers or as scalar inputs to regression layers. We assess model performance using three different feature configurations and find that representing scalar features as image channels results in the strongest generalization.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Uplink ISAC Receiver Designs: Performance Analysis and Algorithm Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have recently emerged as a promising research direction, enabling simultaneous uplink signal detection and target sensing. In this paper, we propose the flexible projection (FP)-type receiver that unify the projection-type receiver and the successive interference cancellation (SIC)-type receiver by using a flexible tradeoff factor to adapt to dynamically changing uplink ISAC scenarios. The FP-type receiver addresses the joint signal detection and target response estimation problem through two coordinated phases: 1) Communication signal detection using a reconstructed signal whose composition is controlled by the tradeoff factor, followed by 2) Target response estimation performed through subtraction of the detected communication signal from the received signal. With adjustable tradeoff factors, the FP-type receiver can balance the enhancement of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) with the reduction of correlation in the reconstructed signal for communication signal detection. The pairwise error probabilities (PEPs) are analyzed for both the maximum likelihood (ML) and the zero-forcing (ZF) detectors, revealing that the optimal tradeoff factor should be determined based on the adopted detection algorithm and the relative power of the sensing and communication (S\&amp;C) signal. A homotopy optimization framework is first applied for the FP-type receiver with a fixed trade-off factor. This framework is then extended to develop the dynamic FP (DFP)-type receiver, which iteratively adjust the trade-off factor for improved algorithm performance and environmental adaptability. Subsequently, two extensions are explored to further enhance the receiver's performance: parallel DFP (PDFP)-type receiver and a block-structured receiver design. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed receiver designs is verified via simulations.</description>
