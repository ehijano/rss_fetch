      <title>Contiguous Boundary Guarding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of guarding the boundary of a simple polygon with a minimum number of guards such that each guard covers a contiguous portion of the boundary. First, we present a simple greedy algorithm for this problem that returns a guard set of size at most OPT + 1, where OPT is the number of guards in an optimal solution. Then, we present a polynomial-time exact algorithm. While the algorithm is not complicated, its correctness proof is rather involved. This result is interesting in the sense that guarding problems are typically NP-hard and, in particular, it is NP-hard to minimize the number of guards to see the boundary of a simple polygon, without the contiguous boundary guarding constraint.
  From the combinatorial point of view, we show that any $n$-vertex polygon can be guarded by at most $\lfloor \frac{n-2}{2}\rfloor$ guards. This bound is tight because there are polygons that require this many guards.</description>

      <title>Folding One Polyhedral Metric Graph into Another</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of folding one polyhedron, viewed as a metric graph of its edges, into the shape of another, similar to 1D origami. We find such foldings between all pairs of Platonic solids and prove corresponding lower bounds, establishing the optimal scale factor when restricted to integers. Further, we establish that our folding problem is also NP-hard, even if the source graph is a tree. It turns out that the problem is hard to approximate, as we obtain NP-hardness even for determining the existence of a scale factor 1.5-{\epsilon}. Finally, we prove that, in general, the optimal scale factor has to be rational. This insight then immediately results in NP membership. In turn, verifying whether a given scale factor is indeed the smallest possible, requires two independent calls to an NP oracle, rendering the problem DP-complete.</description>

      <title>Continuous Flattening and Reversing of Convex Polyhedral Linkages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two results about transforming any convex polyhedron, modeled as a linkage L of its edges. First, if we subdivide each edge of L in half, then L can be continuously flattened into a plane. Second, if L is equilateral and we again subdivide each edge in half, then L can be reversed, i.e., turned inside-out. A linear number of subdivisions is optimal up to constant factors, as we show (nonequilateral) examples that require a linear number of subdivisions. For nonequilateral linkages, we show that more subdivisions can be required: even a tetrahedron can require an arbitrary number of subdivisions to reverse. For nonequilateral tetrahedra, we provide an algorithm that matches this lower bound up to constant factors: logarithmic in the aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>Subset Selection Problems in Planar Point Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set satisfying condition $\mathcal{A}$, the subset selection problem asks, how large of a subset satisfying condition $\mathcal{B}$ can we find? We make progress on three instances of subset selection problems in planar point sets. Let $n,s\in\mathbb{N}$ with $n\geq s$, and let $P\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of $n$ points, where at most $s$ points lie on the same line.
  Firstly, we select a general position subset of $P$, i.e., a subset containing no $3$ points on the same line. This problem was proposed by Erd\H{o}s under the regime when $s$ is a constant. For $s$ being non-constant, we give new lower and upper bounds on the maximum size of such a subset. In particular, we show that in the worst case such a set can have size at most $O(n/s)$ when $n^{1/3}\leq s\leq n$ and $O(n^{5/6+o(1)}/\sqrt{s})$ when $3\leq s\leq n^{1/3}$.
  Secondly, we select a monotone general position subset of $P$, that is, a subset in general position where the points are ordered from left to right and their $y$-coordinates are either non-decreasing or non-increasing. We present bounds on the maximum size of such a subset. In particular, when $s=\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, our upper and lower bounds differ only by a logarithmic factor.
  Lastly, we select a subset of $P$ with pairwise distinct slopes. This problem was initially studied by Erd\H{o}s, Graham, Ruzsa, and Taylor on the grid. We show that for $s=O(\sqrt{n})$ such a subset of size $\Omega((n/\log{s})^{1/3})$ can always be found in $P$. When $s=\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, this matches a lower bound given by Zhang on the grid. As for the upper bound, we show that in the worst case such a subset has size at most $O(\sqrt{n})$ for $2\leq s\leq n^{3/8}$ and $O((n/s)^{4/5})$ for $n^{3/8}\leq s=O(\sqrt{n})$.
  The proofs use a wide range of tools such as incidence geometry, probabilistic methods, the hypergraph container method, and additive combinatorics.</description>

      <title>A subgradient splitting algorithm for optimization on nonpositively curved metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many of the primal ingredients of convex optimization extend naturally from Euclidean to Hadamard spaces $\unicode{x2014}$ nonpositively curved metric spaces like Euclidean, Hilbert, and hyperbolic spaces, metric trees, and more general CAT(0) cubical complexes. Linear structure, however, and the duality theory it supports are absent. Nonetheless, we introduce a new type of subgradient for convex functions on Hadamard spaces, based on Busemann functions. This notion supports a splitting subgradient method with guaranteed complexity bounds. In particular, the algorithm solves $p$-mean problems in general Hadamard spaces: we illustrate by computing medians in BHV tree space.</description>
