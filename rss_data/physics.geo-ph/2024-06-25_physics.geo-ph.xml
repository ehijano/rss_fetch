      <title>Estimation of the Soil Water Characteristics from Dielectric Relaxation Spectra -- a Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency dependence of dielectric material properties of water saturated and unsaturated porous materials such as soil is not only disturbing in applications with high frequency electromagnetic (HF-EM) techniques but also contains valuable information of the material due to strong contributions by interactions between the aqueous pore solution and mineral phases. Hence, broadband HF-EM sensor techniques enable the estimation of soil physico-chemical parameters such as water content, texture, mineralogy, cation exchange capacity and matric potential. In this context, a multivariate (MV) machine learning approach (principal component regression, partial least squares regression, artificial neural networks) was applied to estimate the Soil Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC) from experimentally determined dielectric relaxation spectra of a silty clay soil. The results of the MV-approach were compared with results obtained from empirical equations and theoretical models as well as a novel hydraulic/electromagnetic coupling approach. The applied MV-approach gives evidence, (i) of a physical relationship between soil dielectric relaxation behavior and soil water characteristics as an important hydraulic material property and (ii) the applicability of appropriate sensor techniques for the estimation of physico-chemical parameters of porous media from broadband measured dielectric spectra.</description>

      <title>Petrophysical Characterization of Fractured Limestone from Beauce Aquifer Vadose Zone (O-ZNS Observatory, France)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, water needs increased, driven by climate change and world population growth. In this context, we study groundwater flow in the vadose zone of Beauce aquifer (O-ZNS site, France). This lacustrine limestone vadose zone is characterized by multi-scale heterogeneities. They are defined by strongly various pore structures. This leads to uncertainties for reservoir properties prediction using geophysical methods which impacts reservoir models for flow simulations.In this study, we combined microstructure description and petrophysical analysis in order to model and predict reservoir properties based on different limestones facies and to infer the influence of weathering/fracturing on both acoustics and electrical properties.A total of 16 samples from these facies were cored and characterized by their porosity, permeability, acoustic velocities, complex electrical properties and microstructure analysis.Based on our multi-method approach, we demonstrated the influence of rock structure on reservoir properties prediction and modelling. Petrophysical and microstructure characterization have highlighted two main facies (microporous and homogenous facies and macroporous and heterogenous facies) which can be used to improve reservoir and flow models. However, further development is needed in order to quantify macropores and their link with weathering and to assess permeability models using electrical properties.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Chemical Geothermometers Applied to Waters from some East African Rift Areas (Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya) for Geothermal Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the temperature values of geothermal reservoirs given by classical chemical geothermometers applied on thermal waters are relatively divergent, it is often difficult to estimate the temperatures of these reservoirs with sufficient accuracy for geothermal exploration, before drilling operations. In this case, some auxiliary chemical geothermometers such as Na-Li, Mg-Li, Na-Rb, Na-Cs, K-Sr, K-F, K-Mn, K-Fe, K-W, etc., existing in the literature can be useful tools to help estimating these temperatures. However, previous studies have shown these geothermometers are not only dependent on temperature, but also on other parameters such as the nature of the reservoir rocks and minerals, the fluid salinity, etc. Consequently, they must be used with caution. Another problem for the use of these geothermometers is that Li, Sr, Cs, Rb, Mn, Fe and W are under the form of trace elements in numerous geothermal waters and that it is often difficult to find analyses of these elements in the literature. In this study, we test some of these auxiliary geothermometers on several waters selected from literature data relative to East African Rift (EAR) geothermal areas, in Republic of Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya, where temperature values of deep geothermal reservoirs have been measured into wells or estimated with certainty using chemical classical geothermometers applied on thermal waters. The comparative results are discussed and allow bringing conclusions and recommendations. Among the tested auxiliary geothermometers, this work shows that the Na-Li thermometric relationship defined for the dilute waters from hightemperature volcanic geothermal areas of Iceland is one of the most relevant to estimate the temperatures of deep reservoirs for waters from several geothermal areas from the Republic of Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya. In previous studies, this Na-Li thermometric relationship had also given good estimations of reservoir temperatures for high-temperature (T $\ge$ 300{\textdegree}C) borehole dilute waters from the Los Humeros geothermal area, in Mexico, in volcanic environment. The use of other auxiliary geothermometers such as K-F, K-Sr, Na-Rb and Na-Cs (when F, Sr, Rb and Cs have been analysed) can be also relevant in some cases.</description>

      <title>Exploration of the deep geothermal potential of Petite-Terre Island in Mayotte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2017, the electricity mix of the Department of Mayotte included 5% photovoltaic production, spread over more than 70 installations on the island, and 95% diesel thermal production, provided by two power plants. Nevertheless, since 2005, in order to diversify its electricity supply, the local authorities of Mayotte set up a vast program to develop renewable energies, including the evaluation of Mayotte's geothermal potential to produce electricity.In this framework, BRGM started a program to explore the deep geothermal potential of the department of Mayotte. The conclusions of the different studies confirmed the idea of a strong potential under Petite Terre (Traineau et al., 2006; Sanjuan et al., 2008; Darnet et al., 2019).Our present study aims at refining the knowledge of the subsurface and the geothermal system potentially present beyond a depth of 1000m. This new phase, carried out between 2021 and 2022 includes a geophysical measurement campaign accompanied by a fracture analysis and the study of gas emanating from the ground.The different data set acquired during the campaigns are analysed and interpreted jointly with the data acquired in the framework of the monitoring of the exceptional seismo-volcanic activity observed since May 2018 off the coast of Mayotte.The result of this analysis is a 3D geological model of the structure of the island of Petite Terre, completed by a hydrothermal model of the functioning of the geothermal system, with the aim to help in locating the most favourable zones for geothermal exploitation.</description>

      <title>Interannual Magneto-Coriolis modes and their sensitivity on the magnetic field within the Earth's core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear modes for which the Coriolis acceleration is almost entirely in balance with the Lorentz force are called Magneto-Coriolis (MC) modes. These MC modes are thought to exist in Earth's liquid outer core and could therefore contribute to the variations observed in Earth's magnetic field. The background state on which these waves ride is assumed here to be static and defined by a prescribed magnetic field and zero flow. We introduce a new computational tool to efficiently compute solutions to the related eigenvalue problem, and study the effect of a range of both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric background magnetic fields on the MC modes. We focus on a hierarchy of conditions that sequentially partition the numerous computed modes into those which are (i) in principle observable, (ii) those which match a proxy for interannual geomagnetic signal over 1999-2023, and (iii) those which align with core-flows based on recent geomagnetic data. We found that the background field plays a crucial role in determining the structure of the modes. In particular, we found no examples of axisymmetric background fields that support modes consistent with recent geomagnetic changes, but that some non-axisymmetric background fields do support geomagnetically consistent modes.</description>

      <title>WISER: multimodal variational inference for full-waveform inversion without dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a semi-amortized variational inference framework designed for computationally feasible uncertainty quantification in 2D full-waveform inversion to explore the multimodal posterior distribution without dimensionality reduction. The framework is called WISER, short for full-Waveform variational Inference via Subsurface Extensions with Refinements. WISER leverages the power of generative artificial intelligence to perform approximate amortized inference that is low-cost albeit showing an amortization gap. This gap is closed through non-amortized refinements that make frugal use of acoustic wave physics. Case studies illustrate that WISER is capable of full-resolution, computationally feasible, and reliable uncertainty estimates of velocity models and imaged reflectivities.</description>

      <title>Radio Observations as an Extrasolar Planet Discovery and Characterization: Interior Structure and Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of radio emission from Jupiter was identified quickly as being due to its planetary-scale magnetic field. Subsequent spacecraft investigations have revealed that many of the planets, and even some moons, either have or have had large-scale magnetic fields. In the case of the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the their magnetic fields are generated by dynamo processes within these planets, and an interaction between the solar wind and their magnetic fields generates intense radio emission via the electron cyclotron maser instability. In the case of Jupiter, its magnetic field interacts with the moon Io to result in radio emission as well.
  Extrasolar planets reasonably may be expected to generate large-scale magnetic fields and to sustain an electron cyclotron maser instability. Not only may these radio emissions be a means for discovering extrasolar planets, because magnetic fields are tied to the properties of planetary interiors, radio emissions may be a remote sensing means of constraining extrasolar planetary properties that will be otherwise difficult to access. In the case of terrestrial planets, the presence or absence of a magnetic field may be an indicator for habitability. Since the first edition of the Handbook, there have been a number of advances, albeit there remain no unambigous detection of radio emission from extrasolar planets. New ground-based telescopes and new possibilities for space-based telescopes provide promise for the future.</description>
