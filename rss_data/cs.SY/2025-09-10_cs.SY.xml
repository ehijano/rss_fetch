      <title>Design of Input-Output Observers for a Population of Systems with Bounded Frequency-Domain Variation using $DK$-iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a linear input-output observer design methodology for a population of systems in which each observer uses knowledge of the linear time-invariant dynamics of the particular device. Observers are typically composed of a known model of the system and a correction mechanism to produce an estimate of the state. The proposed design procedure characterizes the variation within the population in the frequency domain and synthesizes a single robust correction filter. The correction filter is compatible with all system models that satisfy the variation characterization such that a given level of estimation performance is guaranteed. This is accomplished by posing a robust performance problem using the observer error dynamics and solving it using $DK$-iteration. The design procedure is experimentally demonstrated on a flexible joint robotic manipulator with varied joint stiffnesses. It is shown that the proposed method that uses a single correction filter achieves comparable estimation performance to a method that uses a correction gain tailored toward each joint stiffness configuration.</description>

      <title>Extended Version: Market-Driven Equilibria for Distributed Solar Panel Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates market-driven long-term investment decisions in distributed solar panels by individual investors. We consider a setting where investment decisions are driven by expected revenue from participating in short-term electricity markets over the panel's lifespan. These revenues depend on short-term markets equilibria, i.e., prices and allocations, which are influenced by aggregate invested panel capacity participating in the markets. We model the interactions among investors by a non-atomic game and develop a framework that links short-term markets equilibria to the resulting long-term investment equilibrium. Then, within this framework, we analyze three market mechanisms: (a) a single-product real-time energy market, (b) a product-differentiated real-time energy market that treats solar energy and grid energy as different products, and (c) a contract-based panel market that trades claims or rights to the production of certain panel capacity ex-ante, rather than the realized solar production ex-post. For each, we derive expressions for short-term equilibria and the associated expected revenues, and analytically characterize the corresponding long-term Nash equilibrium aggregate capacity. We compare the solutions of these characterizing equations under different conditions and theoretically establish that the product-differentiated market always supports socially optimal investment, while the single-product market consistently results in under-investment. We also establish that the contract-based market leads to over-investment when the extra valuations of users for solar energy are small. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving an unprecedented increase in the electricity demand of AI data centers, raising emerging challenges for electric power grids. Understanding the characteristics of AI data center loads and their interactions with the grid is therefore critical for ensuring both reliable power system operation and sustainable AI development. This paper provides a comprehensive review and vision of this evolving landscape. Specifically, this paper (i) presents an overview of AI data center infrastructure and its key components, (ii) examines the key characteristics and patterns of electricity demand across the stages of model preparation, training, fine-tuning, and inference, (iii) analyzes the critical challenges that AI data center loads pose to power systems across three interrelated timescales, including long-term planning and interconnection, short-term operation and electricity markets, and real-time dynamics and stability, and (iv) discusses potential solutions from the perspectives of the grid, AI data centers, and AI end-users to address these challenges. By synthesizing current knowledge and outlining future directions, this review aims to guide research and development in support of the joint advancement of AI data centers and power systems toward reliable, efficient, and sustainable operation.</description>

      <title>Learning Neural Koopman Operators with Dissipativity Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of learning a neural Koopman operator model that provides dissipativity guarantees for an unknown nonlinear dynamical system that is known to be dissipative. We propose a two-stage approach. First, we learn an unconstrained neural Koopman model that closely approximates the system dynamics. Then, we minimally perturb the parameters to enforce strict dissipativity. Crucially, we establish theoretical guarantees that extend the dissipativity properties of the learned model back to the original nonlinear system. We realize this by deriving an exact relationship between the dissipativity of the learned model and the true system through careful characterization of the identification errors from the noisy data, Koopman operator truncation, and generalization to unseen data. We demonstrate our approach through simulation on a Duffing oscillator model.</description>

      <title>Distributed Leader-Follower Consensus for Uncertain Multiagent Systems with Time-Triggered Switching of the Communication Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distributed adaptive control strategy is developed for heterogeneous multiagent systems in nonlinear Brunovsky form with \({\pd}\)-dimensional $n^{\text{th}}$-order dynamics, operating under time-triggered switching communication topologies. The approach uses repulsive potential functions to ensure agent-agent and obstacle safety, while neural network estimators compensate for system uncertainties and disturbances. A high-order control barrier function framework is then employed to certify the positive invariance of the safe sets and the boundedness of the proposed control inputs. The resulting distributed control and adaptive laws, together with dwell-time requirements for topology transitions, achieve leader-following consensus. This integrated design provides synchronized formation and robust disturbance rejection in evolving network configurations, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Data-knowledge fusion driven frequency security assessment: A robust framework for renewable-dominated power grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency security is critical for power grids, as deviations can trigger widespread outages and result in substantial economic losses. However, modern renewable-dominated power grids face an increased risk of insecurity due to low inertia and nonlinear frequency responses. To mitigate these risks, robust pre-fault frequency security assessment (FSA) is critical, which enables grid operators to implement preventive control strategies. We propose a data-knowledge fusion framework to achieve intelligent FSA in actual power grids. First, we classify FSA domain knowledge into two distinct categories: (1) physics-guided knowledge directs the neural network pre-training process, ensuring that the fusion model's predictions consistent with frequency response mechanisms, and (2) physics-constrained knowledge establishes quantitative relationship on predictions, which forces them within theoretical ranges defined by domain knowledge. Furthermore, we develop a dual-channel neural network architecture to simultaneously capture both local and global characteristics of the power system. Finally, we introduce a data-knowledge fusion training algorithm that integrates guided learning with constrained network architecture to enhance model reliability and generalization. Case studies on China's Yunnan Provincial Power Grid validate the superior performance of our framework: it reduces average prediction error to 1.26% (a 49.2% reduction over data-driven methods), and maintains 97.60% accuracy in untrained scenarios (3.85% higher than data-driven methods), therefore satisfies the accuracy, reliability, and generalization requirements for actual power grids. The proposed methodology establishes a new paradigm for enhancing robustness of FSA in power grids, with potential application to cross-domain security assessment.</description>

      <title>Distributed Frequency Control for Multi-Area Power Systems Considering Transient Frequency Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High penetration of renewable energy sources intensifies frequency fluctuations in multi-area power systems, challenging both stability and operational safety. This paper proposes a novel distributed frequency control method that ensures transient frequency safety and enforces generation capacity constraints, while achieving steady-state frequency restoration and optimal economic operation. The method integrates a feedback optimization (FO)-based controller and a safety corrector. The FO-based controller generates reference setpoints by solving an optimization problem, driving the system to the steady state corresponding to the optimal solution of this problem. The safety corrector then modifies these references using control barrier functions to maintain frequencies within prescribed safe bounds during transients while respecting capacity constraints. The proposed method combines low computational burden with improved regulation performance and enhanced practical applicability. Theoretical analysis establishes optimality, asymptotic stability, and transient frequency safety for the closed-loop system. Simulation studies show that, compared with conventional FO-based schemes, the method consistently enforces frequency safety and capacity limits, achieves smaller frequency deviations and faster recovery, thereby demonstrating its practical effectiveness and advantages.</description>

      <title>Anti-Disturbance Hierarchical Sliding Mode Controller for Deep-Sea Cranes with Adaptive Control and Neural Network Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address non-linear disturbances and uncertainties in complex marine environments, this paper proposes a disturbance-resistant controller for deep-sea cranes. The controller integrates hierarchical sliding mode control, adaptive control, and neural network compensation techniques. By designing a global sliding mode surface, the dynamic coordination between the driving and non-driving subsystems is achieved, ensuring overall system stability. The subsystem surfaces reduce oscillations and enhance tracking accuracy. Adaptive control dynamically adjusts system parameters, enhancing robustness against external uncertainties, while the neural network compensates for time-varying disturbances through real-time learning. The stability of the control scheme is verified on the basis of Lyapunov theory. The simulation results demonstrate that, compared to traditional PID control, the proposed controller exhibits significant advantages in trajectory tracking accuracy, response speed, and disturbance rejection.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Event-Triggered MPC for Linear Parameter-Varying Systems with State Delays, Actuator Saturation and Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a unified adaptive event-triggered model predictive control (ETMPC) scheme for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems subject to state delays, actuator saturation, and external disturbances. In existing studies, only a limited number of ETMPC methods have attempted to address either state delays or actuator saturation, and even these few methods typically lack co-design optimization between adaptive event-triggering mechanisms and the control law. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a Lyapunov-Krasovskii-based adaptive ETMPC strategy that enables the co-design optimization of both the triggering mechanism and the controller. Specifically, the event-triggering parameter matrix is adaptively optimized by embedding an internal adaptive variable within the Lyapunov-Krasovskii-like function. Furthermore, the actuator saturation nonlinearity is transformed into a convex hull representation. The infinite-horizon robust optimization problem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem with linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints. Invariant set constraints are introduced to ensure recursive feasibility, and mean-square input-to-state stability (ISS) under multiple uncertainties is rigorously established. Simulations on an industrial electric heating system validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing communication load.</description>

      <title>A smart fridge with AI-enabled food computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling seamless connectivity and intelligent home automation, particularly in food management. By integrating IoT with computer vision, the smart fridge employs an ESP32-CAM to establish a monitoring subsystem that enhances food management efficiency through real-time food detection, inventory tracking, and temperature monitoring. This benefits waste reduction, grocery planning improvement, and household consumption optimization. In high-density inventory conditions, capturing partial or layered images complicates object detection, as overlapping items and occluded views hinder accurate identification and counting. Besides, varied angles and obscured details in multi-layered setups reduce algorithm reliability, often resulting in miscounts or misclassifications. Our proposed system is structured into three core modules: data pre-processing, object detection and management, and a web-based visualization. To address the challenge of poor model calibration caused by overconfident predictions, we implement a variant of focal loss that mitigates over-confidence and under-confidence in multi-category classification. This approach incorporates adaptive, class-wise error calibration via temperature scaling and evaluates the distribution of predicted probabilities across methods. Our results demonstrate that robust functional calibration significantly improves detection reliability under varying lighting conditions and scalability challenges. Further analysis demonstrates a practical, user-focused approach to modern food management, advancing sustainable living goals through reduced waste and more informed consumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Station-based or Route-based Charging Options addresses fleet optimization incorporating both conventional charging stations and continuous wireless charging infrastructure. This paper extends Schneider et al.'s foundational EVRP-TW model with arc-based dynamic wireless charging representation, partial coverage modeling, and hierarchical multi-objective optimization prioritizing fleet minimization. Computational experiments on Schneider benchmark instances demonstrate substantial operational benefits, with distance and time improvements ranging from 0.7% to 35.9% in secondary objective components. Analysis reveals that 20% wireless coverage achieves immediate benefits, while 60% coverage delivers optimal performance across all test instances for infrastructure investment decisions.</description>

      <title>A kernel-based approach to physics-informed nonlinear system identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a kernel-based framework for physics-informed nonlinear system identification. The key contribution is a structured methodology that extends kernel-based techniques to seamlessly integrate partially known physics-based models, improving parameter estimation and overall model accuracy. The proposed method enhances traditional modeling approaches by integrating a parametric model, which provides physical interpretability, with a kernel-based function, which accounts for unmodelled dynamics. The two model's components are identified from data simultaneously, minimizing a suitable cost that balances the relative importance of the physical and the black-box parts of the model. Additionally, nonlinear state smoothing is employed to address scenarios involving state-space models with not fully measurable states. Numerical simulations on an experimental benchmark system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with performance comparisons against state-of-the-art identification techniques.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a distributed control method for matrix-scaled multi-agent networks aimed at achieving convergence within a user-defined time frame. The control law of each individual agent relies only on information from neighboring agents and is updated at discrete intervals determined by state-dependent triggering functions, reducing the frequency of agent interactions. To this end, first, the controller is augmented with a time-varying gain. Then, the dynamics of the closed-loop system over the finite-time interval is transformed into an infinite-time frame using time scaling. Lyapunov-based analysis is employed to derive suitable triggering conditions that guarantee the asymptotic convergence of the time-transformed system, thereby ensuring the prescribed-time convergence of the original system.</description>

      <title>Swarm-optimized Adaptive Augmentation of Missile Autopilot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of optimizing a missile autopilot. In particular, the paper investigates the application of an online learning technique to learn and optimize the gains of a three-loop topology autopilot for a planar missile modeled with nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear aerodynamics forces and moments. The classical autopilot for a missile is based on a three-loop topology, where each loop consists of tunable proportional gains. An adaptive three-loop autopilot is constructed by augmenting the classical autopilot's fixed-gain controllers with a learning-based controller, which is recursively optimized using retrospective cost optimization. Numerical simulations show that online learning improves the tracking performance of the classical autopilot in both nominal and off-nominal interception scenarios.</description>

      <title>Filtering in Multivariate Systems with Quantized Measurements using a Gaussian Mixture-Based Indicator Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of state estimation in multivariable dynamic systems with quantized outputs, a common scenario in applications involving low-resolution sensors or communication constraints. A novel method is proposed to explicitly construct the probability mass function associated with the quantized measurements by approximating the indicator function of each region defined by the quantizer using Gaussian mixture models. Unlike previous approaches, this technique generalizes to any number of quantized outputs without requiring case-specific numerical solutions, making it a scalable and efficient solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed filter achieves high accuracy in state estimation, both in terms of fidelity of the filtering distributions and mean squared error, while maintaining significantly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Sensor Management in Multi-Stage Stochastic Control Problems with Imperfect State Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological advancements in miniaturization and wireless communications are yielding more affordable and versatile sensors and, in turn, more applications in which a network of sensors can be actively managed to best support overall decision-making objectives. We propose modeling the opportunity for sensor management within multi-stage stochastic control problems with imperfect state information. Such formulations inherently assume the state of the modeled environment cannot be accessed directly but instead the controller can observe only noisy measurements of the state and, therefore, at each decision stage some form of state estimation is required before a control is actuated. The notion of sensor management arises when the modeled controls not only affect the subsequent evolution of the state but can also affect the nature of future measurements and, hence, the quality of state estimates that drive future control decisions. In principle, the optimal strategy for any appropriately modeled multi-stage stochastic control problem with imperfect state information (with or without opportunity for sensor management) is the solution to a dynamic program; in practice, the computational requirements are typically prohibitive yet dynamic programming methods are still useful to guide the development of effective suboptimal strategies. In this spirit, we model the opportunity for sensor management within small-scale examples of two well-studied dynamic programming formulations, namely (1) the finite-state/finite-action Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (PO-MDP) and (2) the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian Regulator (LQGR). These examples admit solvable dynamic programs and confirm how the interplay between sensing and acting is a natural by-product of a dynamic programming solution.</description>

      <title>Feedback Linearization-based Guidance Law for Guaranteed Interception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an input-output feedback linearization (IOL)-based guidance law to ensure interception in a pursuer-evader engagement scenario. A point-mass dynamic model for both the pursuer and the evader is considered. An IOL guidance law is derived using range and line-of-sight (LOS) rate measurements. It is found that the range-based IOL guidance law exhibits a singularity under certain conditions. To address this issue, a fuzzy logic system is employed to smoothly blend the IOL guidance with the classical proportional guidance law, thereby avoiding the singularity. In contrast, the LOS-based IOL guidance law is free of singularities but suffers from divergence issues due to angle-related complications. To resolve this, a simple correction function is introduced to ensure consistent interception behavior. Results from Monte Carlo simulations indicate that both modifications of the IOL guidance laws cause interception with control limits applied.</description>

      <title>Multi-Topic Projected Opinion Dynamics for Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model of opinion formation on resource allocation among multiple topics by multiple agents, who are subject to hard budget constraints. We define a utility function for each agent and then derive a projected dynamical system model of opinion evolution assuming that each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility subject to its constraints. Inter-agent coupling arises from an undirected social network, while inter-topic coupling arises from resource constraints. We show that opinions always converge to the equilibrium set. For special networks with very weak antagonistic relations, the opinions converge to a unique equilibrium point. We further show that the underlying opinion formation game is a potential game. We relate the equilibria of the dynamics and the Nash equilibria of the game and characterize the unique Nash equilibrium for networks with no antagonistic relations. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Partitioning and Self-organization of Distributed Generation in Large Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution networks will experience more installations of distributed generation (DG) that is unpredictable and stochastic in nature. Greater distributed control and intelligence will allow challenges such as voltage control to be handled effectively. The partitioning of power networks into smaller clusters provides a method to split the control problem into manageable sub-problems. This paper presents a community detection-based partitioning technique for distribution networks considering local DGs, allowing them to be grouped and controlled in a distributed manner by using local signals and measurements. This method also allows each community to control the voltage using only neighboring DGs, and for each community to self-organize to reflect varying DG conditions and to maintain stable control. Simulations demonstrate that the partitioning of the large distribution network is effective, and each community is able to self-organize and to regulate the voltage independently using only its local DGs.</description>

      <title>A Markov Decision Process Model for Intrusion Tolerance Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and analyze a simplest Markov decision process model for intrusion tolerance problems, assuming that (i) each attack proceeds through one or more steps before the system's security fails, (ii) defensive responses that target these intermediate steps may only sometimes thwart the attack and (iii) reset responses that are sensible upon discovering an attack's completion may not always recover from the security failure. The analysis shows that, even in the ideal case of perfect detectors, it can be sub-optimal in the long run to employ defensive responses while under attack; that is, depending on attack dynamics and response effectiveness, the total overhead of ongoing defensive countermeasures can exceed the total risk of intermittent security failures. The analysis similarly examines the availability loss versus the risk reduction of employing preemptive resets, isolating key factors that determine whether system recovery is best initiated reactively or proactively. We also discuss model extensions and related work looking towards intrusion tolerance applications with (i) imperfect or controllable detectors, (ii) multiple types of attacks, (iii) continuous-time dynamics or (iv) strategic attackers.</description>

      <title>Computational Concept of the Psyche</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article provides an overview of approaches to modeling the human psyche in the perspective of building an artificial one. Based on the review, a concept of cognitive architecture is proposed, where the psyche is considered as an operating system of a living or artificial subject, including a space of needs that determines its life meanings in connection with stimuli from the external world, and intelligence as a decision-making system for actions in relation to this world in order to satisfy these needs. Based on the concept, a computational formalization is proposed for creating artificial intelligence systems through learning from experience in the space of a space of needs, taking into account their biological or existential significance for an intelligent agent. Thus, the problem of building general artificial intelligence as a system for making optimal decisions in the space of agent-specific needs under conditions of uncertainty is formalized, with maximization of success in achieving goals, minimization of existential risks and maximization of energy efficiency. A minimal experimental implementation of the model is also provided.</description>

      <title>Safe and Non-Conservative Contingency Planning for Autonomous Vehicles via Online Learning-Based Reachable Set Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must navigate dynamically uncertain environments while balancing the safety and driving efficiency. This challenge is exacerbated by the unpredictable nature of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HVs) and perception inaccuracies, which require planners to adapt to evolving uncertainties while maintaining safe trajectories. Overly conservative planners degrade driving efficiency, while deterministic approaches may encounter serious issues and risks of failure when faced with sudden and unexpected maneuvers. To address these issues, we propose a real-time contingency trajectory optimization framework in this paper. By employing event-triggered online learning of HV control-intent sets, our method dynamically quantifies multi-modal HV uncertainties and refines the forward reachable set (FRS) incrementally. Crucially, we enforce invariant safety through FRS-based barrier constraints that ensure safety without reliance on accurate trajectory prediction of HVs. These constraints are embedded in contingency trajectory optimization and solved efficiently through consensus alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The system continuously adapts to the uncertainties in HV behaviors, preserving feasibility and safety without resorting to excessive conservatism. High-fidelity simulations on highway and urban scenarios, as well as a series of real-world experiments demonstrate significant improvements in driving efficiency and passenger comfort while maintaining safety under uncertainty.

      <title>Differential Dynamic Programming for the Optimal Control Problem with an Ellipsoidal Target Set and Its Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses an extended class of optimal control problems where a target for a system state has the form of an ellipsoid rather than a fixed, single point. As a computationally affordable method for resolving the extended problem, we present a revised version of the differential dynamic programming (DDP), termed the differential dynamic programming with ellipsoidal target set (ETS-DDP). To this end, the problem with an ellipsoidal target set is reformulated into an equivalent form with the orthogonal projection operator, yielding that the resulting cost functions turn out to be discontinuous at some points. As the DDP usually requires the differentiability of cost functions, in the ETS-DDP formulation we locally approximate the (nonsmooth) cost functions to smoothed ones near the path generated at the previous iteration, by utilizing the explicit form of the orthogonal projection operator. Moreover, a statistical inference method is also presented for designing the ellipsoidal target set, based on data on admissible target points collected by expert demonstrations. Via a simulation on autonomous parking of a vehicle, it is seen that the proposed ETS-DDP efficiently derives an admissible state trajectory while running much faster than the point-targeted DDP, at the expense of optimality.</description>

      <title>Can SSD-Mamba2 Unlock Reinforcement Learning for End-to-End Motion Control?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context. We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations (e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety (collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion control.</description>

      <title>On-chip microwave sensing of quasiparticles in tantalum superconducting circuits on silicon for scalable quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance and scalability of superconducting quantum circuits are fundamentally constrained by non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which induce microwave losses that limit resonator quality factors and qubit coherence times. Understanding and mitigating these excitations is therefore central to advancing scalable quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate on-chip microwave sensing of quasiparticles in high-Q {\alpha}-tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon, operated in the single-photon regime. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal persistent non-equilibrium quasiparticles at millikelvin temperatures, producing a measurable suppression of the internal quality factor (Qi) relative to theoretical expectations. By benchmarking across materials, we find that the quasiparticle density in {\alpha}-Ta is approximately one-third that of NbN at equivalent normalised temperatures (T/Tc), directly correlating with reduced microwave loss. Our methodology establishes a scalable platform for probing quasiparticle dynamics and points towards new routes for engineering superconducting circuits with improved coherence, with impact on qubit readout resonators, kinetic-inductance detectors, and emerging quantum processors and sensors.</description>

      <title>Fault Tolerant Control of a Quadcopter using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based control framework aimed at enhancing the safety and robustness of the quadcopter, with a specific focus on resilience to in-flight one propeller failure. Addressing the critical need of a robust control strategy for maintaining a desired altitude for the quadcopter to safe the hardware and the payload in physical applications. The proposed framework investigates two RL methodologies Dynamic Programming (DP) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to overcome the challenges posed by the rotor failure mechanism of the quadcopter. DP, a model-based approach, is leveraged for its convergence guarantees, despite high computational demands, whereas DDPG, a model-free technique, facilitates rapid computation but with constraints on solution duration. The research challenge arises from training RL algorithms on large dimensions and action domains. With modifications to the existing DP and DDPG algorithms, the controllers were trained not only to cater for large continuous state and action domain and also achieve a desired state after an inflight propeller failure. To verify the robustness of the proposed control framework, extensive simulations were conducted in a MATLAB environment across various initial conditions and underscoring its viability for mission-critical quadcopter applications. A comparative analysis was performed between both RL algorithms and their potential for applications in faulty aerial systems.</description>

      <title>State Estimation with Protecting Exogenous Inputs via Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the real-time state estimation problem for dynamic systems while protecting exogenous inputs against adversaries, who may be honest-but-curious third parties or external eavesdroppers. The Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is employed to constrain the mean square error (MSE) of the adversary's estimate for the exogenous inputs above a specified threshold. By minimizing the MSE of the state estimate while ensuring a certain privacy level measured by CRLB, the problem is formulated as a constrained optimization. To solve the optimization problem, an explicit expression for CRLB is first provided. As the computational complexity of the CRLB increases with the time step, a low-complexity approach is proposed to make the complexity independent of time. Then, a relaxation approach is proposed to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Finally, a privacy-preserving state estimation algorithm with low complexity is developed, which also ensures $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. Two illustrative examples, including a practical scenario for protecting building occupancy, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of Nonlinear (NL) systems. In this paper, we restrict the SRG to particular input spaces to compute frequency-dependent incremental gain bounds for nonlinear systems. This leads to a NL generalization of the Bode diagram, where the sinusoidal, harmonic, and subharmonic inputs are considered separately. When applied to the analysis of the NL loop transfer and sensitivity, we define a notion of bandwidth for both the open-loop and closed-loop, compatible with the Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) definitions. We illustrate the power of our method on the analysis of a DC motor with a parasitic nonlinearity and verify our results in simulations.</description>

      <title>PRIME: Fast Primal-Dual Feedback Optimization for Markets with Application to Optimal Power Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controllers iteratively drive a plant to an optimal operating point that satisfies input and output constraints, relying solely on the input-output sensitivity as model information. This paper introduces PRIME (PRoximal Iterative MarkEts), a novel OFO approach based on proximal-point iterations. Unlike existing OFO solutions, PRIME admits a market-based implementation, where self-interested actors are incentivized to make choices that result in safe and efficient operation, without communicating private costs or constraints. Furthermore, PRIME can handle non-smooth objective functions, achieve fast convergence rates and rapid constraint satisfaction, and effectively reject measurement noise. We demonstrate PRIME on an AC optimal power flow problem, obtaining an efficient real-time nonlinear local marginal pricing scheme.</description>

      <title>Safety Controller Synthesis for Stochastic Networked Systems under Communication Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a framework for synthesizing safety controllers for discrete-time stochastic linear control systems (dt-SLS) operating under communication imperfections. The control unit is remote and communicates with the sensor and actuator through an imperfect wireless network. We consider a constant delay in the sensor-to-controller channel (uplink), and data loss in both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator (downlink) channels. In our proposed scheme, data loss in each channel is modeled as an independent Bernoulli-distributed random process. To systematically handle the uplink delay, we first introduce an augmented discrete-time stochastic linear system (dt-ASLS) by concatenating all states and control inputs that sufficiently represent the state-input evolution of the original dt-SLS under the delay and packet loss constraints. We then leverage control barrier certificates for dt-ASLS to synthesize a controller that ensures the stochastic safety of dt-SLS, guaranteeing that all trajectories remain outside unsafe regions with a quantified probabilistic bound. Our approach translates safety constraints into matrix inequalities, leading to an optimization problem that eventually quantifies the probability of satisfying the safety specification in the presence of communication imperfections. We validate our results on an RLC circuit subject to both constant delay and probabilistic data loss.</description>

      <title>Grid impedance estimation based Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17325v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern power systems face new operational hurdles due to the increasing adoption of inverter-coupled distributed energy resources, which impact system stability and control. Central to these challenges is the dynamic nature of grid impedance. To address this, a novel real-time estimation algorithm based on the Discrete Fourier Transform is proposed. This algorithm is embedded within an Advanced Angle Estimation Kalman Filter framework that employs a Linear Quadratic Regulator for current control (AAEKF-LQR). The impedance data directly informs and refines the controller's phase angle estimation. Simulation analyses demonstrate robust collaboration between the estimator and controller, sustaining system stability under weak grid conditions. The technique proves capable of delivering swift and accurate impedance updates during grid variations, which is crucial for maintaining stable inverter operation</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Koopman Eigenfunctions and Commuting Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator framework offers a way to represent a nonlinear system as a linear one. The key to this simplification lies in the identification of eigenfunctions. While various data-driven algorithms have been developed for this problem, a theoretical characterization of Koopman eigenfunctions from geometric properties of the flow is still missing. This paper provides such a characterization by establishing an equivalence between a set of Koopman eigenfunctions and a set of commuting symmetries -- both assumed to span the tangent spaces at every point on a simply connected open set. Based on this equivalence, we build an explicit and convergent formula for the principal Koopman eigenfunctions defined on the region of attraction of a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium point, thereby offering a constructive formula to compute Koopman eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Maximally Resilient Controllers under Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the notion of resilience of a dynamical system, defined by the maximum disturbance a controlled dynamical system can withstand while satisfying given temporal logic specifications. Given a dynamical system and a specification, the objective is to synthesize the controller such that the closed-loop system satisfies this specification while maximizing its resilience. The problem is formulated as a robust optimization program where the objective is to compute the maximum resilience while simultaneously synthesizing the corresponding controller parameters. For linear systems and linear controllers, exact solutions are provided for the class of time-varying polytopic specifications. For the case of nonlinear systems, nonlinear controllers and more general specifications, we leverage tools from the scenario optimization approach, offering a probabilistic guarantee of the solution as well as computational feasibility. Different case studies are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Linearly Controlled Language Generation with Performative Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of Large Language Models (LMs) in critical applications highlights the need for controlled language generation strategies that are not only computationally efficient but that also enjoy performance guarantees. To achieve this, we use a common model of concept semantics as linearly represented in an LM's latent space. In particular, we take the view that natural language generation traces a trajectory in this continuous semantic space, realized by the language model's hidden activations. This view permits a control-theoretic treatment of text generation in latent space, in which we propose a lightweight, gradient-free intervention that dynamically steers trajectories away from regions corresponding to undesired meanings. In particular, we propose to directly intervene the activations of the token that is being generated in embedding space in an online fashion. Crucially, we do not simply steer activations towards a desirable region. Instead, our method relies on classical techniques from control theory to precisely control activations in a context-dependent way, and guarantees that they are brought into a specific pre-defined region of embedding space that corresponds to allowed semantics. Our intervention is computed in closed-form according to an optimal controller formulation, minimally impacting generation time. This control of the activations in embedding space allows for fine-grained steering of attributes of the generated sequence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different objectives -- toxicity avoidance and sentiment control -- while maintaining text quality.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Gradient Waveform Design for Arbitrary $k$-Space Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: \textbf{Objective: }To develop a real-time method for designing gradient waveforms for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories that are time-optimal and hardware-compliant. \textbf{Methods: }The gradient waveform is solved recursively under both the slew-rate and the trajectory constraints. The gradient constraint is enforced by thresholding the $\ell_2$-norm of the next gradient vector. The constraints form a quadratic equation. To ensure the existence of the solution, a novel Discrete-Time Forward and Backward Sweep (DTFBS) strategy is proposed. To ensure the existence of the trajectory derivatives, the trajectory function is reparameterized as a piecewise cubic polynomial function with $C^2$ continuity. To ensure trajectory fidelity, the output gradient waveform is reparameterized by the finite difference of the trajectory samples. Simulation experiments across seven commonly adopted non-Cartesian trajectories were conducted to validate generality, time-optimality, real-time capability, slew-rate accuracy, and improvements over prior work. Imaging feasibility of the designed time-optimal gradient waveform was validated in phantom and in vivo experiments. \textbf{Results: }The proposed method achieves a $&gt;89\%$ reduction in computation time and simultaneously reduces slew-rate overshoot by $&gt;98\%$ compared to the prior method across all involved trajectories. The computation time of the proposed method is shorter than the gradient duration for all tested cases, validating the real-time capability of the proposed method. \textbf{Conclusions: }The proposed method enables real-time and hardware-compliant gradient waveform design, achieving significant reductions in computation time and slew-rate overshoot compared to the previous method. \textbf{Significance: }This is the first method achieving real-time gradient waveform design for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories.</description>

      <title>Grid-Agent: An LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Power Grid Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern power grids face unprecedented complexity from Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), Electric Vehicles (EVs), and extreme weather, while also being increasingly exposed to cyberattacks that can trigger grid violations. This paper introduces Grid-Agent, an autonomous AI-driven framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) within a multi-agent system to detect and remediate violations. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with numerical precision through modular agents: a planning agent generates coordinated action sequences using power flow solvers, while a validation agent ensures stability and safety through sandboxed execution with rollback mechanisms. To enhance scalability, the framework employs an adaptive multi-scale network representation that dynamically adjusts encoding schemes based on system size and complexity. Violation resolution is achieved through optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment. Our experiments on IEEE and CIGRE benchmark networks, including the IEEE 69-bus, CIGRE MV, IEEE 30-bus test systems, demonstrate superior mitigation performance, highlighting Grid-Agent's suitability for modern smart grids requiring rapid, adaptive response.</description>

Abstract: In todays rapidly evolving digital landscape, safeguarding network infrastructures against cyberattacks has become a critical priority. This research presents an innovative AI-driven real-time intrusion detection framework designed to enhance network security, particularly in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Cloud Computing (CC), and Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The system employs classical machine learning models, Logistic Regression, decision trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors, optimized through the novel Energy Valley Optimization (EVO) method using the NSL-KDD dataset. Feature selection significantly reduced the number of input features from 42 to 18, while maintaining strong detection capabilities. The proposed system achieved 98.95 percent. accuracy with Decision Tree, 98.47 percent with K-Nearest Neighbors, and 88.84 percent with Logistic Regression. Moreover, high precision, recall, and F1-scores were attained across all classifiers while substantially reducing training and testing times, making the framework highly suitable for real-time applications. To ensure fair detection across diverse attack types, dataset balancing via Downsampling was applied to address class imbalance challenges. This investigation focuses on the significance of advancing IDSs. in cloud computing and WSNs. Overall, this work advances secure communications by delivering a scalable, low-latency, and high-accuracy intrusion detection solution aligned with the latest trends in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and real-time digital networks.</description>
