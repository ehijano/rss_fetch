      <title>Singleton algorithms for the Constraint Satisfaction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A natural strengthening of an algorithm for the (promise) constraint satisfaction problem is its singleton version: we first fix a constraint to some tuple from the constraint relation, then run the algorithm, and remove the tuple from the constraint if the answer is negative. We characterize the power of the singleton versions of standard universal algorithms for the (promise) CSP over a fixed template in terms of the existence of a minion homomorphism. Using the Hales-Jewett theorem, we show that for finite relational structures this minion condition is equivalent to the existence of polymorphisms with certain symmetries, called palette block symmetric polymorphisms. By proving the existence of such polymorphisms we establish that the singleton version of the BLP+AIP algorithm solves all tractable CSPs over domains of size at most 7. Finally, by providing concrete CSP templates, we illustrate the limitations of linear programming, the power of the singleton versions, and the elegance of the palette block symmetric polymorphisms.</description>

      <title>Change in Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation: Sufficient, Necessary, and Counterfactual Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a formal approach to explaining change of inference in Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs). When drawing conclusions from a QBAF and updating the QBAF to then again draw conclusions (and so on), our approach traces changes -- which we call strength inconsistencies -- in the partial order over argument strengths that a semantics establishes on some arguments of interest, called topic arguments. We trace the causes of strength inconsistencies to specific arguments, which then serve as explanations. We identify sufficient, necessary, and counterfactual explanations for strength inconsistencies and show that strength inconsistency explanations exist if and only if an update leads to strength inconsistency. We define a heuristic-based approach to facilitate the search for strength inconsistency explanations, for which we also provide an implementation.</description>

      <title>Type Isomorphisms for Multiplicative-Additive Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize type isomorphisms in the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic (MALL), and thus in *-autonomous categories with finite products, extending a result for the multiplicative fragment by Balat and Di Cosmo. This yields a much richer equational theory involving distributivity and cancellation laws. The unit-free case is obtained by relying on the proof-net syntax introduced by Hughes and Van Glabbeek. We use the sequent calculus to extend our results to full MALL, including all units, thanks to a study of cut-elimination and rule commutations.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Extension of Intuitionistic Linear Logic: The $L_!^S$-Calculus and Its Categorical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the $L_!^S$-calculus, a linear lambda-calculus extended with scalar multiplication and term addition, that acts as a proof language for intuitionistic linear logic (ILL). These algebraic operations enable the direct expression of linearity at the syntactic level, a property not typically available in standard proof-term calculi. Building upon previous work, we develop the $L_!^S$-calculus as an extension of the $L^S$-calculus with the $!$ modality. We prove key meta-theoretical properties--subject reduction, confluence, strong normalisation, and an introduction property--as well as preserve the expressiveness of the original $L^S$-calculus, including the encoding of vectors and matrices, and the correspondence between proof-terms and linear functions. A denotational semantics is provided in the framework of linear categories with biproducts, ensuring a sound and adequate interpretation of the calculus. This work is part of a broader programme aiming to build a measurement-free quantum programming language grounded in linear logic.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Skeletal Call-by-Need, Smoothly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skeletal call-by-need is an optimization of call-by-need evaluation also known as "fully lazy sharing": when the duplication of a value has to take place, it is first split into "skeleton", which is then duplicated, and "flesh" which is instead kept shared. Here, we provide two cost analyses of skeletal call-by-need. Firstly, we provide a family of terms showing that skeletal call-by-need can be asymptotically exponentially faster than call-by-need in both time and space; it is the first such evidence, to our knowledge. Secondly, we prove that skeletal call-by-need can be implemented efficiently, that is, with bi-linear overhead. This result is obtained by providing a new smooth presentation of ideas by Shivers and Wand for the reconstruction of skeletons, which is then smoothly plugged into the study of an abstract machine following the distillation technique by Accattoli et al.</description>

      <title>Integrating Belief Domains into Probabilistic Logic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) under the Distribution Semantics is a leading approach to practical reasoning under uncertainty. An advantage of the Distribution Semantics is its suitability for implementation as a Prolog or Python library, available through two well-maintained implementations, namely ProbLog and cplint/PITA. However, current formulations of the Distribution Semantics use point-probabilities, making it difficult to express epistemic uncertainty, such as arises from, for example, hierarchical classifications from computer vision models. Belief functions generalize probability measures as non-additive capacities, and address epistemic uncertainty via interval probabilities. This paper introduces interval-based Capacity Logic Programs based on an extension of the Distribution Semantics to include belief functions, and describes properties of the new framework that make it amenable to practical applications.</description>

      <title>An Information-Flow Perspective on Explainability Requirements: Specification and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable systems expose information about why certain observed effects are happening to the agents interacting with them. We argue that this constitutes a positive flow of information that needs to be specified, verified, and balanced against negative information flow that may, e.g., violate privacy guarantees. Since both explainability and privacy require reasoning about knowledge, we tackle these tasks with epistemic temporal logic extended with quantification over counterfactual causes. This allows us to specify that a multi-agent system exposes enough information such that agents acquire knowledge on why some effect occurred. We show how this principle can be used to specify explainability as a system-level requirement and provide an algorithm for checking finite-state models against such specifications. We present a prototype implementation of the algorithm and evaluate it on several benchmarks, illustrating how our approach distinguishes between explainable and unexplainable systems, and how it allows to pose additional privacy requirements.</description>

      <title>Rice-like complexity lower bounds for Boolean and uniform automata networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automata networks are a versatile model of finite discrete dynamical systems composed of interacting entities (the automata), able to embed any directed graph as a dynamics on its space of configurations (the set of vertices, representing all the assignments of a state to each entity). In this world, virtually any question is decidable by a simple exhaustive search. We lever the Rice-like complexity lower bound, stating that any non-trivial monadic second order logic question on the graph of its dynamics is NP-hard or coNP-hard (given the automata network description), to bounded alphabets (including the Boolean case). This restriction is particularly meaningful for applications to "complex systems", where each entity has a restricted set of possible states (its alphabet). For the deterministic case, trivial questions are solvable in constant time, hence there is a sharp gap in complexity for the algorithmic solving of concrete problems on them. For the non-deterministic case, non-triviality is defined at bounded cliquewidth, which offers a structure to establish metatheorems of complexity lower bounds.</description>
