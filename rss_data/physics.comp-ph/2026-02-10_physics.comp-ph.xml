      <title>DISCOVER: A Physics-Informed, GPU-Accelerated Symbolic Regression Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) enables the discovery of interpretable mathematical relationships from experimental and simulation data. These relationships are often coined descriptors which are defined as a fundamental materials property that is directly correlated to a desired or undesired functional property of the material. Although established approaches such as Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) have successfully identified low-dimensional descriptors within large feature spaces many existing SR tools integrate poorly with modern Python workflows, offer limited control over the symbolic search space, or struggle with the computational demands of large-scale studies. This paper introduces DISCOVER (Data-Informed Symbolic Combination of Operators for Variable Equation Regression), an open-source symbolic regression package developed to address these challenges through a modular, physics-motivated design. DISCOVER allows users to guide the symbolic search using domain knowledge, constrain the feature space explicitly, and take advantage of optional GPU acceleration to improve computational efficiency in data-intensive workflows, enabling reproducible and scalable SR workflows. The software is intended for applications in computational physics, computational chemistry, and materials science, where interpretability, physical consistency, and execution time are especially important, and it complements general-purpose SR frameworks by emphasizing the discovery of physically meaningful models.</description>

      <title>diffpy.morph: Python tools for model independent comparisons between sets of 1D functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: diffpy.morph addresses a need to gain scientific insights from 1D scientific spectra in model independent ways. A powerful approach for this is to take differences between pairs of spectra and look for meaningful changes that might indicate underlying chemical, structural, or other modifications. The challenge is that the difference curve may contain uninteresting differences such as experimental inconsistencies and benign physical changes such as the effects of thermal expansion. diffpy.morph allows researchers to apply simple transformations, or "morphs", to one of the datasets to remove the unwanted differences revealing, when they are present, non-trivial differences. diffpy.morph is an open-source Python package available on the Python Package Index and conda-forge. Here, we describe its functionality and apply it to solve a range of experimental challenges on diffraction and PDF data from x-rays and neutrons, though we note that it may be applied to any 1D function in principle.</description>

      <title>Event-Chain Monte Carlo: The global-balance breakthrough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seminal 2009 paper by Bernard, Krauth, and Wilson marked a paradigm shift in Monte Carlo sampling. By abandoning the restrictive condition of detailed balance in favor of the more fundamental principle of global balance, they introduced the Event-Chain Monte Carlo (ECMC) algorithm, which achieves rejection-free, deterministic sampling for hard spheres. This breakthrough demonstrated that persistent, directional dynamics could dramatically accelerate equilibration in dense particle systems. In this commentary, we review this foundational work and elucidate its underlying mechanism using the broader Event-Driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) framework developed in subsequent years. We show how the original hard-sphere concept naturally generalizes to continuous potentials and modern lifted Markov chain formalisms, transforming a surprising specific result into a powerful general class of sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Compressed Sensing Methods for Memory Reduction in Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations of neutronic systems are computationally intensive and demand significant memory resources for high-fidelity modeling. Compressed sensing enables accurate reconstruction of signals from significantly fewer samples than traditional methods. The specific implementation of compressed sensing investigated here involves the use of overlapping cells to collect tallies. Increasing the number of samples improves the reconstruction accuracy, although the marginal gains diminish with more samples. Reconstruction quality is strongly influenced by the sparsity parameter used in basis pursuit denoising. Across the three test cases considered, memory reductions of up to 81.25% (96.25%) are demonstrated for 2D (3D) reconstructions, with select scenarios achieving reconstruction errors within 1 standard deviation of the corresponding high-fidelity reference results.</description>

      <title>dewi-kadita: A Python Library for Idealized Fish Schooling Simulation with Entropy-Based Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective motion in fish schools exemplifies emergent self-organization in active matter systems, yet computational tools for simulating and analyzing these dynamics remain fragmented across research groups. We present dewi-kadita, an open-source Python library implementing the three-dimensional Couzin zone-based model with comprehensive entropy diagnostics tailored for marine collective behavior research. The library introduces seven information-theoretic metrics -- school cohesion entropy, polarization entropy, depth stratification entropy, angular momentum entropy, nearest-neighbor entropy, velocity correlation entropy, and school shape entropy -- that characterize distinct organizational features inaccessible to classical order parameters. These metrics combine into an Oceanic Schooling Index (OSI) providing a single scalar measure of collective disorder. Validation across four canonical configurations (swarm, torus, dynamic parallel, highly parallel) confirms correct reproduction of known phase behaviors: the swarm maintains disorder with polarization $P &lt; 0.1$ and OSI $\approx 0.71$, while the highly parallel state achieves $P = 0.998$ with OSI $= 0.24$ and velocity correlation entropy vanishing to zero. The entropy framework successfully discriminates the torus and dynamic parallel configurations that exhibit comparable order parameter magnitudes through different organizational mechanisms. Numba just-in-time (JIT) compilation accelerates pairwise interaction calculations by $10$--$100\times$, enabling simulations of $150$--$250$ agents over $1000$--$2000$ time steps within five minutes on standard workstation hardware. NetCDF4 output ensures interoperability with oceanographic analysis tools. The library addresses the need for standardized, reproducible infrastructure in collective behavior modeling analogous to established molecular dynamics codes.</description>

      <title>An intramembranous ossification model for the in-silico analysis of bone tissue formation in tooth extraction sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of biological processes allows to predict the spatio-temporal behavior of living tissues by computer-aided (in-silico) testing, a useful tool for the development of medical strategies, avoiding the expenses and potential ethical implications of in-vivo experimentation. A model for bone healing in mouth would be useful for selecting proper surgical techniques in dental procedures. In this paper, the formulation and implementation of a model for Intramembranous Ossification is presented aiming to describe the complex process of bone tissue formation in tooth extraction sites. The model consists in a mathematical description of the mechanisms in which different types of cells interact, synthesize and degrade extra-cellular matrices under the influence of biochemical factors. Special attention is given to angiogenesis, oxygen-dependent effects and growth factor-induced apoptosis of fibroblasts. Furthermore, considering the depth-dependent vascularization of mandibular bone and its influence on bone healing, a functional description of the cell distribution on the severed periodontal ligament (PDL) is proposed. The developed model was implemented using the finite element method (FEM) and successfully validated by simulating an animal in-vivo experiment on dogs reported in the literature. A good fit between model outcome and experimental data was obtained with a mean absolute error of 3.04%. The mathematical framework presented here may represent an important tool for the design of future in-vitro and in-vivo tests, as well as a precedent for future in-silico studies on osseointegration and mechanobiology.</description>

      <title>Tikhonov regularization-based reconstruction of partial scattering functions obtained from contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering (CV-SANS) has been widely employed for nano structural analysis of multicomponent systems. In CV-SANS experiments, scattering intensities of samples with different scattering co\ ntrasts are decomposed into partial scattering functions, corresponding to structure of each component and cross-correlation between different components, by singular value decomposition (SVD). However, the estimation of partial scattering functions with small absolute values often suffers from instability due to the significant differences in the singular values. In this paper, we propose a remedy for this instability by introducing the Tikhonov regularization, which ensures more stable reconstruction of the partial scattering functions.</description>

      <title>Lagged backward-compatible physics-informed neural networks for unsaturated soil consolidation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops a Lagged Backward-Compatible Physics-Informed Neural Network (LBC-PINN) for simulating and inverting one-dimensional unsaturated soil consolidation under long-term loading. To address the challenges of coupled air and water pressure dissipation across multi-scale time domains, the framework integrates logarithmic time segmentation, lagged compatibility loss enforcement, and segment-wise transfer learning.
  In forward analysis, the LBC-PINN with recommended segmentation schemes accurately predicts pore air and pore water pressure evolution. Model predictions are validated against finite element method (FEM) results, with mean absolute errors below 1e-2 for time durations up to 1e10 seconds. A simplified segmentation strategy based on the characteristic air-phase dissipation time improves computational efficiency while preserving predictive accuracy. Sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of the framework across air-to-water permeability ratios ranging from 1e-3 to 1e3.</description>

      <title>Electron-Informed Coarse-Graining Molecular Representation Learning for Real-World Molecular Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various representation learning methods for molecular structures have been devised to accelerate data-driven chemistry. However, the representation capabilities of existing methods are essentially limited to atom-level information, which is not sufficient to describe real-world molecular physics. Although electron-level information can provide fundamental knowledge about chemical compounds beyond the atom-level information, obtaining the electron-level information in real-world molecules is computationally impractical and sometimes infeasible. We propose a method for learning electron-informed molecular representations without additional computation costs by transferring readily accessible electron-level information about small molecules to large molecules of our interest. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on extensive benchmark datasets containing experimentally observed molecular physics. The source code for HEDMoL is available at https://github.com/ngs00/HEDMoL.</description>

      <title>Systematic Performance Assessment of Deep Material Networks for Multiscale Material Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Material Networks (DMNs) are structure-preserving, mechanistic machine learning models that embed micromechanical principles into their architectures, enabling strong extrapolation capabilities and significant potential to accelerate multiscale modeling of complex microstructures. A key advantage of these models is that they can be trained exclusively on linear elastic data and then generalized to nonlinear inelastic regimes during online prediction. Despite their growing adoption, systematic evaluations of their performance across the full offline-online pipeline remain limited. This work presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of DMNs with respect to prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and training robustness. We investigate the effects of offline training choices, including initialization, batch size, training data size, and activation regularization on online generalization performance and uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both prediction error and variance decrease with increasing training data size, while initialization and batch size can significantly influence model performance. Moreover, activation regularization is shown to play a critical role in controlling network complexity and therefore generalization performance. Compared with the original DMN, the rotation-free Interaction-based Material Network (IMN) formulation achieves a 3.4x - 4.7x speed-up in offline training, while maintaining comparable online prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. These findings clarify key trade-offs between model expressivity and efficiency in structure-preserving material networks and provide practical guidance for their deployment in multiscale material modeling.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Band Gaps in Ensemble Density Functional Theory using Thermodynamic Limits of Finite One-Dimensional Model Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble Density Functional Theory (EDFT) is a promising extension to Density Functional Theory (DFT) for calculating excited states. While Kohn-Sham eigenvalue differences underestimate gaps, EDFT has been shown to provide more accurate excitation energies in atoms, molecules and isolated model systems. However, it is unclear whether EDFT is capable of calculating band gaps of periodic systems -- and what an appropriate theoretical formulation would be to describe periodic systems. We explored how EDFT could calculate band gaps by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly wide finite versions of the one-dimensional Kronig-Penney (KP) periodic model. We use Octopus, an ab initio, open-source, real-space DFT code, as in our previous work [R. J. Leano et al., Electron. Struct. 6, 035003 (2024)] in which we found with "particle in a box" models that EDFT can provide a reasonable effective mass correction for the homogeneous electron gas. Now, we use a periodic reference that is gapped. We find that the finite systems' Kohn-Sham gap approaches the same periodic limit for each of three ways of terminating the finite system, though the appropriate states corresponding to the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum have to be carefully identified in each case. Finally, our EDFT results, using a simple ensemblized LDA approximation, have a reasonable nonzero correction to the bandgap in the periodic limit. The results indicate that EDFT is promising for periodic systems, to motivate further work on developing a suitable formalism.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological energy exchange of diatomic gases: Comparison of Pullin and Borgnakke-Larsen models in direct simulation Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In hypersonic rarefied flows, insufficient intermolecular collisions cause significant deviations between translational and rotational temperatures, leading to strong thermal nonequilibrium. For diatomic gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method commonly employs the Borgnakke-Larsen (BL) model to simulate translational-rotational energy exchange (relaxation) processes. Although widely used, the BL model lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation and assumes that only a fraction of collisions lead to rotational relaxation. To address these shortcomings, Pullin introduced a kinetically consistent relaxation model into the gas kinetic theory. By employing the Beta function for energy partitioning, a concrete collision cross section that satisfies the detailed balance condition is constructed. In this study, a comparative investigation of the BL and Pullin models is performed within the DSMC framework, where both original and simplified equations are considered and parameterized by physical accommodated coefficient in the Beta function. A series of test cases--including zero-dimensional rotational relaxation of nitrogen, one-dimensional planar Couette flow and normal shock wave, two-dimensional hypersonic flow past a cylinder, and three-dimensional hypersonic flow around an X38-like vehicle--are performed to assess the accuracy and efficiency of these models. The results confirm the consistency between the Pullin and BL models. Owing to its rigorous theoretical foundation and accurate physical representation, the Pullin model is expected to provide substantial support for the extension of subsequent theoretical studies and numerical simulations. Moreover, in the highly rarefied flow regime (Knudsen number greater than 1, or altitudes above 100 km), the simplified Pullin model exhibits performance comparable to that of the BL model.</description>

      <title>Field conserving adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) scheme on massively parallel adaptive octree meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is widely used to efficiently resolve localized features in time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by selectively refining and coarsening the mesh. However, in long-horizon simulations, repeated intergrid interpolations can introduce systematic drift in conserved quantities, especially for variational discretizations with continuous basis functions. While interpolation from parent-to-child during refinement in continuous Galerkin (CG) discretizations is naturally conservative, the standard injection-based child-to-parent coarsening interpolation is generally not.
  We propose a simple, scalable field-conserving coarsening operator for parallel, octree-based AMR. The method enforces discrete global conservation during coarsening by first computing field conserving coarse-element values at quadrature points and then recovering coarse nodal degrees of freedom via an $L^2$ projection (mass-matrix solve), which simultaneously controls the $L_2$ error. We evaluate the approach on mass-conserving phase-field models, including the Cahn--Hilliard and Cahn--Hilliard--Navier--Stokes systems, and compare against injection in terms of conservation error, solution quality, and computational cost.</description>

      <title>A quantum-inspired multi-level tensor-train monolithic space-time method for nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multilevel tensor-train (TT) framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a global space-time formulation. While space-time TT solvers have demonstrated significant potential for compressed high-dimensional simulations, the literature contains few systematic comparisons with classical time-stepping methods, limited error convergence analyses, and little quantitative assessment of the impact of TT rounding on numerical accuracy. Likewise, existing studies fail to demonstrate performance across a diverse set of PDEs and parameter ranges. In practice, monolithic Newton iterations may stagnate or fail to converge in strongly nonlinear, stiff, or advection-dominated regimes, where poor initial guesses and severely ill-conditioned space-time Jacobians hinder robust convergence. We overcome this limitation by introducing a coarse-to-fine multilevel strategy fully embedded within the TT format. Each level refines both spatial and temporal resolutions while transferring the TT solution through low-rank prolongation operators, providing robust initializations for successive Newton solves. Residuals, Jacobians, and transfer operators are represented directly in TT and solved with the adaptive-rank DMRG algorithm. Numerical experiments for a selection of nonlinear PDEs including Fisher-KPP, viscous Burgers, sine-Gordon, and KdV cover diffusive, convective, and dispersive dynamics, demonstrating that the multilevel TT approach consistently converges where single-level space-time Newton iterations fail. In dynamic, advection-dominated (nonlinear) scenarios, multilevel TT surpasses single-level TT, achieving high accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost, specifically when high-fidelity numerical simulation is required.</description>

      <title>Azimuthally polarized terahertz radiation generation using radially polarized laser pulse in magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical formulation of a radially polarized laser pulse propagating in a homogeneous, magnetized plasma is presented using Lorentz force, continuity and Maxwells equations. Perturbation technique and quasi-static approximation (QSA) have been used to study the generated fields in nonlinear regime. The generated slow, oscillating, transverse electric and magnetic fields having equal amplitude, constitute a radiation field having frequency in the terahertz (THz) range. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation code FBPIC is used to validate analytical findings. Simulation studies also show that the generated THz radiation field propagates beyond the plasma boundary, indicating coherent electromagnetic radiation emission. Furthermore, the field amplitude scales nonlinearly with plasma density and increases linearly with external magnetic field strength, highlighting the role of these parameters in controlling radiation amplitude.</description>

      <title>Fully coupled implicit finite-volume algorithm for viscoelastic interfacial flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fully coupled implicit finite-volume algorithm for incompressible viscoelastic interfacial flows is proposed, whereby the viscoelasticity of the flow is described by an upper-convected Maxwell constitutive model, including limited extensibility and shear-thinning behaviour. The governing equations describing the conservation of continuity and momentum, as well as the constitutive model are discretized using standard finite-volume methods and are solved for pressure, velocity and the polymer stress tensor in a single linear system of equations. Treating all terms of the linearized and discretized governing equations implicit in velocity, pressure and/or the components of the polymer stress tensor, a tightly coupled system of equations is obtained. The interface separating the interacting bulk phases and the surface tension acting at the fluid interface are modelled using a state-of-the-art front-tracking method. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed numerical framework with four representative test cases, including the deformation of a viscoelastic droplet in shear flow at large Weissenberg numbers of up to Wi=10^4, and the jump discontinuity of the rise velocity of a bubble rising in a viscoelastic liquid as a result of a "negative wake". Contrary to previous studies using segregated algorithms, the proposed fully coupled implicit algorithm does not apply or require a log-conformation approach to predict these flows. Overall, the fully implicit coupled front-tracking formulation provides a robust framework to reliable numerical predictions of strongly elastic interfacial flows at large Weissenberg numbers.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning methods have been successful in many areas, like image classification and natural language processing. However, it still needs to be determined how to apply ML to areas with mathematical constraints, like solving PDEs. Among various approaches to applying ML techniques to solving PDEs, the data-driven discretization method presents a promising way of accelerating and improving existing PDE solver on structured grids where it predicts the coefficients of quasi-linear stencils for computing values or derivatives of a function at given positions. It can improve the accuracy and stability of low-resolution simulation compared with using traditional finite difference or finite volume schemes. Meanwhile, it can also benefit from traditional numerical schemes like achieving conservation law by adapting finite volume type formulations. In this thesis, we have implemented the shallow water equation and Euler equation classic solver under a different framework. Experiments show that our classic solver performs much better than the Pyclaw solver. Then we propose four different deep neural networks for the ML-based solver. The results indicate that two of these approaches could output satisfactory solutions.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability with Anisotropic Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurs in multiple heliospheric (solar-wind stream interfaces, planetary magnetospheres, cometary tails, heliopause flanks) and interstellar (protoplanetary disks, relativistic jets, neutron star accretion disks) environments. While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause).</description>

      <title>Solving continuum and rarefied flows using differentiable programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of multi-scale flows remains a formidable challenge. Constructing theoretical models and numerical methods often involves the design and optimization of parameters. While gradient descent methods have been mainly manifested to shine in the wave of deep learning, composable automatic differentiation can advance scientific computing where the application of classical adjoint methods alone is infeasible or cumbersome. Differentiable programming provides a novel paradigm that unifies data structures and control flows and facilitates gradient-based optimization of parameters in a computer program. This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the first solution algorithm for multi-scale flow physics across continuum and rarefied regimes based on differentiable programming. The fully differentiable simulator provides a unified framework for the convergence of computational fluid dynamics and machine learning, i.e., scientific machine learning. Specifically, parameterized mechanical-neural flow models and numerical methods can be constructed for forward physical processes, while the parameters can be trained on the fly with the help of the gradients that are taken through the backward passes of the whole simulation program, a.k.a., end-to-end optimization. As a result, versatile data-driven modeling and simulation can be achieved for physics discovery, surrogate modeling, and simulation acceleration. The fundamentals and implementation of the solution algorithm are demonstrated in detail. Numerical experiments, including forward and inverse problems for hydrodynamic and kinetic equations, are presented to demonstrate the performance of the numerical method. The open-source codes to reproduce the numerical results are available under the MIT license.</description>

      <title>A DSMC method for the space homogeneous multispecies Landau equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for the spatially homogeneous multispecies Landau-Fokker-Planck equation. The scheme is derived from a first-order approximation of the multispecies Boltzmann operator in the grazing collision limit and employs a regularized, easy-to-sample scattering kernel that removes the need for iterative solvers while preserving the fundamental invariants of the Landau dynamics. The method is fully mesh-free -- being a Monte Carlo particle algorithm -- which makes it naturally scalable to high-dimensional velocity spaces and straightforward to couple with particle-in-cell (PIC) solvers via operator splitting. A notable feature of our approach is its ability to treat realistic mass ratios: we show accurate simulations up to the physical proton-electron ($p$-$e$) mass ratio $m_p/m_e \approx 1836$. We validate the method against the multispecies BKW benchmark for Maxwellian interactions and study collisional relaxation for Coulomb interactions, showing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and the expected trend towards Maxwellian equilibria.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence and atomic-scale mechanisms of reduced dislocation mobility in an inorganic semiconductor under illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photo-plasticity in semiconductors, wherein their mechanical properties such as strength, hardness and ductility are influenced by light exposure, has been reported for several decades. Although such phenomena have drawn significant attention for the manufacturability and usage of deformable semiconductor devices, their underlying mechanisms are not well understood due to the lack of direct evidence. Here we provide experimental observation and atomic insights into the reduced mobility of dislocations in zinc sulfide, as a model material, under light. Using photo-nanoindentation and transmission electron microscopy, we observe that dislocations glide shorter distances under light than those in darkness and there are no apparent deformation twins in both conditions. By atomic-scale simulations, we demonstrate that the decreased dislocation mobility is attributed to the increased Peierls stress for dislocation motion and enhanced stress fields around dislocation cores due to photoexcitation. This study improves the understanding of photo-plastic effects in inorganic semiconductors, offering the opportunities for modulating their mechanical properties using light.</description>

      <title>Reducing Weighted Ensemble Variance With Optimal Trajectory Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weighted ensemble (WE) is an enhanced path-sampling method that is conceptually simple, widely applicable, and statistically exact. In a WE simulation, an ensemble of trajectories is periodically pruned or replicated to enhance sampling of rare transitions and improve estimation of mean first passage times (MFPTs). However, poor choices of the parameters governing pruning and replication can lead to high-variance MFPT estimates. Our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 014108 (2023)] presented an optimal WE parameterization strategy and applied it in low-dimensional example systems. The strategy harnesses estimated local MFPTs from different initial configurations to a single target state. In the present work, we apply the optimal parameterization strategy to more challenging, high-dimensional molecular models, namely, synthetic molecular dynamics (MD) models of Trp-cage folding and unfolding, as well as atomistic MD models of NTL9 folding in high-friction and low-friction continuum solvents. In each system we use WE to estimate the MFPT for folding or unfolding events. We show that the optimal parameterization reduces the variance of MFPT estimates in three of four systems, with dramatic improvement in the most challenging atomistic system. Overall, the parameterization strategy improves the accuracy and reliability of WE estimates for the kinetics of biophysical processes.</description>

      <title>SIMSHIFT: A Benchmark for Adapting Neural Surrogates to Distribution Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer significant performance degradation when evaluated on problem configurations outside their training distribution, such as new initial conditions or structural dimensions. While Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques have been widely used in vision and language to generalize across domains without additional labeled data, their application to complex engineering simulations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap through two focused contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks spanning diverse processes and physics: hot rolling, sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we extend established UDA methods to state-of-the-art neural surrogates and systematically evaluate them. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of out-of-distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of UDA in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios.

      <description>arXiv:2508.16822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representing vector fields by potentials can be a challenging task in domains with cavities or tunnels, due to the presence of harmonic fields which are both irrotational and solenoidal but may have no scalar or vector potentials. For harmonic fields normal to the boundary, which exist in domains with cavities, the standard approach is to construct scalar potentials by solving Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions fitted to the closed surfaces surrounding the domain's cavities. For harmonic fields tangent to the boundary, which exist in domains with tunnels, a similar method was lacking. In this article we present a construction of vector potentials obtained by solving curl-curl problems with inhomogeneous tangent boundary conditions fitted to closed curves looping around the tunnels. Just as the cavity surfaces represent a basis for the 2-chain homology group, these tunnel curves represent a basis for the 1-chain homology group and the corresponding vector potentials yield a basis for the tangent harmonic fields. In our analysis the linear independence of the harmonic fields is established by considering their fluxes through a collection of reciprocal surfaces. These surfaces, whose boundaries lie on the boundary of the domain and which are in intersection duality with the tunnel curves, represent a basis for the relative 2-chain homology group modulo the boundary: their existence in general domains follows from the Poincar\'e-Lefschetz duality. Applied to structure-preserving finite elements, our method also provides an exact geometric parametrization of the discrete harmonic fields in terms of discrete potentials.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Spectral-Element Methods for the Spherical Shallow Water Equations in Covariant Form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce discontinuous spectral-element methods of arbitrary order that are well balanced, conservative of mass, and conservative or dissipative of total energy (i.e., a mathematical entropy function) for a covariant flux formulation of the rotating shallow water equations with variable bottom topography on curved manifolds such as the sphere. The proposed methods are based on a skew-symmetric splitting of the tensor divergence in covariant form, which we implement and analyze within a general flux-differencing framework using tensor-product summation-by-parts operators. Such schemes are proven to satisfy semi-discrete mass and energy conservation on general unstructured quadrilateral grids in addition to well balancing for arbitrary continuous bottom topographies, with energy dissipation resulting from a suitable choice of numerical interface flux. Furthermore, the proposed covariant formulation permits an analytical representation of the geometry and associated metric terms while satisfying the aforementioned entropy stability, conservation, and well-balancing properties without the need to approximate the metric terms so as to enforce discrete metric identities. Numerical experiments on cubed-sphere grids are presented in order to verify the schemes' structure-preservation properties as well as to assess their accuracy and robustness within the context of several standard test cases characteristic of idealized atmospheric flows. Our theoretical and numerical results support the further development of the proposed methodology towards a full dynamical core for numerical weather prediction and climate modelling, as well as broader applications to other hyperbolic and advection-dominated systems of partial differential equations on curved manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Tensor network methods strike a middle ground between fully-fledged quantum computing and classical computing, as they take inspiration from quantum systems to significantly speed up certain classical operations. Their strength lies in their compressive power and the wide variety of efficient algorithms that operate within this compressed space. In this work, we focus on applying these methods to fundamental problems in image compression and processing and classical optics such as wave-front propagation and optical image formation, by using directly or indirectly parallels with quantum mechanics and computation. These quantum-inspired methods are expected to yield faster algorithms with applications ranging from astronomy and earth observation to microscopy and classical imaging more broadly.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials for Structural and Defect Properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>

Abstract: High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) such as YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) are essential for next-generation Tokamak fusion reactors, where Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxides (REBCO) form the functional layers in HTS magnets. Because YBCO's superconductivity depends strongly on oxygen stoichiometry and defect structure, atomistic simulations can provide crucial insight into radiation-damage mechanisms and pathways to maintain material performance.
  In this work, we develop and benchmark four Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLPs) for YBCO: the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), the Message-Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE), the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP), and the Tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), trained on an extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) database explicitly designed to include irradiation-damaged-like configurations. The resulting models achieve DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of atomic environments, faithfully capturing the interatomic forces relevant to radiation damage processes.
  Among the tested models, MACE delivers the highest accuracy, although at greater computational cost, while ACE and tabGAP provide an excellent balance between efficiency and fidelity. These machine-learned potentials establish a robust foundation for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation-induced defect evolution in complex superconducting materials</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional RMSD projections for reaction path visualization and validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and are often history dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization histories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimension projection defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using a gradient aware derivative Gaussian Process. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We demonstrate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements, along with the ratification of the visualization for more complex reactions, a grignard rearrangement, and a bicyclobutadiene rearrangement.</description>

      <title>A coupled Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and Level-Set framework for evolving interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) require significantly smaller architectures compared to multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based approaches, while retaining expressive power through spline-based activations. Moving boundary problems are ubiquitous in physical systems, whose numerical solutions are quite complex. We propose a shallow KAN framework combined with a Level-set formulation that directly approximates the temperature distribution $T(\mathbf{x},t)$ and the moving interface $\Gamma(t)$, enforcing the governing PDEs, phase equilibrium, and Stefan condition through physics-informed residuals. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions show that the framework achieves accurate reconstructions of both temperature fields and interface dynamics, highlighting the potential of KANs as a compact and efficient alternative for moving boundary PDEs. First, we validate the model with semi-infinite analytical solutions. Subsequently, the model is extended to 2D using a level-set based formulation for interface propagation, which is solved within the KAN framework. This work demonstrates that KANs are capable of solving complex moving boundary problems without the need for measurement data.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band method with Hessian Eigenmode Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of transition states is central to an understanding of reaction kinetics. Double-endpoint methods where both initial and final states are specified, such as the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB), identify the minimum energy path between the two and thereby the saddle point on the energy surface that is relevant for the given transition, thus providing an estimate of the transition state within harmonic transition state theory. Such calculations can, however, incur high computational costs and may suffer stagnation on exceptionally flat or rough energy surfaces. Conversely, methods that only require specification of an initial set of atomic coordinates, such as the minimum mode following (MMF) method, offer efficiency but can converge on saddle points that are not relevant for the transition of interest. Here, we present an adaptive hybrid algorithm that switches between the CI-NEB and the MMF method so as to get faster convergence to the relevant saddle point. The method is benchmarked for the Baker-Chan (BC) saddle point test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential as well as 59 transitions of a heptamer island on Pt(111) from the OptBench set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance shows a median reduction of energy and force calculations by 46% [95% CrI: -55%, -37%] relative to CI-NEB for the BC set, while a 28% reduction is found for the transitions of the heptamer island. Calculations of the BC set where a simple switch from the CI-NEB to the MMF method is made when the magnitude of the atomic forces drops below 0.5 eV/AA requires 30% more force calculations than the OCI-NEB algorithm. These results show that an adaptive hybrid method mixing CI-NEB and MMF can be a highly efficient tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery of atomic rearrangements.</description>
