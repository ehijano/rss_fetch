      <title>What defines a group of friends? Rethinking community structure in signed, directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of personal relationships among 1068 high school students using a dataset that contains the network of self-reported friendly and conflictive relationships, with information on their directionality and intensity. We analyse the resulting weighted, directed, and signed network using a Bayesian stochastic block model framework, which enables the inference of group structure without imposing prior assumptions on the role of negative or asymmetric ties. While a full model incorporating all edge attributes yields statistically coherent clusters, these do not align with socially meaningful communities. To address this, we focus first on the network backbone of mutual affinities, and we characterize its group organization. Many communities display an assortative structure, often embedded within larger cohesive configurations, but we also observe more diverse patterns such as core-periphery structure and isolated nodes. We then examine how relationship intensity, directionality, and conflict shape group structure. Asymmetric ties, though often occurring between communities, are frequently present within them, revealing the stabilizing effect of group membership on non-mutual relationships. Furthermore, the presence of asymmetric ties does not inherently imply a hierarchical structure, given that all groups both receive and report significant levels of non-reciprocal ties. More intense ties play a disproportionate role in shaping community structure. Finally, negative ties tend to bridge communities, but we find that groups feature a significant level of internal conflict. Our research offers a new perspective on the study of group organization when rich information about the directionality, the intensity and the sign of ties is considered, with implications for identifying social vulnerability and designing targeted interventions.</description>

      <title>Resilience of coupled systems under deep uncertainty and dynamic complexity: An integrative literature review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilience in coupled systems is increasingly critical in addressing global challenges such as climate change and pandemics. These systems show unpredictable behaviour due to dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty across spatiotemporal scales. Despite growing interest, few studies systematically integrate both concepts when assessing resilience. This paper conducts an integrative review of 102 English-language publications to identify gaps in current approaches. Findings reveal that most papers address lower levels of uncertainty and rarely consider dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty simultaneously, which limits the effectiveness of resilience strategies. To advance systems research, we propose a conceptual framework and practical tools to support researchers and decision-makers in evaluating and improving resilience. The paper also outlines future research directions for more robust, adaptive, and integrative resilience assessments.</description>

      <title>Inequality traps detected in sustainable development goals data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between inequality and the biosphere has been hypothesized to mutual dependecies and feedbacks. If that is true, such feedbacks may give rise to inequality regimes and potential tipping points between them. Here we explore synergies and trade-offs between inequality and biosphere-related sustainable development goals. We used the openly available SDG datasets by the World Bank (WB) and United Nations (UN) and applied ordination methods to distill interactions between economic inequality and the environmental impact across countries. Our results confirm the existence of inequality regimes, and we find preliminary evidence that corruption may be a candidate driver of tipping between regimes.</description>

      <title>Unraveling persistent urban-rural gaps: A long-term provincial analysis of residential heating and cooling loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With global climate change and rising demand for thermal comfort, space heating and cooling have become increasingly critical to achieving carbon neutrality in the building sector. This study presents a first attempt to develop a bottom-up regional building energy model based on prototype buildings simulated in EnergyPlus, to assess space heating and cooling loads of urban and rural residential buildings across 30 Chinese provinces from 1980 to 2024. The results indicate that: (1) Guangdong recorded the highest cooling loads in 2020, reaching 76.5 TWh/a in urban areas and 63.0 TWh/a in rural areas; Henan exhibited the highest rural heating load at 174.6 TWh/a, while urban heating loads were highest in provinces such as Liaoning and Shandong. (2) From 1980 to 2024, average cooling loads increased from 12.4 to 15.1 kWh/m2/a in urban areas but declined from 22.63 to 19.87 kWh/m2/a in rural areas. Over the same period, average heating loads decreased from 44.08 to 39.92 kWh/m2/a in urban areas and from 100.15 to 72.42 kWh/m2/a in rural areas. (3) Urban residential building stock has surpassed rural stock in 22 provinces in recent years, compared with only 4 provinces in 2000, and the presence of 12 urban energy-efficiency standards versus only one rural standard further highlights substantial envelope performance gaps. Collectively, these dynamics have led to pronounced and persistent urban-rural disparities in residential heating and cooling loads. These findings underscore the need for differentiated standards and region-specific clean heating strategies, while providing a transferable modeling framework to inform targeted energy-saving policies and support the building sector's transition toward carbon neutrality.</description>

      <title>The Colombian legislative process, 2014-2025: networks, topics, and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The legislative output of Colombia's House of Representatives between 2014 and 2025 is analyzed using 4,083 bills. Bipartite networks are constructed between parties and bills, and between representatives and bills, along with their projections, to characterize co-sponsorship patterns, centrality, and influence, and to assess whether political polarization is reflected in legislative collaboration. In parallel, the content of the initiatives is studied through semantic networks based on co-occurrences extracted from short descriptions, and topics by party and period are identified using a stochastic block model for weighted networks, with additional comparison using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. In addition, a Bayesian sociability model is applied to detect terms with robust connectivity and to summarize discursive cores. Overall, the approach integrates relational and semantic structure to describe thematic shifts across administrations, identify influential actors and collectives, and provide a reproducible synthesis that promotes transparency and citizen oversight of the legislative process.</description>

      <title>An evacuation simulator for pedestrian dynamics based on the Social Force Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evacuation of pedestrians from enclosed spaces represents a key problem in safety engineering and infrastructure design. Analyzing the collective dynamics that emerge during evacuation processes requires simulation tools capable of capturing individual interactions and spatial constraints realistically.
  In this work, we present \textit{SiCoBioNa}, an open-source evacuation simulator based on the Social Force Model (SFM). The software provides an intuitive graphical interface that allows users to configure pedestrian properties, spatial geometries, and initial conditions without requiring prior expertise in numerical modeling techniques. The SFM framework enables the representation of goal-oriented motion, interpersonal interactions, and interactions with fixed obstacles.
  The simulator generates both quantitative data and visual outputs, facilitating the analysis of evacuation dynamics and the evaluation of different spatial configurations. Due to its modular and extensible design, \textit{SiCoBioNa} serves as a reproducible research tool for studies on pedestrian dynamics providing practical support for evacuation planning.</description>

      <title>Friendship-paradox paradox: Do most people's friends really have more friends than they do?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13957v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.</description>
