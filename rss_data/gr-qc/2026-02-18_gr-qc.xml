      <title>May Negative Mass Objects exist in the sky?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture the possibility of negative mass objects (NMOs) existing in the sky. It is shown that they may not be so exotic as usually expected. We show that NMOs appear as solutions of standard gravitational equations if we consider the system of a compact positive mass object, cosmological fluid and negative cosmological constant. We also construct models which generate such NMOs as solutions within the two-scalar theory and scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity inspired by string theory. The orbits of the photon and massive particles are investigated in the background, where there is a negative mass object which realises a kind of effective anti-gravity. It is explicitly found that the bound system consisting of a positive mass object and a negative mass object can be formed in spite that a positive mass object suffers the repulsive force from the NMO. The possibility that such exotic objects might be observed is discussed. A simple conjecture about their possible masses is made, too. As an even more exotic object, we consider a non-trivial object with vanishing mass and investigate its properties.</description>

      <title>Horizon-Brightened Acceleration Radiation and Optical Signatures of Generic Regular Black Holes from Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) and optical signatures for a broad class of regular black holes sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics. The spacetimes considered are static, spherically symmetric, and nonsingular, and they include Bardeen-like, and Hayward-like regular black-hole limits as spacial cases. We characterize the horizon structure and thermodynamics properties, and we compute key optical observables by determining the photon-sphere location and the corresponding shadow size as seen by distant observers, including controlled perturbative limits and full numerical solutions. Using angular-size constraints for SgrA* and M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope and the GRAVITY collaboration, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to infer the admissible parameter ranges of the model and to quantify degeneracies among the black-hole mass and nonlinear-electrodynimcs parameters. On the quantum side, we develop the near-horizon reduction relevant for HBAR, showing that the dominant sector governing the detector response exhibits conformal behavior and leads to a thermal excitation spectrum governed by the horizon temperature. We formulate a Lindblad master-equation description of the radiation field, identify the thermal steady state, and derive an HBAR entropy-energy relation consistent with a Clausius-type first law. Finally, we establish a Wien-type displacement law for the HBAR spectrum, expressing the peak wavelength in terms of the horizon thermodynamics, thereby providing an additional observable link between nonlinear electrodynamics, regularity, and near-horizon quantum radiation.</description>

      <title>Black-hole thermodynamics in doubly special relativity: local-frame MDRs and rainbow metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) deforms special-relativistic kinematics while preserving the relativity principle by introducing a second invariant scale, typically the Planck energy $E_{\rm Pl}$. Extending DSR-inspired modified dispersion relations (MDRs) to curved spacetimes is challenging, as ambiguous definitions of the deformation energy risk reintroducing preferred frames.
  We review three common extensions beyond flat spacetime: (i) MDRs in local orthonormal frames on fixed backgrounds, (ii) phase-space/Hamiltonian geometry with relative locality, and (iii) rainbow metrics. Using black-hole thermodynamics for static spherically symmetric horizons, we compare two implementations: (A) energy-independent background with local-frame MDR, and (B) energy-dependent rainbow metric.
  When the same prescription is used for the deformation energy scale $E_\star$, both approaches yield identical Hawking temperatures: \begin{equation} T(E_\star)=T_0\,\frac{g(E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})}{f(E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})}\,,\qquad T_0=\frac{\kappa_0}{2\pi}\,, \end{equation} where $\kappa_0$ is the classical surface gravity.
  This $g/f$ scaling holds for examples such as Amelino--Camelia-type MDRs (leading correction $\propto E p^2/E_{\rm Pl}$, giving $T(E_\star)\simeq T_0(1-\frac{\eta}{2}E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})$ for $\eta&gt;0$) and the Magueijo--Smolin invariant ($f=g$, so $T(E_\star)=T_0$).
  Further DSR effects on evaporation (thresholds, phase space, greybody factors, composition laws) are discussed. Discrepancies in the literature arise mainly from different choices of $E_\star$ (energy at infinity vs.\ local frame). For macroscopic black holes, corrections are suppressed by $T_0/E_{\rm Pl}$ and become relevant only near the Planck regime, where full quantum gravity dominates.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the gravitational dust collapse of the LQG-inspired effective asymmetric bounce model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational dust collapse within an effective loop quantum gravity (LQG)-inspired model exhibiting an asymmetric bounce in the marginally bound case. This work extends previous studies, which have predominantly focused on models with either symmetric bounces or asymmetric bounces restricted to homogeneous dust configurations. Our analysis emphasises the phenomenological implications of the model through a combination of analytical and numerical investigations, with particular attention to singularity resolution and the formation of trapped surfaces. As in symmetric bounce models, the central curvature singularity inside the collapsing dust cloud is resolved. However, in contrast to the symmetric case, we find that a singularity emerges in the polymerised vacuum region during the bounce phase. This singularity can be identified as a shell-crossing singularity and exhibits the expected power-law behaviour of curvature scalars. Furthermore, likewise to the symmetric bounce models, we find a critical mass threshold governing the formation of inner and outer horizons in the pre-bounce phase. No analogous critical mass restriction arises for the formation of the inner horizon in the post-bounce phase, highlighting a qualitative difference between the pre- and post-bounce dynamics.</description>

      <title>Particle production, absorption, scattering, and geodesics in a Schwarzschild--Hernquist black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum and classical signatures of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Hernquist dark matter halo. Starting from the exact spherically symmetric solution describing this composite system, we analyze particle production for both bosonic and fermionic fields using semiclassical techniques. Hawking radiation is derived through Bogoliubov transformations and independently via the tunneling method with energy conservation, allowing us to identify the effective temperature, emission spectrum, and the role of dark matter parameters in suppressing particle creation. The evaporation process is examined in the high-frequency regime, leading to modified evaporation times and emission rates relative to the vacuum Schwarzschild case. We further study absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves employing a partial-wave analysis, computing phase shifts, partial and total cross sections, and assessing the impact of the Hernquist scale radius and density on these observables. Finally, null and timelike geodesics are explored to characterize light propagation and particle motion in the presence of the dark matter halo.</description>

      <title>Static black holes in an external uniform electromagnetic field: Reissner-Nordstrom accelerating in Bertotti-Robinson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the non-twisting subcase of the large class of type D black holes with a non-aligned electromagnetic field, presented recently in [H. Ovcharenko and J. Podolsky, Phys. Rev. D 112 (2025) 064076]. We show that such exact solutions split into two main subclasses that (after a suitable re-parametrization) can be interpreted as either the uncharged Schwarzschild or C-metric in the external Bertotti-Robinson (BR) spacetime with geometry ${\mathrm{AdS}_2\times\mathrm{S}_2}$, or as the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the external BR electromagnetic field. The distinction between these two subclasses is determined by the parameter $r_0$ that encodes relations between the external Maxwell field (given by the non-aligned components of the Faraday tensor ${\Phi_0=\Phi_2}$) and the Maxwell field created by the charge of the black hole (given by the aligned component $\Phi_1$). Namely, if ${r_0=0}$ then the electromagnetic field is fully determined by ${\Phi_0=\Phi_2}$, and one gets the C-metric in the BR universe (including also the non-accelerating Schwarzschild-BR black hole). But if ${r_0\neq 0}$ then the electromagnetic field is independently determined by both the external BR field and the field of a black hole itself, and this can be interpreted as the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Even though such an interpretation of the spacetime family is quite simple, it contains a lot of subtleties (e.g. the no-charge limit of the RN-BR spacetime, the non-trivial dependence on the signs of the mass and charge of a black hole, extreme black holes, and others) which we carefully investigate in this work. We also show the explicit relation to solutions previously found by Van den Bergh and Carminati, and we discuss the connection to the Alekseev-Garcia and Alexeev solutions.</description>

      <title>A fresh look at boundary terms in Einstein-Hilbert gravity via an initial value variational principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key tenet of general relativity is the dynamical nature of space-time, ideally represented as an initial value problem. Here we explore the variational formulation of classical Einstein-Hilbert gravity as initial value problem by constructing its Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley (SKG) action, including a careful treatment of boundary terms. The construction is based on a doubling of degrees of freedom and independent of a foliation. The action naturally decomposes into a bulk term furnishing Einstein's equations and a boundary term, which is related to conserved quantities, such as the Komar mass. We find that since only trivial connecting conditions must be specified on boundaries, the variational action principle for gravity as an initial value problem is rendered well-posed without the need to add additional boundary terms. The SKG approach to gravity offers a novel and complementary avenue to solve for the metric of spacetime directly from the action, bypassing the governing equations.</description>

      <title>On the Limitations of Karmarkar's Condition in Static, Conformally Flat Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we investigate the class of exact solutions that arise when two fundamental geometric constraints are imposed simultaneously: the Karmarkar's condition and the vanishing of the Weyl tensor. These conditions restrict the curvature in such a way that the spacetime becomes conformally flat and belongs to the family of embedding class-I solutions. Even though the subsequent solutions namely, the Schwarzschild interior solution and the de Sitter solution are well known, the novelty of our presentation is that these solutions are shown to be a direct consequence of the imposed geometric constraints. The physical matter composition becomes highly constrained by the associated geometry under such conditions. The Schwarzschild interior solution describes the spacetime of an incompressible fluid sphere while the de Sitter solution corresponds to a vacuum energy dominated configuration. Interestingly, pressure anisotropy as well as `complexity factor' vanish identically once the Karmarkar's condition and the conformal flatness conditions are applied simultaneously. As these two geometric constraints alone are sufficient to determine the background spacetime uniquely, Karmarkar's condition might not be a suitable method for the development of realistic stellar models in a conformally flat spacetime unless one invokes other factors into consideration such as time-dependent metric potentials.</description>

      <title>Displacement memory in regular black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Displacement memory, induced by a wave pulse in a regular black hole spacetime, is studied using geodesic (timelike) separation and geodesic deviation. The presence of the wave pulse in such a black hole is modeled via a function $H(u)$ appearing in a restricted version of a generic Bondi-Sachs type line element. Choosing a sech-squared profile for $H(u)$, we first study (numerically) geodesic separation and geodesic deviation in a flat background. Thereafter, similar investigations are carried out in the presence of the black hole, but in regions far away from the vicinity of the horizon. Our results suggest the presence of a distinct displacement memory effect, which depends on the value of the regularisation parameter $g$ as well as the pulse height. Between different types of regular black holes, one notices parameter-dependent changes in the net displacement memory. Further, a clear difference in the magnitude of displacement memory (at large $u$) in regular and singular black holes is also visible in our numerical results.</description>

      <title>Some phenomenological aspects of a quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole: quasi-periodic oscillations, scalar perturbations and thermal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15551v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate several phenomenological aspects of a covariant quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole characterized by the mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, and the quantum correction parameter $\zeta$. We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schr\"{o}dinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $\zeta$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations.</description>

      <title>ModMax-AdS Black Hole with Global Monopole as Source in Kalb-Ramond Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate in detail the thermodynamic properties of a spherically symmetric ModMax-AdS black hole sourced by a global monopole within the Kalb-Ramond gravity. We derive the key thermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity, and analyze how the geometric parameters influence these physical quantities. The first law of thermodynamics and the corresponding Smarr formula are explicitly verified. Furthermore, we study the thermodynamic criticality of the system by deriving the critical points and examining the effects of the space-time geometric parameters. We also obtain the inversion temperature and demonstrate that the minimum inversion temperature is modified by the space-time parameters. In addition, the sparsity of Hawking radiation and thermal fluctuations of the system are investigated, highlighting the effects of the parameters on the entropy corrections. Finally, we analyze the optical properties of the black hole, in particular the photon sphere and shadow radius, showing how these parameters influence these features.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and gravitational waveforms of spinning particles in nonlocal Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics and gravitational-wave signatures of periodic orbits of spinning test particles moving in the equatorial plane around static, spherically symmetric black holes within the framework of Deser-Woodard nonlocal gravity. Based on the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, combined with the Tulczyjew spin supplementary condition, we derive the orbital dynamic equations for spinning particles moving in the equatorial plane and impose a timelike constraint to exclude unphysical superluminal trajectories. By comparing with the classical Schwarzschild black hole, we systematically analyze the effects of the nonlocal gravitational parameters $\zeta$ and $b$ on the effective potential governing the radial motion of particles and the innermost stable circular orbit. In addition, gravitational waveforms exhibit significant phase differences: an increase in $\zeta$ induces a phase delay, whereas an increase in $b$ results in a phase advance. A one-year simulation of the orbital evolution of an extreme mass ratio inspiral demonstrates that when $b=2$ and $\zeta\approx10^{-6}$, the mismatch between the gravitational waveforms predicted for the nonlocal gravity black hole and those for the Schwarzschild black hole reaches the distinguishable threshold ($\mathcal{M}=0.0125$), providing a basis for observational discrimination between general relativity and nonlocal gravity.</description>

      <title>Expansion operators in spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ingoing and outgoing null expansions associated to a spatial 2-sphere are quantized in the spherically symmetric model of loop quantum gravity. It is shown that the resulting expansion operators are self-adjoint in the kinematical Hilbert space with generalized eigenstates. It turns out that the outgoing and ingoing expansion operators share the common continuous part of their spectra but have different additional isolated eigenvalues. These results provide new insights on the avoidance of the singularities in classical general relativity and the establishment of certain notion of quantum horizons.</description>

      <title>Timelike bounce hypersurfaces in charged null dust collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish results on the dynamics of interacting charged null fluids in general relativity, specifically in the context of the bouncing continuation proposed in [Ori91]. In this model - the setting for a number of prominent case studies on black hole formation - charged massless particles may instantaneously change direction (bounce) after losing all their 4-momentum due to electrostatic repulsion. We initiate the study of timelike bounce hypersurfaces in spherical symmetry: scenarios in which an incoming beam of charged null dust changes direction along a timelike surface $\mathcal{B}$, which is the (free) boundary of an interacting 2-dust region. We identify a novel decoupling of the equations of motion in this region. First, it is shown that every timelike curve segment $\gamma$ in the spherically symmetric quotient of Minkowski or Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes arises as the bounce hypersurface $\mathcal{B}$ of a charged null dust beam incident from past null infinity $\mathcal{I}^-$. We construct a spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g_{\mu\nu})$ describing the full trajectory of the beam, which includes gluing to Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Vaidya regions. Across $\mathcal{B}$ the metric has regularity $g_{\mu\nu}\in C^{2,1}$ and satisfies Einstein's equation classically, while $C^\infty$ gluing may be achieved across all other interfaces. We also obtain examples of timelike bounce hypersurfaces terminating in a null point. Since these constructions are teleological, we secondly consider a given charged incoming beam from past null infinity. We formulate and solve a free boundary problem which represents the formation of a timelike bounce hypersurface. The result is conditional, applying only in the exterior region of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, and subject to a technical regularity condition.</description>

      <title>Exploring Chaotic Motion of a Particle in the Centre of a Galaxy with a Prolate Halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of galaxies are known to have supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at their core, which have a tremendous gravitational pull on the objects around them. When embedded within extended matter distributions such as prolate, shell-like halos, they give rise to complex gravitational fields that often drive nearby particles into chaotic orbits. The inherently nonlinear nature of such motion, shaped by general relativity, makes direct analysis highly challenging. To overcome this, pseudo-Newtonian potentials are used to approximate relativistic effects within a Newtonian framework. In this study, we model the central SMBH using the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov (1996) potential to mimic the rotational effects of a Kerr-like black hole. The surrounding prolate halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution, represented through a multipole expansion including dipole and quadrupole components. Poincare sections and the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE) reveal how the SMBH-halo system drives both order and chaos, with the SMBH spin modulating the dynamics by enhancing or suppressing chaos depending on its direction and magnitude.</description>

      <title>Spinning compact object and chaos in galactic centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic centres are highly dynamic regions dominated by a supermassive black hole (BH) surrounded by nuclear star clusters (NSC), molecular gas, and asymmetric matter distributions such as disks or halos. The combined gravitational effects of these components, along with relativistic corrections from the BH's spin, generate strongly nonlinear dynamics and frequent chaotic orbital behaviour. To model this environment, we employ a multipolar expansion potential in which the central compact object is represented by the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov pseudo-Newtonian potential, effectively capturing spin-dependent features of a Kerr-like BH. The surrounding halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution expanded up to third order in multipolar terms to account for realistic asymmetry. Previous studies have mainly explored the influence of multipolar moments and BH spin using Poincare sections, SALI, and related chaos indicators. In this work, we extend these analyses by incorporating stability analysis and basins of convergence to achieve a more complete understanding of the system's dynamics. Stability analysis around equilibrium points provides insight into local behavior, while basins of convergence highlight sensitivity to initial conditions and expose fractal basin boundaries. Our results show that the BH spin significantly reshapes phase space: depending on its magnitude and orientation, it can either amplify chaotic scattering caused by halo asymmetry or stabilize specific orbital families. These findings enhance our understanding of how relativistic spin effects and multipolar mass distributions jointly govern the dynamical architecture of galactic centers.</description>

      <title>GW-FALCON: A Novel Feature-Driven Deep Learning Approach for Early Warning Alerts of BNS and NSBH Inspirals in Next-Generation GW Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation GW observatories such as the ET and CE will detect BNS and NSBH inspirals with high SNRs and long in-band durations, making systematic early-warning alerts both feasible and scientifically valuable. Such triggers are essential for coordinating rapid electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we introduce GW-FALCON, a novel feature-driven DL framework for early-time detection between GW signal+noise and noise-only data in next-generation detectors. Instead of feeding raw time series to CNN or more complex neural network architectures, we first extract a large set of statistical, temporal, and spectral quantities from short observational time windows using the TSFEL library. The resulting fixed-length feature vectors are then used as input to feed-forward ANNs suitable for low-latency operation. We demonstrate the method using simulated BNS and NSBH inspiral waveforms injected into colored Gaussian noise generated from the ET and CE design PSDs. We train separate ANNs on feature sets extracted from partial-inspiral windows characterized by different maximum instantaneous frequencies, enabling early-warning triggers from tens to hundreds of seconds before merger. Across all detector configurations and datasets, the resulting classifiers achieve high accuracy and detection efficiency, with ET-like networks typically reaching test accuracies of order 90% and CE-like ones exceeding 97% at low false-alarm probability. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first comprehensive feature-based DL detection framework for Next-generation GW observatories, connecting feature extraction from strain time series data to robust signal-noise classification within a setup that can be extended to real data and to more advanced neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Measuring Pulsar Distances from Chirping Orbital Periods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed orbital period time derivative (or orbital "chirp") of a millisecond binary pulsar (MSP) encodes information about both the intrinsic properties of the binary system and its environment. Orbital chirp has contributions from intrinsic energy loss due to gravitational wave emission, kinematic effects due to motion in the plane of the sky, and dynamical effects due to galactic acceleration, with the latter two contributions depending on the MSP distance. We use orbital chirp data to infer distances to 21 MSPs; and for four of which we obtain smaller uncertainties than those reported in previous distance measurements. We incorporate multiple realistic galactic acceleration models to assess the sensitivity of the inferred distances to the choice of galactic gravitational potential, finding a significant dependence for four MSPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review three well known inconsistencies in the standard mathematical formulation of semiclassical gravity: the factorization problem, the information problem, and the closed universe problem. Building upon recent work, we explore how modifying the holographic dictionary may provide the necessary freedom to resolve these three problems in a unified manner while maintaining more well established aspects of the standard correspondence. Using the modified holographic dictionary as a scaffolding, we propose a program for constructing an `extended' semiclassical gravitational path integral which (i) is manifestly factorizing, (ii) computes a von Neumann entropy which satisfies the Page curve, and (iii) incorporates new operators that create closed baby universe states. Our construction may be interpreted as imposing a semiclassical version of background independence/a no global symmetry condition, defining a modified large N limit, preparing an ensemble of dual theories, or enforcing observer rules using gravitational degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: Or should we talk about dS/CFT correspondence or dS/SFT correspondence in cosmological correlators? In non-unitary field theories -- which are conjectured to be dual to cosmological correlators -- scale invariance does not necessarily imply full conformal invariance. While general relativity predicts the emergence of conformal invariance (or boost symmetry in the bulk), various modified theories of gravity suggest only scale invariance, characterized by the absence of bulk boost symmetry. We demonstrate this distinction using Einstein-Aether theory as a canonical example.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Schwinger effect from Hawking radiation in Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m black holes via entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A charged black hole can emit charged particles via two independent mechanisms: the Hawking radiation and the Schwinger effect, which are intertwined in the radiation spectrum. In this paper, we will show that the two effects can be distinguished by analyzing the entanglement entropy carried by the produced particle pairs. Explicitly, we apply the island formula to the near extremal Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m (RN) black hole to calculate the total entanglement entropy of the radiation. Meanwhile we use the heat kernel method to calculate the entanglement entropy of charged particle pairs produced solely from the Schwinger effect. By comparing with the total entanglement entropy, we obtain the entanglement entropy produced purely from the Hawking radiation. Consequently, the two effects are distinguishable in near extremal RN black holes after the Page time. Furthermore, we also employ the brick wall model and the Pauli-Villars regularization to derive the entanglement entropy from the Schwinger effect, which gives a slightly different result with that obtained from the heat kernel method.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole evaporation in a thermal bath and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early Universe evaporate via Hawking radiation and constitute a generic source of stochastic gravitational waves. Existing studies of gravitational wave production from evaporating PBHs typically assume vacuum evaporation, neglecting the fact that PBHs in the early Universe are embedded in a hot thermal plasma. In this work, we investigate gravitational wave production from primordial black holes whose evaporation is thermally influenced by their surrounding environment. We adopt a thermal evaporation framework in which interactions with the ambient plasma modify the effective decay rate of the black hole, leading to enhanced mass loss at early times and a redistribution of the evaporation history compared to the standard non-thermal vacuum case. Since graviton emission is intrinsically tied to the evaporation history of PBHs, these thermal effects play a crucial role in determining the timing and spectral properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background. Our results provide a consistent framework for incorporating thermal effects into gravitational wave production from evaporating primordial black holes and set the stage for a detailed analysis of their observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Averaging in Nonminimally Coupled Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge, commonly referred to as the cosmological averaging problem, of relating the large-scale evolution of an inhomogeneous Universe to that predicted by a homogeneous matter distribution in theories of gravity with nonminimal matter-gravity couplings. To this end, we focus on the class of $f(R,T)$ models defined by $f(R,T)=R+F(T)$, which provide a simple yet theoretically consistent realization of nonminimal matter-gravity interactions and can be reformulated as general relativity minimally coupled to a modified matter Lagrangian. Using nonstandard global monopole solutions as a toy model for realistic particles, we show that the spatial average of $F$ typically differs significantly from $F$ evaluated at the spatially averaged trace of $T$, implying that homogeneous cosmological models generally fail to capture the correct large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We further show that dust in these theories generally exhibits a non-vanishing proper pressure. Our results underscore the necessity of properly accounting for spatial averaging when modeling cosmology in theories with nonminimal matter-gravity couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hybrid three-form model of dark energy is developed in order to identify scaling solutions, a long-sought feature in three-form cosmology. Exploiting Hodge dualities, the theory is formulated in terms of two scalar functions that are associated with the conjugate momentum, and the three-form dual vector in an isotropic background. The resulting Lagrangian yields a stable scaling attractor where the three-form energy density tracks the dominant background fluid. A dynamical mechanism is also identified that naturally drives the system out of this regime toward a late-time accelerated phase distinguishable from a cosmological constant. This constitutes the first realization of scaling behavior within a three-form dark energy framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe can imprint potentially observable signatures on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this study, we investigate how deviations from the standard nearly-scale-free primordial power spectrum impact observables for the fully compact, orientable Euclidean topologies ($E_1$--$E_6$). We examine how such deviations modify the detectability of the underlying topology, depending on whether they are an intrinsic consequence of non-trivial topology or independent of it. We compute CMB temperature correlation matrices across a range of topologies, fundamental domain sizes, and observer locations for both standard and modified primordial power spectra. The impact of these modifications on the detectability of topology is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing an estimate of the distinguishability of non-trivial and simply-connected topologies based solely on CMB temperature observations. In addition, we employ the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify harmonic-space realizations of CMB temperature maps and thereby assess the observational prospects for topology detection. Signatures of non-trivial topology are encoded in the off-diagonal structure of the CMB temperature correlation matrices and are most prominent on the largest angular scales. Deviations from the simple power-law primordial spectrum at these scales can substantially alter the detectability of topology, either enhancing its characteristic CMB imprints or suppressing them below observational sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the primordial power spectrum must be carefully accounted for in robust searches for cosmic topology using the CMB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an inverse resonance problem for the scalar wave equation on the Kerr-de Sitter family. In a compact subextremal slow-rotation regime and at a fixed overtone index, high-frequency quasinormal modes admit semiclassical quantization and a real-analytic labeling by angular momentum indices. Using this structure, we first prove that a finite equatorial high-frequency package of quasinormal-mode frequencies determines the mass and rotation parameter $(M,a)$ (for fixed cosmological constant $\Lambda&gt;0$), with a quantitative stability estimate. As a key geometric input we compute explicit second-order (in $a$) corrections to the equatorial photon-orbit invariants which control the leading real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes. Finally, allowing $\Lambda$ to vary in a compact interval, we show that adding one damping observable (the scaled imaginary part of a single equatorial mode) yields a three-parameter inverse theorem: a finite package of three independent real observables determines $(M,a,\Lambda)$ locally in the slow-rotation regime away from $a=0$.</description>

      <title>Radial oscillations of pulsating neutron stars: The UCIa equation-of-state case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radial oscillations provide a clean dynamical test of the high-density stiffness of neutron-star equations of state. We study spherically symmetric pulsations of nonrotating relativistic stars built from cold, charge-neutral, $\beta$-equilibrated pure nucleonic matter described within relativistic mean-field theory. As a baseline we adopt the UCIa parameter set [Astron. Astro-phys. 689, A242 (2024)], and we implement high-density stiffening via the $\sigma$-cut scheme by adding a regulator potential $U_{\rm cut}(\sigma)$ [Phys. Rev. C 92, no.5, 052801 (2015), Phys. Rev. C 106, no.5, 055806 (2022)]. For representative choices $f_s=0$ (no cutoff) and $f_s=0.58$ (stiffened), we solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and tidal perturbation equations to obtain equilibrium sequences, mass-radius relations, and tidal deformabilities. We then derive and solve the linear general-relativistic radial pulsation equations to compute the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the fundamental and overtone modes. The $\sigma$-cutoff suppresses the growth of the scalar field at supranuclear density, increases the pressure, and shifts the maximum mass, radii, and $\Lambda_{1.4}$ accordingly, while systematically raising the radial-mode frequencies at fixed mass. Using the sign change of $\omega_0^2$ as a stability criterion, we identify stiffened models that remain radially stable up to the observed $\sim 2M_\odot$ mass scale and are consistent with current multimessenger constraints, demonstrating how radial spectra complement static EoS tests.</description>

      <title>Hubble-Scale Tachyonic Shocks from Low-Scale Inflation -- A New Gravitational-Wave Window on Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio imply that the energy scale of inflation may lie below the grand-unified scale. In this paper, we show that in a broad class of single-field inflation models with sufficiently small energy scales, an extremely efficient tachyonic instability develops at the end of inflation. This instability rapidly drives the system into a nonlinear regime before coherent oscillations can be established, leading to a first-order phase-transition--like phenomenon without tunneling or barrier crossing. The resulting ultra-relativistic shock fronts surrounding the bubble interiors expand to near the Hubble scale, corresponding to the most strongly enhanced tachyonic modes, and collide with one another, producing energetic inflaton particles and gravitational waves. As a result, the post-inflationary dynamics can differ significantly from the conventional high-scale inflationary scenario. Interestingly, inflation at MeV--EeV energy scales can be probed via gravitational-wave observations, including pulsar timing arrays, ground-based detectors, and future space-based experiments. Recent limits from the LIGO--KAGRA--Virgo collaboration already constrain EeV-scale inflation, while pulsar timing array results may be interpreted as evidence for gravitational waves generated by GeV-scale inflation. We also briefly discuss further implications of the resulting tachyonic shocks.</description>

      <title>Physical properties and the maximum compactness bound of a class of compact stars in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: Motivated by the growing interest in understanding the role of non-metricity in describing dense stellar systems, in this paper, we study compact stellar configurations within the framework of linear $f(Q)$ gravity.
  Methodology: By adopting a linear modification of the form $f(Q) = \alpha Q+\beta$, we analyze the internal structure and physical properties of an anisotropic relativistic star within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity. We employ the Karmarkar's condition together with the Vaidya-Tikekar metric ansatz to obtain a closed-form interior solution of the star. The interior solution is then matched to the Schwarzschild exterior solution across the boundary of the star. By varying the model parameters, we analyze physical features of the resultant stellar configuration.
  Results: We note distinctive features in the density, pressure, anisotropy and total mass of the star under a such modification. By enforcing the condition that the central pressure remains finite, we obtain the maximum compactness bound which is shown to depend solely on the Vaidya-Tikekar curvature parameter $K$. We recover the Buchdahl bound for the curvature parameter $K=0$, which corresponds to the solution for an isotropic and homogeneous fluid sphere. Utilizing the energy density and radial pressure profiles, we numerically integrate the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and obtain the mass-radius ($M-R$) relationships for different values of the model parameter $\alpha$. We note that for higher values of $\alpha$, the maximum mass and radius decrease, shifting the stable branch towards ultra-compact configurations. An interesting observation in our analysis is that a linearly modified $f(Q)$ gravity model can support comparatively low mass stars. Utilizing the observed mass of some known pulsars, we demonstrate how our model can be used to fine-tune the radius of the star.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: A perspective from local geometrical invariants and matter distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02320v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, the deflection angle of photons in the strong deflection limit exhibits a logarithmic divergence. We introduce an analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence by employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the properties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations -- where the divergence rate $\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent metric functions -- our approach relates $\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By applying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \begin{align*} \bar{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-8\pi R_{\mathrm{m}}^2\left(\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}}, \end{align*} where $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy density and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius $R_{\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed by the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\bar{a}=1$ emerging when $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the long-standing puzzle of obtaining $\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the influence of the quantum correction parameter $\xi$ on the motion of particles and the properties of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) around a quantum-corrected black hole (QCBH). We first analyze the geodesics of a test particle and derive weak-field constraints on parameter $\xi$ from the perihelion precession of orbits, using observations from the Solar System and the S2 star's orbit around $\text{SgrA}^\star$ supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy. We obtain $\xi \leq 0.01869$ and $\xi \leq 0.73528$ using the analysis of Solar System observations and the orbit of the S2 star around $\text{SgrA}^\star$, respectively. In the strong-field regime, we examine the dynamics of epicyclic motion around astrophysical black holes and, using observational data from four QPO sources and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we determine the upper constraint $\xi \leq 2.086$. Our results provide new insights into the effects of quantum corrections on black hole spacetimes and highlight the potential of QPOs as a probe for testing quantum gravity in astrophysical environments.</description>

Abstract: We reinvestigate the stability properties of ultracompact spinning boson stars with a stable light ring using fully nonlinear 3+1 and 2+1 numerical relativity simulations and two different formulations of the Einstein equations. We find no evidence of an instability on timescales of $t \mu \sim 10^4$ (in units of the scalar mass), when allowing the star to be perturbed either solely by discretization error or by imposing various types of perturbations to our initial data. We find that the initially imposed perturbations exhibit slow decay, even for magnitudes just below the order where immediate collapse is induced.</description>

      <title>Multibanded Reduced Order Quadrature Techniques for Gravitational Wave Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced-order quadrature (ROQ) is commonly used to accelerate parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy; however, constructing ROQ bases can be computationally costly, particularly for longer-duration signals. We propose a modified construction strategy based on PyROQ that accelerates this process by performing the basis search using multiband waveforms, without compromising the desired likelihood accuracy. We use this altered method to construct a set of ROQs in the sub-solar mass (SSM) range using the IMRPhenomXAS_NRTidalV3 waveform. Compared to PyROQ's standard ROQ method, we find a decrease in basis size of 20% to 30% and observe a decrease in basis construction time by 5 to 20 times, reducing from two weeks to a couple of days. We verify the bases built with this method by injecting simulated gravitational waves into LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA design noise and recovering the parameters, and we find that they preserve the likelihood accuracy and maintain consistent parameter estimation results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrometric measurements provide a unique avenue for constraining the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we investigate the application of two neural network architectures, a fully connected network and a graph neural network, for analyzing astrometric data to detect the SGWB. Specifically, we generate mock Gaia astrometric measurements of the proper motions of sources and train two networks to predict the energy density of the SGWB, $\Omega_\text{GW}$. We evaluate the performance of both models under varying input datasets to assess their robustness across different configurations. We also perform a direct comparison with a likelihood-based approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, finding out that the neural-network-based approach is significantly faster, taking on the order of minutes, compared to MCMC's order of days, while still capturing the same features in the data. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively constrain the SGWB, showing promise as tools for addressing systematic uncertainties and modeling limitations that pose challenges for traditional likelihood-based methods.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic strings for pedestrians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings represent an attractive source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. However, numerical computation of the GW signal from cosmic strings requires the evaluation of complicated integral and sum expressions, which can become computationally costly in large parameter scans. This motivates us to rederive the GW signal from a network of local stable cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto approximation and based on the velocity-dependent one-scale model from a ``pedestrian'' perspective. That is, we derive purely analytical expressions for the total GW spectrum, which remain exact wherever possible and whose error can be tracked and reduced in a controlled way in crucial situations in which we are forced to introduce approximations. In this way, we obtain powerful formulas that, unlike existing results in the literature, are valid across the entire frequency spectrum and across the entire conceivable range of cosmic-string tensions. We provide an in-depth discussion of the GW spectra thus obtained, including their characteristic break frequencies and approximate power-law behaviors, comment on the effect of changes in the effective number of degrees of freedom during radiation domination, and conclude with a concise summary of our main formulas that can readily be used in future studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the implications of finite-temperature quantum field theory effects on cosmological parameters within the framework of the $\L$CDM model and its modification. By incorporating temperature-dependent corrections to the cosmological constant, we extend the standard cosmological model to include additional density parameters, $\Omega_{\L_2}$ and $\Omega_{\L_3}$, which arise from finite-T quantum gravitational effects. Using the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS), we analyze the impact of these corrections on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum and compare the results with the Planck 2018 data. Through brute-force parameter scans and advanced machine learning techniques, including quartic regression, we demonstrate that the inclusion of $\Omega_{\L_2}$ and $\Omega_{\L_3}$ improves the model's predictive accuracy, achieving higher $R^2$ values, lower mean squared error, and lower AIC/BIC scores than those of the $\L$CDM model. Despite identified methodological limitations, these findings establish an exploratory framework for incorporating finite-temperature quantum corrections into precision cosmology and open new avenues for data-driven parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Equation of the Large U(1) Chiral Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we first heuristically construct the charges corresponding to the chiral transformation associated with the large U(1) gauge symmetry. We refer to these as the large chiral charges, and to the chiral transformation they generate as the large chiral transformations. Then, showing that these large chiral charges can be obtained based on Noether's theorem, we obtain the anomaly equation associated with these large chiral transformations. Subsequently, considering the one-loop diagrams of the fermionic field coupled to multiple classical gauge fields (which constitute the effective action of the model in this study with regard to the gauge field), we perform an axialization. Then, defining the BRS transformations for the large U(1) gauge symmetry (we refer to these as the large BRS transformations), we perform these transformations to these axialized one-loop diagrams, and demonstrate that the anomaly equations mentioned above can be derived by evaluating these diagrams. We further confirm that these anomaly equations can be derived using the Fujikawa method. Finally, we discuss the breaking of unitarity and the low-energy effective model associated with the large chiral anomaly in this study, and comment on potential future developments arising from them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14003v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine four dimensional, near-extremal black hole solutions in the presence of a finite boundary obeying conformal boundary conditions, where the conformal class of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature are fixed. Working in Euclidean signature and at fixed charge, we find the near-extremal regime is dominated by a double-scaling limit which reveals new scaling laws for the quasi-local conformal entropy at low temperatures. Upon spherical dimensional reduction, we obtain the effective two-dimensional dilaton-gravity theory that describes the near-extremal regime. In contrast to Dirichlet boundaries, for conformal boundaries a linear dilaton potential is not sufficient to capture the leading correction away from extremality and higher orders are needed. We also examine near-Nariai solutions and the spherical reduction of pure three-dimensional gravity in (Anti-) de Sitter space. In the latter, provided the boundary is placed near the conformal boundary of three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space, the dynamics of the spherically symmetric boundary mode is governed by a Liouville equation that descends from a (minus) Schwarzian effective action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of finite-temperature quantum gravity effects on cosmological parameters, particularly the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, by incorporating temperature-dependent quantum corrections into the Hubble parameter. For that purpose, we modify the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System. We introduce new density parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$, arising from finite-temperature quantum gravity contributions, and analyze their influence on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum using advanced machine learning techniques, including artificial neural networks and stochastic optimization. Our results reveal that $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ assumes a negative value, consistent with dimensional regularization in renormalization and that the presence of $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ as well as $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ enhances model accuracy. Numerical analyses demonstrate that the inclusion of these parameters improves the fit to 2018 Planck data. Although further work is required, our results suggest that finite-temperature quantum gravity effects may play a non-negligible role in cosmological evolution. Although the Hubble tension persists, our findings highlight the potential of quantum gravitational corrections in refining cosmological models and motivate further investigation into higher-order thermal effects and polarization data constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate some very special features of the Dirac-Born-Infeld--like (DBI) gravitational counter-term in AdS$_4$ spacetime, in the context of holography with a sharp radial cut-off. We show that the three-sphere partition function is not only independent of a constant radial cut-off, but also remains unchanged under deformations of the cut-off surface. We also consider the renormalized holographic entanglement entropy for an equatorial Ryu-Takayanagi surface with a cut-off with an arbitrary shape and show that it can also be independent of the cut-off under a special condition. We also numerically study the behavior of the renormalized entropy with different counter-terms and relate the results to monotonicity properties under holographic renormalization group flow. The DBI counter-term is always seen to be associated with integrating out fewer degrees of freedom compared to other counter-terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dissipative properties of relativistic strongly interacting nuclear matter significantly influence the damping of stellar oscillations and density fluctuations during compact star mergers. In this work, we derive the evolution equation for the bulk viscous pressure in unpaired quark matter under small deviations from equilibrium. Our analysis reveals that it behaves like a two-component Burgers fluid. We identify four key transport coefficients -- two relaxation times and two bulk viscosity coefficients -- expressed in terms of equilibrium parameters and electroweak nonleptonic and semi-leptonic decay rates. The transport coefficients are evaluated for two distinct equations of state: one based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics and the other on a modified MIT bag model, valid in different density regimes. We also determine the temperature and density region where nonleptonic electroweak processes dominate the dissipation. Our formulation establishes a new way of describing bulk viscous effects in quark matter, applicable for numerical simulations of compact star mergers.</description>

Abstract: The dark matter may consist of multiple species that interact differently. We show that a species that is cosmologically subdominant but highly collisional can pile up and become dominant in deep gravitational wells, such as those of white dwarfs and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Thermal description of braneworld effective theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-energy effective theories provide the natural description of four-dimensional physics in higher-dimensional geometries, where the imprint of the bulk appears as parameters of the lower dimensional theory. Motivated by the recent progress in the first-order thermodynamic formulation of modified gravity theories, we investigate the thermodynamics of effective theories in braneworld scenarios and thereby the attractor mechanism towards general relativity in such theories. We consider the two-brane Randall-Sundrum model where the low-energy theory on either brane is of scalar-tensor nature with the extra-dimensional radion playing the role of the scalar. We study the thermodynamic implications of a non-vanishing gravitational contribution to the radion potential, and further explore the dynamics in the presence of a bulk stabilizing field.</description>

      <title>Trombone gaugings of five-dimensional maximal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The maximal gauged supergravities in five spacetime dimensions with gauge groups contained in $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are described. The $\textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ factor is the duality group of ungauged maximal supergravity and $\mathbb{R}^+$ is the scaling symmetry of the five-dimensional metric, usually called the \textit{trombone} symmetry. The equations of motion and supersymmetry variations for these supergravities are given to lowest order in fermions, and the mass matrices are provided. Then, the theories with gauge groups contained in a maximal subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are classified, and a new family of such supergravities uncovered. For a concrete theory in this class, some supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua are found and their mass spectra computed within the gauged supergravity. These vacua are argued to be related to superconformal phases of the M5-brane field theory.</description>

      <title>Dark-to-black super accretion as a mechanism for early supermassive black hole growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of supermassive black holes with masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$ challenges conventional formation scenarios based on baryonic accretion and mergers within the first few hundred million years. We propose an alternative channel in which ultralight scalar dark matter undergoes dark-to-black conversion via quasi-bound state depletion around black hole seeds. We estimate the accretion rate of the scalar field as a function of the boson mass parameter $\mu$ and the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$, and integrate this rate over cosmological timescales. Our results show that once a critical value of $\mu M_{\rm BH}$ is reached, scalar field accretion becomes highly efficient, enabling substantial black hole growth even from relatively small initial seed masses. For boson masses $\mu \sim 10^{-19}-10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$, black hole seeds of $10^2-10^5 M_\odot$ can reach $10^6-10^8 M_\odot$ within $\sim 10^8$ yr. This dark-to-black mechanism provides a natural pathway for the rapid formation of massive black holes in the early universe, offering a potential probe of the microphysical nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Conformal Boundary Conditions and Higher Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of boundaries subject to conformal boundary conditions, in which the conformal class of the boundary metric is kept fixed. In Einstein gravity, the trace of the extrinsic curvature is also fixed at the boundary. Here we generalize this boundary condition with the appropriate higher curvature correction. We study the problem both in Euclidean and Lorentzian signature. In Euclidean signature, we show that, similarly to the Einstein gravity case, the entropy at large temperatures exhibits the behavior of a conformal field theory in one lower dimension. We also show that in the flat space limit, the higher curvature corrections do not contribute to the leading behavior at high temperatures. We conjecture that this result is a universal feature of the flat space limit in the presence of conformal boundaries. We test our conjecture by analyzing charged black holes. In Lorentzian signature, we analyze the dynamics of the boundary Weyl factor in black hole backgrounds at the linearized level.</description>
