      <title>Worst- and Average-Case Robustness of Stable Matchings: (Counting) Complexity and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focusing on the bipartite Stable Marriage problem, we investigate different robustness measures related to stable matchings. We analyze the computational complexity of computing them and analyze their behavior in extensive experiments on synthetic instances. For instance, we examine whether a stable matching is guaranteed to remain stable if a given number of adversarial swaps in the agent's preferences are performed and the probability of stability when applying swaps uniformly at random. Our results reveal that stable matchings in our synthetic data are highly unrobust to adversarial swaps, whereas the average-case view presents a more nuanced and informative picture.</description>

      <title>Joint-perturbation simultaneous pseudo-gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing an approximate Nash equilibrium of a game whose strategy space is continuous without access to gradients of the utility function. Such games arise, for example, when players' strategies are represented by the parameters of a neural network. Lack of access to gradients is common in reinforcement learning settings, where the environment is treated as a black box, as well as equilibrium finding in mechanisms such as auctions, where the mechanism's payoffs are discontinuous in the players' actions. To tackle this problem, we turn to zeroth-order optimization techniques that combine pseudo-gradients with equilibrium-finding dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a new technique that requires a number of utility function evaluations per iteration that is constant rather than linear in the number of players. It achieves this by performing a single joint perturbation on all players' strategies, rather than perturbing each one individually. This yields a dramatic improvement for many-player games, especially when the utility function is expensive to compute in terms of wall time, memory, money, or other resources. We evaluate our approach on various games, including auctions, which have important real-world applications. Our approach yields a significant reduction in the run time required to reach an approximate Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Joint Auction in the Online Advertising Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online advertising is a primary source of income for e-commerce platforms. In the current advertising pattern, the oriented targets are the online store owners who are willing to pay extra fees to enhance the position of their stores. On the other hand, brand suppliers are also desirable to advertise their products in stores to boost brand sales. However, the currently used advertising mode cannot satisfy the demand of both stores and brand suppliers simultaneously. To address this, we innovatively propose a joint advertising model termed Joint Auction, allowing brand suppliers and stores to collaboratively bid for advertising slots, catering to both their needs. However, conventional advertising auction mechanisms are not suitable for this novel scenario. In this paper, we propose JRegNet, a neural network architecture for the optimal joint auction design, to generate mechanisms that can achieve the optimal revenue and guarantee near dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual rationality. Finally, multiple experiments are conducted on synthetic and real data to demonstrate that our proposed joint auction significantly improves platform revenue compared to the known baselines.</description>

      <title>Control by Adding Players to Change or Maintain the Shapley-Shubik or the Penrose-Banzhaf Power Index in Weighted Voting Games Is Complete for NP^PP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted voting games are a well-known and useful class of succinctly representable simple games that have many real-world applications, e.g., to model collective decision-making in legislative bodies or shareholder voting. Among the structural control types being analyzing, one is control by adding players to weighted voting games, so as to either change or to maintain a player's power in the sense of the (probabilistic) Penrose-Banzhaf power index or the Shapley-Shubik power index. For the problems related to this control, the best known lower bound is PP-hardness, where PP is "probabilistic polynomial time," and the best known upper bound is the class NP^PP, i.e., the class NP with a PP oracle. We optimally raise this lower bound by showing NP^PP-hardness of all these problems for the Penrose-Banzhaf and the Shapley-Shubik indices, thus establishing completeness for them in that class. Our proof technique may turn out to be useful for solving other open problems related to weighted voting games with such a complexity gap as well.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Mechanisms for Resource Allocation Without Monetary Transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem in which a central planner sequentially allocates a single resource to multiple strategic agents using their utility reports at each round, but without using any monetary transfers. We consider general agent utility distributions and two standard settings: a finite horizon $T$ and an infinite horizon with $\gamma$ discounts. We provide general tools to characterize the convergence rate between the optimal mechanism for the central planner and the first-best allocation if true agent utilities were available. This heavily depends on the utility distributions, yielding rates anywhere between $1/\sqrt T$ and $1/T$ for the finite-horizon setting, and rates faster than $\sqrt{1-\gamma}$, including exponential rates for the infinite-horizon setting as agents are more patient $\gamma\to 1$. On the algorithmic side, we design mechanisms based on the promised-utility framework to achieve these rates and leverage structure on the utility distributions. Intuitively, the more flexibility the central planner has to reward or penalize any agent while incurring little social welfare cost, the faster the convergence rate. In particular, discrete utility distributions typically yield the slower rates $1/\sqrt T$ and $\sqrt{1-\gamma}$, while smooth distributions with density typically yield faster rates $1/T$ (up to logarithmic factors) and $1-\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Reward Machines for Multi-Agent Equilibrium Design (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanism design is a well-established game-theoretic paradigm for designing games to achieve desired outcomes. This paper addresses a closely related but distinct concept, equilibrium design. Unlike mechanism design, the designer's authority in equilibrium design is more constrained; she can only modify the incentive structures in a given game to achieve certain outcomes without the ability to create the game from scratch. We study the problem of equilibrium design using dynamic incentive structures, known as reward machines. We use weighted concurrent game structures for the game model, with goals (for the players and the designer) defined as mean-payoff objectives. We show how reward machines can be used to represent dynamic incentives that allocate rewards in a manner that optimises the designer's goal. We also introduce the main decision problem within our framework, the payoff improvement problem. This problem essentially asks whether there exists a dynamic incentive (represented by some reward machine) that can improve the designer's payoff by more than a given threshold value. We present two variants of the problem: strong and weak. We demonstrate that both can be solved in polynomial time using a Turing machine equipped with an NP oracle. Furthermore, we also establish that these variants are either NP-hard or coNP-hard. Finally, we show how to synthesise the corresponding reward machine if it exists.</description>

      <title>Auctioning Escape Permits for Multiple Correlated Pollutants Using CMRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of increasingly complex environmental challenges, effective pollution control mechanisms are crucial. By extending the state of the art auction mechanisms, we aim to develop an efficient approach for allocating pollution abatement resources in a multi-pollutant setting with pollutants affecting each other's reduction costs. We modify the Combinatorial Multi-Round Ascending Auction for the auction of escape permits of pollutants with co-dependent reduction processes, specifically, greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient runoff in Finnish agriculture. We show the significant advantages of this mechanism in pollution control through experiments on the bid prices and amount of escape permits sold in multiple auction simulations.</description>

      <title>No Screening is More Efficient with Multiple Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study efficient mechanism design for allocating multiple heterogeneous objects. We aim to maximize the residual surplus, the total value generated from an allocation minus the costs for screening agents' values. We discover a robust trend indicating that no-screening mechanisms such as serial dictatorship with exogenous priority order tend to perform better as the variety of goods increases. We analyze the underlying reasons by characterizing efficient mechanisms in a stylized environment. We also apply an automated mechanism design approach to numerically derive efficient mechanisms and validate the trend in general environments. Building on this implication, we propose the register-invite-book system (RIB) as an efficient system for scheduling vaccination against pandemic diseases.</description>

      <title>Conjectural Online Learning with First-order Beliefs in Asymmetric Information Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18781v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymmetric information stochastic games (AISGs) arise in many complex socio-technical systems, such as cyber-physical systems and IT infrastructures. Existing computational methods for AISGs are primarily offline and can not adapt to equilibrium deviations. Further, current methods are limited to particular information structures to avoid belief hierarchies. Considering these limitations, we propose conjectural online learning (COL), an online learning method under generic information structures in AISGs. COL uses a forecaster-actor-critic (FAC) architecture, where subjective forecasts are used to conjecture the opponents' strategies within a lookahead horizon, and Bayesian learning is used to calibrate the conjectures. To adapt strategies to nonstationary environments based on information feedback, COL uses online rollout with cost function approximation (actor-critic). We prove that the conjectures produced by COL are asymptotically consistent with the information feedback in the sense of a relaxed Bayesian consistency. We also prove that the empirical strategy profile induced by COL converges to the Berk-Nash equilibrium, a solution concept characterizing rationality under subjectivity. Experimental results from an intrusion response use case demonstrate COL's {faster convergence} over state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods against nonstationary attacks.</description>

      <title>Honor Among Bandits: No-Regret Learning for Online Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online fair division of indivisible goods to players when there are a finite number of types of goods and player values are drawn from distributions with unknown means. Our goal is to maximize social welfare subject to allocating the goods fairly in expectation. When a player's value for an item is unknown at the time of allocation, we show that this problem reduces to a variant of (stochastic) multi-armed bandits, where there exists an arm for each player's value for each type of good. At each time step, we choose a distribution over arms which determines how the next item is allocated. We consider two sets of fairness constraints for this problem: envy-freeness in expectation and proportionality in expectation. Our main result is the design of an explore-then-commit algorithm that achieves $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret while maintaining either fairness constraint. This result relies on unique properties fundamental to fair-division constraints that allow faster rates of learning, despite the restricted action space. We also prove a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(T^{2/3})$ regret for our setting, showing that our results are tight.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic Game and Foundation Models for Cyber Deception Operations in Strategic Cyber Warfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are currently facing unprecedented cyber warfare with the rapid evolution of tactics, increasing asymmetry of intelligence, and the growing accessibility of hacking tools. In this landscape, cyber deception emerges as a critical component of our defense strategy against increasingly sophisticated attacks. This chapter aims to highlight the pivotal role of game-theoretic models and foundation models (FMs) in analyzing, designing, and implementing cyber deception tactics. Game models (GMs) serve as a foundational framework for modeling diverse adversarial interactions, allowing us to encapsulate both adversarial knowledge and domain-specific insights. Meanwhile, FMs serve as the building blocks for creating tailored machine learning models suited to given applications. By leveraging the synergy between GMs and FMs, we can advance proactive and automated cyber defense mechanisms by not only securing our networks against attacks but also enhancing their resilience against well-planned operations. This chapter discusses the games at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare, delves into the symbiotic relationship between these methodologies, and explores relevant applications where such a framework can make a substantial impact in cybersecurity. The chapter discusses the promising direction of the multi-agent neurosymbolic conjectural learning (MANSCOL), which allows the defender to predict adversarial behaviors, design adaptive defensive deception tactics, and synthesize knowledge for the operational level synthesis and adaptation. FMs serve as pivotal tools across various functions for MANSCOL, including reinforcement learning, knowledge assimilation, formation of conjectures, and contextual representation. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the challenges associated with FMs and their application in the domain of cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cooperation through Selective Interaction and Long-term Experiences in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significance of network structures in promoting group cooperation within social dilemmas has been widely recognized. Prior studies attribute this facilitation to the assortment of strategies driven by spatial interactions. Although reinforcement learning has been employed to investigate the impact of dynamic interaction on the evolution of cooperation, there remains a lack of understanding about how agents develop neighbour selection behaviours and the formation of strategic assortment within an explicit interaction structure. To address this, our study introduces a computational framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning in the spatial Prisoner's Dilemma game. This framework allows agents to select dilemma strategies and interacting neighbours based on their long-term experiences, differing from existing research that relies on preset social norms or external incentives. By modelling each agent using two distinct Q-networks, we disentangle the coevolutionary dynamics between cooperation and interaction. The results indicate that long-term experience enables agents to develop the ability to identify non-cooperative neighbours and exhibit a preference for interaction with cooperative ones. This emergent self-organizing behaviour leads to the clustering of agents with similar strategies, thereby increasing network reciprocity and enhancing group cooperation.</description>
