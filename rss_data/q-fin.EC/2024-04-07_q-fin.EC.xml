      <title>Effect of State and Local Sexual Orientation Anti-Discrimination Laws on Labor Market Differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first quasi-experimental research examining the effect of both local and state anti-discrimination laws on sexual orientation on the labor supply and wages of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) workers. To do so, we use the American Community Survey data on household composition to infer sexual orientation and combine this with a unique panel dataset on local anti-discrimination laws. Using variation in law implementation across localities over time and between same-sex and different-sex couples, we find that anti-discrimination laws significantly reduce gaps in labor force participation rate, employment, and the wage gap for gay men relative to straight men. These laws also significantly reduce the labor force participation rate, employment, and wage premium for lesbian women relative to straight women. One explanation for the reduced labor supply and wage premium is that lesbian couples begin to have more children in response to the laws. Finally, we present evidence that state anti-discrimination laws significantly and persistently increased support for same-sex marriage. This research shows that anti-discrimination laws can be an effective policy tool for reducing labor market inequalities across sexual orientation and improving sentiment toward LGB Americans.</description>

      <title>Instruments And Effects Of Monetary And Fiscal Policy: The Relationship Between Inflation, Vat, And Deposit Interest Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of VAT revenues and Deposit Interest Rates on Inflation in Turkey between 1985-2022. Within the framework of econometric analysis of the obtained data, the analysis was carried out using ADF unit root test, Johansen Co-Integration Test, Error Terms and VECM (Vector Error Correction Model) models. According to the analysis results, it was understood that the data were stationary at the I(I) level, it was determined that there was a cointegrated relationship between them in the long term, and by estimating the error term, causality findings were determined within the framework of VECM analysis. According to the causality results of the Wald Test; causality is found from Deposit Interest Rate to VAT and Inflation, and from Inflation to VAT and Deposit Interest Rate (bidirectional), while causality is also found from VAT to Inflation and Deposit Interest Rates.</description>

      <title>The forgotten pillar of sustainability: development of the S-assessment tool to evaluate Organizational Social Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pursuing sustainable development has become a global imperative, underscored adopting of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). At the heart of this agenda lies the recognition of social sustainability as a pivotal component, emphasizing the need for inclusive societies where every individual can thrive. Despite its significance, social sustainability remains a "forgotten pillar," often overshadowed by environmental concerns. In response, this paper presents the development and validation of the S-Assessment Tool for Social Sustainability, a comprehensive questionnaire designed to evaluate organizations' performance across critical dimensions such as health and wellness, gender equality, decent work, and economic growth, reducing inequalities, and responsible production and consumption. The questionnaire was constructed on the critical dimensions identified through a systematic and narrative hybrid approach to the analysis of peer-reviewed literature. The framework has been structured around the values of the SDGs. It aims to empower organizations to better understand and address their social impact, fostering positive change and contributing to the collective effort towards a more equitable and sustainable future. Through collaborative partnerships and rigorous methodology, this research underscores the importance of integrating social sustainability into organizational practices and decision-making processes, ultimately advancing the broader agenda of sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Subscription-Based Inventory Planning for E-Grocery Retailing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing e-grocery sector faces challenges in becoming profitable due to heightened customer expectations and logistical complexities. This paper addresses the impact of uncertainty in customer demand on inventory planning for online grocery retailers. Given the perishable nature of grocery products and intense market competition, retailers must ensure product availability while minimising overstocking costs. We propose introducing subscription offers as a solution to mitigate these inventory challenges. Unlike existing literature focusing on uniform subscription models that may harm profitability, our approach considers the synergy between implementing product subscriptions and cost savings from improved inventory planning. We present a three-step procedure enabling retailers to understand uncertainty costs, quantify the value of gathering additional planning information, and implement profitability-enhancing subscription offers. This holistic approach ensures the development of sustainable subscription models in the e-grocery domain.</description>

      <title>Judgment in macroeconomic output growth predictions: Efficiency, accuracy and persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study applies observations of individual predictions of the first three releases of the US output growth rate to evaluate how the applied judgment affects prediction efficiency and accuracy as well as if judgment is persistent. While the first two issues have been assessed in other studies, there is little evidence on the formation of judgment in macroeconomic projections. Most of the forecasters produce unbiased predictions, but employing the median Bloomberg projection as baseline, it turns out that judgment generally does not improve accuracy. There seems to be persistence in the judgment applied by forecasters in the sense that the sign of the adjustment in the first release prediction carries over to the projections of the two following revisions. One possible explanation is that forecasters use some kind of anchor-and-adjustment heuristic.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Stochastic Inventory Management in E-Grocery Retailing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E-grocery retailing enables ordering products online to be delivered at a future time slot chosen by the customer. This emerging field of business provides retailers with large and comprehensive new data sets, yet creates several challenges for the inventory management process. For example, the risk of a single item's stock-out leading to a complete cancellation of the shopping process is higher in e-grocery than in traditional store retailing. As a consequence, retailers aim at very high service level targets to provide satisfactory customer service and to ensure long-term business growth. When determining replenishment order quantities, it is of crucial importance to precisely account for the full uncertainty in the inventory process. This requires predictive and prescriptive analytics to (1) estimate suitable underlying probability distributions to represent the uncertainty caused by non-stationary customer demand, shelf lives, and supply, and to (2) integrate those forecasts into a comprehensive multi-period optimisation framework. In this paper, we model this stochastic dynamic problem by a sequential decision process that allows us to avoid simplifying assumptions commonly made in the literature, such as the focus on a single demand period. As the resulting problem will typically be analytically intractable, we propose a stochastic lookahead policy incorporating Monte Carlo techniques to fully propagate the associated uncertainties in order to derive replenishment order quantities. This policy naturally integrates probabilistic forecasts and allows us to explicitly derive the value of accounting for probabilistic information compared to myopic or deterministic approaches in a simulation-based setting. In addition, we evaluate our policy in a case study based on real-world data where underlying probability distributions are estimated from historical data and explanatory variables.</description>

      <title>Power sector effects of alternative options for de-fossilizing heavy-duty vehicles: go electric, and charge smartly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the passenger car segment, battery-electric vehicles (BEV) have emerged as the most promising option to de-fossilize transportation. For heavy-duty vehicles (HDV), the technology space still appears to be more open. Aside from BEV, electric road systems (ERS) for dynamic power transfer are discussed, as well as indirect electrification with trucks that use hydrogen fuel cells or e-fuels. Here we investigate the power sector implications of these alternative options. We apply an open-source capacity expansion model to future scenarios of Germany with high renewable energy shares, drawing on detailed route-based truck traffic data. Results show that power sector costs are lowest for flexibly charged BEV that also carry out vehicle-to-grid operations, and highest for HDV using e-fuels. If BEV and ERS-BEV are not charged in an optimized way, power sector costs increase, but are still substantially lower than in scenarios with hydrogen or e-fuels. This is a consequence of the poor energy efficiency of indirect HDV electrification, which outweighs its temporal flexibility benefits. We further find a higher use of solar photovoltaic energy for BEV and ERS-BEV, while hydrogen and e-fuel HDV lead to a higher use of wind power and fossil electricity generation. Results are qualitatively robust in sensitivity analyses without the European interconnection or with capacity limits for wind power expansion.</description>
