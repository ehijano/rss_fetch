      <title>Interacting Dark Energy and Its Implications for Unified Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternative dark energy models were proposed to address the limitation of the standard concordance model. Though different phenomenological considerations of such models are widely studied, scenarios where they interact with each other remain unexplored. In this context, we study interacting dark energy scenarios (IDEs), incorporating alternative dark energy models. The three models that are considered in this study are time-varying \Lambda, Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG), and K-essence. Each model includes an interaction rate \Gamma to quantify energy density transfer between dark energy and matter. Among them, GCG coupled with an interaction term shows promising agreement with the observed TT power spectrum, particularly for l &lt; 70, when \Gamma falls within a specific range. The K-essence model (\Gamma &lt;= 0.1) is more sensitive to \Gamma due to its non-canonical kinetic term, while GCG (\Gamma &gt;= 1.02) and the time-varying \Lambda (\Gamma &lt;= 0.01) models are less sensitive, as they involve different parameterizations. We then derive a general condition when the non-canonical scalar field {\phi} (with a kinetic term Xn) interacts with GCG. This has not been investigated in general form before. We find that current observational constraints on IDEs suggest a unified scalar field with a balanced regime, where it mimics quintessence behavior at n &lt; 1 and phantom behavior at n &gt; 1. We outline a strong need to consider alternative explanations and fewer parameter dependencies while addressing potential interactions in the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from quasielliptic compact binaries in scalar-tensor theory to one-and-a-half post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbit-averaged fluxes of energy and angular momentum generated by a compact binary system of nonspinning particles are obtained in a popular class of massless scalar-tensor theories with first-and-a-half post-Newtonian (1.5PN) accuracy, i.e., 2.5PN accuracy beyond the leading -1PN dipolar radiation. The secular evolution of the orbital elements (frequency and eccentricity) are then also obtained with 1.5PN accuracy. Three technical advances were necessary to obtain these results: (i) the decomposition of the scalar dipole moment as a Fourier series at 1PN order, along with the other moments at Newtonian order, (ii) the derivation of the formula for the passage to the center-of-mass frame at 2.5PN, including a novel hereditary term arising from the contribution of the radiation, and (iii) the complete treatment of the memory-like term appearing in the angular momentum flux. Moreover, as a byproduct of this work, I revisit in the Appendix the treatment in general relativity of the memory integral appearing at 2.5PN order in the angular momentum flux [arXiv:0908.3854], and find that the spurious divergence in the initial eccentricity $e_1$ found there is cured by a careful split between AC and DC terms.</description>

      <title>Black holes in scalar multipolar Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin Universe was reported [arXiv:2410.02851]. We show this solution is a special case of a Schwarzschild black hole/mass in a scalar multipolar Universe, that can be constructed algebraically combining known vacuum solutions. This builds on the generalized Weyl construction for scalar-vacuum, that admits two, fully decoupled, independent harmonic functions: one for the gravitational sector and another for the scalar sector. Harmonic solutions with growing multipoles lead to naked singularities (at spatial infinity), including for the scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin; harmonic solutions with decaying (scalar) multipoles are asymptotically flat, but have a singular horizon, in accordance with no-scalar-hair theorems. The scalar-vacuum model can be mapped to a five dimensional pure gravity construction via Kaluza-Klein oxidization and, in this way, to the corresponding $D=5$ generalized Weyl construction.</description>

      <title>A Unified Spectral Approach for Quasinormal Modes of Lee-Wick Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive examination of quasinormal modes linked to Lee-Wick black holes, delving into scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations using the spectral method. Such black holes can display a rich structure of horizons, and our analysis considers all the representative scenarios, including extremal and non-extremal situations. In particular, we show that purely imaginary quasinormal modes emerge for extremal and near-extremal configurations, suggesting a rapid return to equilibrium without oscillation.</description>

      <title>Linear independence of field equations in the Brans-Dicke theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solving the Brans-Dicke (BD) equations in the BD theory of gravity, their linear independence is important. This is due to fact that in solving these equations in cosmology, if the number of unknown quantities is equal to the number of independent equations, then the unknowns can be uniquely determined. In the BD theory, the tensor field $g_{\mu \nu}$ and the BD scalar field $\varphi$ are not two separate fields, but they are coupled together. The reason behind this is a corollary that proposed by V. B. Johri and D. Kalyani in cosmology, which states that the cosmic scale factor of the universe, $a$, and the BD scalar field $\varphi$ are related by a power law. Therefore, when the principle of least action is used to derive the BD equations, the variations $\delta g^{\mu \nu}$ and $\delta \varphi$ should not be considered as two independent dynamical variables. So, there is a constraint on $\delta g^{\mu \nu}$ and $\delta \varphi$ that causes the number of independent BD equations to decrease by one unit, in such a way that in the equations that have been known as BD equations, one of them is redundant. In this paper, we prove this issue, that is, we show that one of these equations, which we choose as the modified Klein-Gordon equation, is not an independent equation, but a result establishing other BD equations, the law of conservation of energy-momentum of matter and Bianchi's identity. Therefore, we should not look at the modified Klein-Gordon equation as an independent field equation in the BD theory, but rather it is included in the other BD equations and should not be mentioned separately as one of the BD equations once again.</description>

      <title>One-sided type-D metrics with aligned Einstein-Maxwell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional, Riemannian metrics for which one or other of the self-dual or anti-self-dual Weyl tensors is type-D and which satisfy the Einstein-Maxwell equations with the corresponding Maxwell field aligned with the type-D Weyl spinor, in the sense of sharing the same Principal Null Directions (or PNDs). Such metrics always have a valence-2 Killing spinor, and therefore a Hermitian structure and at least one Killing vector. We rederive the results of Araneda (\cite{ba}), that these metrics can all be given in terms of a solution of the $SU(\infty)$-Toda field equation, and show that, when there is a second Killing vector commuting with the first, the method of Ward can be applied to show that the metrics can also be given in terms of a pair of axisymmetric solutions of the flat three-dimensional Laplacian. Thus in particular the field equations linearise.
  Some examples of the constructions are given.</description>

      <title>Hairy black holes and other compact objects in theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of spacetimes governed by Einstein's general relativity and containing only Maxwell's electromagnetic field, stationary black holes are fully characterized by their mass, electric or magnetic charge, and angular momentum -- a property encapsulated in a version of the no-hair theorem. However, the validity of this theorem is contingent on certain assumptions, and when these are relaxed, new solutions describing hairy black holes arise. To date, astronomical observations have not provided concrete evidence of any type of black hole hair. Nevertheless, the development of increasingly precise gravitational wave detectors has sparked renewed interest in hairy black holes. In this thesis, we delve into two approaches to circumvent the no-hair theorem. The first option consists in describing the spacetime metric by an alternative theory of gravitation. We investigate the dynamical stability of hairy black holes in a vacuum spacetime described by the theory of massive bigravity. We show that hairy black holes in bigravity can describe both stellar black holes and supermassive black holes. The second approach is to keep Einstein's equations but to consider a different material content than Maxwell's electromagnetic field. For this we choose the fields of the electroweak theory. In the absence of gravitation, this theory describes magnetic monopoles with infinite mass. General relativity allows for their regularization by concealing their Coulombian singularity within an event horizon. After providing a detailed analysis of the internal structure of monopoles in flat space, we investigate how their properties generalize to the black hole case. Lastly, we study a particular example of soliton -- boson stars -- arising when a complex scalar field is coupled to general relativity. We construct chains of boson stars by solving the elliptic field equations using the finite element method.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlinear effects in the number-conserving analogue gravity of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the number-conserving unitary dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensates at absolute zero, and argue that an analogue gravity model in such a setting must take into account the backreaction of quasiparticle excitations onto the condensate background. This in turn requires that one expands to second order in perturbations, and takes the nonlinearity of the theory into account. It is shown that this leads to significant modifications of the standard linearized analogue gravity paradigm \`a la Unruh. In particular, to obtain a fully Lorentz-covariant equation in curved spacetime for second-order perturbations, we demonstrate that it is necessary to introduce, to leading order in powers of the formal expansion parameter $N^{-1/2}$ (where $N$ is total particle number), a quantum-fluctuation-renormalized spacetime metric which substantially differs from the Unruh metric and, to subleading order, two emergent vector fields. Both the renormalized metric and the vector fields then keep track of the effect of the backreaction of the quasiparticles onto the condensate up to the order in powers of $N^{-1/2}$ considered. Finally, we apply our formalism to an analogue-cosmological Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric and establish its renormalized form due to quantum many-body backreaction.</description>

      <title>Testing black holes with cosmological constant in Einstein-bumblebee gravity through the black hole shadow using EHT data and deflection angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper investigates black hole solutions with a cosmological constant in Einstein-Bumblebee gravity, which incorporates Lorentz symmetry breaking. Focusing on black hole thermodynamics, the study examines modifications to the first law, the equation of state, and critical points, providing insight into black hole behavior in anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) spacetimes. The presence of the bumblebee parameter is found to significantly affect black hole properties, such as the horizon radius and Hawking temperature, with larger deviations from general relativity predictions as the bumblebee parameter varies. The paper further explores black hole shadows and their potential observational constraints using Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data. The shadow radius is influenced by both the cosmological constant and the bumblebee parameter, offering a possible avenue for testing deviations from general relativity. Additionally, weak and strong deflection angles of light near black holes in Einstein-Bumblebee gravity are computed, revealing substantial differences from standard black hole models. The study highlights how these deflection angles depend on the cosmological constant and the bumblebee parameter, emphasizing the need for highly sensitive detectors to observe such effects.</description>

      <title>Reverse stealth construction and its thermodynamic imprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of solutions within the context of modified gravity theories, characterized by a non-trivial field that does not generate any back-reaction on the metric. These stealth configurations are effectively defined by the stealth conditions, which correspond to a vanishing stress-energy tensor. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to constructing this class of solutions. In contrast to the standard procedure, the starting point requires satisfying the stealth conditions for a given ansatz independently of the gravitational dynamics. This approach simultaneously determines the non-trivial field and the geometries capable of supporting it as a stealth configuration. Consequently, a gravity model can accommodate a stealth field only if its vacuum solution falls within the geometries permissible under stealth conditions. By applying this reverse procedure in the non-minimal $R\phi^2$ coupling, we recover all previously known stealth configurations and present new solutions. Although it seems intuitive to assume that this ``gravitationally undetectable'' scalar field leaves no physical traces, it remarkably reveals thermodynamic imprints, as its presence screens the black hole mass and modifies the entropy according to the first law.</description>

      <title>What Reference Frames Teach Us. Part I: About Symmetry Principles and Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is an exploration of the nuanced realm of reference frames within the framework of General Relativity. Our analysis exposes a violation of Earman's SP1 principle in scenarios involving fields that are dynamically uncoupled, a common assumption for reference frames. Unlike other violations, we cannot foreclose it by eliminating background spacetime structure. Our analysis also leads us to challenge the conventional notion of partial observables as quantities that are associated with a measuring instrument and expressed within a coordinate system. Instead, we argue that a partial observable is inherently relational, even if gauge-variant, and needs dynamical coupling with other partial observables to form a bona-fide, gauge-invariant complete observables. This perspective allows us to distinguish between being relational and being gauge-invariant, two properties that are often conflated.</description>

      <title>Gibbons-Hawking action for electrically charged black holes in the canonical ensemble and Davies' thermodynamic theory of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the connection between the Gibbons-Hawking Euclidean path integral approach applied to the canonical ensemble of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and the thermodynamic theory of black holes of Davies. We build the ensemble, characterized by a reservoir at infinity at temperature $T$ and electric charge $Q$, in $d$ dimensions. The Euclidean path integral yields the action and partition function. In zero loop, we uncover two solutions, one with horizon radius $r_{+1}$ the least massive, the other with $r_{+2}$. We find a saddle point separating the solutions at $T_s$ and $Q_s$ with radius $r_{+s}$. For $T &gt; T_s$ there is only hot flat space with charge at infinity. We derive the thermodynamics. The heat capacity gives that $T_s$ and $Q_s$ separate stable, $r_{+1}$, from unstable, $r_{+2}$ , solutions, the phase transition being second order. The free energy of the stable solution is positive, so if the system is a black hole it makes a first order transition to hot space. An interpretation of the results as energy wavelengths is attempted. For $d = 4$, the thermodynamics from the path integral applied to the canonical ensemble is precisely the Davies thermodynamics theory of black holes, with $T_s$ being the Davies point. We sketch the case $d = 5$.</description>

      <title>Probe of spatial geometry from scalar induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel probe of spatial geometry of the Universe through the observation of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by first order curvature perturbations. The existence of spatial curvature leaves imprints on the gravitational wave spectrum and formation of primordial black holes. Given the peaked scalar spectrum, the induced spectrum deviates from the flat space power spectrum and the deviation is dependent on the spatial curvature K and reheating temperature $T_{rh}$. For prolonged reheating and negative spatial curvature the spectrum is amplified enough and exhibits an additional peak solely due to K indicating a possible detection by future gravitational wave experiments including LISA and DECIGO. We also observe that the presence of negative spatial curvature improves the constraints on PBH formation, increasing the mass of black holes which are viable dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Massive bigravity as a presymplectic BV-AKSZ sigma-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a presymplectic BV-AKSZ sigma model encoding the ghost free massive bigravity theory action as well as its Batalin-Vilkovisky extension in terms of the finite-dimensional graded geometry of the target space. A characteristic feature of the construction is that the target space is realised as a quasi-regular submanifold of a linear graded manifold which, in turn, is a direct product of two copies of the shifted Poincar\'e Lie algebra. This graded manifold comes equipped with a natural presymplectcic structure and the compatible pre-$Q$ structure which is a sum of the Chevalley-Eilenberg differentials of each copy of the Poincare algebra and the interaction term. The constraints determining the submanifold are the supergeometrical realization of the known Deser-Van Nieuwenhuizen condition and its descendant.</description>

      <title>Is the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization evidence for dark energy dynamics partially caused by the excess smoothing of Planck CMB anisotropy data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the performance of the spatially-flat dynamical dark energy (DE) $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, with redshift-dependent DE fluid equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$, with and without a varying CMB lensing consistency parameter $A_L$, against Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (P18 and lensing) and a combination of non-CMB data composed of baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements that do not include DESI BAO data, Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) data points. From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\to\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\sigma$ errors). This joint analysis of CMB and non-CMB data favors DE dynamics over a cosmological constant at $\sim 1\sigma$ and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim 2\sigma$, i.e. more smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data than is predicted by the best-fit model. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\sim 2\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$, there is a difference of $2.8\sigma$ between P18 and non-CMB cosmological parameter constraints and $2.7\sigma$ between P18+lensing and non-CMB constraints. When $A_L$ is allowed to vary these tensions reduced to $1.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ respectively. Our P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation positively favors the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization without and with a varying $A_L$ parameter over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ is also positively favored over $w_0w_a$CDM.</description>

      <title>On-Shell Approach to Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an on-shell approach to study black hole mergers. Since, asymptotically, the initial and final states can be described by point-like spinning particles, we propose a massive three-point amplitude for the merger of two Schwarzschild black holes into a Kerr black hole. This three-point amplitude and the spectral function of the final state are fully determined by kinematics and the model-independent input about the black hole merger which is described by a complete absorption process. Using the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism, we then reproduce the classical conservation laws for momentum and angular momentum after the merger. As an application, we use the proposed three-point to compute the graviton emission amplitude, from which we extract the merger waveform to all orders in spin but leading in gravitational coupling. Up to sub-subleading order in spin, this matches the classical soft graviton theorem. We conclude with a comparison to black hole perturbation theory, which gives complementary amplitudes which are non-perturbative in the gravitational coupling but to leading order in the extreme mass ratio limit. This also highlights how boundary conditions on a Schwarzschild background can be used to rederive the proposed on-shell amplitudes for merger processes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation beyond slow roll: noise modelling and importance sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the distribution of very rare, large excursions in the primordial density field produced in models of inflation in the very early universe which include a strong enhancement of the power spectrum. The stochastic $\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is used to identify the probability distribution for the primordial curvature perturbation with the first-passage-time distribution, $P(\delta \mathcal{N})$, and we compare our stochastic results with those obtained in the classical $\delta \mathcal{N}$ approach. We extend the PyFPT numerical code to simulate the full 2D phase space, and apply importance sampling which allows very rare fluctuations to be simulated in $\mathcal{O}(10)$ minutes on a single CPU, where previous direct simulations required supercomputers. We demonstrate that the stochastic noise due to quantum fluctuations after a sudden transition to ultra-slow roll can be accurately modelled using an analytical Bessel-function ansatz to identify the homogeneous growing mode. The stochastic noise found in this way is a function of the field value only. This enables us to coarse grain the inflation field at the Hubble scale and include non-linear, stochastic evolution on all super-Hubble length scales.</description>

      <title>Impact of stratified rotation on the moment of inertia of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigid (Uniform) rotation is usually assumed when investigating the properties of mature neutron stars (NSs). Although it simplifies their description, it is an assumption because we cannot observe the NS's innermost parts. Here, we analyze the structure of NSs in the simple case of ''almost rigidity,'' where the innermost and outermost parts rotate with different angular velocities. This is motivated by the possibility of NSs having superfluid interiors, phase transitions, and angular momentum transfer during accretion processes. We show that, in general relativity, the relative difference in angular velocity between different parts of an NS induces a change in the moment of inertia compared to that of rigid rotation. The relative change depends nonlinearly on where the angular velocity jump occurs inside the NS. For the same observed angular velocity in both configurations, if the jump location is close to the star's surface-which is possible in central compact objects (CCOs) and accreting stars-the relative change in the moment of inertia is close to that of the angular velocity (which is expected due to total angular momentum aspects). If the jump occurs deep within the NS, for instance, due to phase transitions or superfluidity, smaller relative changes in the moment of inertia are observed; we found that if it is at a radial distance smaller than approximately $40\%$ of the star's radius, the relative changes are negligible. Additionally, we outline the relevance of systematic uncertainties that nonrigidity could have on some NS observables, such as radius, ellipticity, and the rotational energy budget of pulsars, which could explain the X-ray luminosity of some sources. Finally, we also show that non-rigidity weakens the universal $I$-Love-$Q$ relations.</description>

      <title>Particle creation from non-geodesic trajectories in multifield inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle production in de Sitter spacetime arises from the exponential expansion of space, rendering the Bunch-Davies vacuum perceived as a particle-containing state by late-time observers. For states defined as eigenstates of both momentum and the Hamiltonian, the Bunch-Davies vacuum exhibits a constant particle density per physical momentum. We explore particle production beyond this baseline, focusing on deviations from exact de Sitter conditions and non-gravitational interactions, such as slow-roll inflation or interactions arising from the coupling of inflation to other fields. Using Bogoliubov transformations, we calculate the number density of energy/momentum eigenstates. In single-field inflation, this density captures the observed spectral index of the primordial power spectrum, while in two-field models, it reflects the non-gravitational coupling driving background trajectory turning. We present analytical results applicable to various scenarios involving particle production from non-adiabatic processes during inflation.</description>

      <title>New approach to template banks of gravitational waves with higher harmonics: Reducing matched-filtering cost by over an order of magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searches for gravitational wave events use models, or templates, for the signals of interest. The templates used in current searches in the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) data model the dominant quadrupole mode $(\ell,|m|)=(2,2)$ of the signals, and omit sub-dominant higher-order modes (HM) such as $(\ell,|m|)=(3,3)$, $(4,4)$, which are predicted by general relativity. This omission reduces search sensitivity to black hole mergers in interesting parts of parameter space, such as systems with high masses and asymmetric mass-ratios. We develop a new strategy to include HM in template banks: instead of making templates containing a combination of different modes, we separately store normalized templates corresponding to $(2,2)$, $(3,3)$ and $(4,4)$ modes. To model aligned-spin $(3,3)$, $(4,4)$ waveforms corresponding to a given $(2,2)$ waveform, we use a combination of post-Newtonian formulae and machine learning tools. In the matched filtering stage, one can filter each mode separately with the data and collect the timeseries of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). This leads to a HM template bank whose matched-filtering cost is just $\approx 3\times$ that of a quadrupole-only search (as opposed to $\approx\! 100 \times$ in previously proposed HM search methods). Our method is effectual and generally applicable for template banks constructed with either stochastic or geometric placement techniques. New GW candidate events that we detect using our HM banks and details for combining the different SNR mode timeseries are presented in accompanying papers: Wadekar et al. [1] and [2] respectively. Additionally, we discuss non-linear compression of $(2,2)$-only geometric-placement template banks using machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of conformal infinity as a stretched horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study of asymptotically flat spacetime in even dimensions $d\geq 4$. We analyze the most general boundary condition and asymptotic symmetry compatible with Penrose's definition of asymptotic null infinity $\mathscr{I}$ through conformal compactification. Following Penrose's prescription and using a minimal version of the Bondi-Sachs gauge, we show that $\mathscr{I}$ is naturally equipped with a Carrollian stress tensor whose radial derivative defines the asymptotic Weyl tensor. This analysis describes asymptotic infinity as a stretched horizon in the conformally compactified spacetime. We establish that charge aspects conservation can be written as Carrollian Bianchi identities for the asymptotic Weyl tensor. We then provide a covariant renormalization for the asymptotic symplectic potential, which results in a finite symplectic flux and asymptotic charges. The renormalization scheme works even in the presence of logarithmic anomalies.</description>

      <title>Twist-free axisymmetric critical collapse of a complex scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical phenomena in gravitational collapse are characterized by the emergence of surprising structure in solution space, namely the appearance of universal power-laws and periodicities near the threshold of collapse, and a universal discretely self-similar solution at the threshold itself. The seminal work of M. Choptuik spurred a comprehensive investigation of extreme spherical spacetimes in numerical relativity, with analogous results for numerous matter models. Recent research suggests that the generalization to less symmetric scenarios is subtle. In twist-free axisymmetric vacuum collapse for instance, numerical evidence suggests a breakdown of universality of solutions at the threshold of collapse. In this study, we explore gravitational collapse involving a massless complex scalar field minimally coupled to general relativity. We employ the pseudospectral code BAMPS to investigate a neighborhood of the spherically symmetric critical solution in phase space, focusing on aspherical departures from it. First, working in explicit spherical symmetry, we find strong evidence that the spacetime metric of the spherical critical solution of the complex scalar field agrees with that of the Choptuik solution. We then examine universality of the behavior of solutions near the threshold of collapse as the departure from spherical symmetry increases, comparing with recent investigations of the real scalar field. We present a series of well-tuned numerical results and document shifts of the power-law exponent and periods as a function of the degree of asphericity of the initial data. At sufficiently high asphericities we find that the center of collapse bifurcates, on the symmetry axis, but away from the origin. Finally we look for and evaluate evidence that in the highly aspherical setting the collapse is driven by gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum gravity with neural networks: Solving the quantum Hamilton constraint of U(1) BF theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the canonical approach of loop quantum gravity, arguably the most important outstanding problem is finding and interpreting solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint. In this work, we demonstrate that methods of machine learning are in principle applicable to this problem. We consider $U(1)$ BF theory in 3 dimensions, quantized with loop quantum gravity methods. In particular, we formulate a master constraint corresponding to Hamilton and Gauss constraints using loop quantum gravity methods. To make the problem amenable for numerical simulation we fix a graph and introduce a cutoff on the kinematical degrees of freedom, effectively considering $U_q(1)$ BF theory at a root of unity. We show that the Neural Network Quantum State (NNQS) ansatz can be used to numerically solve the constraints efficiently and accurately. We compute expectation values and fluctuations of certain observables and compare them with exact results or exact numerical methods where possible. We also study the dependence on the cutoff.</description>

      <title>Effective-one-body waveform model for non-circularized, planar, coalescing black hole binaries: the importance of radiation reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated version of the TEOBResumS-Dali effective-one-body (EOB) waveform model for spin aligned binaries on non-circularized orbits. Recently computed 4PN (nonspinning) terms are incorporated in the waveform and radiation reaction. The model is informed by a restricted sample ($\sim60$) of spin-aligned, quasi-circular, Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations. In the quasi-circular limit, the model displays EOB/NR unfaithfulness ${\bar{F}}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOBNR}\lesssim 10^{-2}$ (with median~ $1.06\times 10^{-3}$) (with Advanced LIGO noise and in the total mass range $10-200M_\odot$) for the dominant $\ell=m=2$ mode all over the 534 spin-aligned configurations available through the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime catalog of NR waveforms. Similar figures are also obtained with the 28 public eccentric SXS simulations and good compatibility between EOB and NR scattering angles is found. The quasi-circular limit of TEOBResumS-Dali is also found to be highly consistent with the TEOBResumS-GIOTTO quasi-circular model. We then systematically explore the importance of NR-tuning {\it also} the radiation reaction of the system. When this is done, the median of the distribution of quasi-circular ${\bar{F}}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOBNR}$ is lowered to $3.92\times 10^{-4}$, though balanced by a tail up to $\sim 0.1$ for large, positive spins. The same is true for the eccentric-inspiral datasets. We conclude that an improvement of the analytical description of the spin-dependent flux (and its interplay with the conservative part) is likely to be the cornerstone to lower the EOB/NR unfaithfulness below the $10^{-4}$ level all over the parameter space, thus grazing the current NR uncertainties as well as the expected needs for next generation of GW detector like Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Buchdahl transformations: New static and rotating black holes in vacuum, double copy, and hairy extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates Buchdahl transformations within the framework of Einstein and Einstein-Scalar theories. Specifically, we establish that the recently proposed Schwarzschild-Levi-Civita spacetime can be obtained by means of a Buchdahl transformation of the Schwarschild metric along the spacelike Killing vector. The study extends Buchdahl's original theorem by combining it with the Kerr-Schild representation. In doing so, we construct new vacuum-rotating black holes in higher dimensions which can be viewed as the Levi-Civita extensions of the Myers-Perry geometries. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the double copy scheme within these new generated geometries still holds, providing an example of an algebraically general double copy framework. In the context of the Einstein-Scalar system, the paper extends the corresponding Buchdahl theorem to scenarios where a static vacuum seed configuration, transformed with respect to a spacelike Killing vector, generates a hairy black hole spacetime. We analyze the geometrical features of these spacetimes and investigate how a change of frame, via conformal transformations, leads to a new family of black hole spacetimes within the Einstein-Conformal-Scalar system.</description>

Abstract: Precision measurements of space and time, like those made by the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), are often confronted with fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot both be precisely measured, giving rise to an apparent limitation called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Reducing quantum noise below the SQL in gravitational-wave detectors, where photons are used to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors, has been an active area of research for decades. Here we show how the LIGO A+ upgrade reduced the detectors' quantum noise below the SQL by up to 3 dB while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, more than two decades after this possibility was first presented.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal particle production in Einstein-Cartan gravity with modified Holst term and non-minimal couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-thermal fermionic particle production is investigated in Einstein-Cartan modified gravity with a modified Holst term and non-minimal couplings between the spin connection and a fermion. By using the auxiliary field method, the theory is rewritten into a pseudoscalar-tensor theory with Einstein-Hilbert action and canonical kinetic and potential terms for a pseudoscalar field. The introduced field is called Einstein-Cartan pseudoscalaron. If the potential energy of the Einstein-Cartan pseudoscalaron dominates the energy density of the early universe, it causes inflationary expansion. After the end of inflation, the pseudoscalaron develops a large value and the non-minimal couplings destabilize the vacuum. Evaluating the non-thermal fermionic particle production process, we obtain the mass and the helicity dependences of the produced particle number density. We show the model parameters to enhance the preheating and reheating processes.</description>

      <title>On the stability of electrovacuum space-times in scalar-tensor gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of static, spherically symmetric solutions to the field equations of scalar-tensor theories (STT) of gravity belonging to the Bergmann-Wagoner-Nordtvedt class, in the presence of an electric and/or magnetic charge. This class of theories includes the Brans-Dicke, Barker and Schwinger STT as well as nonminimally coupled scalar fields with an arbitrary parameter $\xi$. The study is restricted to canonical (nonphantom) versions of the theories and scalar fields without a self-interaction potential. Only radial (monopole) perturbations are considered as the most likely ones to cause an instability. The static background solutions contain naked singularities, but we formulate the boundary conditions in such a way that would preserve their meaning if a singularity is smoothed, for example, due to quantum gravity effects. These boundary conditions look more physical than those used by other authors. Since the solutions of all STT under study are related by conformal transformations, the stability problem for all of them reduces to the same wave equation, but the boundary conditions for perturbations (and sometimes the boundaries themselves) are different in different STT, which affects the stability results. The stability or instability conclusions are obtained for different branches of solutions in the theories under consideration and are presented in a table form.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of fermions in the vicinity of Sung-Won-Kim wormholes \cite{SW Kim PRD 1996} within the framework of a generalized Kaluza-Klein gravity. The study explores the geometric and quantum implications of introducing an extra dimension into the Sung-Won-Kim wormhole model. The impact of this additional dimension on the stability and traversability of the wormholes, as well as on the fermionic equations of motion, is analyzed. By examining the modified Dirac equation in this extended framework, the emergence of geometric phases and quantum holonomies is discussed, providing insights into the topological aspects of fermion dynamics in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Einstein static Universe with boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The de Sitter state and the static Einstein Universe are the unique states, which have constant Ricci scalar curvature ${\cal R}$. Earlier it was shown that such unique symmetry of the de Sitter state leads to the special thermodynamic properties of this state, which are determined by the local temperature $T=1/(\pi R)$, where $R$ is the radius of the cosmological horizon. Then, what happens in static Universe? We consider the Einstein Universe, which has boundary. This can be the real physical boundary, or the border between two halves of the $R\times S^3$ Universe, if there is no contact between the halves. It appears that the static Einstein Universe with boundary is characterized by the same local temperature $T=1/(\pi R)$ as the de Sitter state. The thermodynamics of the bounded Einstein Universe is also similar to that of de Sitter. If this Universe contains Zel'dovich stiff matter, there is the holographic connection between the entropy of the Universe and the surface entropy $A/4G$ of the boundary. This means that in thermodynamics the physical boundary of the static Einstein Universe plays the role of the de Sitter cosmological horizon.</description>

      <title>The classical dynamics of gauge theories in the deep infrared</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11585v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge and gravitational theories in asymptotically flat settings possess infinitely many conserved charges associated with large gauge transformations or diffeomorphisms that are nontrivial at infinity. To what extent do these charges constrain the scattering in these theories? It has been claimed in the literature that the constraints are trivial, due to a decoupling of hard and soft sectors for which the conserved charges constrain only the dynamics in the soft sector. We show that the argument for this decoupling fails due to the failure in infinite dimensions of a property of symplectic geometry which holds in finite dimensions. Specializing to electromagnetism coupled to a massless charged scalar field in four dimensional Minkowski spacetime, we show explicitly that the two sectors are always coupled using a perturbative classical computation of the scattering map. Specifically, while the two sectors are uncoupled at low orders, they are coupled at quartic order via the electromagnetic memory effect. This coupling cannot be removed by adjusting the definitions of the hard and soft sectors (which includes the classical analog of dressing the hard degrees of freedom). We conclude that the conserved charges yield nontrivial constraints on the scattering of hard degrees of freedom. This conclusion should also apply to gravitational scattering and to black hole formation and evaporation.
  In developing the classical scattering theory, we show that generic Lorenz gauge solutions fail to satisfy the matching condition on the vector potential at spatial infinity proposed by Strominger to define the field configuration space, and we suggest a way to remedy this. We also show that when soft degrees of freedom are present, the order at which nonlinearities first arise in the scattering map is second order in Lorenz gauge, but can be third order in other gauges.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy, temperature corrections and heat kernel coefficients in $(D + 1)$-dimensional spacetimes with nontrivial topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we make use of the generalized zeta function technique to investigate the vacuum energy, temperature corrections and heat kernel coefficients associated with a scalar field under a quasiperiodic condition in a $(D+1)$-dimensional conical spacetime. In this scenario we find that the renormalized vacuum energy, as well as the temperature corrections, are both zero. The nonzero heat kernel coefficients are the ones related to the usual Euclidean divergence, and also to the nontrivial aspects of the quaisperiodically identified conical spacetime topology. An interesting result that arises in this configuration is that for some values of the quasiperiodic parameter, the heat kernel coefficient associated with the nontrivial topology vanishes. In addition, we also consider the scalar field in a $(D+1)$-dimensional spacetime formed by the combination of a conical and screw dislocation topological defects. In this case, we obtain a nonzero renormalized vacuum energy density and its corresponding temperature corrections. Again, the nonzero heat kernel coefficients found are the ones related to the Euclidean and nontrivial topology divergences. For $D=3$ we explicitly show, in the massless scalar field case, the limits of low and high temperatures for the free energy. In the latter, we show that the free energy presents a classical contribution.</description>

      <title>Self-resonance during preheating: The case of $\alpha$-attractor models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, for the first time, we obtain a new class of solutions for the Hill-type differential equations, which emerge in the preheating self-resonance phase of the expanding Universe. We study, in particular, the class of symmetric and asymmetric scalar field potentials coming from the so-called $\alpha$-attractor models of the early Universe cosmology. By making a series expansion of the potential and employing perturbative techniques we reformulate the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation, which captures the dynamics of the curvature perturbation in these models, into a Hill equation. This last includes higher-order terms that were never solved in the literature. Namely, those coming from the cubic and quartic contributions of the scalar field potential. Then, we derive the expressions for the Floquet exponents of the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable. Our analytical results are then compared with numerical computations, showing a good agreement and thus making this method valuable for obtaining theoretical predictions with new observational applications in the contexts of Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves.</description>

      <title>Impact of lensing bias on the cosmological dispersion measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmological dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift, derived from localized fast radio bursts (FRBs), has been used as a tool for constraining the cosmic ionized fraction and cosmological parameters. For these purposes, the DM in a homogeneous cosmological model has typically been used, neglecting the inhomogeneity of matter distribution. In this study, we derive a bias in the ensemble average of the DM over many FRBs owing to gravitational lensing by the inhomogeneous matter distribution based on cosmological perturbation theory. We demonstrate that the ensemble average is $0.4 \, \%$--$1\,\%$ smaller than the DM in the corresponding homogeneous model for a source redshift of $z_{\rm s}=1$, according to recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of IllustrisTNG and BAHAMAS. This reduction occurs because light rays from FRBs tend to avoid high-density regions owing to lensing deflection. We also discuss another selection effect, magnification bias, where demagnified FRBs with low DMs, fainter than the detection threshold, are excluded from the observed sample, leading to a selective observation of magnified FRBs with high DMs. Lensing bias, including magnification bias, must be considered to achieve percent level accuracy in the DM--redshift relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 4D-5D connection allows us to view the same near horizon geometry as part of a 4D black hole or a 5D black hole. A much studied example of this phenomenon is the BMPV black hole uplifted to 6D with flat base space versus Taub-NUT base space. These black holes have identical near horizon AdS_3 x S^3 geometry. In this paper, we study modes in AdS_3 x S^3 and identify those that correspond to supersymmetric hair modes in the full black hole spacetimes. We show that these modes satisfy non-normalisable boundary conditions in AdS_3. The non-normalisable boundary conditions are different for different hair modes and for different asymptotic completion. We also discuss how the supersymmetric hair modes on BMPV black holes fit into the classification of supersymmetric solutions of 6D supergravity.</description>

      <title>Beltrami fields, dispersive electromagnetic waves and gravitational spheromaks from chiral anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly modifies conserved currents, introducing new contributions. For Maxwell gauge fields, this leads to a contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field, a phenomenon known as the chiral magnetic effect, which is widely discussed in the literature. In the case of gravitational fields, as we demonstrate, the anomaly induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the potential manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and hydrodynamics in chiral media, and we also comment on backreaction effects in electrodynamics. In each case, we observe the systematic appearance of Beltrami-type fields. In electrodynamics and hydrodynamics, a Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector parallel to its own curl. We propose a generalization of Beltrami fields for tensorial gravitational perturbations, calling the respective solutions to the gravitational equations gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics of chiral media, vorticity asymptotically forms a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-point fluctuations in the background of a cosmic string provide an opportunity to study the effects of topology in quantum field theory. We use a scattering theory approach to compute quantum corrections to the energy density of a cosmic string, using the "ballpoint pen" and "flowerpot" models to allow for a nonzero string radius. For computational efficiency, we consider a massless field in $2+1$ dimensions. We show how to implement precise and unambiguous renormalization conditions in the presence of a deficit angle, and make use of Kontorovich-Lebedev techniques to rewrite the sum over angular momentum channels as an integral on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a connection between Dirac operators on configuration spaces and Yang-Mills quantum field theory. We first show that the Hamilton operators of the self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory emerge from unitary transformations of a Dirac equation formulated on a configuration space of gauge connections. Secondly, we formulate a Bott-Dirac operator on the configuration space and demonstrate how the Hamilton operator of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory coupled to a fermionic sector emerges from its square. Finally, we discuss a spectral invariant that emerges in this framework.</description>
