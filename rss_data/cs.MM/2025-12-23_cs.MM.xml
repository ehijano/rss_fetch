      <title>Layout-Aware Text Editing for Efficient Transformation of Academic PDFs to Markdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Academic documents stored in PDF format can be transformed into plain text structured markup languages to enhance accessibility and enable scalable digital library workflows. Markup languages allow for easier updates and customization, making academic content more adaptable and accessible to diverse usage, such as linguistic corpus compilation. Such documents, typically delivered in PDF format, contain complex elements including mathematical formulas, figures, headers, and tables, as well as densely layouted text. Existing end-to-end decoder transformer models can transform screenshots of documents into markup language. However, these models exhibit significant inefficiencies; their token-by-token decoding from scratch wastes a lot of inference steps in regenerating dense text that could be directly copied from PDF files. To solve this problem, we introduce EditTrans, a hybrid editing-generation model whose features allow identifying a queue of to-be-edited text from a PDF before starting to generate markup language. EditTrans contains a lightweight classifier fine-tuned from a Document Layout Analysis model on 162,127 pages of documents from arXiv. In our evaluations, EditTrans reduced the transformation latency up to 44.5% compared to end-to-end decoder transformer models, while maintaining transformation quality. Our code and reproducible dataset production scripts are open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Accelerating End-to-End PDF to Markdown Conversion Through Assisted Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Converting data from machine-unreadable formats like PDFs into Markdown has the potential to enhance the accessibility of scientific research. Existing end-to-end decoder transformer models can transform screenshots of PDFs into Markdown, offering more flexibility than pipeline-based methods. Yet, decoding text token by token from scratch is inefficient, especially when dense text can be directly copied from the PDF. To address this challenge, this paper modifies Prompt Lookup Decoding (PLD) to extract candidate sequences directly from PDF files, leveraging the high n-gram overlap between PDFs and their Markdown equivalents. A new method, Copy Lookup Decoding (CLD), is introduced here to enhance PLD's candidate generation mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that CLD can accelerate the conversion process by up to 1.70$\times$ at original quality. The codebase for this paper is open-source on GitHub (https://github.com/Fireblossom/CopyLookup).</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Pipeline Parallelism for Real-Time Multilingual Lip Synchronization in Video Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a parallel and asynchronous Transformer framework designed for efficient and accurate multilingual lip synchronization in real-time video conferencing systems. The proposed architecture integrates translation, speech processing, and lip-synchronization modules within a pipeline-parallel design that enables concurrent module execution through message-queue-based decoupling, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 3.1 times compared to sequential approaches. To enhance computational efficiency and throughput, the inference workflow of each module is optimized through low-level graph compilation, mixed-precision quantization, and hardware-accelerated kernel fusion. These optimizations provide substantial gains in efficiency while preserving model accuracy and visual quality. In addition, a context-adaptive silence-detection component segments the input speech stream at semantically coherent boundaries, improving translation consistency and temporal alignment across languages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed parallel architecture outperforms conventional sequential pipelines in processing speed, synchronization stability, and resource utilization. The modular, message-oriented design makes this work applicable to resource-constrained IoT communication scenarios including telemedicine, multilingual kiosks, and remote assistance systems. Overall, this work advances the development of low-latency, resource-efficient multimodal communication frameworks for next-generation AIoT systems.</description>

      <title>D$^{2}$Stream: Decoupled Dual-Stream Temporal-Speaker Interaction for Audio-Visual Speaker Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual speaker detection aims to identify the active speaker in videos by leveraging complementary audio and visual cues. Existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiency or suboptimal performance due to joint modeling of temporal and speaker interactions. We propose D$^{2}$Stream, a decoupled dual-stream framework that separates cross-frame temporal modeling from within-frame speaker discrimination. Audio and visual features are first aligned via cross-modal attention, then fed into two lightweight streams: a Temporal Interaction Stream captures long-range temporal dependencies, while a Speaker Interaction Stream models per-frame inter-person relationships. The temporal and relational features extracted by the two streams interact via cross-attention to enrich representations. A lightweight Voice Gate module further mitigates false positives from non-speech facial movements. On AVA-ActiveSpeaker, D$^{2}$Stream achieves a new state-of-the-art at 95.6% mAP, with 80% reduction in computation compared to GNN-based models and 30% fewer parameters than attention-based alternatives, while also generalizing well on Columbia ASD.

      <title>Let the Model Learn to Feel: Mode-Guided Tonality Injection for Symbolic Music Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music emotion recognition is a key task in symbolic music understanding (SMER). Recent approaches have shown promising results by fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models (e.g., MIDIBERT, a benchmark in symbolic music understanding) to map musical semantics to emotional labels. While these models effectively capture distributional musical semantics, they often overlook tonal structures, particularly musical modes, which play a critical role in emotional perception according to music psychology. In this paper, we investigate the representational capacity of MIDIBERT and identify its limitations in capturing mode-emotion associations. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Guided Enhancement (MoGE) strategy that incorporates psychological insights on mode into the model. Specifically, we first conduct a mode augmentation analysis, which reveals that MIDIBERT fails to effectively encode emotion-mode correlations. We then identify the least emotion-relevant layer within MIDIBERT and introduce a Mode-guided Feature-wise linear modulation injection (MoFi) framework to inject explicit mode features, thereby enhancing the model's capability in emotional representation and inference. Extensive experiments on the EMOPIA and VGMIDI datasets demonstrate that our mode injection strategy significantly improves SMER performance, achieving accuracies of 75.2% and 59.1%, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of mode-guided modeling in symbolic music emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>PMPGuard: Catching Pseudo-Matched Pairs in Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) image-text retrieval faces significant challenges in real-world datasets due to the presence of Pseudo-Matched Pairs (PMPs), semantically mismatched or weakly aligned image-text pairs, which hinder the learning of reliable cross-modal alignments. To address this issue, we propose a novel retrieval framework that leverages Cross-Modal Gated Attention and a Positive-Negative Awareness Attention mechanism to mitigate the impact of such noisy associations. The gated module dynamically regulates cross-modal information flow, while the awareness mechanism explicitly distinguishes informative (positive) cues from misleading (negative) ones during alignment learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark RS datasets, i.e., RSICD, RSITMD, and RS5M, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in handling real-world mismatches and PMPs in RS image-text retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>Tempo as the Stable Cue: Hierarchical Mixture of Tempo and Beat Experts for Music to 3D Dance Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music to 3D dance generation aims to synthesize realistic and rhythmically synchronized human dance from music. While existing methods often rely on additional genre labels to further improve dance generation, such labels are typically noisy, coarse, unavailable, or insufficient to capture the diversity of real-world music, which can result in rhythm misalignment or stylistic drift. In contrast, we observe that tempo, a core property reflecting musical rhythm and pace, remains relatively consistent across datasets and genres, typically ranging from 60 to 200 BPM. Based on this finding, we propose TempoMoE, a hierarchical tempo-aware Mixture-of-Experts module that enhances the diffusion model and its rhythm perception. TempoMoE organizes motion experts into tempo-structured groups for different tempo ranges, with multi-scale beat experts capturing fine- and long-range rhythmic dynamics. A Hierarchical Rhythm-Adaptive Routing dynamically selects and fuses experts from music features, enabling flexible, rhythm-aligned generation without manual genre labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempoMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in dance quality and rhythm alignment.</description>

      <title>FedVideoMAE: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Federated Video Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of short-form video platforms increases the need for privacy-preserving moderation, as cloud-based pipelines expose raw videos to privacy risks, high bandwidth costs, and inference latency. To address these challenges, we propose an on-device federated learning framework for video violence detection that integrates self-supervised VideoMAE representations, LoRA-based parameter-efficient adaptation, and defense-in-depth privacy protection. Our approach reduces the trainable parameter count to 5.5M (~3.5% of a 156M backbone) and incorporates DP-SGD with configurable privacy budgets and secure aggregation. Experiments on RWF-2000 with 40 clients achieve 77.25% accuracy without privacy protection and 65-66% under strong differential privacy, while reducing communication cost by $28.3\times$ compared to full-model federated learning. The code is available at: {https://github.com/zyt-599/FedVideoMAE}</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Counterfactual Explanations: Uncovering Decision Factors and Dataset Biases in Subjective Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept-driven counterfactuals explain decisions of classifiers by altering the model predictions through semantic changes. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages cross-modal decompositionality and image-specific concepts to create counterfactual scenarios expressed in natural language. We apply the proposed interpretability framework, termed Decompose and Explain (DeX), to the challenging domain of image privacy decisions, which are contextual and subjective. This application enables the quantification of the differential contributions of key scene elements to the model prediction. We identify relevant decision factors via a multi-criterion selection mechanism that considers both image similarity for minimal perturbations and decision confidence to prioritize impactful changes. This approach evaluates and compares diverse explanations, and assesses the interdependency and mutual influence among explanatory properties. By leveraging image-specific concepts, DeX generates image-grounded, sparse explanations, yielding significant improvements over the state of the art. Importantly, DeX operates as a training-free framework, offering high flexibility. Results show that DeX not only uncovers the principal contributing factors influencing subjective decisions, but also identifies underlying dataset biases allowing for targeted mitigation strategies to improve fairness.</description>

      <title>OmniMER: Indonesian Multimodal Emotion Recognition via Auxiliary-Enhanced LLM Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indonesian, spoken by over 200 million people, remains underserved in multimodal emotion recognition research despite its dominant presence on Southeast Asian social media platforms. We introduce IndoMER, the first multimodal emotion recognition benchmark for Indonesian, comprising 1,944 video segments from 203 speakers with temporally aligned text, audio, and visual annotations across seven emotion categories. The dataset exhibits realistic challenges including cross-modal inconsistency and long-tailed class distributions shaped by Indonesian cultural communication norms. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMER, a multimodal adaptation framework built upon Qwen2.5-Omni that enhances emotion recognition through three auxiliary modality-specific perception tasks: emotion keyword extraction for text, facial expression analysis for video, and prosody analysis for audio. These auxiliary tasks help the model identify emotion-relevant cues in each modality before fusion, reducing reliance on spurious correlations in low-resource settings. Experiments on IndoMER show that OmniMER achieves 0.582 Macro-F1 on sentiment classification and 0.454 on emotion recognition, outperforming the base model by 7.6 and 22.1 absolute points respectively. Cross-lingual evaluation on the Chinese CH-SIMS dataset further demonstrates the generalizability of the proposed framework. The dataset and code are publicly available. https://github.com/yanxm01/INDOMER</description>

      <title>TAG-WM: Tamper-Aware Generative Image Watermarking via Diffusion Inversion Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. However, the widespread adoption and advancing capabilities of generative image editing tools have amplified malicious tampering risks, while simultaneously posing new challenges to passive tampering detection and watermark robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results demonstrate that TAG-WM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tampering robustness and localization capability even under distortion, while preserving lossless generation quality and maintaining a watermark capacity of 256 bits. The code is available at: https://github.com/Suchenl/TAG-WM.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Aware Adaptive Elastic Weight Consolidation for Continual Learning in Medical Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical AI systems face catastrophic forgetting when deployed in clinical settings, where models must learn new imaging protocols while retaining prior diagnostic capabilities. This challenge is particularly acute for medical vision-language models that must preserve complex cross-modal alignments between medical images and clinical terminology across diverse imaging modalities. We introduce Prompt- Aware Adaptive Elastic Weight Consolidation (PA-EWC), a novel continual learning approach that addresses catastrophic forgetting through prompt-guided parameter specialization. Our method systematically categorizes model parameters based on their functional roles in processing visual-descriptive, spatial-guided, and medical-semantic information, enabling targeted protection of critical knowledge while allowing adaptation to new clinical requirements. PA-EWC incorporates adaptive Fisher Information computation with gradient stability analysis and develops weighted complexity metrics based on medical terminology density. We evaluate our approach across five medical imaging datasets (Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2018, CheXlocalize, BUSI, CAMUS) representing diverse modalities including endoscopy, dermoscopy, radiography, and ultrasound. Experimental results demonstrate that PA-EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting by up to 17.58% compared to baseline methods, with performance improvements of 4.30% on chest X-ray pathology localization and 6.06% on polyp segmentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning growth of video-to-music generation can be attributed to the ascendancy of multimodal generative models. However, there is a lack of literature that comprehensively combs through the work in this field. To fill this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of video-to-music generation using deep generative AI techniques, focusing on three key components: conditioning input construction, conditioning mechanism, and music generation frameworks. We categorize existing approaches based on their designs for each component, clarifying the roles of different strategies. Preceding this, we provide a fine-grained categorization of video and music modalities, illustrating how different categories influence the design of components within the generation pipelines. Furthermore, we summarize available multimodal datasets and evaluation metrics while highlighting ongoing challenges in the field.</description>
