      <title>DefectTwin: When LLM Meets Digital Twin for Railway Defect Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Digital Twin (DT) replicates objects, processes, or systems for real-time monitoring, simulation, and predictive maintenance. Recent advancements like Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized traditional AI systems and offer immense potential when combined with DT in industrial applications such as railway defect inspection. Traditionally, this inspection requires extensive defect samples to identify patterns, but limited samples can lead to overfitting and poor performance on unseen defects. Integrating pre-trained LLMs into DT addresses this challenge by reducing the need for vast sample data. We introduce DefectTwin, which employs a multimodal and multi-model (M^2) LLM-based AI pipeline to analyze both seen and unseen visual defects in railways. This application enables a railway agent to perform expert-level defect analysis using consumer electronics (e.g., tablets). A multimodal processor ensures responses are in a consumable format, while an instant user feedback mechanism (instaUF) enhances Quality-of-Experience (QoE). The proposed M^2 LLM outperforms existing models, achieving high precision (0.76-0.93) across multimodal inputs including text, images, and videos of pre-trained defects, and demonstrates superior zero-shot generalizability for unseen defects. We also evaluate the latency, token count, and usefulness of responses generated by DefectTwin on consumer devices. To our knowledge, DefectTwin is the first LLM-integrated DT designed for railway defect inspection.</description>

      <title>Data-driven methods for computational mechanics: A fair comparison between neural networks based and model-free approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparison between two approaches to modelling hyperelastic material behaviour using data. The first approach is a novel approach based on Data-driven Computational Mechanics (DDCM) that completely bypasses the definition of a material model by using only data from simulations or real-life experiments to perform computations. The second is a neural network (NN) based approach, where a neural network is used as a constitutive model. It is trained on data to learn the underlying material behaviour and is implemented in the same way as conventional models. The DDCM approach has been extended to include strategies for recovering isotropic behaviour and local smoothing of data. These have proven to be critical in certain cases and increase accuracy in most cases. The NN approach contains certain elements to enforce principles such as material symmetry, thermodynamic consistency, and convexity. In order to provide a fair comparison between the approaches, they use the same data and solve the same numerical problems with a selection of problems highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Both the DDCM and the NNs have shown acceptable performance. The DDCM performed better when applied to cases similar to those from which the data is gathered from, albeit at the expense of generality, whereas NN models were more advantageous when applied to wider range of applications.</description>

      <title>Integrating Bayesian Approaches and Expert Knowledge for Forecasting Continuous Glucose Monitoring Values in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise and timely forecasting of blood glucose levels is essential for effective diabetes management. While extensive research has been conducted on Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneity, underscoring the need for specialized blood glucose forecasting systems. This study introduces a novel blood glucose forecasting system, applied to a dataset of 100 patients from the ShanghaiT2DM study. Our study uniquely integrates knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches, leveraging expert knowledge to validate and interpret the relationships among diabetes-related variables and deploying the data-driven approach to provide accurate forecast blood glucose levels. The Bayesian network approach facilitates the analysis of dependencies among various diabetes-related variables, thus enabling the inference of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) trajectories in similar individuals with T2DM. By incorporating past CGM data including inference CGM trajectories, dietary records, and individual-specific information, the Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) model effectively forecasts glucose levels across time intervals ranging from 15 to 60 minutes. Forecast results show a mean absolute error of 6.41 mg/dL, a root mean square error of 8.29 mg/dL, and a mean absolute percentage error of 5.28%, for a 15-minute prediction horizon. This study makes the first application of the ShanghaiT2DM dataset for glucose level forecasting, considering the influences of diabetes-related variables. Its findings establish a foundational framework for developing personalized diabetes management strategies, potentially enhancing diabetes care through more accurate and timely interventions.</description>

      <title>MLP, XGBoost, KAN, TDNN, and LSTM-GRU Hybrid RNN with Attention for SPX and NDX European Call Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the performance of various artificial neural network architectures, including a multilayer perceptron (MLP), Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN), LSTM-GRU hybrid recursive neural network (RNN) models, and a time-delay neural network (TDNN) for pricing European call options. In this study, we attempt to leverage the ability of supervised learning methods, such as ANNs, KANs, and gradient-boosted decision trees, to approximate complex multivariate functions in order to calibrate option prices based on past market data. The motivation for using ANNs and KANs is the Universal Approximation Theorem and Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, respectively. Specifically, we use S\&amp;P 500 (SPX) and NASDAQ 100 (NDX) index options traded during 2015-2023 with times to maturity ranging from 15 days to over 4 years (OptionMetrics IvyDB US dataset). Black \&amp; Scholes's (BS) PDE \cite{Black1973} model's performance in pricing the same options compared to real data is used as a benchmark. This model relies on strong assumptions, and it has been observed and discussed in the literature that real data does not match its predictions. Supervised learning methods are widely used as an alternative for calibrating option prices due to some of the limitations of this model. In our experiments, the BS model underperforms compared to all of the others. Also, the best TDNN model outperforms the best MLP model on all error metrics. We implement a simple self-attention mechanism to enhance the RNN models, significantly improving their performance. The best-performing model overall is the LSTM-GRU hybrid RNN model with attention. Also, the KAN model outperforms the TDNN and MLP models. We analyze the performance of all models by ticker, moneyness category, and over/under/correctly-priced percentage.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weak form is a ubiquitous, well-studied, and widely-utilized mathematical tool in modern computational and applied mathematics. In this work we provide a survey of both the history and recent developments for several fields in which the weak form can play a critical role. In particular, we highlight several recent advances in weak form versions of equation learning, parameter estimation, and coarse graining, which offer surprising noise robustness, accuracy, and computational efficiency.

      <title>Optimizing the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with OpenMP Offload and Codee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) utilizes shared memory (OpenMP) and distributed memory (MPI) parallelisms. To take advantage of GPU resources on the Perlmutter supercomputer at NERSC, we port parts of the computationally expensive routines of the Fast Spectral Bin Microphysics (FSBM) microphysical scheme to NVIDIA GPUs using OpenMP device offloading directives. To facilitate this process, we explore a workflow for optimization which uses both runtime profilers and a static code inspection tool Codee to refactor the subroutine. We observe a 2.08x overall speedup for the CONUS-12km thunderstorm test case.</description>

      <title>Non-Invasive Glucose Prediction System Enhanced by Mixed Linear Models and Meta-Forests for Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a non-invasive glucose prediction system that integrates Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) sensing. We employ a Mixed Linear Model (MixedLM) to analyze the association between mm-wave frequency S_21 parameters and blood glucose levels within a heterogeneous dataset. The MixedLM method considers inter-subject variability and integrates multiple predictors, offering a more comprehensive analysis than traditional correlation analysis. Additionally, we incorporate a Domain Generalization (DG) model, Meta-forests, to effectively handle domain variance in the dataset, enhancing the model's adaptability to individual differences. Our results demonstrate promising accuracy in glucose prediction for unseen subjects, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 17.47 mg/dL, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 31.83 mg/dL, and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 10.88%, highlighting its potential for clinical application. This study marks a significant step towards developing accurate, personalized, and non-invasive glucose monitoring systems, contributing to improved diabetes management.</description>

      <title>Theory and Computation of Substructure Characteristic Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of substructure characteristic modes is reformulated using a scattering matrix-based formulation, generalizing subregion characteristic mode decomposition to arbitrary computational tools. It is shown that the scattering formulation is identical to the classical formulation based on the background Green's function for lossless systems. The scattering formulation, however, opens a variety of new subregion scenarios unavailable within previous formulations, including cases with lumped or wave ports or subregions in circuits. Thanks to its scattering nature, the formulation is solver-agnostic with the possibility to utilize an arbitrary full-wave method.</description>

      <title>A Port-Hamiltonian System Perspective on Electromagneto-Quasistatic Field Formulations of Darwin-Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagneto-quasistatic (EMQS) field formulations are often dubbed as Darwin-type field formulations which approximate the Maxwell equations by neglecting radiation effects while modelling resistive, capacitive, and inductive effects. A common feature of EMQS field models is the Darwin-Amp\'ere equation formulated with the magnetic vector potential and the electric scalar potential. EMQS field formulations yield different approximations to the Maxwell equations by choice of additional gauge equations. These EMQS formulations are analyzed within the port-Hamiltonian system (PHS) framework. It is shown via the PHS compatibility equation that formulations based on the combination of the Darwin-Amp\'ere equation and the full Maxwell continuity equation yield port-Hamiltonian systems implying numerical stability and specific EMQS energy conservation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1709.10048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper gives an introduction to rate equations in nonlinear continuum mechanics which should obey specific transformation rules. Emphasis is placed on the geometrical nature of the operations involved in order to clarify the different concepts. The paper is particularly concerned with common classes of constitutive equations based on corotational stress rates and their proper implementation in time for solving initial boundary value problems. Hypoelastic simple shear is considered as an example application for the derived theory and algorithms.</description>
