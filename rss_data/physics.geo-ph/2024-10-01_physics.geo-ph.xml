      <title>Training the Next Generation of Seismologists: Delivering Research-Grade Software Education for Cloud and HPC Computing through Diverse Training Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of data volume and computing power, seismological research requires more advanced skills in data processing, numerical methods, and parallel computing. We present the experience of conducting training workshops over various forms of delivery to support the adoption of large-scale High-Performance Computing and Cloud computing to advance seismological research. The seismological foci were on earthquake source parameter estimation in catalogs, forward and adjoint wavefield simulations in 2 and 3 dimensions at local, regional, and global scales, earthquake dynamics, ambient noise seismology, and machine learning. This contribution describes the series of workshops, the learning outcomes of the participants, and lessons learned by the instructors. Our curriculum was grounded on open and reproducible science, large-scale scientific computing and data mining, and computing infrastructure (access and usage) for HPC and the cloud. We also describe the types of teaching materials that have proven beneficial to the instruction and the sustainability of the program. We propose guidelines to deliver future workshops on these topics.</description>

      <title>Multimethod geophysical modelling for granite-related tungsten exploration: example of the Puy-les-Vignes/ Saint-Goussaud district (Limousin, France)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, EU became aware of its dependency on mining countries for mineral resources. In that context in 2022, France launched new airborne geophysical surveys in the Limousin region (northwestern French Massif Central) which is historically renown for its gold, uranium, tungsten and tin production. Thanks to these new data, it has become possible to both explore the Saint-Goussaud - Auriat zone, centered on the Puy-les-Vignes tungsten deposit and to investigate the numerous W occurrences. To do so, direct geophysical modelling using gravimetric, airborne magnetic and electromagnetic data has allowed to create a 3D regional model. It mainly illustrates locations where evolved granites deepen, possibly associated with hidden granitic cupolas. Besides, electromagnetic data have been analysed to highlight conductive anomalies. The lineament analysis has contributed to identify a conductive corridor, interpreted as a regional structure. Conductive vertical conduits, which are spatially close to mineralized occurrences and stream-sediment anomalies have also been spotted. This new method has thus allowed generating new elements which could be combined and could have implications for granite-related tungsten exploration in this region.</description>

      <title>An analysis on OpenMetBuoy-v2021 drifter in-situ data and Lagrangian trajectory simulations in the Agulhas Current System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to perform a sensitivity analysis of Lagrangian trajectory models, Lagrangian trajectory simulations have been compared to six OpenMetBuoy-v2021 drifter trajectories in the Agulhas Current System (Jan-Mar 2023). Three different Lagrangian trajectory simulations have been assessed: (1) two offline Lagrangian tracking tools, OpenDrift and Parcels, (2) three Eulerian ocean surface current products, HYCOM, Mercator and Globcurrent, and (3) the addition of wind and/or wave forcing parameterizations. The latter has also been evaluated by strong ocean current, high wind speed and Stokes drift regimes.
  Firstly, using the same time stepping scheme and linear interpolation methods, the different Lagrangian simulators OpenDrift and Parcels, performed identically. Secondly, the Globcurrent product showed the highest mean skill of the three ocean current products, although it underestimated the speed for strong ocean currents due to its spatial resolution. The HYCOM and Mercator model simulations showed, respectively, 40\% and 15\% lower skill than the Globcurrent simulations. Finally, the addition of the Stokes drift and a wind drift factor (WDF), improved the Lagrangian simulation performance in skill and speed, especially in high wind (&gt;10 m/s) and/or Stokes drift regimes (&gt;0.15 m/s). The optimal WDF for the OpenMetBuoy-v2021 is found to be ~1.8\% and ~2.3\% for simulations including and excluding Stokes drift forcing respectively. To further improve the incorporation of Stokes drift and direct wind drag on the trajectory simulations, a more physically based solution is advised as there are still numerous wind and wave related processes that remain unresolved, like wave-current interactions and vertical shear.
  To statistically strengthen the conclusions from this research, incorporating additional observed drifter trajectories would be highly favourable.</description>

      <title>Perspectives and challenges in bolide infrasound processing and interpretation: A focused review with case studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing plays a critical role in the detection and analysis of bolides, offering passive, cost-effective global monitoring capabilities. Key objectives include determining the timing, location, and yield of these events. Achieving these goals requires a robust approach to detect, analyze, and interpret rapidly moving elevated sources such as bolides (also re-entry and space debris). In light of advancements in infrasonic methodologies, there is a need for a comprehensive overview of the characteristics that distinguish bolides from other infrasound sources, and methodologies for bolide infrasound analysis. This paper provides a focused review of key considerations and presents a unified framework to enhance infrasound processing approaches specifically tailored for bolides. Three representative case studies are presented to demonstrate the practical application of infrasound processing methodologies and deriving source parameters, while exploring challenges associated with bolide-generated infrasound. These case studies underscore the effectiveness of infrasound in determining source parameters and highlight interpretative challenges, such as variations in signal period measurements across different studies. Future research should place emphasis on improving geolocation and yield accuracy. This can be achieved through rigorous and systematic analyses of large, statistically significant samples of such events. aiming to resolve interpretative inconsistencies and explore the causes for variability in signal periods and back azimuths. The topic described here is also relevant to space exploration involving planetary bodies with atmospheres, such as Venus, Mars, and Titan.</description>

      <title>Urban Sensing Using Existing Fiber-Optic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of urban seismic signals offers valuable insights into urban environments and society, including seismic hazards, infrastructure conditions, human mobility, and cultural and social life. Yet, accurate detection and localization of urban seismic sources on a city-wide scale with conventional seismic sensing networks is unavailable due to the prohibitive costs of ultra-dense seismic arrays required for imaging high-frequency anthropogenic sources. Here, we leverage existing fiber-optic networks as a distributed acoustic sensing system to accurately locate urban seismic sources and estimate how their intensity varies over time. By repurposing a 50-kilometer telecommunication fiber into an ultra-dense seismic array, we generate high-resolution spatiotemporal maps of seismic source power (SSP) across San Jose, California. Our approach overcomes the proximity limitations of urban seismic sensing, enabling accurate localization of remote seismic sources generated by urban activities, such as vehicle movements, construction works, and school operations. We also show strong correlations between SSP values and environmental noise level measurements, as well as various persistent urban features, including the density of points of interest, land use patterns, and demographics. Our study shows how SSP maps can be turned into novel urban data that effectively reveal dynamics and persistent urban features, thus opening the way towards the use of fiber-optic networks as a ubiquitous and general-purpose urban sensing platform with wide-ranging applications in urban studies.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Event Categorization Matrix Approach for Nuclear Detonations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current efforts to detect nuclear detonations and correctly categorize explosion sources with ground- and space-collected discriminants presents challenges that remain unaddressed by the Event Categorization Matrix (ECM) model. Smaller events (lower yield explosions) often include only sparse observations among few modalities and can therefore lack a complete set of discriminants. The covariance structures can also vary significantly between such observations of event (source-type) categories. Both obstacles are problematic for ``classic'' ECM. Our work addresses this gap and presents a Bayesian update to the previous ECM model, termed B-ECM, which can be trained on partial observations and does not rely on a pooled covariance structure. We further augment ECM with Bayesian Decision Theory so that false negative or false positive rates of an event categorization can be reduced in an intuitive manner. To demonstrate improved categorization rates with B-ECM, we compare an array of B-ECM and classic ECM models with multiple performance metrics that leverage Monte Carlo experiments. We use both synthetic and real data. Our B-ECM models show consistent gains in overall accuracy and a lower false negative rates relative to the classic ECM model. We propose future avenues to improve B-ECM that expand its decision-making and predictive capability.</description>

      <title>SFY -- A lightweight, high-frequency and phase-resolving wave-buoy for coastal waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small lightweight wave buoys, SFYs, designed to operate near the coast, have been developed. The buoys are designed to record and transmit the full time series of surface acceleration at $52$ Hz. The buoy uses the cellular network to transfer data and position (up to $80$ km from the base station). This reduces costs and increases band-width. The low cost and low weight permits the buoys to be deployed easily, and in arrays in areas where satellite and wave models struggle to resolve wave and current interaction. The buoys are tested in a wave-flume, the open water and in the breaking waves of the surf. The conditions range from calm to significant wave heights exceeding $7$ m and crashing breakers with accelerations exceeding $10$ g. The high sample rate captures the impulse of breaking waves, and allows them to be studied in detail. Breaking waves are measured and quantified in the open water. We measure breaking waves in the surf and recover the trajectory of waves breaking in the field to a higher degree than previously done. The time series of surface elevation, and accurate positioning, permits the signal of adjacent buoys to be correlated in a coherent phase-resolved way. Finally, we offer an explanation and solution for the ubiquitous low-frequency noise in IMU-based buoys and discuss necessary sampling and design to measure in areas of breaking waves.</description>

      <title>Revisiting visualization of spiral states in a wide-gap spherical Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A pioneering study conducted by Egbers and Rath [Acta Mech. 111 pp. 125--140 (1995)] experimentally captured spiral waves to elucidate the transition in the wide-gap spherical Couette flow. However, the physical field quantities of the spiral waves corresponding to light patterns of various intensities, as obtained in the experiment, remain unclear, and we have yet to move beyond the understanding that the reflected light from shear-sensitive flake tracers responds to a flow that appears at the transition. In this study, the experiment to visualize spiral waves using aluminum flakes, as performed by Egbers and Rath, was numerically reproduced by solving the translational and rotational motions of the particles in a spiral wave. First, the spiral wave in a spherical Couette flow with an aspect ratio $\eta=1/2$ was numerically calculated using the Newton--Raphson method. Subsequently, the image that was numerically reproduced from the spiral wave was compared with an experimentally visualized image. The torque acting on the inner sphere and the phase angular velocity of the spiral waves with various wavenumbers were provided. Attempts have been made to determine the instantaneous physical quantity to which the light and dark patterns obtained in the visualization corresponded, and the orientation motion of the flakes developed in the advective history of the flow is essential to yield favorable results. Exploring the correlation between flow visualization results and shear structures may provide a new avenue for quantitatively estimating spatial structures and time scales in complex and quickly time-varying flow fields, such as turbulence.</description>

      <title>Geophysical Observations of the 24 September 2023 OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule Re-Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sample Return Capsules (SRCs) entering Earth's atmosphere at hypervelocity from interplanetary space are a valuable resource for studying meteor phenomena. The 24 September 2023 arrival of the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) SRC provided an unprecedented chance for geophysical observations of a well-characterized source with known parameters, including timing and trajectory. A collaborative effort involving researchers from 16 institutions executed a carefully planned geophysical observational campaign at strategically chosen locations, deploying over 400 ground-based sensors encompassing infrasound, seismic, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), and GPS technologies. Additionally, balloons equipped with infrasound sensors were launched to capture signals at higher altitudes. This campaign (the largest of its kind so far) yielded a wealth of invaluable data anticipated to fuel scientific inquiry for years to come. The success of the observational campaign is evidenced by the near-universal detection of signals across instruments, both proximal and distal. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the collective scientific effort, field deployment, and preliminary findings. The early findings have the potential to inform future space missions and terrestrial campaigns, contributing to our understanding of meteoroid interactions with planetary atmospheres. Furthermore, the dataset collected during this campaign will improve entry and propagation models as well as augment the study of atmospheric dynamics and shock phenomena generated by meteoroids and similar sources.</description>
