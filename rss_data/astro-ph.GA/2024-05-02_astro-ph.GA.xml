      <title>Introducing the DREAMS Project: DaRk mattEr and Astrophysics with Machine learning and Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the DREAMS project, an innovative approach to understanding the astrophysical implications of alternative dark matter models and their effects on galaxy formation and evolution. The DREAMS project will ultimately comprise thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that simultaneously vary over dark matter physics, astrophysics, and cosmology in modeling a range of systems -- from galaxy clusters to ultra-faint satellites. Such extensive simulation suites can provide adequate training sets for machine-learning-based analyses. This paper introduces two new cosmological hydrodynamical suites of Warm Dark Matter, each comprised of 1024 simulations generated using the Arepo code. One suite consists of uniform-box simulations covering a $(25~h^{-1}~{\rm M}_\odot)^3$ volume, while the other consists of Milky Way zoom-ins with sufficient resolution to capture the properties of classical satellites. For each simulation, the Warm Dark Matter particle mass is varied along with the initial density field and several parameters controlling the strength of baryonic feedback within the IllustrisTNG model. We provide two examples, separately utilizing emulators and Convolutional Neural Networks, to demonstrate how such simulation suites can be used to disentangle the effects of dark matter and baryonic physics on galactic properties. The DREAMS project can be extended further to include different dark matter models, galaxy formation physics, and astrophysical targets. In this way, it will provide an unparalleled opportunity to characterize uncertainties on predictions for small-scale observables, leading to robust predictions for testing the particle physics nature of dark matter on these scales.</description>

      <title>Comparing the interstellar and circumgalactic origin of gas in the tails of jellyfish galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations and observations find long tails in jellyfish galaxies, which are commonly thought to originate from ram-pressure stripped gas of the interstellar medium (ISM) in the immediate galactic wake. While at larger distances from the galaxy, they have been claimed to form in situ owing to thermal instability and fast radiative cooling of mixed ISM and intracluster medium (ICM). In this paper, we use magneto-hydrodynamical windtunnel simulations of a galaxy with the arepo code to study the origin of gas in the tails of jellyfish galaxies. To this end, we model the galaxy orbit in a cluster by accounting for a time-varying galaxy velocity, ICM density and turbulent magnetic field. Tracking gas flows between the ISM, the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the ICM, we find contrary to popular opinion that the majority of gas in the tail originated in the CGM. Prior to the central passage of the jellyfish galaxy in the cluster, the CGM is directly transported to the clumpy jellyfish tail that has been shattered into small cloudlets. After the central cluster passage, gas in the tail originates both from the initial ISM and the CGM, but that from the latter was accreted to the galactic ISM before being ram-pressure stripped to form filamentary tentacles in the tail. Our simulation shows a declining gas metallicity in the tail as a function of downstream distance from the galaxy. We conclude that the CGM plays an important role in shaping the tails of jellyfish galaxies.</description>

      <title>The NIRVANDELS Survey: the stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity relations of star-forming galaxies at z = 3.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present determinations of the gas-phase and stellar metallicities of a sample of 65 star-forming galaxies at $z \simeq 3.5$ using rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectroscopy from the VANDELS survey in combination with follow-up rest-frame optical spectroscopy from VLT/KMOS and Keck/MOSFIRE. We infer gas-phase oxygen abundances ($Z_{\mathrm{g}}$; tracing O/H) via strong optical nebular lines and stellar iron abundances ($Z_{\star}$; tracing Fe/H) from full spectral fitting to the FUV continuum. Our sample spans the stellar mass range $8.5 &lt; \mathrm{log}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) &lt; 10.5$ and shows clear evidence for both a stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR). We find that our O and Fe abundance estimates both exhibit a similar mass-dependence, such that $\mathrm{Fe/H}\propto M_{\star}^{0.30\pm0.11}$ and $\mathrm{O/H}\propto M_{\star}^{0.32\pm0.09}$. At fixed $M_{\star}$ we find that, relative to their solar values, O abundances are systematically larger than Fe abundances (i.e., $\alpha$-enhancement).We estimate an average enhancement of $\mathrm{(O/Fe)} = 2.65 \pm 0.16 \times \mathrm{(O/Fe)_\odot}$ which appears to be independent of $M_{\star}$. We employ analytic chemical evolution models to place a novel constraint on the strength of galactic-level outflows via the mass-outflow factor ($\eta$). We show that outflow efficiencies that scale as $\eta \propto M_{\star}^{-0.32}$ can simultaneously explain the functional form of of the stellar and gas-phase MZR, as well as the degree of $\alpha$-enhancement at fixed Fe/H. Our results add further evidence to support a picture in which $\alpha$-enhanced abundance ratios are ubiquitous in high-redshift star-forming galaxies, as expected for young systems whose interstellar medium is primarily enriched by core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>Mass segregation and velocity dispersion as evidence for a dark star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dark star cluster (DSC) is a system in which the cluster potential is dominated by stellar remnants, such as black holes and neutron stars having larger masses than the long-lived low-mass stars. Due to mass segregation, these remnants are located in the central region of the cluster and form a dark core. We expect that at a few kpc from the Galactic centre, the efficient evaporation of the lower-mass stars caused by the strong tidal force exposes the dark core, because the dynamical properties of the DSC are dominated by the remnants. Due to the invisibility of the remnants, finding a DSC by observation is challenging. In this project, we use $N$-body simulations to obtain models of DSCs and try to discern observables that signify a DSC. We consider four observables: the mass spectrum, the observational mass density profile, the observational velocity dispersion profile and the mass segregation. The models show that a DSC typically exhibits two distinct characteristics: for a given mass in stars and a given half-light radius the expected velocity dispersion is underestimated when only visible stars are considered, and there is a lack of measurable mass segregation among the stars. These properties can be helpful for finding DSCs in observational data, such as the Gaia catalogue.</description>

      <title>H1 Ly$\alpha$ Emission from a Metal-Poor Cool Stream Fueling an Early Dusty Starburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GAMA J0913$-$0107 system is a rare conjunction of a submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at $z \approx 2.7$ and two background QSOs with projected separations $&lt;$200 kpc. Previous high-resolution QSO absorption-line spectroscopy has revealed high H $\tiny{\rm I}$ column density, extremely metal-poor ($\sim 1\%$ solar) gas streams in the circumgalactic medium of the SMG. Here we present deep optical integral-field spectroscopy of the system with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). Reaching a $2\sigma$ surface brightness (SB) limit $\approx 10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ with $\sim$2 hours of integration time, we detect a filamentary Ly$\alpha$ nebula stretching $\sim$180 kpc from the SMG intercepting both QSO sightlines. This Ly$\alpha$ filament may correspond to the same cool gas stream penetrating through the hot halo seen in the absorption. In contrast to Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around QSOs, there is no obvious local source for photoionization due to the massive dust content. While uncertain, we consider the possibility that the nebula is ionized by shocks induced by the infall, obscured star formation, and/or a boosted UV background. The SMG-QSOs conjunction multiplied the efficiency of the KCWI observations, allowing a direct comparison of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae in two distinct environments. We find that the nebula around the QSOs are much brighter and show steeper surface brightness profiles than the SMG nebula. This is consistent with the additional photoionization and Ly$\alpha$ scattering provided by the QSOs. While illustrating the challenges of detecting Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around SMGs, our work also demonstrates that important insights can be gained from comparative studies of high-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ nebulae.</description>

      <title>The Interplay between the IMF and Star Formation Efficiency through Radiative Feedback at High Stellar Surface Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed rest-UV luminosity function at cosmic dawn ($z \sim 8-14$) measured by JWST revealed an excess of UV-luminous galaxies relative to many pre-launch theoretical predictions. A high star-formation efficiency (SFE) and a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) are among the mechanisms proposed for explaining this excess. Although a top-heavy IMF has been proposed for its ability to increase the light-to-mass ratio (\(\Psi_{\mathrm{UV}}\)), the resulting enhanced radiative pressure from young stars could decrease the star formation efficiency (SFE), potentially driving galaxy luminosities back down. In this Letter, we use idealized radiation hydrodynamic simulations of star cluster formation to explore the effects of a top-heavy IMF on the SFE of clouds typical of the high pressure conditions found at these redshifts. We find that the SFE in star clusters with solar neighbourhood-like dust abundance decreases with increasingly top-heavy IMF's -- by $\sim 20 \%$ for an increase of factor 4 in $\Psi_{\mathrm{UV}}$, and by $50 \%$ for a factor $ \sim 10$ in $\Psi_{\mathrm{UV}}$. However, we find that an expected decrease in the dust-to-gas ratio ($\sim 0.01 \times \mathrm{Solar}$) at these redshifts can completely compensate for the enhanced light output. This leads to a (cloud-scale; $\sim 10 \, \mathrm{pc}$) SFE that is $\gtrsim 70\%$ even for a factor 10 increase in $\Psi_{\mathrm{UV}}$, implying that highly efficient star formation is unavoidable for high surface density and low metallicity conditions. Our results suggest that a top-heavy IMF, if present, likely coexists with efficient star formation in these galaxies.</description>

      <title>Repainting the colour-mass diagrams by unearthing the green mountain: dust-rich S0 galaxies in the colour-(galaxy stellar mass) diagram, and the colour-(black hole mass) relations for dust-poor versus dust-rich galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lenticular galaxies are notoriously misclassified as elliptical galaxies and, as such, a (disc inclination)-dependent correction for dust is often not applied to the magnitudes of dusty lenticular galaxies. This results in overly red galaxy colours, impacting their distribution in the colour-magnitude diagram. It is revealed how this has led to an underpopulation of the `green valley' by hiding a `green mountain' of massive dust-rich lenticular galaxies - known to be built from gas-rich major mergers - within the `red sequence' of colour-(stellar mass) diagrams. Correcting for dust, a `green mountain' appears at $M_{\rm *,gal}\sim10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, along with signs of an extension to lower masses producing a `green range' or `green ridge' on the green side of the `red sequence' and `blue cloud.' The `red sequence' is shown to be comprised of two components: a red plateau defined by elliptical galaxies with a near-constant colour and by lower-mass dust-poor lenticular galaxies, which are mostly a primordial population but may include faded/transformed spiral galaxies. The quasi-triangular-shaped galaxy evolution sequence, previously called the `Triangal', is revealed in the galaxy colour-(stellar mass) diagram. It tracks the speciation of galaxies and their associated migration through the diagram. The connection of the `Triangal' to previous galaxy morphology sequences (Fork, Trident, Comb) is also shown herein. Finally, the colour-(black hole mass) diagram is revisited, revealing how the dust correction generates a blue-green sequence for the spiral $and$ dust-rich lenticular galaxies that is offset from a green-red sequence defined by the dust-poor lenticular and elliptical galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Low Temperature Kinetic Study of the C(3P) + CH3OCH3 Reaction. Rate constants, H-atom Product Yields and Astrochemical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic carbon in its ground electronic state, C(3P), is expected to be present at high abundances during the evolution of dense molecular clouds. Consequently, its reactions with other interstellar species could have a strong influence on the chemical composition of these regions. Here, we report the results of an investigation of the reaction between C(3P) and dimethylether, CH3OCH3, which was recently detected in dark cloud TMC-1. Experiments were performed to study the kinetics of this reaction using a continuous supersonic flow reactor employing pulsed laser photolysis and pulsed laser induced fluorescence for atomic radical generation and detection respectively. Rate constants for this process were measured between 50 K and 296 K, while additional measurements of the product atomic hydrogen yields were also performed over the 75-296 K range. To better understand the experimental results, statistical rate theory was used to calculate rate constants over the same temperature range and to provide insight on the major product channels. These simulations, based on quantum chemical calculations of the ground triplet state of the C3H6O molecule, allowed us to obtain the most important features of the underlying potential energy surface. The measured rate constant increases as the temperature falls, reaching a value of k_(C+CH_3 OCH_3 )= 7.5 x 10-11 cm3 s-1 at 50 K, while the low measured H-atom yields support the theoretical prediction that the major reaction products are CH3 + CH3 + CO. The effects of this reaction on the abundances of interstellar CH3OCH3 and related species were tested using a gas-grain dense cloud model, employing an expression for the rate constant, k(T) = alpha(T/300)^beta, with alpha = 1.27 x 10-11 and beta = -1.01. These simulations predict that the C(3P) + CH3OCH3 reaction decreases gas-phase CH3OCH3 abundances by more than an order of magnitude at early times.</description>

      <title>The rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal and confirmation of its detection toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3-Hydroxypropenal (HOCHCHCHO) is the lower energy tautomer of malonaldehyde which displays a complex rotation-tunneling spectrum. It was detected tentatively toward the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293$-$2422 B with ALMA in the framework of the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS). Several transitions, however, had large residuals, preventing not only their detection, but also the excitation temperature of the species from being determined unambiguously. We want to extend the existing rotational line list of 3-hydroxypropenal to shed more light on the recent observational results and to facilitate additional radio astronomical searches for this molecule. We analyzed the rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal in the frequency regions between 150 and 330 GHz and between 400 and 660 GHz. Transitions were searched for in the PILS observations of IRAS 16293$-$2422. Local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models were carried out and compared to the observations to constrain the excitation temperature. Additional transitions were searched for in other ALMA archival data of the same source to confirm the presence of 3-hydroxypropenal. More than 11500 transitions were assigned in the course of our investigation with quantum numbers $2 \le J \le 100$, $K_a \le 59$, and $K_c \le 97$, resulting in a greatly improved set of spectroscopic parameters. The comparison between the LTE models and the observations yields an excitation temperature of 125 K with a column density $N = 1.0 \times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ for this species. We identified seven additional lines of 3-hydroxypropenal that show a good agreement with the model in the ALMA archive data. The calculated rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal has sufficient accuracy for radio astronomical searches. The detection of 3-hydroxypropenal toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B is now secure.</description>

      <title>Improved source classification and performance analysis using Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Discrete Source Classifier (DSC) provides probabilistic classification of sources in Gaia Data Release 3 using a Bayesian framework and a global prior. The DSC Combmod classifier in GDR3 achieved for the extragalactic classes (quasars and galaxies) a high completeness of 92% but a low purity of 22% due to contamination from the far larger star class. However, these single metrics mask significant variation in performance with magnitude and sky position. Furthermore, a better combination of the individual classifiers is possible. Here we compute two-dimensional representations of the completeness and the purity as function of Galactic latitude and source brightness, and exclude also the Magellanic Clouds where stellar contamination significantly depresses the purity. Reevaluated on a cleaner validation set and without introducing changes to the published GDR3 DSC probabilities themselves, we achieve for Combmod average 2-d completenesses of 92% and 95% and average 2-d purities of 55% and 89% for the quasar and galaxy classes respectively. Since the relative proportions of extragalactic objects to stars in Gaia is expected to vary significantly with brightness and latitude, we introduce a new prior as a continuous function of brightness and latitude, and compute new class probabilities. This variable prior only improves the performance by a few percentage points, mostly at the faint end. Significant improvement, however, is obtained by a new additive combination of Specmod and Allosmod. This classifier, Combmod-$\alpha$, achieves average 2-d completenesses of 82% and 93% and average 2-d purities of 79% and 93% for the quasar and galaxy classes respectively when using the global prior. Thus we achieve a significant improvement in purity for a small loss of completeness. The improvement is most significant for faint quasars where the purity rises from 20% to 62%.</description>

      <title>RUBIES: Evolved Stellar Populations with Extended Formation Histories at $z \sim 7-8$ in Candidate Massive Galaxies Identified with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of red, apparently massive galaxies at $z&gt;7$ in early JWST photometry suggests a strongly accelerated timeline compared to standard models of galaxy growth. A major uncertainty in the interpretation is whether the red colors are caused by evolved stellar populations, dust, or other effects such as emission lines or AGN. Here we show that three of the massive galaxy candidates at $z=6.7-8.4$ have prominent Balmer breaks in JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the RUBIES program. The Balmer breaks demonstrate unambiguously that stellar emission dominates at $\lambda_{\rm rest} = 0.4\,\mu$m, and require formation histories extending hundreds of Myr into the past in galaxies only 600--800 Myr after the Big Bang. Two of the three galaxies also show broad Balmer lines, with H$\beta$ FWHM $&gt;2500~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, suggesting that dust-reddened AGN contribute to, or even dominate, the SEDs of these galaxies at $\lambda_{\rm rest}\gtrsim 0.6\,\mu$m. All three galaxies have relatively narrow [O III] lines, seemingly ruling out a high-mass interpretation if the lines arise in dynamically-relaxed, inclined disks. Yet, the inferred masses also remain highly uncertain. We model the high-quality spectra using Prospector to decompose the continuum into stellar and AGN components, and explore limiting cases in stellar/AGN contribution. This produces a wide range of possible stellar masses, spanning $M_\star \sim 10^9 - 10^{11}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$. Nevertheless, all fits suggest a very early and rapid formation, most of which follow with a truncation in star formation. Potential origins and evolutionary tracks for these objects are discussed, from the cores of massive galaxies to low-mass galaxies with over-massive black holes. Intriguingly, we find all of these explanations to be incomplete; deeper and redder data are needed to understand the physics of these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of the analysis of a set of images obtained in the field of the Milky Way bulge globular cluster NGC 6355 using the Dark Energy Camera, which is attached to the 4m Blanco telescope of the Cerro-Tololo Interamerican Observatory. We dealt with a heavy differential absorption across the observed field, a crowded field star population, and the superposition of field stars on to the cluster color-magnitude diagram main features to produce an intrinsic cluster stars density map. The resulting stellar density map reveals the presence of an extended envelope, a tidal tail, and scattered debris; the tidal tails pointing toward the Milky Way center. Such extra-tidal overdensities, detected above the mean star field density, resulted to be between four and six times larger that the local star field density fluctuation. They have also been recently generated by two independent studies which performed numerical simulations of synthetic tidal tails of Milky Way globular clusters. These results contrast with previous theoretical speculations about the possibility to detect tidal tails of globular clusters with chaotic orbits because they would be washed out after they were generated.</description>

      <title>Grand Design vs. Multi-Armed Spiral Galaxies: Dependence on Galaxy Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed an algorithm to use Galaxy Zoo 3D spiral arm masks produced by citizen scientist volunteers to semi-automatically classify spiral galaxies as either multi-armed or grand design spirals. Our final sample consists of 299 multi-armed and 245 grand design galaxies. On average, the grand design galaxies have smaller stellar masses than the multi-armed galaxies. For a given stellar mass, the grand design galaxies have larger concentrations, earlier Hubble types, smaller half-light radii, and larger central surface mass densities than the multi-armed galaxies. Lower mass galaxies of both arm classes have later Hubble types and lower concentrations than higher mass galaxies. In our sample, a higher fraction of grand design galaxies have classical bulges rather than pseudo-bulges, compared to multi-armed galaxies. These results are consistent with theoretical models and simulations which suggest that dense classical bulges support the development and/or longevity of 2-armed spiral patterns. Similar specific star formation rates are found in multi-armed and grand design galaxies with similar stellar masses and concentrations. This implies that the specific star formation rates in spiral galaxies is a function of concentration and stellar mass, but independent of the number of spiral arms. Our classifications are consistent with arm counts from the Galaxy Zoo 2 project and published m=3 Fourier amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Formation of extraterrestrial peptides and their derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of protein precursors, due to the condensation of atomic carbon under the low-temperature conditions of the molecular phases of the interstellar medium, opens alternative pathways for the origin of life. We perform peptide synthesis under conditions prevailing in space and provide a comprehensive analytic characterization of its products. The application of 13C allowed us to confirm the suggested pathway of peptide formation that proceeds due to the polymerization of aminoketene molecules that are formed in the C + CO + NH3 reaction. Here, we address the question of how the efficiency of peptide production is modified by the presence of water molecules. We demonstrate that although water slightly reduces the efficiency of polymerization of aminoketene, it does not prevent the formation of peptides.</description>

      <title>Photo-ionization structures of Planetary Nebula IC 2003 with [WR] central star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ionization structures of IC 2003, a planetary nebula with [WR] central star, using a 1-D dusty photo-ionization code: \textit{"CLOUDY 17.03"}. The photo-ionization model is constrained by archival UV emission line fluxes, medium-resolution optical spectroscopy, $IRAS$ $25 \mu m$ flux, absolute $H\beta$ flux, and the mean angular size of the nearly spherical optical nebula. To constrain the carbon abundance and the effect of photo-electric heating in the ionized gas, we used UV emission lines. We considered an amorphous carbon dust grain with MRN and KMH size distributions to address the importance of photo-electric heating in the ionized nebula. We show that KMH grain size distribution with quantum dust heating reproduces the observations quite well. We construct the ionization structures of different elements at their different ionization stages in the nebula. We derive the physical properties of the planetary nebula and its chemical composition, as well as the parameters of its central star. The estimated nebular dust-to-gas mass ratio is $2.37\times 10^{-3}$, and the enhanced photo-electric heating yielded by small dust grains is $9.4\%$ of the total heating. We considered the H-poor model atmosphere for the central star; the effective temperature of the central star is 177kK, the specific gravity log(g) is 6, and its luminosity ($L_*$) is 6425 $L_\odot$. The derived central star parameters plotted on stellar evolutionary tracks correspond to a central star mass of 0.636$M_\odot $ and to a progenitor mass of 3.26$M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich velocity reconstruction from Planck and unWISE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect is a blackbody cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropy induced by Thomson scattering off free electrons in bulk motion with respect to the CMB rest frame. The statistically anisotropic cross-correlation between the CMB and galaxy surveys encodes the radial bulk velocity (more generally, the remote dipole field), which can be efficiently reconstructed using a quadratic estimator. Here, we develop and implement a quadratic estimator for the remote dipole field to data from the Planck satellite and the unWISE galaxy redshift catalog. With this data combination, we forecast a $\sim 1$-$\sigma$ detection within $\Lambda$CDM assuming a simple model for the distribution of free electrons. Using reconstructions based on individual frequency temperature maps, we characterize the impact of foregrounds, concluding that they can be effectively mitigated by masking and removing the estimator monopole. We demonstrate that reconstructions based on component-separated CMB maps have no detectable biases from foregrounds or systematics at the level of the expected statistical error. We use these reconstructions to constrain the multiplicative optical depth bias to $b_v &lt; 1.40$ at $68 \%$ confidence. Our fiducial signal model with $b_v =1$ is consistent with this measurement. Our results support an optimistic future for kSZ velocity reconstruction with near-term datasets.</description>

      <title>Identifying Halos in Cosmological Simulations with Continuous Wavelet Analysis: The 2D Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across spatial and scale domain simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method to identify halos and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin with the generation of four pseudo-2D datasets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. We then calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional Friends-of-Friends (FOF) method shows that our CWT-identified halos, while containing slightly fewer particles, have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. Our identification scheme operates with a linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, suggesting its suitability for analyzing significantly larger datasets in the future.</description>

      <title>Probing the dynamical and kinematical structures of detached shells around AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to resolve the spatial and kinematic sub-structures in five detached-shell sources to provide detailed constraints for hydrodynamic models that describe the formation and evolution of the shells. Methods. We use observations of the 12 CO (1-0) emission towards five carbon-AGB stars with ALMA. The data have angular resolutions of 0.3 arcsec to 1arcsec and a velocity resolution of 0.3 km/s . This enables us to quantify spatial and kinematic structures in the shells. Results. The observed emission is separated into two distinct components: a more coherent, bright outer shell and a more filamentary, fainter inner shell. The kinematic information shows that the inner sub-shells move at a higher velocity relative to the outer sub-shells. The observed sub-structures confirm the predictions from hydrodynamical models. However, the models do not predict a double-shell structure, and the CO emission likely only traces the inner and outer edges of the shell, implying a lack of CO in the middle layers of the detached shell. Previous estimates of the masses and temperatures are consistent with originating mainly from the brighter subshell, but the total shell masses are likely lower limits. Conclusions. The observed spatial and kinematical splittings of the shells appear consistent with results from hydrodynamical models, provided the CO emission does not trace the H2 density distribution in the shell but rather traces the edges of the shells. It is therefore not possible to constrain the total shell mass based on the CO observations alone. Complementary observations of, e.g., CI as a dissociation product of CO would be necessary to understand the distribution of CO compared to H2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically analyse solutions of the spherically symmetric gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system close to compactly supported stable steady states. We observe either partially undamped oscillations or macroscopically damped solutions. We investigate for many steady states to which of these behaviours they correspond. A linear relation between the exponents of polytropic steady states and the qualitative behaviour close to them is identified. Undamped oscillations are also observed around not too concentrated King models and around all shells with a sufficiently large vacuum region. We analyse all solutions both at the non-linear and linearised level and find that the qualitative behaviours are identical at both. To relate the observed phenomena to theoretical results, we further include a comprehensive numerical study of the radial particle periods in the equilibria.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity -- V. Effect of metallicity on surface abundances of O stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars rotate faster, on average, than lower mass stars. Stellar rotation triggers hydrodynamical instabilities which transport angular momentum and chemical species from the core to the surface. Models of high-mass stars that include these processes predict that chemical mixing is stronger at lower metallicity. We aim to test this prediction by comparing the surface abundances of massive stars at different metallicities. We performed a spectroscopic analysis of single O stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) based on the ULLYSES and XshootU surveys. We determined the fundamental parameters and helium, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen surface abundances of 17 LMC and 17 SMC non-supergiant O6-9.5 stars. We complemented these determinations by literature results for additional MCs and also Galactic stars to increase the sample size and metallicity coverage. We investigated the differences in the surface chemical enrichment at different metallicities and compared them with predictions of three sets of evolutionary models. Surface abundances are consistent with CNO-cycle nucleosynthesis. The maximum surface nitrogen enrichment is stronger in MC stars than in Galactic stars. Nitrogen enrichment is also observed in stars with higher surface gravities in the SMC than in the Galaxy. This trend is predicted by models that incorporate chemical transport caused by stellar rotation. The distributions of projected rotational velocities in our samples are likely biased towards slow rotators. A metallicity dependence of surface abundances is demonstrated. The analysis of larger samples with an unbiased distribution of projected rotational velocities is required to better constrain the treatment of chemical mixing and angular momentum transport in massive single and binary stars.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Granulation in Red Supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds with the Gaussian Process Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The granulation of red supergiants (RSGs) in the Magellanic Clouds are systematically investigated by combining the latest RSGs samples and light curves from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment and the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. The present RSGs samples are firstly examined for foreground stars and possible misidentified sources, and the light curves are sequentially checked to remove the outliers by white noise and photometric quality. The Gaussian Process regression is used to model the granulation, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo is applied to derive the granulation amplitude $\sigma$ and the period of the undamped oscillator $\rho$, as well as the damping timescale $\tau$. The dimensionless quality factor $Q$ is then calculated through $Q=\pi \tau/\rho$. RSGs around $Q = 1/\sqrt{2}$ are considered to have significant granulation signals and are used for further analysis. Combining granulation parameters with stellar parameters, robust scaling relations for the timescale $\rho$ are established, while the scaling relations for amplitude $\sigma$ are represented by a piecewise function, possibly related to the tendency of amplitudes in faint RSGs to converge towards a certain value. Comparing results between the SMC and LMC confirms that amplitudes and timescales become larger with metallicity. In examining the scaling relations between the two galaxies, it is found that $\rho$ is nearly independent of metallicity, whereas $\sigma$ is more significantly affected by metallicity. The Gaussian Process method is compared with the periodogram fitting of the granulations, and the advantages of either are discussed.</description>

      <title>The UV luminosity function at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1 from UVCANDELS</title>

Abstract: UVCANDELS is a HST Cycle-26 Treasury Program awarded 164 orbits of primary ultraviolet (UV) F275W imaging and coordinated parallel optical F435W imaging in four CANDELS fields: GOODS-N, GOODS-S, EGS, and COSMOS, covering a total area of $\sim426$ arcmin$^2$. This is $\sim2.7$ times larger than the area covered by previous deep-field space UV data combined, reaching a depth of about 27 and 28 ABmag ($5\sigma$ in $0.2"$ apertures) for F275W and F435W, respectively. Along with the new photometric catalogs, we present an analysis of the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF), relying on our UV-optimized aperture photometry method yielding a factor of $1.5\times$ increase than the H-isophot aperture photometry in the signal-to-noise ratios of galaxies in our F275W imaging. Using well tested photometric redshift measurements we identify 5810 galaxies at redshifts $0.6&lt;z&lt;1$, down to an absolute magnitude of $M_\text{UV} = -14.2$. In order to minimize the effect of uncertainties in estimating the completeness function, especially at the faint-end, we restrict our analysis to sources above $30\%$ completeness, which provides a final sample of 4726 galaxies at $-21.5&lt;M_\text{UV}&lt;-15.5$. We performed a maximum likelihood estimate to derive the best-fit parameters of the UV LF. We report a best-fit faint-end slope of $\alpha = -1.359^{+0.041}_{-0.041}$ at $z \sim 0.8$. Creating sub-samples at $z\sim0.7$ and $z\sim0.9$, we observe a possible evolution of $\alpha$ with redshift. The unobscured UV luminosity density at $M_\text{UV}&lt;-10$ is derived as $\rho_\text{UV}=1.339^{+0.027}_{-0.030}\ (\times10^{26} \text{ergs/s/Hz/Mpc}^3)$ using our best-fit LF parameters. The new F275W and F435 photometric catalogs from UVCANDELS have been made publicly available on the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS), a 1.3 GHz continuum survey of almost half of the Galactic Plane (251\deg $\le l \le$ 358\deg and 2\deg $\le l \le$ 61\deg at $|b| \le 1.5\deg $). SMGPS is the largest, most sensitive and highest angular resolution 1 GHz survey of the Plane yet carried out, with an angular resolution of 8" and a broadband RMS sensitivity of $\sim$10--20 $\mu$ Jy/beam. Here we describe the first publicly available data release from SMGPS which comprises data cubes of frequency-resolved images over 908--1656 MHz, power law fits to the images, and broadband zeroth moment integrated intensity images. A thorough assessment of the data quality and guidance for future usage of the data products are given. Finally, we discuss the tremendous potential of SMGPS by showcasing highlights of the Galactic and extragalactic science that it permits. These highlights include the discovery of a new population of non-thermal radio filaments; identification of new candidate supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae and planetary nebulae; improved radio/mid-IR classification of rare Luminous Blue Variables and discovery of associated extended radio nebulae; new radio stars identified by Bayesian cross-matching techniques; the realisation that many of the largest radio-quiet WISE HII region candidates are not true HII regions; and a large sample of previously undiscovered background HI galaxies in the Zone of Avoidance.</description>

      <title>Exploring Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V: First Year Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Changing-look" active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) challenge our basic ideas about the physics of accretion flows and circumnuclear gas around supermassive black holes. Using first-year Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) repeated spectroscopy of nearly 29,000 previously known AGNs, combined with dedicated follow-up spectroscopy, and publicly available optical light curves, we have identified 116 CL-AGNs where (at least) one broad emission line has essentially (dis-)appeared, as well as 88 other extremely variable systems. Our CL-AGN sample, with 107 newly identified cases, is the largest reported to date, and includes $\sim0.4\%$ of the AGNs reobserved in first-year SDSS-V operations. Among our CL-AGNs, 67% exhibit dimming while 33% exhibit brightening. Our sample probes extreme AGN spectral variability on months to decades timescales, including some cases of recurring transitions on surprisingly short timescales ($\lesssim 2$ months in the rest frame). We find that CL events are preferentially found in lower-Eddington-ratio ($f_{Edd}$) systems: Our CL-AGNs have a $f_{Edd}$ distribution that significantly differs from that of a carefully constructed, redshift- and luminosity-matched control sample (Anderson-Darling test yielding $p_{\rm AD}\approx 6\times10^{-5}$; median $f_{Edd}\approx0.025$ vs. $0.043$). This preference for low $f_{Edd}$ strengthens previous findings of higher CL-AGN incidence at lower $f_{Edd}$, found in smaller samples. Finally, we show that the broad MgII emission line in our CL-AGN sample tends to vary significantly less than the broad H$\beta$ emission line. Our large CL-AGN sample demonstrates the advantages and challenges in using multi-epoch spectroscopy from large surveys to study extreme AGN variability and physics.</description>

      <title>Cholla-MHD: An Exascale-Capable Magnetohydrodynamic Extension to the Cholla Astrophysical Simulation Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension of the massively parallel, GPU native, astrophysical hydrodynamics code Cholla to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Cholla solves the ideal MHD equations in their Eulerian form on a static Cartesian mesh utilizing the Van Leer + Constrained Transport integrator, the HLLD Riemann solver, and reconstruction methods at second and third order. Cholla's MHD module can perform $\approx260$ million cell updates per GPU-second on an NVIDIA A100 while using the HLLD Riemann solver and second order reconstruction. The inherently parallel nature of GPUs combined with increased memory in new hardware allows Cholla's MHD module to perform simulations with resolutions $\sim500^3$ cells on a single high end GPU (e.g. an NVIDIA A100 with 80GB of memory). We employ GPU direct MPI to attain excellent weak scaling on the exascale supercomputer \textit{Frontier}, while using 74,088 GPUs and simulating a total grid size of over 7.2 trillion cells. A suite of test problems highlights the accuracy of Cholla's MHD module and demonstrates that zero magnetic divergence in solutions is maintained to round off error. We also present new testing and continuous integration tools using GoogleTest, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins that have made development more robust and accurate and ensure reliability in the future.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from the Normalized Velocity Profile of Gaia Wide Binary Stars and Statistical Testing of Newtonian and Milgromian Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-acceleration gravitational anomaly is investigated with a new method of exploiting the normalized velocity profile $\tilde{v}\equiv v_p/v_c$ of wide binary stars as a function of the normalized sky-projected radius $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ where $v_p$ is the sky-projected relative velocity between the pair, $v_c$ is the Newtonian circular velocity at the sky-projected separation $s$, and $r_{\rm{M}}$ is the MOND radius. With a Monte Carlo method Gaia observed binaries and their virtual Newtonian counterparts are probabilistically distributed on the $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ versus $\tilde{v}$ plane and a logarithmic velocity ratio parameter $\Gamma$ is measured in the bins of $s/r_{\rm{M}}$. With three samples of binaries covering a broad range in size, data quality, and implied fraction of hierarchical systems including a new sample of 6389 binaries selected with accurate distances and radial velocities, I find a unanimous systematic variation from the Newtonian flat line. With $\Gamma=0$ at $s/r_{\rm{M}}\lesssim 0.15$ or $s\lesssim 1$~kilo astronomical units (kau), I get $\Gamma=0.068\pm 0.015$ (stat) $_{-0.015}^{+0.024}$ (syst) for $s/r_{\rm{M}} \gtrsim 0.7$ or $s\gtrsim 5$~kau. The gravitational anomaly (i.e.\ acceleration boost) factor given by $\gamma_g = 10^{2\Gamma}$ is measured to be $\gamma_g = 1.37_{-0.09}^{+0.10}$ (stat) $_{-0.09}^{+0.16}$ (syst). With a reduced $\chi^2$ test of Newtonian and Milgromian nonrelativistic theories, I find that Newtonian gravity is ruled out at $5.8\sigma$ ($\chi^2_\nu=9.4$) by the new sample (and $9.2\sigma$ by the largest sample used). The Milgromian AQUAL theory is acceptable with $0.5\lesssim \chi^2_\nu\lesssim 3.1$. These results agree well with earlier results with the ``acceleration-plane analysis'' for a variety of samples and the ``stacked velocity profile analysis'' for a pure binary sample.</description>

      <title>Turbulent gas-rich disks at high redshift: bars &amp; bulges in a radial shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of high-redshift galaxies ($z \lesssim 7$) reveal that a substantial fraction have turbulent, gas-rich disks with well-ordered rotation and elevated levels of star formation. In some instances, disks show evidence of spiral arms, with bar-like structures. These remarkable observations have encouraged us to explore a new class of dynamically self-consistent models using our hydrodynamic N-body simulation framework that mimic a plausible progenitor of the Milky Way at high redshift. We explore disk gas fractions of $f_{\rm gas} = 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100\%$ and track the creation of stars and metals. The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We explore three distinct histories: (i) there is no ongoing accretion and the gas is used up by the star formation; (ii) the star-forming gas is replenished by cooling in the hot halo gas; (iii) in a companion paper, we revisit the models in the presence of a strong perturbing force. At low $f_{\rm disk}$ ($&lt;0.3$), where $f_{\rm disk}$ is the mass fraction of stars relative to dark matter within 2.2 $R_{\rm disk}$, a bar does not form in a stellar disk; this remains true even when gas dominates the inner disk potential. For a dominant baryon disk ($f_{\rm disk} \gtrsim 0.5$) at all gas fractions, the turbulent gas forms a strong "radial shear flow" that leads to an intermittent star-forming bar within about 500 Myr; turbulent gas speeds up the formation of bars compared to gas-free models. For $f_{\rm gas} \lesssim 60\%$, all bars survive, but for higher gas fractions, the bar devolves into a central bulge after 1 Gyr. The star-forming bars are reminiscent of recent discoveries in high-redshift ALMA observations of gaseous disks.</description>

      <title>A$^3$COSMOS and A$^3$GOODSS: Continuum Source Catalogues and Multi-band Number Counts</title>

Abstract: Galaxy submillimetre number counts are a fundamental measurement in our understanding of galaxy evolution models. Most early measurements are obtained via single-dish telescopes with substantial source confusion, whereas recent interferometric observations are limited to small areas. We used a large database of ALMA continuum observations to accurately measure galaxy number counts in multiple (sub)millimetre bands, thus bridging the flux density range between single-dish surveys and deep interferometric studies. We continued the Automated Mining of the ALMA Archive in the COSMOS Field project (A$^3$COSMOS) and extended it with observations from the GOODS-South field (A$^3$GOODSS). The database consists of ~4,000 pipeline-processed continuum images from the public ALMA archive, yielding 2,050 unique detected sources. To infer galaxy number counts, we constructed a method to reduce the observational bias inherent to targeted pointings that dominate the database. This method comprises a combination of image selection, masking, and source weighting. The effective area was calculated by accounting for inhomogeneous wavelengths, sensitivities, and resolutions and for spatial overlap between images. We tested and calibrated our method with simulations. We derived the number counts in a consistent and homogeneous way in four different ALMA bands covering a relatively large area. The results are consistent with number counts from the literature within the uncertainties. In Band 7, at the depth of the inferred number counts, ~40% of the cosmic infrared background is resolved into discrete sources. This fraction, however, decreases with wavelength, reaching ~4% in Band 3. Finally, we used the number counts to test models of dusty galaxy evolution, and find a good agreement within the uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Triaxial Schwarzschild Models of NGC 708: a 10-billion solar mass black hole in a low dispersion galaxy with a Kroupa IMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a $(1.0 \pm 0.28) \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ Supermassive Black Hole (BH) at the centre of NGC 708, the Brightest Cluster Galaxy of Abell 262. Such high BH masses are very rare and allow to investigate BH - host galaxy scaling relations at the high mass end, which in turn provide hints about the (co)evolution of such systems. NGC~708 is found to be an outlier in all the canonical scaling relations except for those linking the BH mass to the core properties. The galaxy mass-to-light ratio points to a Kroupa IMF rather than Salpeter, with this finding confirmed using photometry in two different bands. We perform this analysis using our novel triaxial Schwarzschild code to integrate orbits in a 5-dimensional space, using a semi-parametric deprojected light density to build the potential and non-parametric Line-of-Sight Velocity Distributions (LOSVDs) derived from long-slit spectra recently acquired at Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) to exploit the full information in the kinematic. We find that the galaxy geometry changes as a function of the radius going from prolate, nearly spherical in the central regions to triaxial at large radii, highlighting the need to go beyond constant shape profiles. Our analysis is only the second of its kind and will systematically be used in the future to hunt Supermassive Black Holes in giant ellipticals.</description>

      <title>A broad linewidth, compact, millimeter-bright molecular emission line source near the Galactic Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A compact source, G0.02467-0.0727, was detected in ALMA \threemm observations in continuum and very broad line emission. The continuum emission has a spectral index $\alpha\approx3.3$, suggesting that the emission is from dust. The line emission is detected in several transitions of CS, SO, and SO$_2$ and exhibits a line width FWHM $\approx160$ \kms. The line profile appears Gaussian. The emission is weakly spatially resolved, coming from an area on the sky $\lesssim1"$ in diameter ($\lesssim10^4$ AU at the distance of the Galactic Center; GC). The centroid velocity is $v_{LSR}\approx40$-$50$ \kms, which is consistent with a location in the Galactic Center. With multiple SO lines detected, and assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions, $T_\mathrm{LTE} = 13$ K, which is colder than seen in typical GC clouds, though we cannot rule out low-density, subthermally excited, warmer gas. Despite the high velocity dispersion, no emission is observed from SiO, suggesting that there are no strong ($\gtrsim10~\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$) shocks in the molecular gas. There are no detections at other wavelengths, including X-ray, infrared, and radio.
  We consider several explanations for the Millimeter Ultra-Broad Line Object (MUBLO), including protostellar outflow, explosive outflow, collapsing cloud, evolved star, stellar merger, high-velocity compact cloud, intermediate mass black hole, and background galaxy. Most of these conceptual models are either inconsistent with the data or do not fully explain it. The MUBLO is, at present, an observationally unique object.</description>

      <title>Kinematics and metallicity of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Andromeda XVIII</title>

Abstract: Andromeda XVIII is an isolated dwarf galaxy 579 kpc away from the nearest large galaxy, M31. It is a candidate ``backsplash galaxy'' that might have been affected by a close passage to M31. We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of Andromeda XVIII to assess the likelihood that it is a backsplash galaxy. We estimated the velocities, metallicities ([Fe/H]), and $\alpha$-enhancements ([$\alpha$/Fe]) for 56 probable members. We estimated Andromeda XVIII's mean heliocentric velocity, rotation velocity, position angle of the rotation axis, and velocity dispersion using maximum likelihood coupled with a Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC). There is no evidence for bulk rotation, though sub-populations might be rotating. The mean heliocentric velocity is -337.2 km s$^{-1}$. The line-of-sight velocity relative to M31 is -36 km s$^{-1}$ (approaching), which is lower than the escape velocity from M31. Based on the abundances of 38 stars with low errors ($\delta [Fe/H] &lt; 0.3$) compared to a total of 56 probable members, parameters for the simplest chemical evolution models were estimated using maximum likelihood coupled with an MCMC. The metallicity distribution is inconsistent with these models due to a sharp metal-rich cut-off. Together, the metallicity distribution and the mean velocity are consistent with a sudden interruption of star formation. One possible cause for this quenching may be rapid gas loss due to ram pressure stripping during a close passage by M31 in the past. We also consider a past major merger as another possible cause.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic outflows have a multiphase nature making them challenging to model analytically. Many previous studies have tried to produce models that come closer to reality. In this work, we continue these efforts and describe the interaction of the hot wind fluid with multiple cold cloud populations, with their number density determined by different probability density functions. To do so, we introduced realistic cloud-wind interaction source terms and a time-varying cooling area. We find that the model reproduces well results from small-scale hydrodynamic simulations, but exhibits a general destructive behavior both for a single cloud population as well as multiple ones. We show that including multiple cloud populations can alter the evolution of the wind drastically. We also compare our model to observations and show that the differential acceleration of multiple clouds can lead to a non-negligible velocity `dispersion' relevant for down-the-barrel studies. Furthermore, we compute the emitted cooling surface brightness and find it generally too faint to explain observed Lyman-$\alpha$ halos.</description>

      <title>Broadband non-thermal emission of odd radio circles induced by explosive galactic outflow remnants and their evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Odd radio circles (ORCs) are mysterious rings of faint, diffuse emission recently discovered in radio surveys, some of which may be associated with galaxies in relatively dense environments. We propose such ORCs to be synchrotron emission from remnants of explosive galactic outflows, calling them OGREs, and discuss their broadband non-thermal emission and evolution. We posit that a large amount of energy was ejected from the central galaxy in the past, creating an outgoing shock that accelerates cosmic rays. Assuming plausible values for the density, temperature and magnetic field of the ambient medium, consistency with the observed spectral index, size and power of the ORCs requires the energy to be as high as ~10^60 erg, suggesting that their sources could be active galactic nuclei. We calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the OGREs and their evolution, including synchrotron, inverse Compton (IC) and bremsstrahlung emission from electrons, and pion-decay emission from protons. We find that the SEDs of the younger OGREs are not greatly different from those of older ones currently observable as ORCs if radiative cooling of electrons is effective. As such younger OGREs are expected to be rarer and smaller, they may not be readily observable. However, if radiative cooling of electrons is ineffective, younger OGREs may be detectable in X-rays.</description>

      <title>Boron Abundances in Early B Dwarfs of the Galactic Open Cluster NGC 3293</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New boron abundances or upper limits have been determined for 8 early-B stars in the young Galactic open cluster NGC 3293, using ultraviolet spectra obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. With previous observations, there are now 18 early-B stars in this cluster with boron measurements. Six of the newly observed stars have projected rotational velocities greater than 200 km/s, allowing new constraints on rotationally driven mixing in main-sequence stars. When comparing to synthetic model populations, we find that the majority of our sample stars agree well with the predicted trends of stronger boron depletion for larger rotation and for larger mass or luminosity. Based on those, a smaller than the canonical rotational mixing efficiency,(fc = 0.0165 vs the more standard value of 0.033), appears to be required. However, our five most slowly rotating stars are not well explained by rotational mixing, and we speculate that they originate from binary mergers.</description>

      <title>On Binary Formation from Three Initially Unbound Bodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore three-body binary formation (3BBF), the formation of a bound system via gravitational scattering of three initially unbound bodies (3UB), using direct numerical integrations. For the first time, we consider systems with unequal masses, as well as finite-size and post-Newtonian effects. Our analytically derived encounter rates and numerical scattering results reproduce the 3BBF rate predicted by Goodman \&amp; Hut (1993) for hard binaries in dense star clusters. We find that 3BBF occurs overwhelmingly through nonresonant encounters and that the two most massive bodies are never the most likely to bind. Instead, 3BBF favors pairing the two least massive bodies (for wide binaries) or the most plus least massive bodies (for hard binaries). 3BBF overwhelmingly favors wide binary formation with super-thermal eccentricities, perhaps helping to explain the eccentric wide binaries observed by Gaia. Hard binary formation is far rarer, but with a thermal eccentricity distribution. The semimajor axis distribution scales cumulatively as $a^3$ for hard and slightly wider binaries. Though mergers are rare between black holes when including relativistic effects, direct collisions occur frequently between main-sequence stars -- more often than hard 3BBF. Yet, these collisions do not significantly suppress hard 3BBF at the low velocity dispersions typical of open or globular clusters. Energy dissipation through gravitational radiation leads to a small probability of a bound, hierarchical triple system forming directly from 3UB.</description>
