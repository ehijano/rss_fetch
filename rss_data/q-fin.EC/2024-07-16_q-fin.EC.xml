      <title>Using Artificial Intelligence to Unlock Crowdfunding Success for Small Businesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While small businesses are increasingly turning to online crowdfunding platforms for essential funding, over 40% of these campaigns may fail to raise any money, especially those from low socio-economic areas. We utilize the latest advancements in AI technology to identify crucial factors that influence the success of crowdfunding campaigns and to improve their fundraising outcomes by strategically optimizing these factors. Our best-performing machine learning model accurately predicts the fundraising outcomes of 81.0% of campaigns, primarily based on their textual descriptions. Interpreting the machine learning model allows us to provide actionable suggestions on improving the textual description before launching a campaign. We demonstrate that by augmenting just three aspects of the narrative using a large language model, a campaign becomes more preferable to 83% human evaluators, and its likelihood of securing financial support increases by 11.9%. Our research uncovers the effective strategies for crafting descriptions for small business fundraising campaigns and opens up a new realm in integrating large language models into crowdfunding methodologies.</description>

      <title>Cultural Transmission, Technology, and Treatment of the Elderly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the interrelationship between the treatment of the elderly, the nature of production, and the transmission of culture. Respect for the elderly is endogenous. Parents cultivate an interest in consuming culture in their children; when they are older, children compensate their elders proportional to the degree to which their interests were previously cultivated. We show that this model is functionally equivalent to one in which cultural goods are transferred across generations. We focus on the relative well-being of the elderly and use the model to explain patterns in their relative well-being across societies. An important theme is that the cultivation of culture and norms for the respect and support of the elderly bear a nonlinear relationship with many economic variables, such as capital and or land intensity in production. We also discuss the interaction of property rights with production, assets such as productive resources, and relative treatment of the elderly. Insecurity of some types of property rights, such as rights over output, may benefit the elderly, while secure rights over productive resources may also benefit the elderly. We discuss how the elderly could be affected by demographic, technological and policy changes in both developing and developed economies.</description>

      <title>Population Concentration in High-Complexity Regions within City during the heat wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the 2018 summer heat wave on urban mobility in Seoul and the role of economic complexity in the region's resilience. Findings from subway and mobile phone data indicate a significant decrease in the floating population during extreme heat wave, underscoring the thermal vulnerability of urban areas. However, urban regions with higher complexity demonstrate resilience, attracting more visitors despite high temperatures. Our results suggest the centrality of economic complexity in urban resilience against climate-induced stressors. Additionally, it implies that high-complexity small businesses' clusters can serve as focal points for sustaining urban vitality in the face of thermal shocks within city. In the long run perspective, our results imply the possibility that people are more concentrated in high complexity region in the era of global warming.</description>

      <title>Monopoly Unveiled: Telecom Breakups in the US and Mexico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper posits the decline in market capitalization following a monopoly breakup serves as a means to gauge how financial markets assess market power. Our research, which employs univariate structural time series models to estimate the firm's value without the breakup and juxtapose it with actual post-divestiture values, reveals a staggering drop in AT&amp;T's value by 65% and AMX's by 32% from their pre-breakup levels. These findings underscore the contemporary valuation of monopoly rents as perceived by financial markets, highlighting the significant impact of monopoly breakup on market capitalization and the need for a deeper understanding of these dynamics.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Effect of Toxicity on Player Engagement and its Propagation in Competitive Online Video Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article seeks to provide accurate estimates of the causal effect of exposure to toxic language on player engagement and the proliferation of toxic language. To this end, we analyze proprietary data from the first-person action video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, published by Activision. To overcome causal identification problems, we implement an instrumental variables estimation strategy. Our findings confirm that exposure to toxic language significantly affects player engagement and the probability that players use similar language. Accordingly, video game publishers have a vested interest in addressing toxic language. Further, we demonstrate that this effect varies significantly depending on whether toxic language originates from opponents or teammates, whether it originates from teammates in the same party or a different party, and the match's outcome. This has meaningful implications regarding how resources for addressing toxicity should be allocated.</description>

      <title>Strategic Integration of Artificial Intelligence in the C-Suite: The Role of the Chief AI Officer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into corporate strategy has become a pivotal focus for organizations aiming to maintain a competitive advantage in the digital age. As AI reshapes business operations and drives innovation, the need for specialized leadership to effectively manage these changes becomes increasingly apparent. In this paper, I explore the role of the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) within the C-suite, emphasizing the necessity of this position for successful AI strategy, integration, and governance. I analyze future scenarios based on current trends in three key areas: the AI Economy, AI Organization, and Competition in the Age of AI. These explorations lay the foundation for identifying the antecedents (environmental, structural, and strategic factors) that justify the inclusion of a CAIO in top management teams. This sets the stage for a comprehensive examination of the CAIO's role and the broader implications of AI leadership. This paper advances the discussion on AI leadership by providing a rationale for the strategic integration of AI at the executive level and examining the role of the Chief AI Officer within organizations.</description>

      <title>The Self-Organized Criticality Paradigm in Economics &amp; Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ``Self-Organised Criticality'' (SOC) is the mechanism by which complex systems spontaneously settle close to a *critical point*, at the edge between stability and chaos, and characterized by fat-tailed fluctuations and long-memory correlations. Such a scenario may explain why insignificant perturbations can generate large disruptions, through the propagation of ``avalanches'' across the system. In this short review, we discuss how SOC could offer a plausible solution to the excess volatility puzzle in financial markets and the analogue ``small shocks, large business cycle puzzle'' for the economy at large, as initially surmised by Per Bak et al. in 1993. We argue that in general the quest for efficiency and the necessity of *resilience* may be mutually incompatible and require specific policy considerations.</description>

      <title>Explosive growth from AI automation: A review of the arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine whether substantial AI automation could accelerate global economic growth by about an order of magnitude, akin to the economic growth effects of the Industrial Revolution. We identify three primary drivers for such growth: 1) the scalability of an AI "labor force" restoring a regime of increasing returns to scale, 2) the rapid expansion of an AI labor force, and 3) a massive increase in output from rapid automation occurring over a brief period of time. Against this backdrop, we evaluate nine counterarguments, including regulatory hurdles, production bottlenecks, alignment issues, and the pace of automation. We tentatively assess these arguments, finding most are unlikely deciders. We conclude that explosive growth seems plausible with AI capable of broadly substituting for human labor, but high confidence in this claim seems currently unwarranted. Key questions remain about the intensity of regulatory responses to AI, physical bottlenecks in production, the economic value of superhuman abilities, and the rate at which AI automation could occur.</description>

      <title>The Role of Gender, Birth Order, and Ability in Intra-household Educational Inequality: Evidence from Benin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores how gender, birth order, and innate ability affect educational disparities among children within households. Using both a reduced-form approach and a structural model of household educational resource allocation, it identifies the contributions of gender and birth order to intra-household educational inequality. In Benin, significant disparities are found in households with non-educated heads and mixed-gender children, with 70% of the inequality attributed to gender and birth order. In contrast, households led by college-educated heads show 24% gender effects and 9% birth order effects. Additionally, college-educated parents exhibit less overall educational inequality among their children. Policy counterfactuals assess the impact of (1) education vouchers, (2) compulsory education, and (3) targeted educational cost reduction for non-educated parents. All three policies reduced the effects of gender and birth order on inequality. Compulsory education reduced overall average inequality, while targeted educational cost reduction completely eliminated gender and birth order effects. This research underscores the complex factors driving intra-household educational inequalities and suggests effective policy measures.</description>
