      <title>Imposing Rules in Process Discovery: an Inductive Mining Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process discovery aims to discover descriptive process models from event logs. These discovered process models depict the actual execution of a process and serve as a foundational element for conformance checking, performance analyses, and many other applications. While most of the current process discovery algorithms primarily rely on a single event log for model discovery, additional sources of information, such as process documentation and domain experts' knowledge, remain untapped. This valuable information is often overlooked in traditional process discovery approaches. In this paper, we propose a discovery technique incorporating such knowledge in a novel inductive mining approach. This method takes a set of user-defined or discovered rules as input and utilizes them to discover enhanced process models. Our proposed framework has been implemented and tested using several publicly available real-life event logs. Furthermore, to showcase the framework's effectiveness in a practical setting, we conducted a case study in collaboration with UWV, the Dutch employee insurance agency.</description>

      <title>Configuration Monitor Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observable behavior of a system usually carries useful information about its internal state, properties, and potential future behaviors. In this paper, we introduce configuration monitoring to determine an unknown configuration of a running system based on observations of its behavior. We develop a modular and generic pipeline to synthesize automata-theoretic configuration monitors from a featured transition system model of the configurable system to be monitored. The pipeline further allows synthesis under partial observability and network-induced losses as well as predictive configuration monitors taking the potential future behavior of a system into account. Beyond the novel application of configuration monitoring, we show that our approach also generalizes and unifies existing work on runtime monitoring and fault diagnosis, which aim at detecting the satisfaction or violation of properties and the occurrence of faults, respectively. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with a case study on configuration monitors synthesized from configurable systems community benchmarks.</description>

      <title>iCPS-DL: A Description Language for Autonomic Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern industrial systems require frequent updates to their cyber and physical infrastructures, which often demand considerable reconfiguration effort. This paper introduces a framework to automate this process, implemented as the industrial Cyber-Physical Systems Description Language, iCPSDL. This framework maps an industrial process as a knowledge graph, which includes information about physical and cyber-physical components, a state estimation model, and software component interaction. A novel aspect is the use of communication semantics to ensure correct interaction among distributed entities. Reasoning on the knowledge graph facilitates the configuration of cyber-physical elements in an industrial system. A case study in the Water Distribution Networks domain demonstrates the framework's application.</description>

      <title>Temporal Ensemble Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Temporal Ensemble Logic (TEL), a monadic, first-order modal logic for linear-time temporal reasoning. TEL includes primitive temporal constructs such as ``always up to $t$ time later'' ($\Box_t$), ``sometimes before $t$ time in the future'' ($\Diamond_t$), and ``$t$-time later'' $\varphi_t$. TEL has been motivated from the requirement for rigor and reproducibility for cohort specification and discovery in clinical and population health research, to fill a gap in formalizing temporal reasoning in biomedicine. Existing logical frameworks such as linear temporal logic are too restrictive to express temporal and sequential properties in biomedicine, or too permissive in semantic constructs, such as in Halpern-Shoham logic, to serve this purpose. In this paper, we first introduce TEL in a general set up, with discrete and dense time as special cases. We then focus on the theoretical development of discrete TEL on the temporal domain of positive integers $\mathbb{N}^+$, denoted as ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$. ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$ is strictly more expressive than the standard monadic second order logic, characterized by B\"{u}chi automata. We present its formal semantics, a proof system, and provide a proof for the undecidability of the satisfiability of ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$. We also include initial results on expressiveness and decidability fragments for ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$, followed by application outlook and discussions.</description>

      <title>A Connection Between Unbordered Partial Words and Sparse Rulers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\textit{Partial words}$ are words that contain, in addition to letters, special symbols $\diamondsuit$ called $\textit{holes}$. Two partial words of $a=a_0 \dots a_n$ and $b=b_0 \dots b_n$ are $\textit{compatible}$ if for all $i$, $a_i = b_i$ or at least one of $a_i, b_i$ is a hole. A partial word is $\textit{unbordered}$ if it does not have a nonempty proper prefix and a suffix that are compatible. Otherwise the partial word is $\textit{bordered}$.
  A set $R \subseteq \{0, \dots, n\}$ is called a $\textit{complete sparse ruler of length $n$}$ if for all $k \in \{0, \dots, n\}$ there exists $r, s \in R$ such that $k = r - s$. These are also known as $\textit{restricted difference bases}$.
  From the definitions it follows that the more holes a partial word has, the more likely it is to be bordered. By introducing a connection between unbordered partial words and sparse rulers, we improve bounds on the maximum number of holes an unbordered partial word can have over alphabets of sizes $4$ or greater. We also provide a counterexample for a previously reported theorem.
  We then study a two-dimensional generalization of these results. We adapt methods from one-dimensional case to solve the correct asymptotic for the number of holes an unbordered two-dimensional binary partial word can have. This generalization might invoke further research questions.</description>
