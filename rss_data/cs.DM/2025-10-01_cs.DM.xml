      <title>Well-Quasi-Ordering Eulerian Digraphs Embeddable in Surfaces by Strong Immersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every surface $\Sigma$, the class of Eulerian directed graphs that are Eulerian embeddable into $\Sigma$ (in particular they have degree at most $4$) is well-quasi-ordered by strong immersion. This result marks one of the most versatile directed graph classes (besides tournaments) for which we are aware of a positive well-quasi-ordering result regarding a well-studied graph relation.
  Our result implies that the class of bipartite circle graphs is well-quasi-ordered under the pivot-minor relation. Furthermore, this also yields two other interesting applications, namely, a polynomial-time algorithm for testing immersion closed properties of Eulerian-embeddable graphs into a fixed surface, and a characterisation of the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for Eulerian digraphs of maximum degree four.
  Further, in order to prove the mentioned result, we prove that Eulerian digraphs of carving width bounded by some constant $k$ (which correspond to Eulerian digraphs with bounded treewidth and additionally bounded degree) are well-quasi-ordered by strong immersion. We actually prove a stronger result where we allow for vertices of the Eulerian digraphs to be labeled by elements of some well-quasi-order $\Omega$. We complement these results with a proof that the class of Eulerian planar digraphs of treewidth at most $3$ is not well-quasi-ordered by strong immersion, noting that any antichain of bounded treewidth cannot have bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Balanced Fibonacci word rectangles, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following a recent paper of Anselmo et al., we consider $m \times n$ rectangular matrices formed from the Fibonacci word, and we show that their balance properties can be solved with a finite automaton. We also generalize the result to every Sturmian characteristic word corresponding to a quadratic irrational.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12153v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a proof of the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA) for classes of finite $n$-partite tournaments for $n \in \{2,3,\ldots,\omega\}$, and for the class of finite semigeneric tournaments. We also prove that the generic $\omega$-partite tournament and the generic semigeneric tournament have ample generics.</description>

      <title>Sparsest cut and eigenvalue multiplicities on low degree Abelian Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether or not the Sparsest Cut problem admits an efficient $O(1)$-approximation algorithm is a fundamental algorithmic question with connections to geometry and the Unique Games Conjecture. Revisiting spectral algorithms for Sparsest Cut, we present a novel, simple algorithm that combines eigenspace enumeration with a new algorithm for the Cut Improvement problem. The runtime of our algorithm is parametrized by a quantity that we call the solution dimension $\text{SD}_\varepsilon(G)$: the smallest $k$ such that the subspace spanned by the first $k$ Laplacian eigenvectors contains all but $\varepsilon$ fraction of a sparsest cut. Our algorithm matches the guarantees of prior methods based on the threshold-rank paradigm, while also extending beyond them. To illustrate this, we study its performance on low degree Cayley graphs over Abelian groups -- canonical examples of graphs with poor expansion properties. We prove that low degree Abelian Cayley graphs have small solution dimension, yielding an algorithm that computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation to the uniform Sparsest Cut of a degree-$d$ Cayley graph over an Abelian group of size $n$ in time $n^{O(1)}\cdot\exp(d/\varepsilon)^{O(d)}$. Along the way to bounding the solution dimension of Abelian Cayley graphs, we analyze their sparse cuts and spectra, proving that the collection of $O(1)$-approximate sparsest cuts has an $\varepsilon$-net of size $\exp(d/\varepsilon)^{O(d)}$ and that the multiplicity of $\lambda_2$ is bounded by $2^{O(d)}$. The latter bound is tight and improves on a previous bound of $2^{O(d^2)}$ by Lee and Makarychev.</description>

      <title>Searching in trees with $k$-up-modular cost functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the following generalization of the classic binary search problem: a searcher is required to find a hidden vertex $x$ in a tree $T$. To do so, they iteratively perform queries to an oracle, each about a chosen vertex $v$. After each such call, the oracle responds whether the target was found and if not, the searcher receives as a reply the connected component of $T-v$ which contains $x$. Additionally, each vertex $v$ may have a different query cost $c(v)$. The goal is to find the optimal querying strategy which minimizes the worst case cost required to find $x$. The problem is known to be NP-hard even in restricted classes of trees such as bounded diameter spiders [Cicalese et al. 2016], and no constant factor approximation algorithm is known for general trees. Following the recent studies of [Dereniowski et al. 2022, Dereniowski et al. 2024], instead of restricted classes of trees, we explore restrictions on the cost function. We generalize the notion of up-monotonic functions and introduce the concept of \textit{$k$-up-modularity}. We show that an $O(\log\log n)$-approximate solution can be found within $k^{O(\log k)}\cdot\text{poly}(n)$ time.</description>

      <title>Feature-aware Hypergraph Generation via Next-Scale Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph generative models have shown strong results in molecular design but struggle to scale to large, complex structures. While hierarchical methods improve scalability, they usually ignore node and edge features, which are critical in real-world applications. This issue is amplified in hypergraphs, where hyperedges capture higher-order relationships among multiple nodes. Despite their importance in domains such as 3D geometry, molecular systems, and circuit design, existing generative models rarely support both hypergraphs and feature generation at scale. In this paper, we introduce FAHNES (feature-aware hypergraph generation via next-scale prediction), a hierarchical framework that jointly generates hypergraph topology and features. FAHNES builds multi-scale representations through node coarsening and refines them via localized expansion, guided by a novel node budget mechanism that controls granularity and ensures consistency across scales. Experiments on synthetic, 3D mesh and graph point cloud datasets show that FAHNES achieves state-of-the-art performance in jointly generating features and structure, advancing scalable hypergraph and graph generation.</description>

      <title>Model Discovery and Graph Simulation: A Lightweight Gateway to Chaos Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaos engineering reveals resilience risks but is expensive and operationally risky to run broadly and often. Model-based analyses can estimate dependability, yet in practice they are tricky to build and keep current because models are typically handcrafted. We claim that a simple connectivity-only topological model - just the service-dependency graph plus replica counts - can provide fast, low-risk availability estimates under fail-stop faults. To make this claim practical without hand-built models, we introduce model discovery: an automated step that can run in CI/CD or as an observability-platform capability, synthesizing an explicit, analyzable model from artifacts teams already have (e.g., distributed traces, service-mesh telemetry, configs/manifests) - providing an accessible gateway for teams to begin resilience testing. As a proof by instance on the DeathStarBench Social Network, we extract the dependency graph from Jaeger and estimate availability across two deployment modes and five failure rates. The discovered model closely tracks live fault-injection results; with replication, median error at mid-range failure rates is near zero, while no-replication shows signed biases consistent with excluded mechanisms. These results create two opportunities: first, to triage and reduce the scope of expensive chaos experiments in advance, and second, to generate real-time signals on the system's resilience posture as its topology evolves, preserving live validation for the most critical or ambiguous scenarios.</description>

      <title>Discrepancy Beyond Additive Functions with Applications to Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a setting where we have a ground set $M$ together with real-valued set functions $f_1, \dots, f_n$, and the goal is to partition $M$ into two sets $S_1,S_2$ such that $|f_i(S_1) - f_i(S_2)|$ is small for every $i$. Many results in discrepancy theory can be stated in this form with the functions $f_i$ being additive. In this work, we initiate the study of the unstructured case where $f_i$ is not assumed to be additive. We show that even without the additivity assumption, the upper bound remains at most $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$.
  Our result has implications on the fair allocation of indivisible goods. In particular, we show that a consensus halving up to $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$ goods always exists for $n$ agents with monotone utilities. Previously, only an $O(n)$ bound was known for this setting.</description>
