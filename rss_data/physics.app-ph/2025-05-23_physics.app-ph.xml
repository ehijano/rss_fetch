      <title>Triple V-shaped type-II quantum wells for long wavelength interband cascade lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate triple V-shaped type-II quantum wells designed to emit at 6-9 {\mu}m wavelength range, consisting of three InAs(Sb) electron quantum wells and two Ga0.6In0.4Sb hole quantum wells. The wells' composition and thicknesses are optimized in terms of wavefunction overlap and valence intersubband absorption (VISA) by using kp calculation. The triple V-shaped type-II quantum well designed for emission at 6.2 {\mu}m, 7.5 {\mu}m and 9.0 {\mu}m, show 18.8 %, 18.9 % and 19.2 % higher wavefunction overlap respectively, compared to the corresponding W-shaped designs of InAs/Ga0.6In0.4Sb/InAs wells commonly employed in active regions of interband cascade lasers. In addition, the calculated VISA in V-shaped quantum wells for the designed wavelength is significantly smaller than in W-shaped wells. These enhancements might extend the wavelength limit of room temperature emission of GaSb-based interband cascade lasers.</description>

      <title>Novel active avalanche paradigm for power semiconductor device extending extending SOA to 6.5kV/15kA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of renewable energy being integrated, transmitted, and utilized in various forms, power systems are evolving from traditional metal-based infrastructures to advanced semiconductor-based technologies. Central to this transformation, power semiconductor devices now face the crucial demands of ultrahigh switching ability, presenting a long-standing challenge in the field. In this work, building on the P-N-P-N scheme, we propose a novel Avalanche Controlled Thyristor (ACT) device, which pivots an active avalanche paradigm to realize robust and strong switch-off ability through semiconductor-level electrical potential manipulation. Unprecedentedly, we achieve a controllable switch-off current record of 15kA, 375% that of the conventional devices without sacrificing the blocking and conduction capability. The novel device signifies that switching ability is no longer a bottleneck for power semiconductor devices, which is believed to revolutionarily reshape the technical and practical landscape of power conversion, and fundamentally boost the large-scale integration, cross-regional transmission, and cost-effective utilization of renewable energy.</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc -- A toy model exhibiting the geometric phase --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a simple kinematic model, which is a rotating disc on the edge of another fixed disc without slipping, and study the rotation angle of the rotating disc. The rotation angle consists of two parts, the dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and the geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The former is a dynamical rotation of the disc itself, and the geometric motion of the disc characterizes the latter. In fact, $\Delta_g$ is regarded as the geometric phase appearing in several important contexts in physics. The clue to finding the explicit form of $\Delta_g$ is the Baumkuchen lemma, which we called. Due to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, in the case that the rotating disc comes back to the initial position, $\Delta_g$ is interpreted as the signed area of a two-sphere enclosed by the trajectory of the Gauss vector, which is a unit normal vector on the moving disc. We also comment on typical models sharing the common underlying structure, which include Foucault's pendulum, Dirac's monopole potentials, and Berry phase. Hence, our model is a very simple but distinguished one in the sense that it embodies the essential concepts in differential geometry and theoretical physics such as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the geometric phase, and the fiber bundles.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Control via Dynamic Complex Pole-Zero Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise optical phase control is crucial for innovations in telecommunications, optical computing, quantum information processing, and advanced sensing. However, conventional phase modulators often introduce parasitic amplitude modulation and struggle to provide a full 2{\pi} phase shift efficiently. This work introduces a novel paradigm for complete and robust phase control at constant amplitude by dynamically engineering the pole-zero constellation of resonant photonic systems within the complex frequency plane. We theoretically elucidate and validate two distinct approaches: first, by modulating the complex frequency of an excitation signal to trace an iso-amplitude contour (apollonian circle) around a static reflection zero; and second, by dynamically tuning the physical parameters of the resonator such that its reflection zero encircles a fixed-frequency monochromatic excitation, again constraining operation to an iso-amplitude trajectory. Both methods demonstrate the ability to impart a full 2{\pi} phase shift while maintaining a pre-defined, constant reflection amplitude, thereby eliminating amplitude-to-phase distortion. These results leverage the topological nature of phase accumulation around critical points (poles and zeros), a concept gaining significant traction in non-Hermitian and topological photonics.</description>

      <title>Ultralow loss torsion micropendula for chipscale gravimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a new class of chipscale torsion pendula formed by Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoribbon suspensions. Owing to their unique hierarchy of gravitational, tensile, and elastic stiffness, the devices exhibit damping rates of $\sim 10\;\mu$Hz and parametric gravity sensitivities near that of an ideal pendulum. The suspension nonlinearity can also be used to cancel the pendulum nonlinearity, paving the way towards fully isochronous, high $Q$ pendulum gravimeters. As a demonstration, we study a 0.1 mg, 32 Hz micropendulum with a damping rate of $16\;\mu$Hz, a thermal acceleration sensitivity of $2\;\text{n}g/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, and a parametric gravity sensitivity of $5$ Hz/$g_0$. We record Allan deviations as low as 2.5 $\mu$Hz at 100 seconds, corresponding to a bias stability of $5\times 10^{-7}g_0$. We also demonstrate a 100-fold cancellation of the pendulum nonlinearity. In addition to inertial sensing, our devices are well suited to proposed searches for new physics exploiting low-loss micro- to milligram-scale mechanical oscillators.</description>

      <title>Electrical and Structural Properties of In-Situ MOCVD Grown Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the electrical and structural properties of MOSCAPs with in-situ MOCVD-grown Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics on (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films. The Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs showed a strong dependence on Al$_2$O$_3$ deposition temperature. At 900$^\circ$C, reduced voltage hysteresis ($\sim$0.3 V) and improved reverse breakdown voltage (74.5 V) were observed, with breakdown fields of 5.01 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$ and 4.11 MV/cm in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. At 650$^\circ$C, higher hysteresis ($\sim$3.44 V) and lower reverse breakdown voltage (38.8 V) were observed, with breakdown fields of 3.69 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$ and 2.87 MV/cm in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. However, forward breakdown fields improved from 5.62 MV/cm (900$^\circ$C) to 7.25 MV/cm (650$^\circ$C). STEM revealed improved crystallinity and sharper interfaces at 900$^\circ$C, enhancing reverse breakdown performance. For Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs, increasing Al composition ($x$ = 5.5\% to 9.2\%) reduced carrier concentration and improved reverse breakdown fields from 2.55 to 2.90 MV/cm in $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ and 2.41 to 3.13 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$. Forward breakdown fields in Al$_2$O$_3$ improved from 5.0 to 5.4 MV/cm as Al composition increased. STEM confirmed compositional homogeneity and excellent stoichiometry of Al$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ layers. These findings highlight the robust electrical performance, high breakdown fields, and structural quality of Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs for high-power applications.</description>

      <title>Topology Design of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Based on Current Distribution and Otsu Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Miniaturization of reconffgurable intelligent surface RIS) elements is a crucial trend in the development of RISs. It not only facilitates the attainment of multifunctional integration but also promotes seamless amalgamation with other elements. The current on the RIS element plays a crucial role in determining the characteristics of the induced electromagnetic ffeld components. Segments with high current intensity determine the performance of RIS elements. Carving the parts with strong current distribution density into the metal patch of RIS element structure can achieve miniaturization. Based on this insight, this work proposes a topology design method that leverages current distribution and image processing techniques to achieve efffcient miniaturization of the RIS elements. In this proposed method, we ffrst obtain the current distribution across different operational states and the period of the working frequency. Next, we employ the Otsu image segmentation method to extract relevant image information from the current distribution images of the RIS elements. Subsequently, we utilize linear mapping techniques to convert this image information into the structure of RIS elements. Then, based on the structure of the RIS elements, the Quasi-Newton optimization algorithm is utilized to obtain the parameters of the tunable device that correspond to various operational states. As a result, we successfully construct the structural topology of the RIS elements based on their current distribution, designing areas with strong current distribution as metal patches. To validate the performance of the proposed method, a 16 by 16 3-bit RIS was developed, fabricated and measured. Compared with existing RIS designs, the proportion of the top-layer metal patches is smaller, which provides the possibility for integrating other functions and devices.</description>

      <title>An Electrically Injected and Solid State Surface Acoustic Wave Phonon Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) enable a wide array of technologies including RF filters, chemical and biological sensors, acousto-optic devices, acoustic control of microfluidic flow in lab-on-a-chip systems, and quantum phononics. While numerous methods exist for generating SAWs, they each have intrinsic limitations that inhibit performance, operation at high frequencies, and use in systems constrained in size, weight, and power. Here, for the first time, we present a completely solid-state, single-chip SAW phonon laser that is comprised of a lithium niobate SAW resonator with an internal, DC electrically injected and broadband semiconductor gain medium with $&lt;$0.15 mm$^2$ footprint. Below the threshold bias of 36 V, the device behaves as a resonant amplifier, and above it exhibits self-sustained coherent oscillation, linewidth narrowing, and high output powers. A continuous on-chip acoustic output power of up to -6.1 dBm is generated at 1 GHz with a resolution-limited linewidth of $&lt;$77 Hz and a carrier phase noise of -57 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset. Through detailed modeling, we show pathways for improving these devices' performance including mHz linewidths, sub -100 dBc/Hz phase noise at 1 kHz, high power efficiency, footprints less than 550 um$^2$ at 10 GHz, and SAW generation approaching the hundreds of GHz regime. This demonstration provides a fundamentally new approach to SAW generation, paving the way toward ultra-high-frequency SAW sources on a chip and highly miniaturized and efficient SAW-based systems that can be operated without an external RF source.</description>

      <title>CMOS-fabricated ultraviolet light modulators using low-loss alumina piezo-optomechanical photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-violet (UV) and near-UV wavelengths are necessary for many important optical transitions for quantum technologies and various sensing mechanisms for biological and chemical detection. However, all well-known photonic platforms have excessively high losses in the UV, which has prevented photonic integrated circuits (PICs) being used to address these and other important application spaces. Photonic waveguides using low-loss alumina cores have emerged as a promising solution because of almunia's large optical bandgap and the high quality of films enabled by atomic layer deposition. However, to the best of our knowledge, active alumina PICs have only been realized using thermo-optic tuning, which precludes switching speeds shorter than one microsecond, high circuit densities, and cryogenically compatible operation. Here, we introduce a CMOS-fabricated, piezo-optomechanical PIC platform using alumina waveguides with low optical losses at UV wavelengths and aluminum nitride piezoelectric strain actuators, which solves the issues associated with thermal tuning. We demonstrate a high-performance, reconfigurable optical filter operating at wavelengths as low as 320 nm. The filter has a 6 nanosecond switching time, a loaded linewidth of 3.3 GHz, tuning rate of -120 MHz/V, and a hold power less than 20 nW.</description>
