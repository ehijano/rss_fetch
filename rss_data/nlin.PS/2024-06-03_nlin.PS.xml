      <title>Physical interpretations of infinite symmetries and the establishment of unified hierarchies in supersymmetric, ren-symmetric, and classical integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to elucidate potential physical interpretations of infinitely many symmetries and conservation laws inherent in integrable systems constitutes a longstanding challenge within the scientific communities of physics and mathematics. This letter delves into this unresolved issue through an unconventional lens. For a integrable system, there exist various categories of n-wave solutions, such as the n-soliton, multiple breathers, complexitons, and the n-periodic wave solutions, wherein n denotes an arbitrary integer that can approach infinity. Each subwave comprising the n-wave solution may possess certain free parameters, including center parameters, width parameters, and periodic parameters. It is evident that these solutions are invariant with respect to all free parameters. We postulate that the entirety of the recognized infinitely many symmetries merely constitute linear combinations of these finite wave parameter translation symmetries. This conjecture appears to hold true for all integrable systems with n-wave solutions. By considering the KdV equation and the Burgers equation as exemplar cases, the conjecture is substantiated for the n-soliton solutions. It is unequivocal that any linear combination of the wave parameter translation symmetries retains its status as a symmetry associated with the particular solution. This observation suggests that by introducing a ren-variable and a ren-symmetric derivative which serve as generalizations of the Grassmann variable and the super derivatives, it may be feasible to unify classical integrable systems, supersymmetric integrable systems, and ren-symmetric integrable systems within a cohesive hierarchical framework. Notably, a ren-symmetric integrable Burgers hierarchy is explicitly derived. Both the supersymmetric and the classical integrable hierarchies are encompassed within the ren-symmetric integrable hierarchy.</description>

      <title>General fractals represented by $\mathcal{F}$-limit sets of compression maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.08634v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a simple and systematic way to represent general (inhomogeneous) fractals that may look different at different scales and places. By using set-valued compression maps, we express these general fractals as $\mathcal{F}$-limit sets, which are represented as sequences of points in a fixed parameterization space $M$. By choosing different types of sequences in $M$, we get various types of fractals: from self-simlilar to non self-similar, and from deterministic to random. The computational complexity of producing a general fractal is independent of the sequence in $M$, and as a result, is the same as that of an iterated function system obtained from a constant sequence. In the metric space setting, we also estimate the Hausdorff dimension of limit sets for collections of sets that do not necessarily satisfy the Moran structure conditions. In particular, we introduce the concept ``uniform covering condition" for the study of the lower bound of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set, and provide sufficient conditions for this condition. Specific examples (Cantor-like sets, Sierpi\'nski-like Triangles, etc.) with the calculations of their corresponding Hausdorff dimensions are also studied.</description>

      <title>Multiple possible patterns can emerge from virus-immune coevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adaptive immune system engages in an arms race with evolving viruses, trying to generate new responses to viral strains that continually move away from the set of variants that have already elicited a functional immune response. In previous work, it has been argued that this dynamical process can lead to a propagating pulse of ever-changing viral population and concomitant immune response. Here, we introduce a new stochastic model of viral-host coevolution and a deterministic approximation thereof with which to study these dynamics. We show that there is indeed a possible pulse solution, but for a large host population size, the pulse becomes unstable to the generation of new infections in its wake, leading to an extended endemic infection pattern. This time-dependent endemic pattern eventually reaches a fluctuating steady-state when the infected population size reaches a large enough fraction of the total number of hosts.</description>
