      <title>FuXi-RTM: A Physics-Guided Prediction Framework with Radiative Transfer Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to conventional video generation, current deep learning-based weather prediction frameworks often lack explicit physical constraints, leading to unphysical outputs that limit their reliability for operational forecasting. Among various physical processes requiring proper representation, radiation plays a fundamental role as it drives Earth's weather and climate systems. However, accurate simulation of radiative transfer processes remains challenging for traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models due to their inherent complexity and high computational costs. Here, we propose FuXi-RTM, a hybrid physics-guided deep learning framework designed to enhance weather forecast accuracy while enforcing physical consistency. FuXi-RTM integrates a primary forecasting model (FuXi) with a fixed deep learning-based radiative transfer model (DLRTM) surrogate that efficiently replaces conventional radiation parameterization schemes. This represents the first deep learning-based weather forecasting framework to explicitly incorporate physical process modeling. Evaluated over a comprehensive 5-year dataset, FuXi-RTM outperforms its unconstrained counterpart in 88.51% of 3320 variable and lead time combinations, with improvements in radiative flux predictions. By incorporating additional physical processes, FuXi-RTM paves the way for next-generation weather forecasting systems that are both accurate and physically consistent.</description>

      <title>A Dual-Core Model for ENSO Diversity: Unifying Model Hierarchies for Realistic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in climate modeling, simulating the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains challenging due to its spatiotemporal diversity and complexity. To address this, we build upon existing model hierarchies to develop a new unified modeling platform, which provides practical, scalable, and accurate tools for advancing ENSO research. Within this framework, we introduce a dual-core ENSO model (DCM) that integrates two widely used ENSO modeling approaches: a linear stochastic model confined to the equator and a nonlinear intermediate model extending off-equator. The stochastic model ensures computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. It captures essential ENSO characteristics and reproduces the observed non-Gaussian statistics. Meanwhile, the nonlinear model assimilates pseudo-observations from the stochastic model while resolving key air-sea interactions, such as feedback balances and spatial patterns of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) during El Ni\~no peaks and improving western-central Pacific SSTA magnitudes and spatial accuracy. The DCM effectively captures the realistic dynamical and statistical features of the ENSO diversity and complexity. Notably, the computational efficiency of the DCM facilitates a rapid generation of extended ENSO datasets, overcoming observational limitations. The outcome facilitates the analysis of long-term variations, advancing our understanding of ENSO and many other climate phenomena.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Seasonal Climate Predictions via Variational Inference and Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most operational climate services providers base their seasonal predictions on initialised general circulation models (GCMs) or statistical techniques that fit past observations. GCMs require substantial computational resources, which limits their capacity. In contrast, statistical methods often lack robustness due to short historical records. Recent works propose machine learning methods trained on climate model output, leveraging larger sample sizes and simulated scenarios. Yet, many of these studies focus on prediction tasks that might be restricted in spatial extent or temporal coverage, opening a gap with existing operational predictions. Thus, the present study evaluates the effectiveness of a methodology that combines variational inference with transformer models to predict fields of seasonal anomalies. The predictions cover all four seasons and are initialised one month before the start of each season. The model was trained on climate model output from CMIP6 and tested using ERA5 reanalysis data. We analyse the method's performance in predicting interannual anomalies beyond the climate change-induced trend. We also test the proposed methodology in a regional context with a use case focused on Europe. While climate change trends dominate the skill of temperature predictions, the method presents additional skill over the climatological forecast in regions influenced by known teleconnections. We reach similar conclusions based on the validation of precipitation predictions. Despite underperforming SEAS5 in most tropics, our model offers added value in numerous extratropical inland regions. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of training generative models on climate model output for seasonal predictions, providing skilful predictions beyond the induced climate change trend at time scales and lead times relevant for user applications.</description>

      <title>Influx of Bay of Bengal waters and stirring trends in the Arabian Sea based on satellite altimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freshwater export from the Bay of Bengal (BoB) can drive the regional air-sea interaction in the Arabian Sea (AS). We use AVISO geostrophic and Globcurrent velocities to characterize horizontal stirring on a seasonal and interannual time scale for 1993-2022. With an example of the post-monsoon period of 2015-2016, we estimate the residence time of parcels initialized around Sri Lanka in the BoB advected to the southeastern AS is $\mathcal{O}$(1.5-2) months. Finite-time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) characterizes the chaotic nature of stirring through its probability density function on a sub-monthly timescale. Stirring rates are enhanced along the western boundary by 1.3 times around the Great Whirl and Socotra eddies relative to the eastern boundary and are higher in the summer monsoon season. The southeastern AS shows enhanced stirring rates during the winter monsoons. At the basin scale, the geostrophic eddy kinetic energy increases $\sim$10\% on interannual timescales associated with enhanced stirring.</description>

      <title>Smoothing and spatial verification of global fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecast verification plays a crucial role in the development cycle of operational numerical weather prediction models. At the same time, verification remains a challenge as the traditionally used non-spatial forecast quality metrics exhibit certain drawbacks, with new spatial metrics being developed to address these problems. Some of these new metrics are based on smoothing, with one example being the widely used Fraction Skill Score (FSS) and its many derivatives. However, while the FSS has been used by many researchers in limited area domains, there are, as of yet, no examples of it being used in a global domain. The issue is due to the increased computational complexity of smoothing in a global domain, with its inherent spherical geometry and non-equidistant and/or irregular grids. At the same time, there clearly exists a need for spatial metrics that could be used in the global domain as the operational global models continue to be developed and improved along with the new machine-learning-based models. Here, we present two new methodologies for smoothing in a global domain that are potentially fast enough to make the smoothing of high-resolution global fields feasible. Both approaches also consider the variability of grid point area sizes and can handle missing data appropriately. This, in turn, makes the calculation of smoothing-based metrics, such as FSS and its derivatives, in a global domain possible, which we demonstrate by evaluating the performance of operational high-resolution global precipitation forecasts provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relationship between bolide entry angle and apparent direction of infrasound signal arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing offers critical capabilities for detecting and geolocating bolide events globally. However, the observed back azimuths, directions from which infrasound signals arrive at stations, often differ from the theoretical expectations based on the bolide's peak brightness location. For objects with shallow entry angles, which traverse longer atmospheric paths, acoustic energy may be emitted from multiple points along the trajectory, leading to substantial variability in back azimuth residuals. This study investigates how the entry angle of energetic bolides affects the back azimuth deviations, independent of extrinsic factors such as atmospheric propagation, station noise, and signal processing methodologies. A theoretical framework, the Bolide Infrasound Back-Azimuth EXplorer Model (BIBEX-M), was developed to compute predicted back azimuths solely from geometric considerations. The model quantifies how these residuals vary as a function of source-to-receiver distance, revealing that bolides entering at shallow angles of 10 degrees can experience average residuals of 20 degrees, with deviations reaching up to 46 degrees at distances below 1000 km, and remaining significant even at 10,000 km. In contrast, bolides with steeper entry angles (greater than 60 degrees) show much smaller deviations, typically under 5 degrees at 1000 km and diminishing to less than 1 deg beyond 5000 km. These findings attest to the need for careful interpretation when evaluating signal detections and estimating bolide locations. This work is not only pertinent to bolides but also to other high-energy, extended-duration atmospheric phenomena such as space debris and reentry events, where similar geometric considerations can influence infrasound arrival directions.</description>
