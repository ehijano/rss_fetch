      <title>The QCD Equation of State with $N_f=3$ flavours up to the electro-weak scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Equation of State of Quantum Chromodynamics with $N_f=3$ flavours is determined non-perturbatively in the range of temperatures between $3$ and $165$ GeV with a precision of about $0.5$-$1.0\%$. The calculation is carried out by numerical simulations of lattice gauge theory discretized \`a la Wilson with shifted boundary conditions in the compact direction. At each given temperature the entropy density is computed at several lattice spacings in order to extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. Taken at face value, data point straight to the Stefan-Boltzmann value by following a linear behaviour in the strong coupling constant squared. They are also compatible with the known perturbative formula supplemented by higher order terms in the coupling constant, a parameterization which describes well our data together with those present in the literature down to $500$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Extending Israel-Stewart theory: Causal bulk viscosity at large gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a class of relativistic fluid models for cold and dense matter with bulk viscosity, whose equilibrium equation of state is polytropic. These models reduce to Israel-Stewart theory for small values of the viscous stress $\Pi$. However, when $\Pi$ becomes comparable to the equilibrium pressure $P$, the evolution equations "adjust" to prevent the onset of far-from-equilibrium pathologies that would otherwise plague Israel-Stewart. Specifically, the equations of motion remain symmetric hyperbolic and causal at all times along any continuously differentiable flow, and across the whole thermodynamic state space. This means that, no matter how fast the fluid expands or contracts, the hydrodynamic equations are always well-behaved (away from singularities). The second law of thermodynamics is enforced exactly. Near equilibrium, these models can accommodate an arbitrarily complicated dependence of the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta$ on both density and temperature.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of screening masses of mesons in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12675v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spatial two-point correlation functions of mesonic operators in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures. The simulated temperatures over the range $T \in [147, 330]$ MeV, where the critical temperature is estimated around 165 MeV. To ensure a good control of the chiral symmetry we employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action for two degenerate flavors of quarks. With a lattice cut off $a^{-1}\sim 2.6$ GeV, the residual mass is reduced to 0.14 MeV. With the energy spectrum obtained from the screening mass at incremental values of the temperature range, we examine the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry, the anomalous axial $U(1)$ as well as an enhanced symmetry which exchanges the spin degrees of freedom. We also study how the data approaches the perturbative prediction given by twice the Matsubara frequency of free quarks.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic QCD Study of Excited Bottomonia at Finite Temperatures on a Fine Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temperature dependence of bottomonium correlators up to the 3S and 3P excited states are presented in the range $T \simeq 133-250$ MeV. These lattice calculations employ the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) approach for bottom quarks on (2+1)-flavor gauge backgrounds, using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action near the physical point. The study utilizes a fine lattice spacing of 0.0493 fm at all temperatures. Extended bottomonium operators are implemented to achieve optimized overlaps with the targeted excited states, enhancing sensitivity to thermal effects. To probe in-medium modifications of excited bottomonia, we extract thermal widths and in-medium masses from bottomonium correlators, parameterizing the spectral function with a Gaussian ansatz. Our results confirm nonzero thermal widths for various bottomonium states as the temperature increases, while no significant mass shifts are observed. Additionally, we check that the in-medium properties of bottomonia are almost not affected by variations in the choice of extended operators.</description>

      <title>Predicting the QCD critical point and EoS from combining HIC and neutron star observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A combined constraint on the dense QCD equation of state from connecting neutron star observations to data from heavy ion reactions is presented. We use the Chiral Mean Field Model which can describe neutron star and iso-spin symmetric matter and allows the consistent calculation of the density and momentum dependent potentials of baryons which are then implemented in the UrQMD transport model. In contrast to previous studies, the same equation of state constrained from neutron star properties is also able to describe experimental observables in heavy ion reactions at the HADES experiment.</description>

      <title>The impact of hyperons on neutron star mergers: gravitational waves, mass ejection and black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of hyperons in binary neutron star (NS) mergers considering a total of 14 temperature dependent equations of state (EoSs) models which include hyperonic degrees of freedom and partly delta resonances. Thermally produced hyperons induce a higher heat capacity and a lower thermal index, i.e. a reduced thermal pressure for a given amount of thermal energy, compared to purely nucleonic models. We run a large set of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of NS mergers to explore the impact on observables of these events. In symmetric binaries, we describe a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) frequency by a few per cent, which is specifically linked to the occurrence of hyperons and can thus be potentially used as a discriminator between purely nucleonic and hyperonic systems. We corroborate that this effect occurs similarly for asymmetric binaries and becomes more prominent with increasing total binary mass. Hyperonic models tend to stick out in relations between the dominant postmerger GW frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars providing a signature to identify the presence of hyperons. Distinct secondary postmerger GW spectral features are differently affected by the presence of hyperons, in the sense that one feature exhibits a characteristic frequency shift due to the specific thermal properties of hyperonic EoSs while the other does not. The dynamical mass ejection of mergers is tentatively enhanced for hyperonic models in comparison to nucleonic EoSs which yield roughly the same stellar properties of cold NSs. This may serve useful to identify exotic degrees of freedom in these systems by kilonova observations. Also, for hyperonic EoSs the threshold mass for prompt black hole formation is reduced by about 0.05 $M_{\odot}$ in comparison to nucleonic systems with the same stellar parameters of cold NSs.</description>

      <title>Conditional variational autoencoder inference of neutron star equation of state from astrophysical observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new inference framework for neutron star astrophysics based on conditional variational autoencoders. Once trained, the generator block of the model reconstructs the neutron star equation of state from a given set of mass-radius observations. While the pressure of dense matter is the focus of the present study, the proposed model is flexible enough to accommodate the reconstructing of any other quantity related to dense matter equation of state. Our results show robust reconstructing performance of the model, allowing to make instantaneous inference from any given observation set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11019v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New liquid drop model with the isospin-square dependence of the volume and surface energy terms is applied to reproduce experimentally known masses of nuclei with number of protons and neutrons larger or equal to twenty. The ground-state microscopic energy corrections are taken into account. In spite of the fact that the model contains only six adjustable parameters, the quality of mass reproduction is good, and it is comparable with other contemporary mass models. Also, the fission barrier heights of actinide nuclei evaluated using the topographical theorem of Myers and Swiatecki are close to the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a neural network classification model for detecting the presence of hyperonic degrees of freedom in neutron stars. The models take radii and/or tidal deformabilities as input and give the probability for the presence of hyperons in the neutron star composition. Different numbers of observations and different levels of uncertainty in the neutron star properties are tested. The models have been trained on a dataset of well-calibrated microscopic equations of state of neutron star matter based on a relativistic mean-field formalism. Real data and data generated from a different description of hyperonic matter are used to test the performance of the models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To solve the Cd puzzle (spherical nucleus puzzle), I proposed the concept of a sphere-like nucleus. Since shape coexistence often occurs in such nuclei, explicit spherical-like spectra are not easily identified. In this letter, I finally find the direct evidence for the existence of the spherical-like nucleus. $^{106}$Pd is a typical spherical-like nucleus. The low-lying parts, up to the $10_{1}^{+}$ state, under 4000 keV, of the spherical-like spectra are verified. By comparison, new theory outperforms the IBM-2. This result completely disproves the possibility of the phonon excitations of the spherical nucleus in the Cd-Pd nuclei region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early universe and in particle colliders, starting from the Standard Model. Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence a phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <title>FastEEC: Fast Evaluation of N-point Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators characterize the asymptotic energy flow in scattering events produced at colliders, from which the microscopic physics of the scattering can be deduced. This view of collisions is akin to analyses of the Cosmic Microwave Background, and a range of promising phenomenological applications of energy correlators have been identified, including the study of hadronization, the deadcone effect, measuring $\alpha_s$ and the top quark mass. While $N$-point energy correlators are interesting to study for larger values of $N$, their evaluation is computationally intensive, scaling like $M^N/N!$, where $M$ is the number of particles. In this Letter, we develop a fast, approximate method for their evaluation exploiting that correlations at a given angular scale are insensitive to effects at other (widely-separated) scales. This implies that the energy correlator can be computed on (sub)jets, effectively reducing M. Furthermore, we utilize a dynamical (sub)jet radius that allows us to obtain reliable results without restricting the angular scales being probed. For concreteness we focus on the projected energy correlator, which projects onto the largest separation between the $N$ directions. E.g.~for $N=7$ we find a speed up of up to four orders of magnitude, depending on the desired accuracy. We also consider the possibility of raising the energy to a power higher than one in the energy correlator, which has been proposed to reduce soft sensitivity, and further cuts back the required computation time. These higher-power correlators are not collinear safe, but as a byproduct our approach suggests a natural method to regularize them, such that they can be described using perturbation theory. This letter is accompanied by a public code that implements our method.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations with Gauge Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum lattice gauge theories faces the major challenge of maintaining gauge invariance, as various errors in the simulation push the state of the system out of the physical subspace of the system's exponentially larger Hilbert space. This paper outlines a method, based off of previous work, that uses gauge transformations in two ways. Firstly, the method exploits the Zeno effect by conducting frequent projections to suppress gauge drift. These projections utilize local gauge transformations to destructively interfere unphysical amplitudes via coupling to an ancillary qubit while the physical amplitudes are left untouched, up to a less than unity normalization factor. Secondly, gauge transformations are conducted throughout the time evolution of the system to hamper the speed of gauge drift. This paper demonstrates this method on a pure 1D SU$(2)$ toy model.</description>

Abstract: After more than half a century after the first predictions of the so-called "island of stability of superheavy nuclei", exploring the limits of nuclear stability at highest atomic numbers is still one of the most prominent challenges in low-energy nuclear physics. These exotic nuclear species reveal their character and details of some of their properties by their induced or spontaneous disintegration. The achievements in the field superheavy nuclei (SHN) research have been reported in a number of review papers throughout the decades. This review is an attempt to summarize the progress that has been made in recent years by employing the versatile tool park of Decay Spectroscopy After Separation (DSAS) for the heaviest isotopes from Z=99 (einsteinium) to Z=118 (oganesson). In addition, references to earlier reviews and the relevant papers, together with the major decay properties of all these isotopes are given.</description>

Abstract: We extend our prior results on the worldline computation of the axial vector-vector-vector (AVV) triangle anomaly in polarized deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) to the finite mass case by computing in addition the pseudoscalar-vector-vector (PVV) triangle graph. For the well-studied QED case, we show explicitly how the off-forward AVV pole exactly cancels an identical PVV pole. We then demonstrate the dramatic difference in QCD due to the chiral condensate, which qualitatively modifies anomalous Ward identities. As in the massless case, the anomaly pole in QCD is canceled by the dynamics of a primordial isosinglet pseudoscalar $\bar \eta$-meson, whose Wess-Zumino-Witten coupling to the topological charge density shifts the pole to the physical $\eta^\prime$ mass, with the finite quark mass contribution differing by $O(10\%)$ from the Witten-Veneziano formula. We obtain a compact analytic expression for the finite mass corrections to Shore and Veneziano's result that the proton's net quark helicity $\Delta \Sigma\propto \sqrt{\chi_{\rm QCD}' |_{m=0}(0)}$, the forward slope of the topological susceptibility in the chiral limit, and show they are of the order of a few percent. Our prior prediction that the polarized DIS structure function $g_1$ is quenched by sphaleron-like topological transitions at small $x$ is unaffected by quark mass effects. Our results illustrate how worldline computations of anomalous processes, in synergy with lattice computations and nonet chiral perturbation theory, can uncover novel nonperturbative features of QCD at the Electron-Ion collider.</description>
