      <title>Dead ends in square-free digit walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study "dead ends" in square-free digit walks: square-free integers $N$ such that, in base $b$, every one-digit extension $bN+d$ is non-square-free. In base $10$, the stochastic independence model of Miller et al. suggests that infinite square-free walks occur with probability near $1$, corresponding to an asymptotic dead-end density of $\approx 5.218\times 10^{-5}$. We prove that the true asymptotic dead-end density satisfies \[ c_{\mathrm{dead}} \approx 1.317\times 10^{-9}, \] roughly a factor of $\sim 4\times 10^4$ smaller than the prediction. For every base $b\geq 2$, we prove that dead-end densities exist and are given by a closed-form expression (as a finite alternating sum of Euler products). The argument is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib, and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capsets are subsets of $\mathbb{F}_3^n$ with no three points on a line and a capset is complete if it is not a subset of a larger capset. We study some new constructions of capsets via algebraic equations over extensions of $\mathbb{F}_3$. In particular we construct the smallest known complete capsets with size proportional to the best known lower bound.</description>

      <title>Near-perfect matchings in highly connected 1-planar graphs with a local crossing constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For planar graphs, it is well known that high connectivity implies a Hamiltonian cycle and hence any 4-connected planar graph has a near-perfect matching. Nevertheless, whether 6-connected 1-planar graphs admit near-perfect matchings remains largely open. The prior art established this for 4-connected 1-planar graphs only when each crossing involves four endpoints that induce a $K_4$. In this paper, we study 6-connected 1-planar graphs that are drawn such that at all crossings the four endpoints induce a 4-cycle (plus perhaps more edges). We show that these have a near-perfect matching, and in fact even stronger, their scattering number is at most one. Moreover, under the local crossing restriction, the requirement of 6-connectivity is best possible; this is witnessed by explicit constructions due to Biedl and Fabrici et al.</description>

      <title>Tilted Richardson Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the flag variety $\mathrm{Fl}_n$ and its subvarieties, including Schubert and Richardson varieties, plays a fundamental role in algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics. In this paper, we introduce and develop the theory of tilted Richardson varieties $\mathrm{T}_{u,v}$, a new family of subvarieties of the flag variety that provides a geometric framework for the quantum Bruhat graphs. These varieties are defined for all pairs of permutations $u$ and $v$, extending the classical Richardson varieties in the case where $u\leq v$ in the Bruhat order. We establish their fundamental geometric properties, proving irreducibility and providing explicit dimension formulas. Moreover, we show that they have a well-defined stratification indexed by tilted Bruhat intervals, a generalization of classical Bruhat intervals previously introduced by Brenti, Fomin, and Postnikov. Additionally, we introduce a tilted generalization of the classical Deodhar decomposition of Richardson varieties, which leads to a combinatorial formula for tilted Kazhdan--Lusztig R-polynomials, a notion that arises naturally in our framework.
  We further develop a theory of total positivity for tilted Richardson varieties. In particular, we define and study the totally nonnegative parts of tilted Richardson varieties, proving they form a CW complex. This generalizes earlier results on the totally nonnegative flag variety and answers Bj\"orner's questions regarding geometric realizations of tilted Bruhat intervals.
  Finally, we establish explicit connections between tilted Richardson varieties and quantum Schubert calculus. Specifically, we prove that $\mathrm{T}_{u,v}$ coincides with minimal-degree two-point curve neighborhoods. As a result, we compute their cohomology classes and derive new relationships among Gromov--Witten invariants of the flag variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study Neumaier Cayley graphs. First, we give a criterion for a Cayley graph to be a Neumaier graph with a spread given by the cosets of a subgroup. Further, we construct a new infinite family of Neumaier Cayley graphs of unbounded nexus. Finally, we provide an algorithm for enumerating Neumaier Cayley graphs and computational results obtained by this algorithm.</description>

      <title>An Erd\H{o}s problem on random subset sums in finite abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(N)$ denote the least integer $k$ such that, if $G$ is an abelian group of order $N$ and $A \subseteq G$ is a uniformly random $k$-element subset, then with probability at least $\tfrac12$ the subset-sum set $\{ \sum_{x \in S} x : S \subseteq A \}$ equals $G$. In 1965, Erd\H{o}s and R\'{e}nyi proved that for all $N$, $$ f(N) \le \log_2 N + \left(\frac{1}{\log 2}+o(1)\right)\log\log N. $$ Erd\H{o}s later conjectured that this bound cannot be improved to $f(N)\le \log_2 N+o(\log\log N)$. In this paper we confirm this conjecture by showing that, for primes $p$, $$ f(p)\ge \log_2 p+\left(\frac{1}{2\log 2}+o(1)\right)\log\log p. $$ This work is an outcome of human--AI collaboration: the original qualitative proof was generated autonomously by ChatGPT-5.2 Pro, while the quantitative refinement was developed by the authors.</description>

      <title>Metric representations by minimal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A resolving set in a graph $G$ is a vertex subset $W= \{\omega^1, \dots, \omega^n\} \subseteq V(G)$ such that each $u \in V(G)$ can be uniquely identified by the vector $r(u \vert W) = (d(u,\omega^1), \dots, d(u,\omega^n))$ of metric coordinates of $u$ with respect to $W$. The reverse problem of identifying the vector sets that are a set of coordinates of some graph provides the concept of realizable vector set $S \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ by a pair $(G, W)$ meaning that $S=\{ r(u\vert W)\colon u\in V(G)\}$ with $W$ a resolving set of the graph $G$. Here we focus on the minimality of the realizations of vector sets with respect to their edge sets. On the one hand, we study conditions under which it is possible to remove an edge from the graph and keep the realizability condition. This provides a method for finding minimal realizations, as well as allowing us to characterize uniquely realizable vector sets. On the other hand, we prove that the decision problem of realizing a vector set by a graph with a given number of edges is an NP-complete problem. Finally, we characterize the vector sets that are realizable by a tree and, furthermore, we study the case in which such a realization is the only one.</description>

      <title>Matrices of nonnegative integer rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonnegative integer rank of a matrix is a variant of the classical nonnegative rank, introduced in the 1980s, where factorizations are required to have integer entries. While computing nonnegative integer rank is generally very hard, we focus on a fundamental special case: determining when a rank 2 nonnegative integer matrix has nonnegative integer rank equal to 2 (the "rank2 problem"). Although this problem is trivial in the continuous case, in this context it is surprisingly rich.
  We provide a geometric reformulation in terms of affine semigroups and rational cones in the plane, which yields new structural insights. We show that any rank 2 integer matrix can be reduced to a $3\times 3$ matrix which has nonnegative integer rank $2$ if and only if the original one also has nonnegative integer rank $2$, with the reduction computable in polynomial time. This reduction reveals that the difficulty of the rank2 problem is already captured by small matrices. Building on this geometric framework, we also develop an algorithm that solves the rank2 problem by strategically searching for integer generators within bounded regions of the associated cone. Although the theoretical worst-case complexity remains high, numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm performs efficiently in practice.</description>

      <title>The Multicolor Induced Size-Ramsey Number of Long Subdivisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $k$ and a graph $H$, the $k$-color induced size-Ramsey number \linebreak $\widehat{R}_{\mathrm{ind}}(H, k)$ is the minimum integer $m$ for which there exists a graph $G$ with $m$ edges such that for every $k$-edge coloring of $G$, the graph $G$ contains a monochromatic copy of $H$ as an induced subgraph. For a graph $H$ with the edge set $E(H)$ and a function $\sigma:E(H)\to \mathbb{N}$, the subdivision $H^\sigma$ is obtained by replacing each $e \in E(H)$ with a path of length $\sigma(e)$. We prove that for all integers $k,\, D\geq 2 $, there exists a constant $c=c(k, D)$ such that the following holds. Let $ H $ be any graph with maximum degree~$D$ and let~$H^{\sigma}$ be a subdivision of $H$ with $\sigma(e) &gt; c \log_D n $ for every $e \in E(H)$, where~$n$ is the order of~$H^\sigma$. Then, $\hat{R}_{\mathrm{ind}}(H^\sigma,k)=e^{O(k\log k)} D^{9}\log (D)\, n$. If each $\sigma(e)$ is even and larger than $c \log_D n$, this bound improves to $\hat{R}_{\mathrm{ind}}(H^\sigma,k)=O(k^{342} \log^{9} (k) D^{9} \log D )n$. We also find improved bounds for the non-induced size-Ramsey number of long subdivisions.</description>

      <title>Lattices from Pointed Building Sets: Generalized Ornamentation Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel combinatorial structure called pointed building sets, which can be viewed as families of lattices equipped with compatibility relations. To each pointed building set $\mathsf{B}$, we associate a complete lattice $\mathcal{O}(\mathsf{B})$, called the ornamentation lattice of $\mathsf{B}$.
  Special cases of this construction have already proven useful in understanding the structure of three families of posets: operahedron lattices, the affine Tamari lattice, and hypergraphic posets of subhypergraphs of the path hypergraph of an increasing tree.
  The goal of this paper is to establish the theory of these generalized ornamentations. We examine several natural classes of pointed building sets which recover classical lattices such as the Tamari lattice, the lattice of topologies ordered by coarsening, and the lattice of naturally labeled partial orders. Furthermore, several theoretical directions are explored, including inverse limits and group actions. Notably, this leads to a straightforward construction of inverse limits of Tamari lattices, yielding infinite analogs of the Tamari lattice.</description>

      <title>Convex unions and completions from simplicial pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While intersections of convex sets are convex, their unions have rather complicated behavior. Some natural contexts where they appear include duality arguments involving boundaries of convex sets and valuations, which have an Euler characteristic-like structure. However, there are certain settings where the convexity property itself is important to consider. For example, this includes (preservation of) positivity properties of divisors on toric varieties under blowdowns. In the case of (restrictions of) conormal bundles, this can be interpreted in terms of interactions between local convexity data stored in rational equivalence relations. We consider generalizations to realizations of simplicial pseudomanifolds and replace rational equivalence with effects of PL homeomorphisms.
  Decomposing the PL homeomorphisms into edge subdivisions and contractions, we characterize the space of suitable contraction points compatible with local convexity properties in terms of convex unions and completions. This gives rise to certain external edge subdivisions that make this ``contraction space'' of the starting edge empty, which is unexpected given the expected ``increased convexity'' from edge subdivisions. We also obtain strong affine/linear restrictions on realizations of facets containing nearby edges preserving local convexity. This implies that contracting certain nearby edges results in a very large or very small contraction space of the starting edge. As for boundary behavior, there are parallels between effects of PL homeomorphisms on induced 4-cycles in the 1-skeleton. Finally, we find effects of PL homeomorphisms and suspensions on analogues of local convexity properties stored by linear systems of parameters. This indicates that simplicial spheres PL homeomorphic to the boundary of a cross polytope store record local convexity changes in the most natural way.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory for Borel PMP Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of spectral theory for bounded-degree Borel pmp graphs. Specifically, we study spectral properties of the associated adjacency and Laplacian operators. We start with proving a spectral characterization of approximate measurable bipartiteness. Next, we adapt classical theorems of Wilf and Hoffman to give novel upper and lower bounds on the approximate measurable chromatic number. Using similar techniques, we then show that the approximate measurable chromatic number of a pmp graph generated by $n$ bounded-to-one functions is at most $2n + 1$. Next, concerning matchings, we introduce a measurable version of Tutte's condition and show that a spectral assumption analogous to the one from a classical theorem of Brouwer and Haemers implies this measurable Tutte condition. Finally, we show that the spectrum is continuous under local-global convergence.</description>

      <title>Regions surrounded by parabolas in the plane and trees representing their shapes respecting their natural projection to the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The author has been interested in regions surrounded by real algebraic curves of degree $1$ or $2$ in the plane. The author is mainly interested in their shapes and combinatorics. This is a fundamental and natural problem in mathematics being also elementary and connected to various fields. The shapes are understood via graphs the regions collapsing to respecting the canonical projection onto the 1st component.
  Our main result is the following: each tree is realized by regions surrounded by parabolas of two types, here.
  Related studies are elementary and interesting and surprisingly, this explicit field is started very recently, by Bodin, Popescu-Pampu and Sorea in the 2020s. After that, this is developing, due to the author. The author also investigates this motivated by studies on explicit construction of real algebraic maps onto the regions locally so-called moment maps: this comes from singularity theory of differentiable maps and real algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Rational Interpreters for Discrete Dynamics: Existence, Exactness, and Decomposition over $p$-adic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address an inverse problem in non-Archimedean dynamics: given a finite discrete dynamical system (equivalently, a functional graph on $N$ states), construct a continuous $p$-adic dynamical system whose residue-level behavior reproduces the prescribed transitions. Using the cylinder partition of $\mathcal{O}_K$ (viewed as \emph{Witt cylinders} for unramified $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$), we encode states by pairwise disjoint closed balls and formalize an \textbf{interpreter} as a map sending each state ball into its target ball.
  Our main existence result constructs rational interpreters that are analytic (hence pole-free) on the prescribed state cylinders, combining rigid-analytic Runge approximation with finite interpolation constraints. Under a linear-dominance condition on each cylinder, ball images are explicit and locally affine, leading to a robust classification of discrete behavior into contractive, indifferent, and expansive regimes. Good reduction provides a selection principle for natural interpreters; effective degree and height bounds for general rational interpreters remain open.
  For composite alphabets we prove a \textbf{Dynamic Chinese Remainder Theorem} for congruence-preserving systems: the CRT isomorphism $\Theta:\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{\sim}\prod_i\mathbb{Z}/p_i^{k_i}\mathbb{Z}$ (for $m=\prod p_i^{k_i}$) yields a factorization of the \emph{dynamics} (equivalently, the functional graph) on $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ into dynamics on the prime-power components, compatible with reduction. Finally, we discuss an inverse-limit (profinite) extension: compatible towers define a $1$-Lipschitz map on $\mathbb{Z}_p$, while selecting compatible analytic/rational interpreters across levels becomes a separate problem.</description>

      <title>A Structural Equivalence of Symmetric TSP to a Constrained Group Steiner Tree Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a brief structural equivalence between the symmetric TSP and a constrained Group Steiner Tree Problem (cGSTP) defined on a simplicial incidence graph. Given the complete weighted graph on the city set V, we form the bipartite incidence graph between triangles and edges. Selecting an admissible, disk-like set of triangles induces a unique boundary cycle. With global connectivity and local regularity constraints, maximizing net weight in the cGSTP is exactly equivalent to minimizing the TSP tour length.</description>

      <title>Cheeger inequalities on simplicial complexes</title>

Abstract: Cheeger-type inequalities in which the decomposability of a graph and the spectral gap of its Laplacian mutually control each other play an important role in graph theory and network analysis, in particular in the context of expander theory. The natural problem to extend such inequalities to simplicial complexes and their higher order Eckmann Laplacians has been open for a long time. Before proving any inequality, however, one needs to identify the right Cheeger-type constant for which such an inequality can hold. Here, we solve this problem. Our solution involves and combines constructions from simplicial topology, signed graphs, Gromov filling radii and an interpolation between the standard 2-Laplacians and the analytically more difficult 1-Laplacians, for which, however, the inequalities become equalities. It is then natural to develop a general theory for $p$-Laplacians on simplicial complexes and investigate the related Cheeger-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Fan distributions via Tverberg partitions and Gale duality</title>

Abstract: Equipartition theory, beginning with the classical ham sandwich theorem, seeks the fair division of finite point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by the full-dimensional regions determined by a prescribed geometric dissection of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Here we examine $\textit{equidistributions}$ of finite point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by prescribed $\textit{low dimensional}$ subsets. Our main result states that if $r\geq 3$ is a prime power, then for any $m$-coloring of a sufficiently small point set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists an $r$-fan in $\mathbb{R}^d$ -- that is, the union of $r$ ``half-flats'' of codimension $r-2$ centered about a common $(r-1)$-codimensional affine subspace -- which captures all the points of $X$ in such a way that each half-flat contains at most an $r$-th of the points from each color class. The number of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ we require for this is essentially tight when $m\geq 2$. Additionally, we extend our equidistribution results to ''piercing'' distributions in a similar fashion to Dolnikov's hyperplane transversal generalization of the ham sandwich theorem. By analogy with recent work of Frick et al., our results are obtained by applying Gale duality to linear cases of topological Tverberg-type theorems. Finally, we extend our distribution results to multiple $r$-fans after establishing a multiple intersection version of a topological Tverberg-type theorem due to Sarkaria.</description>

Abstract: The base sequences BS(n+1,n) are four sequences of $\pm1$ and lengths n+1,n+1,n,n with zero auto correlation. The base sequence conjecture states that BS(n+1,n) exists for all positive integers and has been verified for $n\le40$. We present our algorithm and give construction of BS(n+1,n) for $n=41,42,43$.\\ The Normal sequences NS (n) and the Near-normal sequences NNS (n) are subclasses of BS(n+1,n). Yang conjecture asserts that there is a NNS(n) for each even integer n and has been verified for $n\le40$. We found that there is no NNS(n) for n=42 and 44 by exhaustive search, which gives the first counter case of Yang conjecture. We also show that there is no NS(n) for n=41,42,43,44,45 by exhaustive search and proves that no NS(n) exist for $n=8k-2,k \in Z_+$.</description>

      <title>On orbit sets generated by semigroups of one-dimensional affine functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional orbit set $\langle F : s \rangle$ is formed by the images of a number $s$ under the action of a semigroup generated by integer affine functions $f_i=a_i x+b_i$ taken from the set $F=\{f_1,\ldots,f_n\}$. P.Erd\H{o}s established an upper bound $O(x^{\sigma+\epsilon})$ for the growth function $|\langle F : s \rangle\cap[0,x]|$, where $1/a_1^{\sigma}+1/a_2^{\sigma}+\ldots + 1/a_n^{\sigma}=1$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, which was extended to orbit multisets and real affine functions by J.Lagarias. We complement this by a lower bound $\Omega(x^{\sigma})$ for the multiset size $|\langle F : s \rangle^\#\cap[0,x]|$.
  P.Erd\H{o}s and R.Graham asked whether an orbit set $\langle F : s \rangle$ has positive density when $F$ is a basis of a free semigroup and $1/a_1+1/a_2+\ldots + 1/a_n=1$. Under these two conditions, we establish a sublinear lower bound $|\langle F : s \rangle \cap [0,x]|=\Omega(x/\log^{\frac{n-1}2} x)$. We also show that in the case when the functions of $F$ form an exact covering system of integers, i.e. when $f_1(\mathbb Z) \sqcup \ldots \sqcup f_n(\mathbb Z)=\mathbb Z$, this bound can be strengthened to $\Omega(x)$, so the set $\langle F : s \rangle$ has positive density.</description>

Abstract: We show that the star graph defined as the Cayley graph of ${\mathfrak S}_{n+1}$ generated by the star transpositions is an ${\mathfrak S}_n$-cover of the complete graph $K_{n+1}$, which is known to have fine spectral properties. In the case $n = 3$, the star graph also has fine geometric properties: it embeds into the honeycomb lattice and has a spectrum computable via both representation theory and an explicit Fourier formula. Intermediate covers correspond to the cube and truncated tetrahedron, offering a new interpretation of their integral spectra.</description>

      <title>Extensions of Real-Weighted Fractional Arboricity: Conductance-Resistance Bounds and Monoid Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09096v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a conductance-weighted arboricity for a finite simple undirected graph $G=(V,E,c)$ with a conductance assignment $c:E\to[0,\infty)$: \[ A_c(G):=\max\bigl\{ D_c(H): H\subseteq G\text{ connected}, |V(H)|\ge 2 \bigr\},\qquad D_c(H):=\frac{\sum_{e\in E(H)}c(e)}{|V(H)|-1}. \] This functional reduces to fractional arboricity when $c\equiv 1$, is isomorphism invariant, monotone under subgraphs and edge additions, positively homogeneous, and convex. We prove sharp global bounds \[ \max_{e\in E}c(e)\le A_c(G)\le\sum_{e\in E}c(e), \] with attainment by some connected subgraph. On the analytic side, we introduce a local variant and derive conductance--resistance inequalities using effective resistances in the ambient network. If $R^{G}_{\mathrm{eff}}(e)$ denotes the effective resistance between the endpoints of $e$ in $G$, we show that every connected $H\subseteq G$ satisfies \[ \sum_{e\in E(H)}c(e)\,R^{G}_{\mathrm{eff}}(e)\le |V(H)|-1, \] which in turn yields the upper bound \[ D_c(H)\le\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{e\in E(H)}c(e)/R^{G}_{\mathrm{eff}}(e)}{|V(H)|-1}} \] and hence an explicit effective resistance-based upper bound on $A_c(G)$. On the structural side, we describe the algebraic behavior of $A_c(G)$. We show that under edge-disjoint union, $A_c(G)$ behaves as a max invariant: for a finite disjoint union of weighted graphs one has $A_c(G)= \max_i A_{c_i}(G_i)$. In particular, disjoint union induces a commutative idempotent monoid structure at the level of isomorphism classes, with $A_c(G)$ idempotent with respect to this operation. We also provide a computational exhibit on the hypercube family $Q_d$, including random conductance sampling, illustrating numerical evaluation of the resulting resistance-based bound.</description>

      <title>On Shellability of 3-Cut Complexes of Hexagonal Grid Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $k$-cut complex was recently introduced by Bayer et al. as a generalization of earlier work of Fr{\"o}berg (1990) and Eagon and Reiner (1998), and was shown to be shellable for several classes of graphs. In this article, we prove that the $3$-cut complexes of the hexagonal grid graphs $H_{1 \times m \times n}$ are shellable for all $m,n \geq 1$, by constructing an explicit shelling order using reverse lexicographic ordering. From this shelling, we determine the number of spanning facets, denoted by $\psi_{m,n}$, and deduce that the complex is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of $\psi_{m,n}$ spheres of dimension $\left( 2m + 2n + 2mn - 4 \right)$, where $$\psi_{m,n} = \binom{2m+2n+2mn-1}{2} - \left[ \left( 6m+2 \right) n + (2m-4) \right].$$
  While these topological properties can be obtained from general results of Bayer et al., we provide an explicit combinatorial construction of a shelling order, yielding a direct counting formula for the number of spheres in the wedge sum decomposition.</description>

      <title>The Greedy Algorithm for Dissociated Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07068v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac \pi 2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1&lt;C&lt;c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</description>

      <title>Weyl groups and the Kostant game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a novel combinatorial framework at the intersection of Lie theory and algebraic combinatorics, based on a generalization of the Kostant game. We begin by reviewing the foundations of root systems, the classification of Dynkin diagrams, and the structure of Weyl groups. Subsequently, we analyze the original Kostant game as a tool for generating positive roots, demonstrating its unique termination on simply-laced diagrams and its role in an alternative classification thereof.
  The main contribution of this work -- which, to our knowledge, has not been studied before -- is a multi-vertex generalization of the game that allows for the simultaneous modification of multiple vertices of a Dynkin diagram. We prove that the resulting configurations of this new game establish a natural bijection with the elements of the quotient W/W_J of Weyl groups by parabolic subgroups. This formalism is applied to problems in algebraic geometry, specifically addressing cases of the Mukai conjecture via Hilbert polynomials, and is accompanied by a computational implementation in Java. These results offer new combinatorial perspectives for studying root counting problems, the regularity of reduced word languages, and the construction of Young Tableaux.</description>

      <title>The Mutual-Visibility Problem In Directed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of mutual visibility has traditionally focused on undirected graphs, asking for the maximum number of vertices that can communicate via shortest paths without intermediate interference from other set members. In this paper, we extend this concept to directed graphs, establishing fundamental results for several graph classes. We prove that for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), the mutual-visibility number $\mu(D)$ is always 1, and for directed cycles of length $n\ge3$, it is strictly 2. In contrast, we demonstrate that tournaments can support arbitrarily large mutual-visibility sets; specifically, using properties of Paley tournaments, we show that $\mu(T)$ grows linearly with the size of the tournament. On the algorithmic side, we show that while verifying a candidate set is polynomial-time solvable ($O(|S|(|V|+|A|))$), the problem of determining $\mu(D)$ is NP-hard for general digraphs. We also analyze the impact of strong bridges and strongly connected components on the upper bounds of $\mu(D)$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study polymatroids that are representable by means of linear restricted rank-metric codes, namely, by subspaces of the space of alternating, symmetric, or Hermitian square matrices endowed with the rank metric. More precisely, we characterize the rank function defining these polymatroids and establish sufficient conditions on the relevant parameters under which it is fully determined. We show that there are several differences in compared to the behaviour of $q$-polymatroids of unrestricted matrix codes.</description>

      <title>An arithmetic algebraic regularity lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an 'arithmetic regularity lemma' for groups definable in finite fields, analogous to Tao's 'algebraic regularity lemma' for graphs definable in finite fields. More specifically, we show that, for any $M&gt;0$, any finite field $\mathbf{F}$, and any definable group $(G,\cdot)$ in $\mathbf{F}$ and definable subset $D\subseteq G$, each of complexity at most $M$, there is a normal definable subgroup $H\leqslant G$, of index and complexity $O_M(1)$, such that the following holds: for any cosets $V,W$ of $H$, the bipartite graph $(V,W,xy^{-1}\in D)$ is $O_M(|\mathbf{F}|^{-1/2})$-quasirandom. Various analogous regularity conditions follow; for example, for any $g\in G$, the Fourier coefficient $||\widehat{1}_{H\cap Dg}(\pi)||_{\mathrm{op}}$ is $O_M(|\mathbf{F}|^{-1/8})$ for every non-trivial irreducible representation $\pi$ of $H$.</description>

      <title>Limits of biconditioned Bienayme-Galton-Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the limiting behavior of a Bienayme-Galton-Watson tree conditioned to have a large number of vertices and either a fixed number of leaves or a fixed number of internal nodes. The first biconditioning gives a universal result with respect to the offspring distribution. In contrast, the second case leads to a variety of limiting behaviors, ranging from condensation phenomena to more elongated tree structures, depending on the properties of the offspring distribution. To prove these results, we use tools from conditioned random walk theory and from analytic combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Threshold graphs are globally synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12646v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model can be formulated as a gradient flow on a nonconvex energy landscape of the form $E(\boldsymbol{\theta}) := \frac{1}{2} \sum_{1\le i,j\le n} A_{ij}\bigl(1-\cos(\theta_i-\theta_j)\bigr).$ A fundamental question is to identify graph structures for which this landscape is benign, in the sense that every second-order stationary point corresponds to a fully synchronized state. This property guarantees that all trajectories of the Kuramoto model converge to a fully synchronized state except for a measure-zero set of initial conditions, a phenomenon known as global synchronization. Existing guarantees typically require that each node be connected to a sufficiently large fraction of the other nodes, enforcing high graph density. In this work, we show that threshold graphs lie well outside this regime while still exhibiting global synchronization. In particular, threshold graphs realize arbitrary edge densities and have degree sequences that are extremal in the sense of majorization. Our analysis is based on a phasor--geometric characterization of stationary points that exploits the structural and geometric symmetries induced by threshold graphs.</description>

      <title>Semi-Autonomous Mathematics Discovery with Gemini: A Case Study on the Erd\H{o}s Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a case study in semi-autonomous mathematics discovery, using Gemini to systematically evaluate 700 conjectures labeled 'Open' in Bloom's Erd\H{o}s Problems database. We employ a hybrid methodology: AI-driven natural language verification to narrow the search space, followed by human expert evaluation to gauge correctness and novelty. We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI. We reflect on the takeaways from AI-assisted efforts on the Erd\H{o}s Problems.</description>
