      <title>Open-source Flux Transport (OFT). I. HipFT -- High-performance Flux Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global solar photospheric magnetic maps play a critical role in solar and heliospheric physics research. Routine magnetograph measurements of the field occur only along the Sun-Earth line, leaving the far-side of the Sun unobserved. Surface Flux Transport (SFT) models attempt to mitigate this by modeling the surface evolution of the field. While such models have long been established in the community (with several releasing public full-Sun maps), none are open source. The Open Source Flux Transport (OFT) model seeks to fill this gap by providing an open and user-extensible SFT model that also builds on the knowledge of previous models with updated numerical and data acquisition/assimilation methods along with additional user-defined features. In this first of a series of papers on OFT, we introduce its computational core: the High-performance Flux Transport (HipFT) code (github.com/predsci/hipft). HipFT implements advection, diffusion, and data assimilation in a modular design that supports a variety of flow models and options. It can compute multiple realizations in a single run across model parameters to create ensembles of maps for uncertainty quantification and is high-performance through the use of multi-CPU and multi-GPU parallelism. HipFT is designed to enable users to easily write extensions, enhancing its flexibility and adaptability. We describe HipFT's model features, validations of its numerical methods, performance of its parallel and GPU-accelerated code implementation, analysis/post-processing options, and example use cases.</description>

      <title>A Predicted Great Dimming of T Tauri: Has it Begun?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical star in the T Tauri triple system is the prototype of young sun-like stars in our galaxy. This complex and dynamic system has evidence for misaligned disks and outflows, and molecular material in a circumbinary ring that obscures the southern infrared binary, T Tau South. Observations by members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) show that T Tau North, the optical star, has dimmed by up to ~2 magnitudes in the visual over the course of the past decade. The dimming across the B, V, R and I bands has a color character typical of changes in ISM extinction, suggesting an increase in obscuration along the line of sight to T Tau North. Material associated with the circumbinary ring around T Tau South has been predicted to occult the optical star via wide-scale orbital motion of the system. Through analysis of the geometrical configuration and motion of dust structures in the system, it seems that a great dimming of T Tau North by line-of-sight material associated with the T Tau South binary has, in fact, begun. Based on the extent and motion of the circumbinary ring material associated with the southern binary, T Tau North will likely experience dimming events for decades to come and may disappear entirely from the optical sky as the densest mid-plane region of the ring traverses our line of sight.</description>

      <title>Multi-episodes of remote brightenings driven by a coronal EUV jet on the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote brightening (RB) is compact brightening at footpoints of magnetic loops, which are remotely-connecting to and confining an eruption in the solar atmosphere. Here, we report on observations of an RB resulting from an EUV jet with a speed of about 90\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The loops connecting the RB and the jet have an apparent length of about 59\,Mm. Intriguingly, the RB exhibits at least two episodes of brightenings, as characterised by two peaks in its lightcurve. The energies, which sustain the first and second peaks of the RB, are $6.3\times10^{26}$\,erg and $8.4\times10^{26}$\,erg, respectively, and take a significant proportion of the total energy. The first peak of the RB brightenings coincides with the jet's peak with a time delay of 12 seconds, while the second peak lags behind by 108 seconds. Besides the flows of the ejecta, we have identified two additional flows originating from the eruption site. One is relatively cool with a temperature of $log_{10}T/K=5.8-6.1$ and has a speed of about $275\pm15$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The other is hot with a temperature of $log_{10}T/K=7.0-7.3$ and travels much faster with a speed of about 750$\pm$\,70\,km\,s$^{-1}$. We attribute the second peak of RB directly to this hot flow, which our numerical experiments suggest is the result of a slow shock wave. Considering the minimal time delay between the first peak of RB and the eruption, we infer this first episode is due to heating by nonthermal electrons. Our research demonstrates that the dynamics in an RB can offer vital insights into the nature of the corresponding eruption and help understand how the energy is distributed throughout the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Study Self-lensing/Eclipsing Signals in Edge-on Double White-Dwarf Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar lightcurves from edge-on double white dwarf systems(DWDs) have periodic lensing/eclipsing signals at times of alignment between two components as seen by the observer. Here, we study the characterization and detection of these signals. In common DWDs, the Einstein radii have similar orders of magnitude with WDs' radii, and the projected source and lens radii normalized to the Einstein radius ($\rho_{\star}$, and $\rho_{\rm l}$) are $\sim 1$. Both of them are reduced with the orbital period and the lens mass. If $\rho_{\rm l}\simeq 1$ the lensing-induced minor image is always blocked by the lens which results lower magnification factors. If $\rho_{\rm l}\lesssim 1$ and in transit events the finite-lens effects decrease the lightcurves' width. When $\rho_{\rm l}\gtrsim1$ (happens for close DWDs including one low-mass and one massive WD) deep or complete eclipses dominate to lensing effects. The self-lensing signals maximize for massive DWDs in wide orbits. We study the detect-ability of lensing/eclipsing signals in edge-on DWDs in observations by The NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite(TESS), The Vera Rubin Observatory(LSST) and The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. We simulate stellar lightcurves due to edge-on DWDs and generate synthetic data points based on their observing strategies. Detection efficiency maximizes for extremely low-mass WDs in close orbits, and the numbers of DWDs within 100 pc and an observing cone with detectable lensing/eclipsing signals in one $27.4$-day TESS and $62$-day Roman observing window are $\sim1$ and $&lt;1$, respectively. Detecting these signals by LSST is barely possible because of its long cadence.</description>

      <title>Impact of Coulomb Correction Factor on Rate of Change of Lepton Fraction during Presupernova Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reexamine the weak interaction nuclei having largest contribution to the lepton to baryon fraction Ye by coupling the stellar weak rates and mass abundances for post silicon burning conditions during the presupernova evolution of massive stars. The stellar weak rates were recently calculated by Nabi et al. 2021 employing the fully microscopic pnQRPA model without invoking the Brink Axel hypothesis. We compute the mass abundances for a total of 728 nuclei, with A equal 1to 100, using Sahas equation and assuming nuclear statistical equilibrium with the incorporation of Coulomb correction factor to the chemical potential. We compile a list of top 50 electron capture ec and \b{eta} decay bd nuclei on the basis of largest contribution to Ye forpost silicon burning conditions where 11 percent ec and 6percent bd nuclei debuted dueto Coulomb corrections. The calculated mass abundances and corresponding Ye values are enhanced up to 3 orders of magnitude for heavier nuclei once Coulomb corrections were incorporated. This enhancement led to anincrement in total Y bde and Yece values, at Ye equal to 0.425 (\r{ho} equal 2.20 multiply 109 g/cm3 of 80percent and 91percent respectively. After incorporating the Coulomb corrections we propose a revised interval of Ye equal 0.423 0.455 where bd rates surpass thecompeting ec rates and is 3.2 percent bigger than the one suggested by Nabi et al. (2021).</description>

      <title>Solar Particle Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy particles may be accelerated widely in stellar coronae; probably by the same processes we find in the Sun. Here, we have learned of two physical mechanisms that dominate the acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs). The highest energies and intensities are produced in "gradual" events at shock waves driven from the Sun by fast, wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Smaller, but more numerous, "impulsive" events with unusual particle composition are produced during magnetic reconnection in solar jets and flares. Jets provide open magnetic field lines where SEPs escape; closed magnetic loops contain this energy to produce bright, hot flares, perhaps even contributing to heating the low corona in profuse nanoflares. Streaming protons amplify Alfven waves upstream of the shocks. These waves scatter and trap SEPs and, in large events, modify the element abundances and flatten the low-energy spectra upstream. Shocks also reaccelerate residual ions from earlier impulsive events, when available, that characteristically dominate the energetic heavy-ion abundances. The large CME-driven shock waves develop an extremely wide longitude span, filling much of the inner heliosphere with energetic particles.</description>

      <title>A Spectroscopic and Interferometric Study of W Serpentis Stars. I. Circumbinary Outflow in the Interacting Binary W Serpentis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: W Serpentis is an eclipsing binary system and the prototype of the Serpentid class of variable stars. These are interacting binaries experiencing intense mass transfer and mass loss. However, the identities and properties of both stars in W Ser remain a mystery. Here we present an observational analysis of high quality, visible-band spectroscopy made with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope and ARCES spectrograph plus the first near-IR, long-baseline interferometric observations obtained with the CHARA Array. We present examples of the appearance and radial velocities of the main spectral components: prominent emission lines, strong shell absorption lines, and weak absorption lines. We show that some of the weak absorption features are associated with the cool mass donor, and we present the first radial velocity curve for the donor star. The donor's absorption lines are rotationally broadened, and we derive a ratio of donor to gainer mass of 0.36 +/- 0.09 based on the assumptions that the donor fills its Roche lobe and rotates synchronously with the orbit. We use a fit of the ASAS light curve to determine the orbital inclination and mass estimates of 2.0 and 5.7 solar masses for the donor and gainer, respectively. The partially resolved interferometric measurements of orbital motion are consistent with our derived orbital properties and the distance from Gaia EDR3. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that the gainer is enshrouded in an opaque disk that channels the mass transfer stream into an outflow through the L3 region and into a circumbinary disk.</description>

      <title>Exploring mass transfer mechanisms in symbiotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define two regimes of the parameter space of symbiotic systems based on the dominant mass transfer mechanism. A wide range of white dwarf (WD) mass, donor mass, and donor radius combinations are explored to determine the separation, for each parameter combination, below which wind Roche-lobe overflow (WRLOF) will be the dominant mass transfer mechanism. The underlying concept is the premise that the wind accelerates. If it reaches the Roche-lobe before attaining sufficient velocity to escape, it will be trapped, and gravitationally focused through the inner Lagrangian point towards the accreting WD. However, if the wind succeeds in attaining the required velocity to escape from the donor's Roche-lobe, it will disperse isotropically, and the dominant mass transfer mechanism will be the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) prescription in which only a fraction of the wind will be accreted onto the WD. We present, these two regimes of the four dimensional parameter space, covering 375 different parameter combinations.</description>

      <title>Observation and modeling of complex transient structure in heliosphere followed by geomagnetic storm on May 10-11, 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex CME/ICME structures in the solar wind often arising in the heliosphere as a result of interaction between two or more CMEs are very important due to their enhanced geoefficiency, but their modeling is difficult due to lack of observational data outside the solar corona. The outstanding evidence of such complex structure occurred on May 10-11,2024, when the strongest geomagnetic storm was caused by a series of successive CMEs emerged from the same solar AR13664. The complex formed from the first 4 CMEs of the series triggered a drop of the Dst-index to -412nT. The aim of this study is to consider propagation of these ICMEs in the heliosphere using observations at three stages: at the starting point observed with the LASCO, in the middle heliosphere by the IPS method and in situ at the L1 point with the ACE. The IPS observations were carried out on May 9 and 10 with the BSA LPI, which enables to build in the scanning mode 2D map of scintillation index m2 associated with enhancements of the integrated over the LOS plasma density over a range of the heliocentric distances 0.4-0.8AU. Evolution of the ICMEs in the heliosphere was described using a cone model in the selfsimilar approximation and kinematics according to the DBM. The initial spatial distributions of density at the cone base were determined from the LASCO images of the CMEs at the heights of 20Rsun, and then were rescaled according to radial distances to the position corresponding to the time of the BSA observations. It was shown that the modeled distribution of the ICME complex LOS density N2 over heliocentric distance is consistent with distribution of m2. Some discrepancies may characterize variation of the density structure inside the complex due to CME interaction. The modeled mean volume density of the ICME plasma at the L1 position agreed with in situ ACE measurements, which validates the developed expansion model.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Forecasting of Tomorrow's Solar Wind at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A faster than real time forecast system for solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field transients that is driven by hourly updated solar magnetograms is proposed to provide a continuous nowcast of the solar corona ($&lt;0.1$AU) and 24-hours forecast of the solar wind at 1 AU by solving a full 3-D MHD model. This new model has been inspired by the concept of \textit{relativity of simultaneity} used in the theory of special relativity. It is based on time transformation between two coordinate systems: the solar rest frame and a boosted system in which the current observations of the solar magnetic field and tomorrow's measurement of the solar wind at 1 AU are simultaneous. In this paper we derive the modified governing equations for both hydrodynamics (HD) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and present a new numerical algorithm that only modifies the conserved quantities but preserves the original HD/MHD numerical flux. The proposed method enables an efficient numerical implementation, and thus a significantly longer forecast time than the traditional method.</description>

      <title>X-ray activity of nearby G-, K-, and M-type stars and implications for planet habitability around M stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The intense X-ray and UV emission of some active M stars has raised questions about the habitability of planets around M-type stars. Aims. We aim to determine the unbiased distribution of X-ray luminosities in complete, volume-limited samples of nearby M dwarfs, and compare them to those of K and G dwarfs. Methods. We constructed volume-complete samples of 205 M stars with a spectral type $\leq$ M6 within 10 pc of the Sun, 129 K stars within 16 pc, and 107 G stars within 20 pc. We used X-ray data from Chandra, XMM-Newton, eROSITA, and ROSAT to obtain the X-ray luminosities of the stars. Results. Our samples reach an X-ray detection completeness of 85%, 86%, and 80% for M, K, and G stars, respectively. The fractional X-ray luminosities relative to the bolometric luminosities, $\log(L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol})$, of the M stars show a bimodal distribution, with one peak at around -5, mostly contributed by early M stars (M0--M4), and another peak around -3.5, contributed mainly by M4--M6 stars. The comparison of the different spectral classes shows that 63% of all M stars in our sample (80% of the M stars with a spectral type $&lt;$ M4) have $L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}$ values that are within the central 80% quantile of the distribution function for G stars. In addition, 55% of all M stars in our sample (and 72% of the M stars with a spectral type $&lt;$ M4) have $L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}$ less than 10 times the solar value. Conclusions. The X-ray activity levels of the majority ($\ge 60\%$) of nearby M dwarfs no later than M6 are actually not higher than the typical (80% quantile) levels for G-type stars. The X-ray irradiation of habitable-zone planets around these stars should therefore not present a specific problem for their habitability.</description>

      <title>Exploring Temperature Influences on Gravitational Wave Production in Binary White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the conditions under which gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted during the merger of hot white dwarfs (WDs) in a binary system. Traditionally, these systems consist of two low-mass stars or a more massive WD paired with a less massive companion. In addition, recent work has investigated the possibility that double white dwarf (DWD) mergers are possibly the leading formation channel of massive, rapidly rotating, high-field magnetic WDs , particularly SDSS J221141.80 + 113604.4 (hereafter J2211+1136) and ZTF J190132.9 + 145808.7 (hereafter J1901 + 14588). Motivated by these findings and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) prospects, this study aims to calculate the tidal Love number, the dimensionless tidal deformability, as well as the frequency and amplitude of GWs of hot WDs. The results indicate that the tidal deformability is more pronounced in stars with higher central temperatures and lower masses, which would lead to reduced emission of GWs. In contrast, more massive stars exhibit less deformability, making them prime candidates for generating stronger GWs. Additionally, the analysis of frequency and amplitude reveals that the frequencies of high-mass binaries are smaller and evolve more rapidly, reaching a limit that aligns with the operational detection capabilities of LISA during its initial phase.</description>

      <title>A critical evaluation of the elemental abundances and evolutionary status of 15 Vul (HD 189849): The first identification of an evolved Am star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of metallic-line (Am) stars requires well determined atmospheric parameters and abundance patterns of the selected candidates. In this study, we presented a detailed abundance analysis of 15 Vul (HD 189849), identified as a marginal Am star, using a combination of equivalent width and spectrum synthesis techniques, under the LTE assumption. We compared our findings to previous analyses of the star, providing critique on both their results and our own. Our results suggest that although 15 Vul exhibits some underabundances of calcium and scandium, which are typically associated with Am stars, it might be more accurately identified as a normal A star in terms of its abundance pattern of all other elements and microturbulence velocity. The star's position on the HR diagram, along with our findings, may indicate that it is potentially a classical Am star that has evolved into the subgiant phase as a "quasi-normal" star. This may be the first identification of an evolved Am star.</description>

      <title>A reference framework for extremely metal-poor OB star studies: calibrations for stellar parameters and intrinsic colours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first reference framework for extremely metal-poor (XMP) OB-type stars. We parsed a grid of 0.10 $Z_{\odot}$ FASTWIND models, covering the parameter space of O stars and early-B supergiants, through contemporary spectral classification criteria to deliver a calibration of key stellar properties as a function of spectral type, and tabulated colours for the most common photometric systems. By using an extensive grid of models, we account for the different combinations of stellar parameters that result in the same spectral morphology and provide a range of parameters and colours compatible with each spectral subtype and luminosity class. We supply updated photometric criteria to optimize candidate selection of OB stars in XMP environments. We find 0.10 $Z_{\odot}$ OB stars are 1-6 kK hotter and produce higher ionizing fluxes than their Galactic analogues. In addition, we find a bimodal distribution of the HeII-ionizing flux with spectral type; because of its known dependence on effective temperature and the wind, $\log~q_{HeII}$ for individual XMP late-O type stars could be underestimated by up to 4 orders of magnitude by other calibrations, some of them used by population synthesis codes. Finally, we used our calibrated colours to map the extinction of the 0.10 $Z_{\odot}$ galaxy Sextans A finding that reddening is non-negligible and uneven.</description>

      <title>VIRAC2: NIR Astrometry and Time Series Photometry for 500M+ Stars from the VVV and VVVX Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present VIRAC2, a catalogue of positions, proper motions, parallaxes and $Z$, $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ near-infrared photometric time series of 545 346 537 unique stars. The catalogue is based on a point spread function fitting reduction of nearly a decade of VISTA VVV and VVVX images, which cover $560~{\rm deg}^2$ of the Southern Galactic plane and bulge. The catalogue is complete at the $&gt;90$ per cent level for $11&lt;K_s~{\rm mag}&lt;16$ sources, but extends to $K_s\approx{}17.5$ mag in most fields. Astrometric performance for $11&lt;K_s~{\rm mag}&lt;14$ sources is typically $\approx{}0.37~{\rm mas~yr}^{-1}$ per dimension for proper motion, and $1~{\rm mas}$ for parallax. At $K_s=16$ the equivalent values are around $1.5~{\rm mas~yr}^{-1}$ and $5~{\rm mas}$. These uncertainties are validated against Gaia DR3 and Hubble Space Telescope astrometry. The complete catalogues are available via the ESO archive. We perform an initial search of the catalogue for nearby ultracool dwarf candidates. In total we find 26 new sources whose parallaxes place them within 50 parsecs of the Sun. Among them we find two high-confidence T dwarfs and a number of other sources that appear to lie close to the L/T transition.</description>

      <title>Efficient Framework for Solving Plasma Waves with Arbitrary Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma, which constitutes 99\% of the visible matter in the universe, is characterized by a wide range of waves and instabilities that play a pivotal role in space physics, astrophysics, laser-plasma interactions, fusion research, and laboratory experiments. The linear physics of these phenomena is described by kinetic dispersion relations (KDR). However, solving KDRs for arbitrary velocity distributions remains a significant challenge, particularly for non-Maxwellian distributions frequently observed in various plasma environments. This work introduces a novel, efficient, and unified numerical framework to address this challenge. The proposed method rapidly and accurately yields all significant solutions of KDRs for nearly arbitrary velocity distributions, supporting both unstable and damped modes across all frequencies and wavevectors. The approach expands plasma species' velocity distribution functions using a series of carefully chosen orthogonal basis functions and employs a highly accurate rational approximation to transform the problem into an equivalent matrix eigenvalue problem, eliminating the need for initial guesses. The efficiency and versatility of this framework are demonstrated, enabling simplified studies of plasma waves with arbitrary distributions. This advancement paves the way for uncovering new physics in natural plasma environments, such as spacecraft observations in space plasmas, and applications like wave heating in fusion research.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Habitable Zones around White Dwarfs undergoing Neon-22 Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarf stars have attracted considerable attention in the past 15 years as hosts for potentially habitable planets, but their low luminosity and continuous cooling are major challenges for habitability. Recently, astronomers have found that about 6% of massive white dwarfs seem to have "paused" their cooling for up to ~10 Gyr. The leading explanation for this cooling delay is the distillation of neutron-rich isotopes such as $^{22}$Ne in the white dwarf's interior, which releases a considerable amount of gravitational energy as the star's internal structure rearranges. Here, we consider the impact of $^{22}$Ne distillation on the evolution of white dwarf habitable zones. We find that $^{22}$Ne distillation in the white dwarf host dramatically increases the time that a planet can continuously reside within the habitable zone (giving more time for life to arise) and that long-lasting habitable zones are located farther from the star (decreasing the impact of tidal forces). These properties may make white dwarfs undergoing $^{22}$Ne distillation more promising locations for habitability than white dwarfs undergoing standard cooling.</description>

      <title>BATSRUS GPU: Faster-than-Real-Time Magnetospheric Simulations with a Block-Adaptive Grid Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BATSRUS, our state-of-the-art extended magnetohydrodynamic code, is the most used and one of the most resource-consuming models in the Space Weather Modeling Framework. It has always been our objective to improve its efficiency and speed with emerging techniques, such as GPU acceleration. To utilize the GPU nodes on modern supercomputers, we port BATSRUS to GPUs with the OpenACC API. Porting the code to a single GPU requires rewriting and optimizing the most used functionalities of the original code into a new solver, which accounts for around 1% of the entire program in length. To port it to multiple GPUs, we implement a new message passing algorithm to support its unique block-adaptive grid feature. We conduct weak scaling tests on as many as 256 GPUs and find good performance. The program has 50-60% parallel efficiency on up to 256 GPUs, and up to 95% efficiency within a single node (4 GPUs). Running large problems on more than one node has reduced efficiency due to hardware bottlenecks. We also demonstrate our ability to run representative magnetospheric simulations on GPUs. The performance for a single A100 GPU is about the same as 270 AMD "Rome" CPU cores, and it runs 3.6 times faster than real time. The simulation can run 6.9 times faster than real time on four A100 GPUs.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Heating in 1D, 2D, and 3D core-collapse supernovae: characterizing the explosion of high-compactness stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars can end their lives with a successful supernova explosion (leaving behind a neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole), or a failed explosion that leaves behind a black hole. The density structure of the pre-collapse progenitor star already encodes much of the information regarding the outcome and properties of the explosion. However, the complexity of the collapse and subsequent shock expansion phases prevents drawing a straightforward connection between the pre-collapse and post-explosion properties. In order to derive such a connection several explodability studies have been performed in recent years. However, different studies can predict different explosion outcomes. In this article, we show how compactness, which is related to the average density of the star's core, has an important role in determining the efficiency of neutrino heating, and therefore the outcome of the explosion. Commonly, high-compactness progenitors are assumed to yield failed explosions, due to their large mass accretion rates, preventing the shock from expanding. We show by analyzing $\sim$ 150 2D FLASH and Fornax simulations and 20 3D Fornax simulations that this is not the case. Instead, due to the rapid increase of neutrino heating with compactness, high-compactness progenitors lead to successful shock revival. We also show that 1D+ simulations that include $\nu$-driven convection using a mixing-length theory approach correctly reproduce this trend. Finally, we compare 1D+ models, which we show can reproduce some aspects of multi-D simulations with reasonable accuracy, with other widely used 1D models in the literature.</description>

      <title>Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three $\sim 10^{6}M_\odot$ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to $\sim 10^{5}M_\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.</description>

Abstract: Supernova 2018ibb of the PISN category related to the dynamical instability of oxygen core in a supermassive star induced by pair-creation shows at the nebular stage strong [\oiii] emission lines of an uncertain origin. I propose a simple model that demonstrates a possibility of [O III] lines emission from the supernova oxygen matter ionized and heated by the $^{56}$Co radioactive decay. The reason is pinpointed by which the [O III] line luminosity among supernovae of PISN category can vary in a broad range.</description>

      <title>The I-Love universal relation for polytropic stars under Newtonian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moment of inertia and tidal deformability of idealized stars with polytropic equations of state (EOSs) are numerically calculated under both Newtonian gravity and general relativity (GR). The results explicitly confirm that the relation between the moment of inertia and tidal deformability, parameterized by the star's mass, exhibits variations of 1% to 10% for different polytropic indices in Newtonian gravity and GR, respectively. This indicates a more robust I-Love universal relation in the Newtonian framework. The theoretically derived I-Love universal relation for polytropic stars is subsequently tested against observational data for the moment of inertia and tidal deformability of the 8 planets and some moons in our solar system. The analysis reveals that the theoretical I-Love universal relation aligns well with the observational data, suggesting that it can serve as an empirical relation. Consequently, it enables the estimation of either the moment of inertia or the tidal deformability of an exoplanet if one of these quantities, along with the mass of the exoplanet, is known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present microlux, which is a Jax-based code that can compute the binary microlensing light curve and its derivatives both efficiently and accurately. The key feature of microlux is the implementation of a modified version of the adaptive sampling algorithm that was originally proposed by V. Bozza to account for the finite-source effect most efficiently. The efficiency and accuracy of microlux have been verified across the relevant parameter space for binary microlensing. As a differentiable code, microlux makes it possible to apply gradient-based algorithms to the search and posterior estimation of the microlensing modeling. As an example, we use microlux to model a real microlensing event and infer the model posterior via both Fisher information matrix and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, neither of which would have been possible without the access to accurate model gradients.</description>

      <title>Approaching ballistic motion in 3D simulations of gamma-ray burst jets in realistic binary neutron star merger environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The concomitant observation of gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger in 2017 confirmed that these events can produce relativistic jets responsible for short Gamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs). The complex interaction between the jet and the surrounding post-merger environment shapes the angular structure of the outflow, which is then imprinted in the prompt and afterglow sGRB emission. Aims. The outcome of relativistic (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of jets piercing through post-merger environments is often used as input to compute afterglow signals to be compared with observations. However, for reliable comparisons, the jet propagation should be followed until nearly ballistic regimes, in which the jet acceleration is essentially over and the angular structure is no longer evolving. This condition is typically reached in 2D simulations, but not in 3D. Our goal is to extend a (specific) jet simulation in 3D up to a nearly ballistic phase, analysing the overall dynamical evolution from the jet breakout. Methods. Our work is based on a previous 3D magnetohydrodynamic jet simulation employing a realistic environment imported from a BNS merger simulation, extended here far beyond the evolution time originally covered. After approximately 3 seconds of the jet evolution on the original spherical grid, we remap the system into a uniform Cartesian grid and reach about 10 seconds without loss of resolution. Results. The specific jet considered here struggles to pierce the dense surroundings, resulting in a rather asymmetrical emerging outflow with relatively low Lorentz factor. The analysis of the energy conversion processes and corresponding acceleration shows that at the end of our simulation 98% of the energy is in kinetic form. Moreover, at that time the angular structure is frozen. We thus obtain suitable inputs for computing the afterglow emission. Our procedure is general and applicable to any jet simulation of the same kind.</description>

      <title>Is planetary inward migration responsible for GJ 504's fast rotation and bright X-ray luminosity? New constraints from eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of an increasing variety of exoplanets in very close orbits around their host stars raised many questions about how stars and planets interact, and to which extent host stars' properties may be influenced by the presence of close-by companions. Understanding how the evolution of stars is impacted by the interactions with their planets is fundamental to disentangle their intrinsic evolution from Star-Planet Interactions (SPI)-induced phenomena. GJ 504 is a promising candidate for a star that underwent strong SPI. Its unusually short rotational period (3.4 days), while being in contrast with what is expected by single-star models, could result from the inward migration of a close-by, massive companion, pushed starward by tides. Moreover, its brighter X-ray luminosity may hint at a rejuvenation of the dynamo process sustaining the stellar magnetic field, consequent to the SPI-induced spin-up. We aim to study the evolution of GJ 504 and establish whether by invoking the engulfment of a planetary companion we can better reproduce its rotational period and X-ray luminosity. We simulate the past evolution assuming two different scenarios: 'Star without close-by planet', 'Star with close-by planet'. In the second scenario, we investigate how inward migration and planetary engulfment driven by tides spin up the stellar surface and rejuvenate its dynamo. We compare our tracks with rotational period and X-ray data collected from the all-sky surveys of the ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission (SRG). Despite the very uncertain stellar age, we found that the second evolutionary scenario is in better agreement with the short rotational period and the bright X-ray luminosity of GJ 504, thus strongly favouring the inward migration scenario over the one in which close-by planets have no tidal impact on the star.</description>

      <title>Do tides play a role in the determination of the pre-stellar core mass function?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have examined the role of tides in the star formation process. They suggest, notably, that the tides determine the characteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by preventing the collapse of density fluctuations that would become gravitationally unstable in the absence of the tidal field generated by a neighboring central mass. However, most of these studies consider the tidal collapse condition as a 1D process or use a scalar virial condition and thus neglect the anisotropy of the tidal field and its compressive effects. In the present paper, we consider a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the envelope of a central core. This perturbation is subject to a tidal field generated by the central core. We study its evolution taking dynamical effects and the anisotropy of the tides into account. Based on the general tensorial virial equations, we determine a new collapse condition that takes these mechanisms into account. We identify two regimes: (i) a weak tidal regime in which the dynamics of the perturbation is only slightly modified by the action of the tides and (ii) a strong tidal regime in which the density threshold for collapse can potentially be increased due to the combined effects of the tides and the rotational support generated by the tidal synchronization of the perturbation with the orbital motion. In the case of a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the vicinity of a first Larson core, we show that the density threshold above which the perturbation collapses is increased only for low-mass perturbations (less than 2.7 solar mass) and only by at most a factor of 1.5. We conclude that tides likely do not play a major role in the process of star formation or in the determination of the characteristic mass of the IMF. We propose an alternative explanation for the observed value of the characteristic mass of the IMF.</description>

      <title>Numerical viscosity and resistivity in MHD turbulence simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations require understanding numerical dissipation. We quantify numerical viscosity and resistivity in subsonic (M=0.1) and supersonic (M=10) turbulence regimes. The hydrodynamic (Re) and magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) on the turbulence driving scale l_turb in a cubic domain of side length L with N^3 resolution elements are well-described by Re=[2(N/N_Re)(l_turb/L)]^p_Re and Rm=[2(N/N_Rm)(l_turb/L)]^p_Rm. We provide two sets of fit values of (N_Re,p_Re,N_Rm,p_Rm): one with p_Re &amp; p_Rm fixed at their theoretical values, and the other one allowing all 4 parameters to vary. The sets for M=0.1 are (1.57_{-0.12}^{+0.10},4/3,1.55_{-0.14}^{+0.45},4/3) and (0.83_{-0.08}^{+0.09},1.20_{-0.02}^{+0.02},4.19_{-4.05}^{+2.95},1.60_{-0.33}^{+0.18}), respectively. For M=10, they are (3.55_{-0.56}^{+0.78},3/2,1.03_{-0.11}^{+0.12},3/2) and (10.46_{-0.85}^{+0.96},1.90_{-0.04}^{+0.04},0.44_{-0.23}^{+0.61},1.32_{-0.09}^{+0.17}). The resulting magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm=Rm/Re) are consistent with constant values of 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for M=0.1, and 6.2_{-4.8}^{+5.6} for M=10. These apply when the magnetic energy (E_mag) is &lt;10% of the kinetic energy (E_kin). When E_mag/E_kin~0.1-1, Rm is reduced by a factor~3 (increase in N_Rm by a factor~2) for M=0.1, while Rm for M=10 and Re (for any M) remain largely unaffected. We compare our Re-N relation with 14 other simulations from the literature, employing various numerical methods (with &amp; without Riemann solvers, different reconstruction schemes &amp; orders, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and find agreement within a factor of 3. Additionally, we compare these results to target Re and Rm values from simulations with explicit dissipation. These comparisons and our relations help users determine the Re and Rm achievable at a given N, ensuring physical dissipation dominates over numerical dissipation.</description>

      <title>Low-mass Runaways from the Orion Nebula Cluster -- Kinematic Age Constraints on Star Cluster Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their early, formative stages star clusters can undergo rapid dynamical evolution leading to strong gravitational interactions and ejection of "runaway" stars at high velocities. While O/B runaway stars have been well studied, lower-mass runaways are so far very poorly characterised, even though they are expected to be much more common. We carried out spectroscopic observations with MAG2-MIKE to follow-up 27 high priority candidate runaways consistent with having been ejected from the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) &gt; 2.5 Myr ago, based on Gaia astrometry. We derive spectroscopic youth indicators (Li &amp; H${\alpha}$) and radial velocities, enabling detection of bona fide runaway stars via signatures of youth and 3D traceback. We successfully confirmed 11 of the candidates as low-mass Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) on the basis of our spectroscopic criteria and derived radial velocities (RVs) with which we performed 3D traceback analysis. Three of these confirmed YSOs have kinematic ejection ages &gt; 4 Myr, with the oldest being 4.7 Myr. Assuming that these stars indeed formed in the ONC and were then ejected, this yields an estimate for the overall formation time of the ONC to be at least ${\sim}$ 5 Myr, i.e., about 10 free-fall times, and with a mean star formation efficiency per free-fall time of ${\bar{\epsilon}_{ff}} {\lesssim}$ 0.05. These results favor a scenario of slow, quasi-equilibrium star cluster formation, regulated by magnetic fields and/or protostellar outflow feedback.</description>

      <title>Early Grain Growth in the Young Protostellar Disk HH 212 Supported by Dust Self-Scattering Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grain growth in disks around young stars plays a crucial role in the formation of planets. Early grain growth has been suggested in the HH 212 protostellar disk by previous polarization observations. To confirm it and to determine the grain size, we analyze high-resolution multi-band observations of the disk obtained with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Bands 9 (0.4 mm), 7 (0.9 mm), 6 (1.3 mm), 3 (3 mm) as well as with Very Large Array (VLA) in Band Ka (9 mm) and present new VLA data in Bands Q (7 mm), K (1.3 cm), and X (3 cm). We adopt a parameterized flared disk model to fit the continuum maps of the disk in these bands and derive the opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index $\mathrm{\beta}$ of the dust in the disk, taking into account the dust scattering ignored in the previous work modeling the multi-band data of this source. For the VLA bands, we only include the Band Q data in our modeling to avoid free-free emission contamination. The obtained opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index $\beta$ (with a value of $\sim$ 1.2) suggest that the upper limit of maximum grain size in the disk be $\sim$ 130 $\mu$m, consistent with that implied in the previous polarization observations in Band 7, supporting the grain growth in this disk. The values of the absorption opacities further highlight the need for a new dust composition model for Class 0/I disks.</description>

      <title>From Out of the Blue: Swift Links 2002es-like, 2003fg-like, and Early-Time Bump Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We collect a sample of 42 SNe Ia with Swift UV photometry and well-measured early-time light curve rises and find that 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia have different pre-peak UV color evolutions compared to normal SNe Ia and other spectroscopic subtypes. Specifically, 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia are cleanly separated from other SNe Ia subtypes by UVM2-UVW1&gt;=1.0~mag at 10 days prior to B-band maximum. Furthermore, the SNe Ia that exhibit non-monotonic bumps in their rising light curves, to date, consist solely of 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia. We also find that SNe Ia with two-component power-law rises are more luminous than SNe Ia with single-component power-law rises at pre-peak epochs. Given the similar UV colors, along with other observational similarities, we discuss a possible progenitor scenario that places 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia along a continuum and may explain the unique UV colors, early-time bumps, and other observational similarities between these objects. Ultimately, further observations of both subtypes, especially in the near-infrared, are critical for constraining models of these peculiar thermonuclear explosions.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Jupiter Analog Misaligned to the Inner Planetary System in HD 73344</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a Jupiter-like planet, HD 73344 d ($m_{d}=2.55^{+0.56}_{-0.46}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $a_{d}=6.70^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$ AU, $e_{d}=0.18^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$) based on 27-year radial velocity observations. HD 73344 also hosts a compact inner planetary system, including a transiting sub-Neptune HD 73344 b ($P_{b}=15.61\ \mathrm{days}$, $r_{b}=2.88^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\ \mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) and a non-transiting Saturn-mass planet ($P_{c}=65.936\ \mathrm{days}$, $m_{c}\sin{i_c}=0.36^{+0.02}_{-0.02}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$). By analyzing TESS light curves, we identified a stellar rotation period of $9.03\pm{1.3}$ days. Combining this with $v\sin{i_*}$ measurements from stellar spectra, we derived a stellar inclination of $63.6^{+17.4}_{-16.5}\ \rm{deg} $. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we characterized the three-dimensional orbit of the outer giant planet and constrained its mutual inclination relative to the innermost transiting planet to be $46 &lt;\Delta I_{bd}&lt; 134\ \rm{deg}\ (1\sigma)$ and $20 &lt;\Delta I_{bd}&lt; 160\ \rm{deg}\ (2\sigma)$, strongly disfavoring coplanar architectures. Our analytical calculations and N-body simulation reveal that the two inner planets are strongly coupled with each other and undergo nodal precession together around the orbital axis of the giant planet. During nodal precession, the orbital inclination of inner planets oscillate with time and therefore become misaligned relative to the stellar spin axis. The formation of such systems suggests a history of planet-planet scattering or misalignment between the inner and outer components of protoplanetary disks. The upcoming release of Gaia DR4 will uncover more systems similar to HD 73344 and enable the study of the flatness of exoplanet systems with a mixture of inner and outer planetary systems on a statistical level.</description>

      <title>Investigating cannibalistic millisecond pulsar binaries using MESA: New constraints from pulsar spin and mass evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with orbital periods $\lesssim1$d are key to understanding binary evolution involving massive neutron stars (NSs). Due to the ablation of the companion by the rapidly spinning pulsar, these systems are also known as spiders and categorized into two main branches: redbacks (RBs; companion mass in the range of 0.1 to 0.5\,\Msun) and black widows (BWs; companion mass $\lesssim$\,0.1\,\Msun). We present models of low- and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries and compare them with observations of Galactic spiders (including the presence or absence of hydrogen lines in their optical spectra), and we constrain and quantify the interaction between the pulsar and the companion. Using MESA, we created the allowed initial parameter space. For the first time in MESA, we also included the detailed evolution of the pulsar spin and modeled the irradiation of the companion by the pulsar wind. Efficient mass accretion onto the NS (at least $70\%$ of the mass transferred is accreted) with an X-ray irradiated disk followed by strong irradiation of the companion can explain most of the properties of the observed spiders. Our RB evolutionary tracks continue to the BW regime, connecting the two branches of spiders. Our models explain the lack of hydrogen in some observed BWs with ultra-light companions. During accretion induced spin up, the mass required to spin up an NS to sub-milliseconds is high enough to collapse it into a black hole. Finally, after analyzing the formation of RB-like spiders with giant companions and orbital periods of several days (huntsmen), we conclude that they are unlikely to produce super-massive NSs (maximum accreted mass $\lesssim$0.5M$_{\odot}$). Cannibalistic MSP binary formation depends heavily on the interplay between accretion onto the pulsar and pulsar wind irradiation.</description>

      <title>Off-centre ignition of sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs does not resolve the tension with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation of type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white-dwarf (WD) stars, but the exact nature of their progenitor systems remains uncertain. Recent studies have suggested that a propagating detonation within a thin helium shell surrounding a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO core can subsequently trigger a detonation within the core (the double-detonation model, DDM). The resulting explosion resembles a central ignition of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD (SCD), which is known to be in tension with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation, where $t_0$ (the $\gamma$-rays' escape time from the ejecta) is positively correlated with $M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ (the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass). SCD predicts an anticorrelation between $t_0$ and $M_{\rm{Ni}56}$, with $t_0\mathord{\approx}30\,\textrm{day}$ for luminous ($M_{\rm{Ni}56}\gtrsim0.5\,M_{\odot}$) SNe Ia, while the observed $t_0$ is in the range of 35-45 day. In this study, we apply our recently developed numerical scheme to calculate in 2D the impact of off-centre ignition in sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD, aiming to better emulate the behaviour expected in the DDM scenario. Our calculations of the $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation, which do not require radiation transfer calculations, achieve convergence to within a few per cent with a numerical resolution of $\mathord{\sim}1\,\rm{km}$. We find that the results only slightly depend on the ignition location, mirroring the SCD model, and consequently, the discrepancy with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation remains unresolved.</description>
