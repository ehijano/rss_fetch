      <title>Displacement Current in Classical and Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is certain that electrical properties-whether slow (sec) or fast (nsec), even optical (fsec)-are described by Maxwell's equations, and there are terms that depend on the rate of change of the electric and magnetic fields. In particular, Maxwell's equation for the curl of the magnetic field contains both the steady current and a term depending upon the temporal derivative of the electric displacement field. The latter is referred to as displacement current, and is generally believed to have been included originally by Maxwell himself, although there is evidence it was earlier considered by Kirchhoff. Maxwell's equations and Kirchoff's circuit laws both are important over the wide range of frequencies with which electronics traditionally deals. And, displacement current is an important contribution to these in both classical and quantum mechanics. Here, the development of displacement current, its importance in both classical and quantum mechanics, and some applications are provided to illustrate the fundamental role that it plays in the dynamics of a wide range of systems.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum of radiation from ultrarelativistic charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The angular momentum of radiation from an arbitrarily moving relativistic charge is studied. The angular momentum is presented as the sum of the angular momentum relative to the point where the charge is located at a retarded moment of time and the angular momentum relative to an arbitrary stationary center. In particular, the instantaneous center of curvature of the trajectory is considered as such a center. Explicit expressions for the angular distribution of these components of angular momentum fluxes are obtained and studied. It is shown that the angular momentum of the field relative to the position of the charge is determined only by the properties of the electromagnetic radiation field, and the angular momentum relative to an arbitrarily distant point is the vector product of the displacement of this point and the force corresponding to radiation pressure. It is shown that in the ultrarelativistic limit, the canonical angular momentum of the radiation coincides with the angular momentum following from the symmetrized energy-momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Theory of perturbation of the magnetostatic field by an anisotropic magnetic toroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perturbation of a magnetostatic field by a toroid made of a homogeneous anisotropic magnetic material was formulated using the solutions of the Laplace equation in the toroidal coordinate system. That was straightforward in the region outside the toroid, but an affine coordinate transformation had to be employed inside the toroid. The coefficients of the series expansion of the perturbation potential in terms of appropriate toroidal basis functions were related to the coefficients of the series expansion of the source potential in terms of appropriate toroidal basis functions by a transition matrix. As a result of the solution of this novel problem, the consequences of material anisotropy on perturbing the magnetostatic field are clearly evident in the region near the toroid.</description>

      <title>Even More Generalized Hamiltonian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the procedure to derive from an action-based variational principle the classical equations of motion in Hamiltonian phase space of a particle subject to general position and velocity dependent non-holonomic equality constraints. Key to the procedure is our introduction of Flannery brackets, which generalize Poisson brackets. We conjecture on some implications, including the possibility of replacing Poisson brackets with Flannery brackets in Dirac's brackets to provide the quantization procedure for general non-holonomic equality constraint systems.</description>

      <title>Electrical and Thermal Conductivity of Complex-Shaped Contact Spots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the electrical and thermal conductivity of complex contact spots on the surface of a half-space. Employing an in-house Fast Boundary Element Method implementation, various complex geometries were studied. Our investigation begins with annulus contact spots to assess the impact of connectedness. We then study shape effects on "multi-petal" spots exhibiting dihedral symmetry, resembling flowers, stars, and gears. The analysis culminates with self-affine shapes, representing a multiscale generalization of the multi-petal forms. In each case, we introduce appropriate normalizations and develop phenomenological models. For multi-petal shapes, our model relies on a single geometric parameter: the normalized number of "petals". This approach inspired the form of the phenomenological model for self-affine spots, which maintains physical consistency and relies on four geometric characteristics: standard deviation, second spectral moment, Nayak parameter, and Hurst exponent. As a by-product, these models enabled us to suggest flux estimations for an infinite number of petals and the fractal limit. This study represents an initial step into understanding the conductivity of complex contact interfaces, which commonly occur in the contact of rough surfaces.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of reverberation theory in a diffuse sound field by using reflection orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The room acoustics was established based on Sabine's reverberation theory. However, in Sabine's theory, the reverberation time does not reach zero, even if the absolute absorption condition is satisfied. Eyring revised the reverberation theory to resolve this contradiction. However, Eyring's theory is inconsistent in its formulation of the steady state and decay processes. Therefore, the author has revised Sabine's theory (Hanyu, Acoustical Science &amp; Technology 45, 3, 2024), taking a different approach from that of Eyring. This revised theory was constructed by introducing the concept of "reverberation of a direct sound". In this paper, a new mathematical model of reverberation using reflection orders is proposed. This means that the revised theory already proposed by the author is reconstructed to include the temporal energy distributions in each reflection order. The new mathematical model also uses the concept of "reverberation of a direct sound" but describes the reverberation of only reflected sounds without the direct sound. This means that the concept of "reverberation of a direct sound" is essential also to the entire reverberation process. Reverberation decay of the new model is consistent with that of the already proposed revised theory. The new model showed good correspondence with the simulation results.</description>
