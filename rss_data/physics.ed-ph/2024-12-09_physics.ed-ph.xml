      <title>Raspberry Pi multispectral imaging camera system (PiMICS): a low-cost, skills-based physics educational tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an educational pilot program for low-cost physics experimentation run in Ecuador, South Africa, and the United States. The program was developed after having needs-based discussions with African educators, researchers, and leaders. It was determined that the need and desire for low-cost, skills-building, and active-learning tools is very high. From this, we developed a 3D-printable, Raspberry Pi-based multispectral camera (15 to 25 spectral channels in the visible and near-IR) for as little as $100. The program allows students to learn 3D modeling, 3D printing, feedback, control, image analysis, Python programming, systems integration and artificial intelligence as well as spectroscopy. After completing their cameras, the students in the program studied plant health, plant stress, post-harvest fruit ripeness, and polarization and spectral analysis of nanostructured insect wings, the latter of which won the ``best-applied research" award at a conference poster session and will be highlighted in this paper. Importantly, these cameras can be an integral part of any developing country's agricultural, recycling, medical, and pharmaceutical infrastructure. Thus, we believe this experiment can play an important role at the intersection of student training and developing countries' capacity building.</description>

      <title>A story with twists and turns: How to control the rotation of the notched stick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notched stick, also known as the Gee-Haw-Whammy-Diddle, is a wooden toy able to convert linear vibration into rotational motion, whose behavior has been intriguing both children and physicists for decades. Here we derive an analytical model of the system, supported by experimental results. We predict the direction of rotation, and explain why the device is so easy to operate, even without fine control of the various parameters. The potential importance of the vertical displacement of the finger exerting the perturbation force is also highlighted. We finally discuss similarities between the mechanical system described here and the optical effect of birefringence.</description>

      <title>How many lives does Schr\"odinger's cat have?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger's cat is an iconic example for the problem of the transition from the microscopic quantum world to the macroscopic, classical one. It opened many interesting questions such as, could a macroscopic superposition like a dead and alive cat ever exist? What would be the characteristic features of such a system? The field of macroscopicity aims at providing answers to those questions, both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view. Here, we present the main concepts in macroscopicity, including macroscopicity measures, experimental realizations and the link to metrology, from a pedagogical perspective. We provide visualizations and intuitive explanations, together with a hands-on activity where students can create their own macroscopic quantum cats from cardboard cells that are in a superposition of being dead and alive.</description>

      <title>Using skateboarding to develop a culturally relevant tutorial on static equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP), initially developed by Ladson-Billings, is an instructional framework for supporting diverse learners by drawing on their cultural backgrounds and experiences. In line with the CRP framework, we developed a tutorial on static equilibrium using skateboarding, a popular activity on university campuses, as a culturally relevant context. To address specific student conceptions about static equilibrium documented in the physics education research (PER) literature, we used the elicit-confront-resolve (ECR) strategy to develop the tutorial. In this paper, we provide a detailed account of how we operationalized the ECR strategy in designing the sequences of questions in the tutorial. Additionally, we present anecdotal evidence to show that the culturally relevant tutorial appears to effectively engage students and motivate their interest in learning physics.</description>
