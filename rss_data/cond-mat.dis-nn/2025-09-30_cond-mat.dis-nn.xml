      <title>Anderson localization: a density matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anderson localization is a quantum phenomenon in which disorder localizes electronic wavefunctions. In this work, we propose a new approach to study Anderson localization based on the density matrix formalism. Drawing an analogy to the standard transfer matrix method, we extract the localization length from the modular density matrix in quasi-one-dimensional systems. This approach successfully captures the metal-insulator transition in the three-dimensional Anderson model and in the two-dimensional Anderson model with spin-orbit coupling. It can be also readily extended to multiorbital systems. We further generalize the formalism to interacting systems, showing that the one-dimensional spinless attractive model exhibits the expected metallic phase, consistent with previous studies. More importantly, we demonstrate the existence of a two-dimensional metallic phase in the presence of Hubbard interactions and disorder. This method offers a new perspective on Anderson localization and its interplay with interactions.</description>

      <title>Why is topology hard to learn?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much attention has been devoted to the use of machine learning to approximate physical concepts. Yet, due to challenges in interpretability of machine learning techniques, the question of what physics machine learning models are able to learn remains open. Here we bridge the concept a physical quantity and its machine learning approximation in the context of the original application of neural networks in physics: topological phase classification. We construct a hybrid tensor-neural network object that exactly expresses real space topological invariant and rigorously assess its trainability and generalization. Specifically, we benchmark the accuracy and trainability of a tensor-neural network to multiple types of neural networks, thus exemplifying the differences in trainability and representational power. Our work highlights the challenges in learning topological invariants and constitutes a stepping stone towards more accurate and better generalizable machine learning representations in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Topological protection breakdown: a route to frustrated ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14646v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phases manifesting topological patterns in functional systems, like ferroelectric and ferromagnetic vortex superlattices, can manifest intricate and apparently ungovernable behavior, typical of frustrated non-ergodic states with high-dimensional energy landscapes. This is also the case for potassium-tantalate-niobate (KTN) crystals. These transparent ferroelectrics manifest remarkable but little-understood metastable domain patterns at optical (micrometer and above) scales near the cubic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition. Here, we formulate the Topological Breakdown Model based on the competition between intrinsic scales of domain-domain collinear and non-collinear interactions associated with polarization-charge screening. The model is able to explain observed KTN mesoscopic domain patterns and phase diagram as a function of temperature and external electric field. Findings include a precise set of sharp and broad percolative transitions that are experimentally verified, validating our model. Our study identifies the central role played by competing topologically protected states, identifying a fundamental link between topological protection and frustration that supports a hitherto unexplored functional non-ergodic arena.</description>
