      <title>Pseudo-Anosov subgroups of surface bundles over tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that finitely generated, purely pseudo-Anosov subgroups of the fundamental groups of surface bundles over tori are convex cocompact as subgroups of the mapping class group via the Birman exact sequence. This generalizes the fact that similar groups within fibered 3-manifold groups are convex cocompact, which is a combination of results due to Dowdall, Kent, Leininger, Russell, and Schleimer.</description>

      <title>Equivalences of racks, Legendrian racks, and symmetric racks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08090v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Racks and Legendrian racks are nonassociative algebraic structures based on the framed and Legendrian Reidemeister moves, respectively. Motivated by the classification problem for Legendrian knots, we construct an equivalence of categories between racks and Legendrian racks (and, hence, GL-quandles). We deduce equivalences between kink-involutory racks and Legendrian quandles, involutory racks and Legendrian kei, and the respective pairs of full subcategories whose objects are medial.
  As applications, we classify objects in these categories up to order 8 and classify several families of symmetric racks; these results are likely to be of independent interest. In particular, the categories of kei with good involutions, Legendrian kei, and involutory racks are all equivalent.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Anosov action on the $SU(2)$-character variety of $S_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we continue the study of the action of subgroups of the mapping class group on the $SU(2)$-character variety. We prove the existence of a mapping class subgroup on the surface of genus $2$, containing infinitely many pseudo-Anosov elements, which admit an invariant rational function on $SU(2)$-character variety of $S_2$.</description>

      <title>The Links-Gould invariant as a classical generalization of the Alexander polynomial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we conjecture that the Links-Gould invariant of links, that we know is a generalization of the Alexander-Conway polynomial, shares some of its classical features. In particular it seems to give a lower bound for the genus of links and to provide a criterion for fiberedness of knots. We give some evidence for these two assumptions.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons potentials of higher-dimensional Pontryagin densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the Chern-Simons potentials given the Pontryagin densities in arbitrary even dimensions $ D\geq4 $. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Pontryagin densities in $ D=4n-2 \, (n \geq 2) $ dimensions. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential of the Pontryagin density given an arbitrary even dimension.</description>

      <title>Geometric universal Jones invariant from configurations on ovals in the disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct geometrically a universal Jones invariant as a limit of invariants given by graded intersections in configuration spaces. For any fixed level $\mathcal N$, we construct a new knot invariant, called "$\mathcal N^{th}$ Unified Jones invariant" globalising topologically all coloured Jones polynomials at levels less than $\mathcal N$. It is defined via the set of intersection points between Lagrangian submanifolds supported on arcs and ovals in the disc.
  Habiro's famous invariant for knots is a universal invariant recovering each coloured Jones polynomial. Willetts modified Habiro's ring and defined a universal invariant recovering coloured Jones polynomials and the ADO invariant divided by the Alexander polynomials. The universal Jones invariant that we construct belongs to a different ring that comes with a map to Habiro-Willetts's ring. We prove that our invariant recovers Habiro-Willetts's invariant. The difference is that our invariant is constructed as a limit of new knot invariants, the $\mathcal N^{th}$ unified Jones invariants. These invariants in turn provide a geometrical understanding of sets of all coloured Jones polynomials of bounded colour, collecting more information as we increase the colour.
  This article provides part of the set-up for a sequel, where we construct geometrically two universal link invariants. These invariants, universal Jones link invariant and universal ADO link invariant, globalise all coloured Jones polynomials and all ADO link invariants respectively. They are constructed as limits of link invariants that see all coloured Jones link invariants and coloured Alexander link invariants with bounded (multi) colours respectively. This answers the open problem of defining universal non-semisimple link invariants.</description>

      <title>Nonperiodic leaves of codimension one foliations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we exhibit examples of $5$-manifolds that are not homeomorphic to any leaf of any $C^2$ codimension one foliation of any compact $6$-manifold but are homeomorphic to (proper) leaves of some $C^1$ codimension one foliations and also to (proper) leaves of some $C^\inf$ codimension $2$ foliations. As far as we know, this is the first example of this nature. In addition, it is shown examples of $C^{r}$ codimension one foliations, $r\in[0,2)$, with a minimal invariant set whose leaves are pairwise nonhomeomorphic.</description>

      <title>Torsion elements in the associated graded of the $Y$-filtration of the monoid of homology cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clasper surgery induces the $Y$-filtration $\{Y_n\mathcal{IC}\}_n$ over the monoid of homology cylinders, which serves as a $3$-dimensional analogue of the lower central series of the Torelli group of a surface. In this paper, we investigate the torsion submodules of the associated graded modules of these filtrations. To detect torsion elements, we introduce a homomorphism on $Y_n\mathcal{IC}/Y_{n+1}$ induced by the degree $n+2$ part of the LMO functor. Additionally, we provide a formula that computes this homomorphism under clasper surgery, and use it to demonstrate that every non-trivial torsion element in $Y_6\mathcal{IC}/Y_7$ has order $3$.</description>

      <title>On the topology of $B\Gamma_n^\mathbb{C}$ and its application to complex structures on open manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the 1970s, it has been known that any open connected manifold of dimension 2, 4 or 6 admits a complex analytic structure whenever its tangent bundle admits a complex linear structure. For half a century, this has been conjectured to hold true for manifolds of any dimension. In this paper, we extend the result to manifolds of dimension 8 and 10. The result is proved by applying Gromov's h-principle in order to adapt a method of Haefliger, originally used to study foliations, to the holomorphic setting. For dimension 12 and greater, the conjecture remains open.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of double cosets and fundamental domains for the subgroups of the modular group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.1340</link>
      <description>arXiv:0901.1340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As noticed by R.~Kulkarni, the conjugacy classes of subgroups of the modular group correspond bijectively to bipartite cuboid graphs. We'll explain how to recover the graph corresponding to a subgroup $G$ of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ from the combinatorics of the right action of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on the right cosets $G\setminus\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. This gives a method of constructing nice fundamental domains (which Kulkarni calls "special polygons") for the action of $G$ on the upper half plane.
  For the classical congruence subgroups $\Gamma_0(N)$, $\Gamma_1(N)$, $\Gamma(N)$ etc. the number of operations the method requires is the index times something that grows not faster than a polynomial in $\log N$. This is roughly the square root of the number of operations required by the naive procedure. We give algorithms to locate an element of the upper half-plane on the fundamental domain and to write a given element of $G$ as a product of independent generators. We also (re)prove a few related results about the automorphism groups of modular curves. For example, we give a simple proof that the automorphism group of $X(N)$ is $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/N)/\{\pm I\}$.</description>

      <title>On the Marinus--Ptolemy and Delisle--Euler conical maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine connections between the mathematics behind methods of drawing geographical maps due, on the one hand to Marinos and Ptolemy (1st-2nd c. CE) and on the other hand to Delisle and Euler (18th century). A recent work by the first two authors of this article shows that methods of Delisle and Euler for drawing geographical maps, which are improvements of methods of Marinus and Ptolemy, are best among a collection of geographical maps we term ``conical''. This is an instance where after practitioners and craftsmen (here, geographers) have used a certain tool during several centuries, mathematicians prove that this tool is indeed optimal. Many connections among geography, astronomy and geometry are highlighted. The fact that the Marinos--Ptolemy and the Delisle--Euler methods of drawing geographical maps share many non-trivial properties is an important instance of historical continuity in mathematics.</description>

      <title>A study of braids arising from simple choreographies of the planar Newtonian N-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study periodic solutions of the planar Newtonian $N$-body problem with equal masses. Each periodic solution traces out a braid with $N$ strands in 3-dimensional space. When the braid is of pseudo-Anosov type, it has an associated stretch factor greater than 1, which reflects the complexity of the corresponding periodic solution. For each $N \ge 3$, Guowei Yu established the existence of a family of simple choreographies to the planar Newtonian $N$-body problem. We prove that braids arising from Yu's periodic solutions are of pseudo-Anosov types, except in the special case where all particles move along a circle. We also identify the simple choreographies whose braid types have the largest and smallest stretch factors, respectively.</description>
