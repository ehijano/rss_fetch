      <title>Classifying Isolated Symplectic Singularities via 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Coulomb Branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Decay and Fission Conjecture, we provide a classification of unitary quivers whose 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Coulomb branches exhibit isolated singularities. This yields the complete list of isolated conical symplectic singularities that can arise in this way. In the process, we identify three new families of stable quivers: two giving rise to previously unknown isolated symplectic singularities, and one offering a novel realization of a known family.</description>

      <title>von Neumann Subfactors and Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the language of von Neumann subfactors to investigate non-invertible symmetries in two dimensions. A fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$, its module category $\mathcal{M}$, and a gauging labeled by an algebra object $\mathcal{A}$ are encoded in the bipartite principal graph of a subfactor. The dual principal graph captures the quantum symmetry $\mathcal{C}'$ obtained by gauging $\mathcal{A}$ in $\mathcal{C}$, as well as a reverse gauging back to $\mathcal{C}$. From a given subfactor $N \subset M$, we derive a quiver diagram that encodes the representations of the associated non-invertible symmetry. We show how this framework provides necessary conditions for admissible gaugings, enabling the construction of generalized orbifold groupoids. To illustrate this strategy, we present three examples: Rep$(D_4)$ as a warm-up, the higher-multiplicity case Rep$(A_4)$ with its associated generalized orbifold groupoid and triality symmetry, and Rep$(A_5)$, where $A_5$ is the smallest non-solvable finite group. For applications to gapless systems, we embed these generalized gaugings as global manipulations on the conformal manifolds of $c=1$ CFTs and uncover new self-dualities in the exceptional $SU(2)_1/A_5$ theory. For $\mathcal{C}$-symmetric TQFTs, we use the subfactor-derived quiver diagrams to characterize gapped phases, describe their vacuum structure, and classify the recently proposed particle-soliton degeneracies.</description>

      <title>A disorder-averaged framework for evaluating the Witten index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric indices in disordered systems, in particular an $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev-type quantum mechanics. In cases where the disordered parameters do not affect the index, we explain how the exact answer can nevertheless be obtained using disorder averaged collective variables. Furthermore, when disorder averaging is performed on multiple copies of the same theory, non-trivial coupling between them is generated. We show how the index ultimately remains factorized.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic angle-dependent gauge transformations at null infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logarithmic angle-dependent gauge transformations are symmetries of electromagnetism that are canonically conjugate to the standard $\mathcal O(1)$ angle-dependent $u(1)$ transformations. They were exhibited a few years ago at spatial infinity. In this paper, we derive their explicit form at null infinity. We also derive the expression there of the associated "conserved" surface integrals. To that end, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the behaviour of the electromagnetic vector potential $A_\mu$ in the vicinity of null infinity for generic initial conditions given on a Cauchy hypersurface. This behaviour is given by a polylogarithmic expansion involving both gauge-invariant logarithmic terms also present in the field strengths and gauge-variant logarithmic terms with physical content, which we identify. We show on which explicit terms, and how, do the logarithmic angle-dependent gauge transformations act. Other results of this paper are a derivation of the matching conditions for the Goldstone boson and for the conserved charges of the angle-dependent $u(1)$ asymptotic symmetries, as well as a clarification of a misconception concerning the non-existence of these angle-dependent $u(1)$ charges in the presence of logarithms at null infinity. We also briefly comment on higher spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Emergence of $F^4$-couplings in Heterotic/Type IIA Dual String Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M-theoretic emergence proposal claims that in an isotropic decompactification limit to M-theory the full effective action is generated via quantum effects by integrating out only the light towers of states of the theory. In the BPS particle sector, these include transversally wrapped $M2$- and $M5$-branes possibly carrying Kaluza-Klein momentum. This implies that a longitudinally wrapped $M5$-brane, i.e. a wrapped $D4$-brane, is not to be included in emergence computations. In this work we collect explicit evidence supporting this point by examining an $F^4$ gauge coupling in six dimensions, making use of the duality between heterotic string theory on $T^4$ and strongly coupled type IIA on K3. In this instance, the M-theoretic emergence proposal can be viewed as a tool for making predictions for the microscopic behavior of string theoretic amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that any Euclidean-time quantum mechanical theory may be represented as a neural network, ensured by the Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\`eve theorem, mean-square path continuity, and finite two-point functions. The additional constraint of reflection positivity, which is related to unitarity, may be achieved by a number of mechanisms, such as imposing neural network parameter space splitting or the Markov property. Non-differentiability of the networks is related to the appearance of non-trivial commutators. Neural networks acting on Markov processes are no longer Markov, but still reflection positive, which facilitates the definition of deep neural network quantum systems. We illustrate these principles in several examples using numerical implementations, recovering classic quantum mechanical results such as Heisenberg uncertainty, non-trivial commutators, and the spectrum.</description>

      <title>The off-shell one- and two-loop box recovered from intersection theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We advertise intersection theory for generalised hypergeometric functions as a means of evaluating Mellin-Barnes representations. As an example, we study two-parameter representations of the off-shell one- and two-loop box graphs in exactly four-dimensional configuration space. Closing the integration contours for the MB parameters we transform these into double sums. Polygamma functions in the MB representation of the double box and the occurrence of higher poles are taken into account by parametric differentiation. Summing over any one of the counters results into a $_{p+1}F_p$ that we replace by its Euler integral representation. The process can be repeated a second time and results in a two- or four-parameter Euler integral, respectively. We use intersection theory to derive Pfaffian systems of equations on related sets of master integrals and solve for the box and double box integrals reproducing the known expressions. Finally, we use a trick to re-derive the double box from a two-parameter Euler integral. This second computation requires only very little computing resources.</description>

      <title>Graphical functions with spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of graphical functions is generalized from scalar theories to theories with spin, leading to a numerator structure in Feynman integrals. The main part of this article treats the case of positive integer spin, which is obtained from spin $1/2$ theories after the evaluation of $\gamma$ traces.
  As an application (in this article used mainly to prove consistency and efficiency of the method), we calculate Feynman periods in Yukawa-$\phi^4$ (Gross-Neveu-Yukawa) theory up to loop order eight.</description>

      <title>Strict renormalizability as a paradigm for fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important theoretical achievement of the last century was the realization that strict renormalizability can be a powerful criterion to select Lagrangians in the framework of perturbative quantum field theory. The Standard Model Lagrangian (without gravity) is strictly renormalizable from a perturbative point of view. On the other hand, the inclusion of gravity seems not to respect this criterion, since general relativity is perturbatively non-renormalizable. The aim of this work is to provide concrete evidence that strict renormalizability is still a valid criterion even when applied to gravity. First, we show that adding quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action gives rise to a strictly renormalizable theory known as quadratic gravity. Second, we argue that this unique theory represents the most conservative approach to quantum gravity and, at the same time, is highly predictive, as it can explain new physics beyond general relativity already in the sub-Planckian regime. In particular, it provides one of the best fits to the CMB anisotropies via Starobinsky inflation and makes sharp cosmological predictions that can be tested in the near future. Finally, we comment on the (super-)Planckian regime and conclude with a historical note.</description>

      <title>The complete trans-series for conserved charges in the Lieb-Liniger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the complete trans-series solution for the (non-relativistic) moments of the rapidity density in the Lieb-Liniger model. The trans-series is written explicitly in terms of a perturbative basis, which can be obtained from the already known perturbative expansion of the density by solving several ordinary differential equations. Unknown integration constants are fixed from Volin's method. We have checked that our solution satisfies the analytical consistency requirements including the newly derived resurgence relations and agrees with the high precision numerical solution. Our results also provides the full analytic trans-series for the capacitance of the coaxial circular plate capacitor.</description>

      <title>A Lorentz Covariant Matrix Model for Bosonic M2-Branes: Nambu Brackets and Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Lorentz covariant matrix model as a nonperturbative formulation of the bosonic M2-brane in M-theory. Unlike previous approaches relying on the light-cone gauge or symmetry-based constructions, our model retains full 11-dimensional Lorentz invariance by introducing a novel gauge-fixing condition that restricts the symmetry of volume-preserving deformations (VPD) to a subclass, which we call restricted VPD (RVPD). This restriction enables a consistent matrix regularization of the Nambu bracket, bypassing the long-standing obstructions related to the Leibniz rule and the Fundamental Identity. The resulting model exhibits RVPD symmetry, admits particle-like and noncommutative membrane solutions, and lays the foundation for a Lorentz-invariant, nonperturbative matrix description of M2-branes. Our work offers a new paradigm for constructing Lorentz-invariant matrix models of membranes, revisiting the algebraic structure underlying M-theory.</description>

      <title>In search of almost generic Calabi-Yau 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a projective Calabi-Yau (CY) 3-fold almost generic if it has only isolated nodes as singularities and the homology classes of all of the exceptional curves in an analytic small resolution are non-trivial but torsion. Such a Calabi-Yau supports a topologically non-trivial flat B-field and the corresponding A-model topological string partition function encodes a torsion refinement of the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of the smooth deformation. Our goal in this paper is to find new examples of almost generic CY 3-folds, using both conifold transitions as well as the integral structure of the periods of the mirrors. In this way we explicitly construct two quintic CY 3-folds with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-torsion, two octics with $\mathbb{Z}_3$-torsion and deduce the existence of a complete intersection $X_{(6,6)}\subset\mathbb{P}^5_{1,1,2,2,3,3}$ with $\mathbb{Z}_5$-torsion. Via mirror symmetry, the examples give new geometric interpretations to several AESZ Calabi-Yau operators. The mirror periods of the almost generic $X_{(6,6)}$ with non-trivial B-field topology are annihilated by an irrational Picard-Fuchs operator. We describe how the usual integral structure of the periods has to be modified and in all of the cases we calculate the monodromies around the singular points to verify integrality. Additional points of maximally unipotent monodromy in the moduli spaces lead us to find several more examples of smooth or almost generic CY 3-folds and to conjecture new twisted derived equivalences. We integrate the holomorphic anomaly equations and extract the torsion refined Gopakumar-Vafa invariants up to varying genus. For our construction of the almost generic octic CY 3-folds, we also give a short introduction to the subject of hypermatrices and hyperdeterminants.</description>

      <title>Unification of Conformal and Fuzzy Gravities with Internal Interactions resulting in SO(10) and a Possible Probe through Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unification of conformal and fuzzy gravities with internal interactions is based on the facts that i) the tangent group of a curved manifold and the manifold itself do not necessarily have the same dimensions and ii) both gravitational theories considered here have been formulated in a gauge theoretic way. We review the gauge-theoretic approach of gravities, commenting in particular on their diffeomorphism invariance, and the construction of conformal and noncommutative (fuzzy) gravity using the gauge-theoretic framework. Based on an extension of the four-dimensional tangent group, unification of both gravities with the internal interactions is achieved. Both unified schemes are examined at 1-loop level considering suitable spontaneous symmetry breakings to a SO(10) grand unified theory and consequently down to the Standard Model of particle physics through four specific spontaneous breaking channels. Each channel is examined against proton lifetime experimental bounds and its observation potential through gravitational signal from cosmic strings production is discussed.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative resolutions and CICY quotients from a non-abelian GLSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a one-parameter non-abelian GLSM with gauge group $(U(1)\times U(1)\times U(1))\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_3$ and its associated Calabi-Yau phases. The large volume phase is a free $\mathbb{Z}_3$-quotient of a codimension $3$ complete intersection of degree-$(1,1,1)$ hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^2\times\mathbb{P}^2\times\mathbb{P}^2$. The associated Calabi-Yau differential operator has a second point of maximal unipotent monodromy, leading to the expectation that the other GLSM phase is geometric as well. However, the associated GLSM phase appears to be a hybrid model with continuous unbroken gauge symmetry and cubic superpotential, together with a Coulomb branch. Using techniques from topological string theory and mirror symmetry we collect evidence that the phase should correspond to a non-commutative resolution, in the sense of Katz-Klemm-Schimannek-Sharpe, of a codimension two complete intersection in weighted projective space with $63$ nodal points, for which a resolution has $\mathbb{Z}_3$-torsion. We compute the associated Gopakumar-Vafa invariants up to genus $11$, incorporating their torsion refinement. We identify two integral symplectic bases constructed from topological data of the mirror geometries in either phase.</description>

      <title>No-scale supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To connect supergravity with the real world, a highly non-trivial requirement is complete spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in an approximately flat four-dimensional space-time. In no-scale supergravity models, this naturally happens at the classical level: the gravitino mass, setting the scale of supersymmetry breaking, slides along a flat direction of the potential with vanishing energy. This contribution briefly describes, with a personal selection of simple illustrative examples, some qualitative features of no-scale models that relate them to a possible dynamical generation of the hierarchies between the vacuum energy scale, the weak scale and the Planck scale. It includes comments on their versions with extended supersymmetry, on their higher-dimensional origin and on how their still unsolved problems of quantum stability can already be addressed, with some results, at the level of supergravity compactifications, although their solution (if any) will eventually require a better understanding of superstring theories.</description>

      <title>Factorizing Defects from Generalized Pinning Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce generalized pinning fields in conformal field theory that model a large class of critical impurities at large distance, enriching the familiar universality classes. We provide a rigorous definition of such defects as certain unbounded operators on the Hilbert space and prove that when inserted on codimension-one surfaces they factorize the spacetime into two halves. The factorization channels are further constrained by symmetries in the bulk. As a corollary, we solve such critical impurities in the 2d minimal models and establish the factorization phenomena previously observed for localized mass deformations in the 3d ${\rm O}(N)$ model.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group in far-from-equilibrium states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study renormalization group flows in far-from-equilibrium states. The study is made tractable by focusing on states that are spatially homogeneous, time-independent, and scale-invariant. Such states, in which mode $k$ has occupation numbers $n_k \sim k^{-\gamma}$, are well known in nonlinear physics. RG flow in such states is qualitatively different from that in the vacuum -- a positive $\gamma$ decreases the dimension of an operator, turning marginal interactions into relevant interactions. We compute one-loop beta functions. Depending on the sign of the beta function, backreaction may either cause a minor shift of the state in the IR, or completely change the nature of the state. Focusing on nearly marginal interactions, we construct an analog of the epsilon expansion and IR fixed points, with epsilon now set by the scaling of the interaction rather than the spacetime dimension. In the language of RG flow, critical-balance scaling -- which has applications in fields as varied as astrophysics and ocean waves -- corresponds to the state dynamically adjusting itself along the RG flow until the interaction becomes marginal.</description>

      <title>Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel quantum protocol called Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation (TQET), designed for transporting quantum energy across space-time. This protocol uses temporal and spatial quantum correlations between agents separated by space and time. The energy supplier injects energy into the system by measuring the ground state of a many-body system that evolves over time, while the distant recipient performs a conditional operation using feedback from the supplier. When both supplier and recipient operate within the same time frame, this is called Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET). A proof-of-concept was performed for the Ising model, utilizing quantum simulations. TQET increases energy efficiency from approximately 3% to around 40%, representing over a 13-fold improvement compared to QET. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between entanglement in time and TQET, validating the role of temporal correlations in energy activation between agents across space-time.</description>

      <title>Subexponential decay of local correlations from diffusion-limited dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Primordial Stochastic Gravitational Waves from Massive Higher-Spin Bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can a stationary stone radiate gravitational waves (GWs)? While the answer is typically "no" in flat spacetime, we get a "yes" in inflationary spacetime. In this work, we study the stationary-stone-produced GWs in inflation with a concrete model, where the role of stones is played by massive higher-spin particles. We study particles of spin-2 and higher produced by helical chemical potentials, and show that the induced GWs feature a scale-invariant and helicity-biased power spectrum in the slow-roll limit. Including slow-roll corrections leads to interesting backreactions from the higher-spin boson production, resulting in an intriguing scale-dependence of GWs at small scales. Given the existing observational and theoretical constraints, we identify viable parameter regions capable of generating visibly large GWs for future observations.</description>

      <title>Shadow radius and classical scattering analysis of two secondary hair Horndeski black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the shadow radius analysis of a charged Horndeski black hole (CHB) and the naked singularity (NS) with secondary scalar hair obtained from the Einstein-Horndeski-Maxwell theory. For this analysis, we include the beyond Horndeski black hole (bH) with secondary scalar hair and the magnetically charged black hole (MC) found from the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg theory.
  It is worth noting that the NS versions of CHB and bH arise from the charge extension of their photon spheres, while there is no NS version for MC.
  One branch (i) from the CHB is a point in the horizon realization but it shows up on the photon sphere and shadow radius.
  The shadow radius for the CHB is the nearly same as that for the MC with a single horizon and the charge of the NS is constrained by the EHT obserbation.
  From classical scattering analysis, it turns out that i-NS branch and NS play different roles from CHB, bH, and MC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine generalized global symmetries as a kind of compactly supported cohomology, and so are led to revisit questions about the locality of quantum field theory, following Segal. Physics naturally suggests a generalization of factorization algebras, aimed at capturing nonperturbative information, and we explain how higher group symmetries offer examples of this generalization, providing an extension of the nonabelian Poincar\'e duality of Salvatore and Lurie. Finally, we explore how continuous generalized symmetries and anomalies can be cast in this framework.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic supercriticality and complex phase diagram for the AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we extend the application of the Lee-Yang phase transition theorem to the realm of AdS black hole thermodynamics, thereby deriving a comprehensive complex phase diagram for such systems. Our research augments extant studies on black hole thermodynamic phase diagrams, particularly in the regime above the critical point, by delineating the Widom line of AdS black holes. This boundary segregates the supercritical domain of the phase diagram into two disparate zones. As the system traverses the thermodynamic crossover within the supercritical region, it undergoes a transition from one supercritical phase to another, while maintaining the continuity of its thermodynamic state functions. This behavior is fundamentally different from that below the critical point, where crossing the coexistence line results in discontinuities of thermodynamic state functions. The Widom line enables a thermodynamic crossover between single-phase states without traversing the spinodal that emerges in the critical region.</description>

      <title>A new approach for simulating PBH formation from generic curvature fluctuations with the Misner-Sharp formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations suffer from divergent terms (0/0), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in PBH formation.</description>

      <title>The threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry, driven by the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations, for different curvature profiles $\zeta$. Our results show that the threshold for PBH formation, defined as the peak value of the critical compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ (where $r_m$ is the scale at which the peak occurs), does not asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in the type-II region with $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ being a minimum. We find, for the cases tested, that this is a general trend associated with profiles that exhibit extremely large curvatures in the linear component of the compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{l}(r) \equiv -4r \zeta'(r)/3$ shape around its peak $r_m$ (spiky shapes). To measure this curvature at $r_m$, we define a dimensionless parameter: $\kappa \equiv -r^{2}_m \mathcal{C}_l''(r_m)$, and we find that the thresholds observed in the type-II region occur for $\kappa \gtrsim 30$ for the profiles we have used. By defining the threshold in terms of $\mathcal{C}_{l,c}(r_m)$, we extend previous analytical estimations to the type-II region, which is shown to be accurate within a few percent when compared to the numerical simulations for the tested profiles. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the type-II region may have been overestimated due to the general assumption that it should saturate at the boundary between the type-I and type-II regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years scale invariant scattering theory provided the first exact access to the magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional statistical systems with quenched disorder. We show how the theory extends to the overlap variables entering the characterization of spin glass properties. The resulting exact fixed point equations yield both the magnetic and, for the first time, the spin glass renormalization group fixed points. For the case of the random bond Ising model, on which we focus, the spin glass subspace of solutions is found to contain a line of fixed points. We discuss the implications of the results for Ising spin glass criticality and compare with the available numerical results.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from primordial black hole dominance: The effect of inflaton decay rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore primordial black holes (PBH) formation scenario during the post-inflationary preheating stage dominated by the inflaton field. We consider, in particular, a model-independent parametrization of the Gaussian peak inflationary power spectrum that leads to amplified inflationary density fluctuations before the end of inflation. These modes can reenter the horizon during preheating and could experience instabilities that trigger the production of PBH. This is estimated with the Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalism that takes into account non-spherical effects. We derive an accurate analytical expression for the mass fraction under the KP formalism that fits well with the numerical evaluation. Particularly, we focus on ultra-light PBH of masses $M_{\text{PBH}}&lt;10^9g$ and study their evolution and (possible) dominance after the decay of the inflation field into radiation and before the PBH evaporation via Hawking radiation. These considerations alter the previous estimates of induced gravitational waves (GWs) from PBH dominance and open new windows for detecting stochastic GW backgrounds with future detectors.</description>

All these notions have had profound impact on quantum field theory research in the last decade. I highlight various applications of these new symmetries in particle physics, focussing on theories beyond the Standard Model. Areas touched upon include axions, gauge unification, dark matter, neutrino masses, and flavour hierarchies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We gain insight on the fixed point dynamics of $d$ dimensional quantum field theories by exploiting the critical behavior of the $d-\epsilon$ sister theories. To this end we first derive a self-consistent relation between the $d-\epsilon$ scaling exponents and the associated $d$ dimensional beta functions. We then demonstrate that to account for an interacting fixed point in the original theory the related $d-\epsilon$ scaling exponent must be multi-valued in $\epsilon$. We elucidate our findings by discussing several examples such as the QCD Banks-Zaks infrared fixed point, QCD at large number of flavors, as well as the O(N) model in four dimensions. For the latter, we show that although the $1/N$ corrections prevent the reconstruction of the renormalization group flow, this is possible when adding the $1/N^2$ contributions.</description>

Abstract: We explore spacetime torsion in a two-dimensional setting, wherein it corresponds to a vector field. Without invoking field equations of a particular gravitational theory, we develop visualization techniques for such torsion fields, consider a generalization of Killing vectors to the presence of torsion, and find explicit representations of such Killing vectors (and their generalized algebra) in the presence of constant torsion. We then utilize these structures to derive general properties of surface gravities of static black holes whose near-horizon region features approximately constant torsion fields. Under certain assumptions, the two-dimensional results can be lifted to four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Cosmic inflation in non-perturbative quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String field theory motivated infinite-derivative models lead to non-local gravity modifications which form a promising class of quantum gravity candidates. In this paper we investigate effects of non-locality on the three-point function (the bi-spectrum) during cosmic inflation. The study is done in an Einstein frame with an infinite-derivative scalar field Lagrangian minimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert term. A non-local generalization of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation is derived. Infinite-derivative operators present in this equation lead to an appearance of infinitely many new background induced states in the perturbation spectrum during inflation with complex masses on top of a usual nearly massless inflaton. On contrary to a flat background such states can be classically stable in a de Sitter space-time. This helps preserving observational constraints on the scalar power-spectrum. We proceed by studying a particular configuration assuming that the generalized Mukhanov-Sasaki equation gives rise to an inflaton and one pair of new states with complex conjugate masses as perturbative degrees of freedom. The corresponding scalar bi-spectrum is computed numerically in squeezed and equilateral limits. We use the latest observational constraints on amplitude of the bi-spectrum $f_{NL}$ from Planck 2018 dataset as a guideline for possible values of masses of new emerging states. We find that $f_{NL}$ is non-trivially sensitive to the values of complex masses and this can reduce the parameter space of gravity modifications. In particular we find that the amplitude of the squeezed limit gets easily enhanced while of the equilateral limit can stay like in a local single-field model of inflation. We end up discussing open questions relevant for this class of models of inflation.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Renormalization of a Chiral $SU(2)$ Gauge Theory in Dimensional Regularization with Non-Anticommuting $\gamma_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher order calculations in chiral gauge theories such as the Electroweak Standard Model require a sound treatment of the notoriously problematic $\gamma_5$-matrix in Dimensional Regularization (DReg). In the all-order consistent BMHV scheme anticommutativity has to be sacrificed, resulting in spurious breakings of BRST invariance, the restoration of which necessitates finite, symmetry-restoring counterterms. Following recent advances in successfully applying this scheme to multi-loop calculations for Abelian models, we shall here present the first complete non-Abelian two-loop result for the case of $SU(2)$, which is of particular interest to the Standard Model. We provide the complete list of finite, two-loop symmetry restoring counterterms and discuss intricacies of the non-Abelian implementation. Except for one novel term, the finite counterterm action exhibits the same structure as at one-loop order.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Tails of Gravitational Waves in Schwarzschild Black Hole Ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schwarzschild black holes evolve toward their static configuration by emitting gravitational waves, which decay over time following a power law at fixed spatial positions. We derive this power law analytically for the second-order even gravitational perturbations, demonstrating that it is determined by the fact that the second-order source decays as the inverse square of the distance. Quadratic gravitational modes with multipole $\ell$ decay according to a law $\sim t^{-2\ell-1}$, in contrast to the linear Price law scaling $\sim t^{-2\ell-3}$. Consequently, nonlinear tails may persist longer than their linear counterparts.</description>

Abstract: A generalization of coherent states has been developed in the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. For many cases, no link has been made with the corresponding classical system. In this work, we consider simple superpotentials and compare the classical trajectories and the mean values of the position operator in these states. The mean value of the position operator can be written as a power series in time with coefficients whose relations to the superpotential are given in the general case. These coefficients imply integrals and recursion formulas. The method used reproduces exactly what is known for the harmonic oscillator. It is extended to study a family of systems which encompasses the harmonic oscillator. We also consider a third degree superpotential. The time scale after which the mean value of the position operator and the classical trajectory begin differing significantly is evaluated.

      <description>arXiv:2403.17523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapt the precise definition of the flowing effective action in order to obtain a functional flow equation with simple properties close to physical intuition. The simplified flow equation is invariant under local gauge transformations and suitable for both euclidean and Minkowski signature and analytic continuation. The cutoff always removes fluctuations close to zeros of the inverse full propagator. A formulation of the simplified flow equation in terms of renormalized scale invariant fields permits direct access to scaling solutions and associated fixed points. Our setting is based on a particular choice of cutoff function which depends on the macroscopic fields. Corrections to the simplified flow equation involve a field-dependent modification of the cutoff for which we discuss a systematic expansion. Truncated solutions for a scalar field theory in four dimensions suggest a new fixed point with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term.</description>

      <title>Fermionic back-reaction on kink and topological charge pumping in the $sl(2)$ affine Toda coupled to matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the Faddeev-Jackiw (F-J) symplectic Hamiltonian reduction of the $sl(2)$ affine Toda model coupled to matter (ATM), which includes new parametrizations for a scalar field and a Grassmannian fermionic field. The structure of constraints and symplectic potentials primarily dictates the strong-weak dual coupling sectors of the theory, ensuring the equivalence between the Noether and topological currents. The analytical calculations encompass the fermion-kink classical solution, the excited fermion bound states localized on the kink, and the scattering states, all of which account for the fermion back-reaction on the soliton. The total energy, which includes the classical fermion-soliton interaction energy, the bound-state fermion energy, and the fermion vacuum polarization energy (VPE), is determined by the topological charge of the kink. This system satisfies first-order differential equations and a chiral current conservation equation. Our results demonstrate that the excited fermion bound states and scattering states significantly alter the properties of the kink. Notably, they give rise to a pumping mechanism for the topological charge of the in-gap kink due to fermionic back-reaction, as well as the appearance of kink states in the continuum (KIC).</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2306.07329 we established a connection between symplectic cuts of Calabi-Yau threefolds and open topological strings, and used this to introduce an equivariant deformation of the disk potential of toric branes. In this paper we establish a connection to higher-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometries by showing that the equivariant disk potential arises as an equivariant period of certain Calabi-Yau fourfolds and fivefolds, which encode moduli spaces of one and two symplectic cuts (the maximal case) by a construction of Braverman arXiv:alg-geom/9712024. Extended Picard-Fuchs equations for toric branes, capturing dependence on both open and closed string moduli, are derived from a suitable limit of the equivariant quantum cohomology rings of the higher Calabi-Yau geometries.</description>

      <title>Scattering of Quantum Particles in de Sitter Spacetime I: The Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes in maximally symmetric de Sitter spacetime with compact spatial dimensions. We describe quantum states by using the representation theory of de Sitter symmetry group and link the Hilbert space to geodesic observers. The positive and negative ``energy'' wavefunctions are uniquely determined by the requirement that in observer's neighborhood, short wavelengths propagate as plane waves with positive and negative frequencies, respectively; they define a unique ``Euclidean'' (a.k.a.\ Bunch-Davies) de Sitter invariant vacuum, common to all inertial observers. By following the same steps as in Minkowski spacetime, we show that the scattering amplitudes are given by a generalized Dyson's formula. Compared to the flat case, they describe the scattering of wavepackets with the frequency spectrum determined by geometry. The frequency spread shrinks as the masses and/or momenta become larger than the curvature scale. Asymptotically, de Sitter amplitudes agree with the amplitudes evaluated in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We show that the generalised geometry formalism provides a new approach to the description of higher-fermion terms in $\mathcal N=1$ supergravity in ten dimensions, which does not appeal to supercovariantisation or superspace. We find expressions containing only five higher-fermion terms across the action and supersymmetry transformations, working in the second-order formalism.</description>

      <title>Soft edges: the many links between soft and edge modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundaries in gauge theory and gravity give rise to symmetries and charges at both finite and asymptotic distance. Due to their structural similarities, it is often held that soft modes are some kind of asymptotic limit of edge modes. Here, we show in Maxwell theory that there is an arguably more interesting relationship between the asymptotic symmetries and their charges, on one hand, and their finite-distance counterparts, on the other, without the need of a limit. Key to this observation is to embed the finite region in the global spacetime and identify edge modes as dynamical $\rm{U}(1)$-reference frames for dressing subregion variables. Distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic frames, according to whether they are built from field content in- or outside the region, we find that non-trivial corner symmetries arise only for extrinsic frames. Further, the asymptotic-to-finite relation requires asymptotically charged ones (like Wilson lines). Such frames, called soft edges, extend to asymptotia and, in fact, realize the corner charge algebra in multiple ways, for example, by "pulling in" the asymptotic one from infinity, or physically through the addition of asymptotic soft and hard radiation. Realizing an infinite-dimensional algebra requires a new set of soft boundary conditions, relying on the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic data. We identify the subregion Goldstone mode as the relational observable between extrinsic and intrinsic frames and clarify the meaning of vacuum degeneracy. We also connect the asymptotic memory effect with a more operational quasi-local one. A main conclusion is that the relationship between asymptotia and finite distance is frame-dependent; each choice of soft edge mode probes distinct cross-boundary data of the global theory.</description>

Abstract: It has been conjectured that the size of the black hole interior captures the quantum gate complexity of the underlying boundary evolution. In this short note we aim to provide a further microscopic evidence for this by directly relating the area of a certain codimension-two surface traversing the interior to the depth of the quantum circuit. Our arguments are based on establishing such relation rigorously at early times using the notion of operator Schmidt rank and then extrapolating it to later times by mapping bulk surfaces to cuts in the circuit representation.</description>

      <title>A Central Charge for sub-AdS Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We synthesize and sharpen various observations about sub-AdS holography in the literature to associate a central charge to sub-AdS scales of AdS x $X$ geometries. A key ingredient in our proposal is the idea that the AdS length is the length of the long string in a stack of $N$ $backreacted$ D-branes. This allows us to make statements about sub-AdS scales by considering long strings in sub-stacks of $M &lt; N$ branes. Our proposal applies in general dimensions, connects with and refines previous ideas about sub-matrix deconfinement &amp; long strings, makes crucial use of the compact space, and is consistent with the expected thermodynamics of small black holes localized on $X$. Some of our arguments draw intuition from separating branes, and have natural connections to (heating up) the Coulomb branch of the gauge theory. We apply related ideas to non-conformal D-branes at zero and finite temperature, discuss the holographic bound and IR/UV duality in theories with 16 supercharges, and find broad consistency.</description>

Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the Virasoro algebra (super Curtright-Zachos algebra), as realized in the GL(1,1) quantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. By examining the duality inherent in quantum superspace scaling operators, we establish a correspondence between quantum superspace and its physical realization through a novel operator mixing mechanism. For the continuous case, we construct super Curtright-Zachos algebra using magnetic translations and spin matrix bases, demonstrating explicit realizations for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric algebras with a natural N=2 decomposition. For the discrete case, we establish cyclic matrix representations in tight-binding models. We organize these structures through the *-bracket formalism with Z2-grading, revealing how the quantum superspace structure manifests in physical systems while preserving essential algebraic properties.</description>

Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze how the axion parameter, the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) coupling constant, and the charge density affect the chaotic properties of a charged hairy black hole, as characterized by the quantum Lyapunov exponent. We inject charged shock waves from the asymptotic boundary and compute the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). Due to the relevant deformation in the boundary theory induced by a bulk scalar field, the bulk solution flows to a more general Kasner spacetime near the black hole singularity. We examine the behavior of chaotic parameters, including the Lyapunov exponent, butterfly velocity, and scrambling time delay, under this deformation. We find that as the deformation parameter increases, the ratio of the quantum Lyapunov exponent to the surface gravity decreases. For sufficiently large deformation, the Lyapunov exponent in the deformed geometry can exceed that of the axion Reissner-Nordstrom case. We observe that boundary deformation generally reduces the scrambling time delay, with the EMS coupling having a significant effect on the delay. These results provide further insight into the role of boundary deformations in modifying chaotic properties in charged hairy black holes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the smoothness of the classical limit of inclusive observables in the formalism developed by Kosower, Maybee and O'Connell (KMOC). Building on the earlier work [1-3], we prove that the classical limit of three classes of inclusive observables, namely scattering angle, radiative field and angular impulse is smooth and does not suffer from any so-called superclassical divergences at all orders in perturbation. Our analysis goes some way in showing that KMOC formalism can be used to compute classical radiation by simply focussing on all the terms that scale as $\hbar^0$ as all the terms that scale with inverse power of $\hbar$ vanish.</description>

      <title>S-dual Quintessence, the Swampland, and the DESI DR2 Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dark energy model in which a quintessence field $\phi$ rolls near the vicinity of a local maximum of its potential characterized by the simplest $S$ self-dual form $V(\phi) = \Lambda \ {\rm sech}(\sqrt{2} \, \phi/M_p)$, where $M_p$ is the reduced Planck mass and $\Lambda \sim 10^{-120} M_p^4$ is the cosmological constant. We confront the model with Swampland ideas and show that the $S$-dual potential is consistent with the distance conjecture, the de Sitter conjecture, and the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture. We also examine the compatibility of this phenomenological model with the intriguing DESI DR2 results and show that the shape of the $S$-dual potential is almost indistinguishable from the axion-like potential, $V (\phi) = m_a^2 \ f_a^2 \ [ 1 + \cos(\phi/f_a)]$, with $m_a$ and $f_a$ parameters fitted by the DESI Collaboration to accommodate the DR2 data. The self-dual potential has the advantage that one starts at the self-dual point and this is a theoretical motivation, because as the universe cools off the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gets broken leading to a natural rolling away from the symmetric point.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric solutions of non-relativistic 11-dimensional supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eleven-dimensional supergravity has a non-relativistic variant obtained by taking a limit associated with the M2 brane. Consistency of this non-relativistic supergravity requires constraints. There is one choice of constraints which keeps the maximal amount of supersymmetry transformations, and another which only keeps half. I discuss supersymmetric solutions of this theory, based on limits of the M2 and M5 solutions. These limits involve either a scaling of the number of branes or a smearing in certain directions, and have been argued to produce non-Lorentzian bulk geometries appearing in novel versions of the AdS/CFT correspondence. I show that the scaled solutions are solutions of the maximally supersymmetric version of the non-relativistic supergravity, while the smeared solutions only give solutions of the half-maximally supersymmetric version. I show these solutions are all supersymmetric by solving the Killing spinor equations, and discuss usual and unusual forms of supersymmetry enhancement. I also discuss a simple supersymmetric AdS_3 background, and point out that the BTZ black hole is a solution of non-relativistic 11-dimensional supergravity.</description>

      <title>Effective action for $\phi^4$-Yukawa theory via 2PI formalism in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a scalar field theory with quartic self interaction, Yukawa coupled to fermions in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime background. The scalar has a classical background plus quantum fluctuations, whereas the fermions are taken to be quantum. We derive for this system the effective action and the effective potential via the two particle irreducible (2PI) formalism. This formalism provides an opportunity to find out resummed or non-perturbative expressions for some series of diagrams. We have considered the two loop vacuum graphs and have computed the local part of the effective action. The various resummed counterterms corresponding to self energies, vertex functions and the tadpole have been explicitly found out. The variation of the renormalised effective potential for massless fields has been investigated numerically. We show that for the potential to be bounded from below, we must have $\lambda \gtrsim 16 g^2$, where $\lambda$ and $g$ are respectively the quartic and Yukawa couplings. We emphasise the qualitative differences of this non-perturbative calculation with that of the standard 1PI perturbative ones in de Sitter. The qualitative differences of our result with that of the flat spacetime has also been pointed out.</description>

      <title>Universality of R\'enyi Entropy in Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th R\'enyi entropy $S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n \rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We consider quantum and classical first-order transitions, at equilibrium and under out-of-equilibrium conditions, mainly focusing on quench and slow quasi-adiabatic protocols. For these phenomena, we review the finite-size scaling theory appropriate to describe the general features of the large-scale, and long-time for dynamic phenomena, behavior of finite-size systems.</description>

      <title>A virtual $\mathrm{PGL}_r$-$\mathrm{SL}_r$ correspondence for projective surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a smooth projective surface $X$ satisfying $H_1(X,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and $w \in H^2(X,\mu_r)$, we study deformation invariants of the pair $(X,w)$. Choosing a Brauer-Severi variety $Y$ (or, equivalently, Azumaya algebra $\mathcal{A}$) over $X$ with Stiefel-Whitney class $w$, the invariants are defined as virtual intersection numbers on suitable moduli spaces of stable twisted sheaves on $Y$ constructed by Yoshioka (or, equivalently, moduli spaces of $\mathcal{A}$-modules of Hoffmann-Stuhler).
  We show that the invariants do not depend on the choice of $Y$. Using a result of de Jong, we observe that they are deformation invariants of the pair $(X,w)$. For surfaces with $h^{2,0}(X) &gt; 0$, we show that the invariants can often be expressed as virtual intersection numbers on Gieseker-Maruyama-Simpson moduli spaces of stable sheaves on $X$. This can be seen as a $\mathrm{PGL}_r$-$\mathrm{SL}_r$ correspondence.
  As an application, we express $\mathrm{SU}(r) / \mu_r$ Vafa-Witten invariants of $X$ in terms of $\mathrm{SU}(r)$ Vafa-Witten invariants of $X$. We also show how formulae from Donaldson theory can be used to obtain upper bounds for the minimal second Chern class of Azumaya algebras on $X$ with given division algebra at the generic point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate that a distinctive resonant excitation between quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes emerges as a universal phenomenon at an avoided crossing near the exceptional point through high-precision numerical analysis and theory of QNMs based on the framework of non-Hermitian physics. This resonant phenomenon not only allows us to decipher a long-standing mystery concerning the peculiar behaviors of QNMs but also stands as a novel beacon for characterizing black hole spacetime geometry. Our findings pave the way for rigorous examinations of black holes and the exploration of new physics in gravity.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

Abstract: The next goalpost in precision calculations for physics beyond the Standard Model is determining the two-loop renormalization group (RG) equations in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We progress towards this goal by determining the RG equations for a simplified version of the SMEFT without any fermion fields. Our calculation relies on functional methods that are newly developed for multi-loop computations and adapted for the determination of RG equations here.</description>

      <title>Confined but chirally and chiral spin symmetric hot matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of the quark--antiquark mesons at zero and finite temperature in the framework of a solvable chirally symmetric quark model with linear confining potential. The interquark interaction in the model is reminiscent of that derived in Coulomb gauge QCD, with the string tension being the only model parameter. We demonstrate that while the confining interaction induces spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, chiral symmetry gets restored at a temperature Tch ~ 90 MeV for the string tension fixed to provide the phenomenological value of the quark condensate. This temperature is similar to Tch ~ 130 MeV observed on the lattice in the chiral limit for N_c=3. The physical mechanism responsible for the chiral symmetry restoration in the confining regime is Pauli blocking of the quark levels, required for the existence of a nonvanishing quark condensate, by the thermal excitations of the quarks and antiquarks. Thus, above the chiral restoration temperature, the meson-like states are chirally symmetric and approximately chiral spin symmetric. A crucial property of the confined meson-like light-light states above Tch is their size that exceeds drastically that in the chirally broken phase below Tch, in contrast to the heavy-heavy mesons that nearly preserve their size irrespective of the temperature. This property is a result of Pauli blocking of the quark and antiquark levels with small momenta. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radius of the states with J=0,1 diverges in the chiral limit. This unexpected property must be a key to understanding unusual features of the hot QCD matter as observed at RHIC and LHC. Consequently, the confining but chirally symmetric matter above Tch can be considered as a dense system of very large and strongly overlapping meson-like states (``strings'').</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a self-interacting, massive, real scalar field on a four-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime and the associated stress-energy tensor. Using techniques proper of the algebraic approach to perturbative quantum field theory, we study the associated, Wick-ordered, quantum observable. In particular we generalize a construction, first developed in the free field theory scenario by Moretti in [Mor03], aimed at exploiting the existing freedoms in the definition of the classical stress-energy tensor, in order to define a quantum counterpart which is divergence free. We focus on Minkowski spacetime proving that this procedure can be adapted also to cubic or quartic self-interactions, at least up to order $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^3)$ in perturbation theory. We remark that this result can be extended to arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetimes, although, in this case one needs to exploit the existing regularization freedom in the construction of the Wick ordered stress-energy tensor.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly and internode scatterings in multifold semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our quest to unravel the topological properties of nodal points in three-dimensional semimetals, one hallmark property which warrants our attention is the \textit{chiral anomaly}. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign of the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality ($\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing chiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral anomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we have multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ is constrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\chi =\pm 1$. Hence, the presence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it possible to have two distinct scenarios: the pair of conjugate nodes in question comprise bands of (1) the same pseudospin variety and exhibiting Berry-curvature profiles differing by an overall factor of $\chi$, or (2) two distinct pseudospin representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply our derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point (threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes, and show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Lattice T-duality from non-invertible symmetries in quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dualities of quantum field theories are challenging to realize in lattice models of qubits. In this work, we explore one of the simplest dualities, T-duality of the compact boson CFT, and its realization in quantum spin chains. In the special case of the XX model, we uncover an exact lattice T-duality, which is associated with a non-invertible symmetry that exchanges two lattice U(1) symmetries. The latter symmetries flow to the momentum and winding U(1) symmetries with a mixed anomaly in the CFT. However, the charge operators of the two U(1) symmetries do not commute on the lattice and instead generate the Onsager algebra. We discuss how some of the anomalies in the CFT are nonetheless still exactly realized on the lattice and how the lattice U(1) symmetries enforce gaplessness. We further explore lattice deformations preserving both U(1) symmetries and find a rich gapless phase diagram with special $\mathrm{Spin}(2k)_1$ WZW model points and whose phase transitions all have dynamical exponent ${z&gt;1}$.</description>

Abstract: The transport property of cold and dense nucleon matter is important for nuclear physics but is relatively less studied than that at finite temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta&gt;0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model.</description>

      <title>Stable long-term evolution in numerical relativity</title>

Abstract: We report on the potential occurrence of a numerical instability in the long-time simulation of black holes using the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura formulation of numerical relativity, even in the simple set-up of a Schwarzschild black hole. Through extensive numerical experiments, we identify that this "late-time instability" arises from accumulated violations of the momentum constraint. To address this issue, we propose two modified versions of the so-called conformal covariant Z4 scheme, designed to propagate momentum constraint violations without damping. Our results demonstrate that these alternative formulations, which we refer to as CCZ4' and CCZ3, effectively resolve the late-time numerical instability not only in Schwarzschild spacetimes but also in black hole spacetimes with matter fields. Notably, by preventing damping of the momentum constraint violation, the Hamiltonian constraint damping can be significantly increased, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing long-term evolution in our proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Fast Scrambling in the Hyperbolic Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate many-body chaos and scrambling in the Hyperbolic Ising model, a mixed-field Ising model living in the background of AdS2. The effect of the curvature is captured by site-dependent couplings obtained from the AdS2 metric applied to a flat nearest neighbor spin chain. We show that this model with only local site-dependent nearest neighbor interactions is maximally chaotic, can be classified as a fast scrambler, and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound on chaos for a certain set of parameters, thus making this model one of the few if not the only example where such fast scrambling behavior has been seen without all-to-all or long-range interactions. Moreover, the modest resources needed to simulate this model make it an ideal test-bed for studying scrambling and chaos on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Electric potentials and field lines for uniformly-charged tube and cylinder expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function and integration of $Z(u|m) \mathrm{sc}(u|m)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas.</description>
