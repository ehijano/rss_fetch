      <title>Topological water-wave structures manipulating particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological wave structures, such as vortices and skyrmions, appear in a variety of quantum and classical wave fields, including optics and acoustics. In particular, optical vortices have found numerous applications ranging from quantum information to astrophysics. Furthermore, both optical and acoustic structured waves are crucial for manipulation of small particles, from atoms to macroscopic biological objects. Here we report on the controllable generation of topological structures -- wave vortices, skyrmions, and polarization M\"{o}bius strips -- in interfering gravity water waves. Most importantly, we demonstrate efficient manipulation of subwavelength and wavelength-order floating particles with topologically structured water waves. This includes trapping of the particles in the high-intensity field zones, as well as controllable orbital and spinning motions due to the orbital and spin angular momenta of water waves. Our results reveal the water-wave counterpart of optical and acoustic manipulations, which paves the avenue for applications in hydrodynamics and microfluidics.</description>

      <title>Flexures for Kibble balances: Minimizing the effects of anelastic relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the anelastic aftereffect of a flexure being used in a Kibble balance, where the flexure is subjected to a large excursion in velocity mode after which a high-precision force comparison is performed. We investigated the effect of a constant and a sinusoidal excursion on the force comparison. We explored theoretically and experimentally a simple erasing procedure, i.e., bending the flexure in the opposite direction for a given amplitude and time. We found that the erasing procedure reduced the time-dependent force by about 30%. The investigation was performed with an analytical model and verified experimentally with our new Kibble balance at the National Institute of Standards and Technology employing flexures made from precipitation-hardened Copper Beryllium alloy C17200.
  Our experimental determination of the modulus defect of the flexure yields 1.2E-4. This result is about a factor of two higher than previously reported from experiments. We additionally found a static shift of the flexure's internal equilibrium after a change in the stress and strain state. These static shifts, although measurable, are small and deemed uncritical for our Kibble balance application at present.
  During this investigation, we discovered magic flexures that promise to have very little anelastic relaxation. In these magic flexures, the mechanism causing anelastic relaxation is compensated for by properly shaping and loading a flexure with a non-constant cross-section in the region of bending.</description>

      <title>Canonical scattering problem in topological metamaterials: Valley-Hall modes through a bend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the amount of backscattering of Valley Hall modes in a classical topological insulator. In reciprocal systems, the conservation of the valley index has been argued to be at the root of the high-transmission of Valley Hall modes, observed in many experimental realisations. Here, we reconsider this hypothesis by quantitatively analysing the canonical scattering problem of interface Valley Hall modes impinging on sharp bends which may or may not conserve the valley index. We consider a tight binding model of graphene ribbons with an interface and compute the reflection and transmission coefficients using a transfer matrix formalism. We find that, in all configurations considered, the transmission of Valley Hall modes is close to being maximal, even in cases where the valley index is not conserved. Hence there appears to be no correlation between valley conservation and good transmission. Our results serve as a reference case for the design of Valley Hall type metamaterial.</description>

      <title>Propagation in rough waveguides: Forward and inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss here the direct and inverse problems for wave propagation in a waveguide with rough internal surface and arbitrary mean shape. The high degree of multiple scattering inside the waveguide poses significant challenges both for the forward computation and for the recovery of the surface profile, and raises important questions about scattering cross-sections. This paper falls into two parts corresponding to these issues.
  We first apply Left-Right (L-R) operator splitting to calculate the scattered fields in 2- and 3-dimensional waveguides. Using this we illustrate the scattered fields and the effect of surface roughness. In the second part we formulate an algorithm for surface recovery from field measurements along the waveguide axis, which generalises recent work on surfaces in 2 dimensions. This method utilizes forward scattering assumptions in effect by formulating an integral equation in the unknown surface field, treated as a function of the surface. Although discussed in the context of waveguides, the formulae are given in a form applicable to a variety of geometries, with coefficients which will depend on and be determined by each specific application.</description>
