      <title>Convergence of finite element right-hand-side computation from finite difference data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents two integration methods for field transfer in computational aeroacoustics and in coupled field problems, using the finite element method to solve the acoustic field. Firstly, a high-order Gaussian quadrature computes the finite element right-hand side. In contrast, the (flow) field provided by the finite difference mesh is mapped by higher-order B-Splines or a Lagrangian function. Secondly, the cut-cell or supermesh integration with geometric clipping. For each method, the accuracy, performance characteristics, and computational complexity are analyzed. As a reference, the trapezoidal integration rule was computed from the finite difference results. The high-order quadrature converges as the B-Spline interpolation order increases, and the finite difference results and mesh resolutions are consistent. The supermesh approach eliminates interpolation and approximation errors at the grid-to-mesh level and improves accuracy. This behaviour is universal for smooth or strongly oscillating field quantities, which will be shown in a comparative study between the Lighthill-like source term and the source term of the perturbed convective wave equation for subsonic flows.</description>

      <title>A low-order hybrid method for the variable-density incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce and analyse a new low-order method for the variable-density incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The main novelty of the proposed method lies in the support of general meshes, possibly including polygonal or polyhedral elements as well as non-matching interfaces. We carry out a complete analysis, showing stability, existence and uniqueness of a discrete solution, and convergence of the latter to a suitably defined weak solution of the continuous problem. Numerical tests validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Variance Reduction in the Fokker-Planck Particle Method for Rarefied Gases using Quasi-Random Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck (FP) particle method accelerates rarefied-gas simulations by replacing the binary collisions of the commonly used Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method with a drift=diffusion process. Like all particle methods, the FP method is inherently stochastic, which leads to statistical fluctuations in macroscopic quantities and necessitates large particle numbers for accurate results. In this work, we investigate the use of quasi-random numbers, which sample distributions more evenly and thereby reduce the variance. To preserve the low-discrepancy structure across time steps, we employ the Array Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo (Array-RQMC) technique. We combine the FP method with Array-RQMC and compare it in homogeneous and inhomogeneous problems with other commonly used variance-reduction techniques. The proposed FP-Array-RQMC approach achieves improved convergence rates compared with pseudo-random sampling and yields smaller estimator errors for sufficiently large particle numbers.</description>

      <title>High-Order Symmetric Positive Interior Quadrature Rules on Two and Three Dimensional Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully symmetric positive interior (f-SPI) quadrature rules are key building blocks for high-order discretizations of partial differential equations, yet high-degree rules with few nodes remain scarce on reference elements commonly used in mesh generation. We construct new f-SPI rules on the square, cube, prism, and pyramid by coupling a variable parameterization that enforces positivity and interiority with an efficient Levenberg-Marquardt optimization and a symmetry-aware node-reduction strategy that eliminates and collapses orbits, allowing transitions between symmetry types. The resulting rules achieve degrees up to 77 on the square, 45 on the cube, and 30 on the prism and pyramid, and for most degrees use fewer nodes than previously published f-SPI quadrature rules. Verification tests demonstrate comparable accuracy to existing rules. Complete node and weight data are also provided.</description>

      <title>Super Time Stepping Methods for Diffusion using Discontinuous-Galerkin Spatial Discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-time-stepping (STS) methods provide an attractive approach for enabling explicit time integration of parabolic operators, particularly in large-scale, higher-dimensional kinetic simulations where fully implicit schemes are impractical. In this work, we present an explicit STS framework tailored for diffusion operators in gyrokinetic models, motivated by the fact that constructing and storing a Jacobian is often infeasible due to strong nonlocal couplings, high dimensionality, and memory constraints. We investigate the performance of several STS methods, including Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) and Runge-Kutta-Legendre (RKL) schemes, applied to a diffusion equation discretized using both discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and finite-difference methods. To support time adaptivity, we introduce a novel error norm designed to more accurately track temporal error arising from DG spatial discretizations, in which degrees of freedom contribute unevenly to the solution error. Finally, we assess the performance of an automatic eigenvalue estimation algorithm for determining the required number of STS stages and compare it against an analytical estimation formula.</description>

      <title>A Cordes framework for stationary Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first review the Cordes condition for nondivergence-form differential operators through the lens of Campanato's theory of near operators. We then survey a recently proposed Cordes framework that guarantees the existence and uniqueness of $L^2$ solutions to stationary Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations subject to periodic boundary conditions, and that allows for the construction of a simple finite element method for its numerical approximation. Finally, we propose a Cordes framework for stationary Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov-type equations subject to a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional approximations of random attractor for stochastic discrete complex Ginzburg-Landau equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply an implicit Euler scheme to discretize the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and prove the existence of a numerical attractor for the discrete Ginzburg-Landau system. We establish the upper semicontinuity of the numerical attractor with respect to the global attractor as the time step tends to zero. Furthermore, we provide finite-dimensional approximations for three types of attractors (global, numerical, and random), and demonstrate the existence of truncated attractors along with their convergence as the dimension of the state space tends to infinity. Finally, we prove the existence of a random attractor and establish the upper semi-continuity both of the global random attractor and the truncated random attractor.</description>

      <title>RANDSMAPs: Random-Feature/multi-Scale Neural Decoders with Mass Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce RANDSMAPs (Random-feature/multi-scale neural decoders with Mass Preservation), numerical analysis-informed, explainable neural decoders designed to explicitly respect conservation laws when solving the challenging ill-posed pre-image problem in manifold learning. We start by proving the equivalence of vanilla random Fourier feature neural networks to Radial Basis Function interpolation and the double Diffusion Maps (based on Geometric Harmonics) decoders in the deterministic limit. We then establish the theoretical foundations for RANDSMAP and introduce its multiscale variant to capture structures across multiple scales. We formulate and derive the closed-form solution of the corresponding constrained optimization problem and prove the mass preservation property. Numerically, we assess the performance of RANDSMAP on three benchmark problems/datasets with mass preservation obtained by the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards traffic flow PDE with shock waves, 2D rotated MRI brain images, and the Hughes crowd dynamics PDEs. We demonstrate that RANDSMAPs yield high reconstruction accuracy at low computational cost and maintain mass conservation at single-machine precision. In its vanilla formulation, the scheme remains applicable to the classical pre-image problem, i.e., when mass-preservation constraints are not imposed.</description>

      <title>Modal-Centric Field Inversion via Differentiable Proper Orthogonal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems in computational physics often require matching high-dimensional spatio-temporal fields, leading to prohibitive computational costs and ill-conditioned optimizations. We introduce modal-centric field inversion (MCFI), a paradigm that reformulates inverse problems in the reduced space of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes rather than the full physical state space. By targeting dominant flow structures instead of point-wise field values, MCFI provides a compact, physically meaningful objective that naturally regularizes the inversion and dramatically reduces computational burden. Central to this framework is the differentiable POD: an adjoint-based method that efficiently computes sensitivities of POD modes with respect to model parameters, enabling gradient-based optimization in the modal space. We demonstrate MCFI on a one and two-dimensional modified viscous Burger's equation, optimizing spatially varying coefficients to match target dynamics through mode-matching. The adjoint formulation achieves computational cost independent of parameter dimension, in contrast to finite-difference approaches that scale linearly. MCFI establishes a foundation for scalable inverse design and model calibration in unsteady, high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized preconditioned conjugate gradients for adaptive FEM with optimal complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider adaptive finite element methods (AFEMs) with inexact algebraic solver for second-order symmetric linear elliptic diffusion problems. We formulate and analyze a non-linear and non-symmetric geometric multigrid preconditioner for the generalized preconditioned conjugate gradient method (GPCG) used to solve the arising finite element systems. Moreover, a linear and symmetric variant of the geometric multigrid preconditioner that is suitable for the (standard) preconditioned conjugate gradient method (PCG) is provided and analyzed. We show that both preconditioners are optimal in the sense that, first, the resulting algebraic solvers admit a contraction factor that is independent of the local mesh size h and the polynomial degree p, and, second, that they can be applied with linear computational complexity. Related to this, quasi-optimal computational cost of the overall adaptive finite element method is addressed. Numerical experiments underline the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Rank-one Riemannian Subspace Descent for Nonlinear Matrix Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a rank-one Riemannian subspace descent algorithm for computing symmetric positive definite (SPD) solutions to nonlinear matrix equations arising in control theory, dynamic programming, and stochastic filtering. For solution matrices of size $n\times n$, standard approaches for dense matrix equations typically incur $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ cost per-iteration, while the efficient $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ methods either rely on sparsity or low-rank solutions, or have iteration counts that scale poorly. The proposed method entails updating along the dominant eigen-component of a transformed Riemannian gradient, identified using at most $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ power iterations. The update structure also enables exact step-size selection in many cases at minimal additional cost. For objectives defined as compositions of standard matrix operations, each iteration can be implemented using only matrix--vector products, yielding $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ arithmetic cost. We prove an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ iteration bound under standard smoothness assumptions, with improved bounds under geodesic strong convexity. Numerical experiments on large-scale CARE, DARE, and other nonlinear matrix equations show that the proposed algorithm solves instances (up to $n=10{,}000$ in our tests) for which the compared solvers, including MATLAB's \texttt{icare}, structure-preserving doubling, and subspace-descent baselines fail to return a solution. These results demonstrate that rank-one manifold updates provide a practical approach for high-dimensional and dense SPD-constrained matrix equations.

      <title>Nonclassical symmetries of polynomial equations and test problems with parameters for computer algebra systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonclassical symmetries and reductions of polynomial equations and systems of polynomial equations are considered. It is shown that specific polynomial equations having "hidden" symmetries can be reduced to classical symmetric systems of polynomial equations by introducing a new additional variable. It has been established that symmetric systems of polynomial equations of mixed type, consisting of symmetric and anti-symmetric polynomials, can be transformed into simpler systems. A method is presented for solving nonclassical symmetric systems of two polynomial equations that change places when the unknowns are permuted. We study polynomial equations containing the second iteration of a given polynomial, which are reduced to nonclassical symmetric systems of equations. New higher-degree polynomial equations containing free parameters that admit solutions in radicals are found. Three such equations of the sixth and ninth degrees are further used as test problems with parameters for analyzing the capabilities of two leading computer algebra systems. It is shown that currently, the Maple and Mathematica systems do not allow us to efficiently find analytical solutions (in radicals) of polynomial equations with free parameters, but they allow us to obtain numerical solutions of equations for fixed numerical values of the parameters. The results of this work and the proposed test problems with parameters can be used to further improve existing computer algebra systems.</description>

      <title>Optimized Schwarz Waveform Relaxation for the Damped Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Schwarz Waveform Relaxation is critically dependent on the choice of transmission conditions. While classical absorbing conditions work well for wave propagation, they prove insufficient for damped wave equations, particularly in viscoelastic damping regimes where convergence becomes prohibitively slow. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a more general transmission operator with two free parameters for the one-dimensional damped wave equation. Through frequency-domain analysis, we derive an explicit expression for the convergence factor governing the convergence rate. We propose and compare two optimization strategies (L-infinity and L-2 minimization) for determining optimal transmission parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our optimized approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to standard absorbing conditions, especially for viscoelastic damping cases. The method provides a computationally efficient alternative to exhaustive parameter search while maintaining robust performance across different damping regimes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a convergence analysis of the parallel-in-time integration method known as the Parareal algorithm for degenerate differential-algebraic systems arising from quasi-static Biot models, which govern coupled flow and deformation in porous media. The underlying system exhibits a saddle-point structure and degeneracy due to the quasi-static assumption. We extend the Parareal algorithm to this setting and propose three coarse propagators: monolithic, fixed-stress, and multirate fixed-stress schemes. For each, we derive sufficient conditions for convergence and establish explicit time step restrictions that guarantee contractivity of the iteration matrix. Numerical experiments show computational savings accrued by using a parareal solver in multiphysics simulations involving poroelasticity and other coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Contour-integral based quantum eigenvalue transformation: analysis and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenvalue transformations appear ubiquitously in scientific computation, ranging from matrix polynomials to differential equations, and are beyond the reach of the quantum singular value transformation framework. In this work, we study the efficiency of quantum algorithms based on contour integral representation for eigenvalue transformations from both theoretical and practical aspects. Theoretically, we establish a complete complexity analysis of the contour integral approach proposed in [Takahira, Ohashi, Sogabe, and Usuda. Quant. Inf. Comput., 22, 11\&amp;12, 965--979 (2021)]. Moreover, we combine the contour integral approach and the sampling-based linear combination of unitaries to propose a quantum algorithm for estimating observables of eigenvalue transformations using only $3$ additional qubits. Practically, we design contour integral based quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation, matrix polynomials, and solving linear ordinary differential equations, and show that the contour integral algorithm can outperform all the existing quantum algorithms in the case of solving asymptotically stable differential equations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a fractional approximation of the AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem based on an all-pass approximation of the exponential power flow kernel. The classical AC OPF relies on trigonometric coupling between bus voltage phasors, which yields a nonconvex program with oscillatory derivatives that can slow, or in some cases destabilize, interior-point methods. We replace the trigonometric terms with an all-pass fractional (APF) approximation whose real and imaginary components act as smooth surrogates for the cosine and sine functions, and we introduce a pre-rotation to shift the argument of the approximation toward its most accurate region, ensuring that the reformulated power flow model preserves physical loss behavior, maintains the symmetry of the classical kernels, and improves the conditioning of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices. The proposed APF OPF formulation remains nonconvex, as in the classical model, but it eliminates trigonometric evaluations and empirically produces larger and more stable Newton steps under standard interior-point solvers. Numerical results on more than 25 IEEE and PGLib test systems ranging from 9 to 10{,}000 buses demonstrate that the APF OPF model achieves solutions with accuracy comparable to that of the classical formulation while reducing solver times, indicating a more solver-friendly nonconvex representation of AC OPF. All code, functions, verification scripts, and generated results are publicly available on \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/APF-OPF}{GitHub}, along with a README describing how to run and reproduce the experiments.</description>

      <title>Large Data Limits of Laplace Learning for Gaussian Measure Data in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laplace learning is a semi-supervised method, a solution for finding missing labels from a partially labeled dataset utilizing the geometry given by the unlabeled data points. The method minimizes a Dirichlet energy defined on a (discrete) graph constructed from the full dataset. In finite dimensions the asymptotics in the large (unlabeled) data limit are well understood with convergence from the graph setting to a continuum Sobolev semi-norm weighted by the Lebesgue density of the data-generating measure. The lack of the Lebesgue measure on infinite-dimensional spaces requires rethinking the analysis if the data aren't finite-dimensional. In this paper we make a first step in this direction by analyzing the setting when the data are generated by a Gaussian measure on a Hilbert space and proving pointwise convergence of the graph Dirichlet energy.</description>

      <title>On the existence of Ulanowicz's optimal structural resilience in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the mathematical existence and asymptotic properties of Ulanowicz's structural resilience in complex systems such as supply chain networks. While ecological evidence suggests that sustainable systems gravitate toward an optimal state at $\alpha = 1/\mathrm{e}$, the universality of this configuration in generalized networks remains theoretically unverified. We prove that while optimal resilience is unattainable in two-node networks due to structural over-determinacy, it exists for any directed graph with $N_\mathcal{V} \geq 3$. By constructing a symmetric network model with three types of link weights $(x, y, z)$ and uniform marginal distributions, we derive the governing equations for the optimal resilience configuration. Our analytical and numerical results reveal that as the network size $N_\mathcal{V}$ increases, the link weights required to maintain optimal resilience exhibit a power-law scaling behavior: the adjacent links scale as $O(N_\mathcal{V}^{-1})$, while the non-adjacent links scale as $O(N_\mathcal{V}^{-2})$, both accompanied by specific logarithmic corrections. This work establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for the optimal resilience framework and provides a unified perspective on how entropy-based principles govern the robustness and evolution of large-scale complex networks, which may offer quantitative guidance for designing large-scale networked systems under robustness constraints.</description>

      <title>A pressure-robust HHO method for the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on general meshes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.07180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work [10], we have introduced a pressure-robust Hybrid High-Order method for the numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on matching simplicial meshes. Pressure-robust methods are characterized by error estimates for the velocity that are fully independent of the pressure. A crucial question was left open in that work, namely whether the proposed construction could be extended to general polytopal meshes. In this paper we provide a positive answer to this question. Specifically, we introduce a novel divergence-preserving velocity reconstruction that hinges on the solution inside each element of a mixed problem on a subtriangulation, then use it to design discretizations of the body force and convective terms that lead to pressure robustness. An in-depth theoretical study of the properties of this velocity reconstruction, and their reverberation on the scheme, is carried out for polynomial degrees $k \geq 0$ and meshes composed of general polytopes. The theoretical convergence estimates and the pressure robustness of the method are confirmed by an extensive panel of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Finite Expression Method for Solving High-Dimensional Committor Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition path theory (TPT) is a mathematical framework for quantifying rare transition events between a pair of selected metastable states $A$ and $B$. Central to TPT is the committor function, which describes the probability to hit the metastable state $B$ prior to $A$ from any given starting point of the phase space. Once the committor is computed, the transition channels and the transition rate can be readily found. The committor is the solution to the backward Kolmogorov equation with appropriate boundary conditions. However, solving it is a challenging task in high dimensions due to the need to mesh a whole region of the ambient space. In this work, we explore the finite expression method (FEX, Liang and Yang (2022)) as a tool for computing the committor. FEX approximates the committor by an algebraic expression involving a fixed finite number of nonlinear functions and binary arithmetic operations. The optimal nonlinear functions, the binary operations, and the numerical coefficients in the expression template are found via reinforcement learning. The FEX-based committor solver is tested on several high-dimensional benchmark problems. It gives comparable or better results than neural network-based solvers. Most importantly, FEX is capable of correctly identifying the algebraic structure of the solution which allows one to reduce the committor problem to a low-dimensional one and find the committor with any desired accuracy.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of McKean-Vlasov SDEs via stochastic gradient descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13579v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to numerically approximate McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDE) using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) while avoiding the use of interacting particle systems (IPS) {and the associated simulation costs required to achieve the ``propagation of chaos'' limit}. The SGD technique is deployed to solve a Euclidean minimization problem, obtained by first representing the MV-SDE as a minimization problem over the set of continuous functions of time, and then approximating the domain with a finite-dimensional subspace. Convergence is established by proving certain intermediate stability and moment estimates of the relevant stochastic processes, including the tangent processes. Numerical experiments illustrate the competitive performance of our SGD based method compared to the IPS benchmarks. This work offers a theoretical foundation for using the SGD method in the context of numerical approximation of MV-SDEs, and provides analytical tools to study its stability and convergence.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Real-Time Bayesian Inference for Linear Autonomous Dynamical Systems With Application to Digital Twins for Tsunami Early Warning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a goal-oriented framework for constructing digital twins with the following properties: (1) they employ discretizations of high-fidelity PDE models governed by autonomous dynamical systems, leading to large-scale forward problems; (2) they solve a linear inverse problem to assimilate observational data to infer uncertain model components followed by a forward prediction of the evolving dynamics; and (3) the entire end-to-end, data-to-inference-to-prediction computation is carried out without approximation and in real time through a Bayesian framework that rigorously accounts for uncertainties. Several challenges must be overcome to realize this framework, including the large scale of the forward problem, the high dimensionality of the parameter space, and for a class of problems including those we target, the slow decay of the singular values of the parameter-to-observable map. Here we introduce a methodology to overcome these challenges by exploiting the autonomous structure of the forward model to decompose the solution of the inverse problem into an offline phase in which the PDE model is solved a limited number of times, and an online phase that computes the parameter inference and prediction of quantities of interest in real time, given observational data. Our goal is to apply this framework to construct digital twins for subduction zones to provide early warning for tsunamis. To this end, we show how our methodology can be used to employ seafloor pressure observations, along with the coupled acoustic-gravity wave equations, to infer the earthquake-induced seafloor motion (discretized with 10^9 parameters) and forecast the tsunami propagation. We present results of an end-to-end inference, prediction, and uncertainty quantification for a representative test problem with 10^8 inversion parameters for which goal-oriented Bayesian inference is accomplished in real time.</description>

      <title>Enriching continuous Lagrange finite element approximation spaces using neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a study combining two approaches in the context of solving PDEs: the continuous finite element method (FEM) and more recent techniques based on neural networks. In recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have become particularly interesting for rapidly solving PDEs, especially in high dimensions. However, their lack of accuracy can be a significant drawback in this context, hence the interest in combining them with FEM, for which error estimates are already known. The complete pipeline proposed here consists in modifying the classical FEM approximation spaces by taking information from a prior, chosen as the prediction of a neural network. On the one hand, this combination improves and certifies the prediction of neural networks, to obtain a fast and accurate solution. On the other hand, error estimates are proven, showing that such strategies outperform classical ones by a factor that depends only on the quality of the prior. We validate our approach with numerical results performed on parametric problems with 1D, 2D and 3D geometries. These experiments demonstrate that to achieve a given accuracy, a coarser mesh can be used with our enriched FEM compared to the standard FEM, leading to reduced computational time, particularly for parametric problems.</description>

Abstract: Hug is a recently proposed iterative mapping used to design efficient updates in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Hug generates proposals that remain very close to hypersurfaces (level sets) of constant probabilty density. We analyse a generalization of Hug from hypersurfaces to manifolds of arbitrary dimensions, not necessarily arising in a sampling context. The analysis is based on interpreting, in a nonstandard way, Hug as a consistent discretization of a system of differential equations with a rather complicated structure. The proof of convergence of this discretization includes a number of unusual features we explore fully, in particular a supraconvergence property is established, whereby second order of convergence is attained with consistency of the first order. We uncover and discuss an unexpected property of the solutions of the underlying dynamical system that manifest itself by the existence of Hug trajectories that fail to cover the manifold of interest.</description>

Abstract: We propose new a posteriori error estimators for non-conforming finite element discretizations of second-order elliptic PDE problems. These estimators are based on novel reformulations of the standard Prager-Synge identity, and enable to prove efficiency estimates without extra stabilization terms in the error measure for a large class of discretization schemes. We propose a residual-based estimator for which the efficiency constant scales optimally in polynomial degree, as well as two equilibrated estimators that are polynomial-degree-robust. One of the two estimators further leads to asymptotically constant-free error bounds.</description>

      <title>Exact expressions for the unresolved stress in a finite-volume based large-eddy simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we propose new discretization-informed expressions for the residual stress tensor (RST) in a finite-volume based large-eddy simulation (LES-FVM). In addition to the classical RST $\overline{u u} - \bar{u} \bar{u}$ resulting from the non-commutation between filtering and the nonlinear stress, our RST also contains contributions from the numerical flux, discrete divergence, and pressure terms. Unlike the classical RST, our proposed RST is non-symmetric and non-local. The proposed form of the RST is important for generating appropriate reference data for LES closure modeling.
  Based on DNS results of the 1D Burgers and 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, we show that the discretization-induced parts of the RST play an important role in the LES-FVM equation for common LES filter widths. When the discrete contribution is included, our RST expression gives zero a-posteriori error in LES, while existing RST expressions give errors that increase over time. For a Smagorinsky model, we show that the Smagorinsky coefficient is higher when fitted to our new RST than when fitted to the classical RST and gives improved results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), yet they often fail to achieve accurate convergence in the H1 norm, especially in the presence of boundary approximation errors. In this work, we propose a novel method called Sobolev-Stable Boundary Enforcement (SSBE), which redefines the boundary loss using Sobolev norms to incorporate boundary regularity directly into the training process. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that SSBE ensures bounded H1 error via a stability guarantee and derive generalization bounds that characterize its robustness under finite-sample regimes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear PDEs, including Poisson, heat, and elliptic problems, show that SSBE consistently outperforms standard PINNs in terms of both relative L2 and H1 errors, even in high-dimensional settings. The proposed approach offers a principled and practical solution for improving gradient fidelity and overall solution accuracy in neural network based PDE solvers.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Finite-Volume Reconstruction Framework for Efficient High-Order Shock-Capturing on Unstructured Meshes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a multi-dimensional, arbitrary-order hybrid reconstruction framework for compressible flows on unstructured meshes. The method combines the efficiency of linear reconstruction with the robustness of high-order non-oscillatory schemes, activated only where needed through a novel a priori detection strategy. By minimising the use of costly CWENOZ and MUSCL reconstructions, the approach substantially reduces computational expense without sacrificing accuracy or stability. The framework blends CWENOZ formulations with the MOOD paradigm and introduces a redesigned Numerical Admissibility Detector that classifies the flow in a single step as smooth, weakly non-smooth, or discontinuous. Smooth regions use high-order linear reconstruction, weakly non-smooth regions use CWENOZ, and discontinuities are treated with second-order MUSCL. This targeted allocation preserves high-order accuracy while ensuring non-oscillatory and stable solutions near shocks. Implemented in the open-source unstructured finite-volume solver UCNS3D, the method supports arbitrary-order reconstruction on mixed-element meshes. Two- and three-dimensional benchmarks confirm the designed accuracy in smooth regions and enhanced robustness in shock-dominated flows. Reduced reliance on nonlinear reconstructions yields up to a 2.5x speed-up over same-order CWENOZ in 3D compressible turbulence simulations, bringing high-order accuracy closer to industrial-scale CFD applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an effective new method for solving trust-region and norm-regularization problems that arise as subproblems in many optimization applications. We show that the solutions to such subproblems lie on a manifold of approximately very low rank as a function of their controlling parameters (trust-region radius or regularization weight). Based on this, we build a basis for this manifold using an efficient extended-Krylov-subspace iteration that involves a single matrix factorization. The problems within the subspace using such a basis may be solved at very low cost using effective high-order root-finding methods. This then provides an alternative to common methods using multiple factorizations or standard Krylov subspaces. We provide numerical results to illustrate the effectiveness of our {\tt TREK}/{\tt NREK} approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose data-integrated neural networks (DataInNet) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), offering a novel approach to leveraging data (e.g., source terms, initial conditions, and boundary conditions). The core of this work lies in the integration of data into a unified network framework. DataInNet comprises two subnetworks: a data integration neural network responsible for accommodating and fusing various types of data, and a fully connected neural network dedicated to learning the residual physical information not captured by the physics integration neural network. This network architecture inherently excludes function classes that violate known physical constraints, thereby substantially narrowing the solution search space. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DataInNet delivers superior performance on challenging problems, such as the Helmholtz equation (relative \(L^2\) error: O(\(10^{-6}\))) and PDEs with high frequency solutions (relative \(L^2\) error: O(\(10^{-5}\))).</description>

      <title>Finite Expression Methods for Discovering Physical Laws from Data</title>

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics is a pervasive phenomenon observed in scientific and engineering disciplines. However, the task of deriving analytical expressions to describe nonlinear dynamics from limited data remains challenging. In this paper, we shall present a novel deep symbolic learning method called the "finite expression method" (FEX) to discover governing equations within a function space containing a finite set of analytic expressions, based on observed dynamic data. The key concept is to employ FEX to generate analytical expressions of the governing equations by learning the derivatives of partial differential equation (PDE) solutions through convolutions. Our numerical results demonstrate that our FEX surpasses other existing methods (such as PDE-Net, SINDy, GP, and SPL) in terms of numerical performance across a range of problems, including time-dependent PDE problems and nonlinear dynamical systems with time-varying coefficients. Moreover, the results highlight FEX's flexibility and expressive power in accurately approximating symbolic governing equations.</description>

      <title>A Fast Algorithm for the Finite Expression Method in Learning Dynamics on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex network data is prevalent in various real-world domains, including physical, technological, and biological systems. Despite this prevalence, predicting trends and understanding behavioral patterns in complex systems remain challenging due to poorly understood underlying mechanisms. While data-driven methods have advanced in uncovering governing equations from time series data, efforts to extract physical laws from network data are limited and often struggle with incomplete or noisy data. Additionally, they suffer from computational costs on network data, making it difficult to scale to real-world networks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called the Finite Expression Method (FEX) and its fast algorithm for learning dynamics on complex networks. FEX represents dynamics on complex networks using binary trees composed of finite mathematical operators. The nodes within these trees are trained through a combinatorial optimization process guided by reinforcement learning techniques. This unique configuration allows FEX to capture complex dynamics with minimal prior knowledge of the system and a small dictionary of mathematical operators. We also integrate a fast, stochastic algorithm into FEX, reducing the computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$. Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that FEX excels in accurately identifying dynamics across diverse network topologies and dynamic behaviors.</description>

      <title>Recovery of the matrix potential of the one-dimensional Dirac equation from spectral data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method for solving an inverse spectral problem for the one-dimensional Dirac equation is developed. The method is based on the Gelfand-Levitan equation and the Fourier-Legendre series expansion of the transmutation kernel. A linear algebraic system of equations is obtained, which can be solved numerically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical method for the solution of the inverse problem for the one-dimensional Dirac equation on a finite interval.</description>

      <title>Numerical Optimization Strategies for the Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz in Noisy Quantum Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of variational methods in near-term quantum computing makes optimizer choice critical, yet selection is frequently intuition-based. We therefore present a systematic benchmark of eight classical optimization algorithms for variational quantum chemistry using the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz. Performance is evaluated on H$_2$, H$_4$, and LiH in both full and active-space representations under noiseless and finite-shot sampling noise. Sampling noise substantially reshapes cost landscapes, induces wandering near minima, and flips optimizer rankings: gradient-based methods perform best in noiseless simulations, whereas population-based optimizers, particularly CMA-ES, show greater robustness under finite-shot noise. Optimizer performance is strongly problem dependent: Hartree-Fock initialization aids small systems, but its advantage diminishes with system size. Also, we observe that finite shot sampling frequently violates the lower bound given by the variational principle, a principle that cannot be strictly held in the presence of noise. By exploiting the guaranteed convergence of Evolution Strategies to a steady state distribution defined by the noise floor, we utilize the symmetry of these violations to achieve energy estimation precision beyond the intrinsic sampling limit.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA) Using CancelOut Layer and a Projected Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA), which identifies the underlying intrinsic dimension of a wide range of datasets whose samples lie on either linear or nonlinear manifolds. Beyond estimating the intrinsic dimension, IDEA is also able to reconstruct the original dataset after projecting it onto the corresponding latent space, which is structured using re-weighted double CancelOut layers. Our key contribution is the introduction of the projected reconstruction loss term, guiding the training of the model by continuously assessing the reconstruction quality under the removal of an additional latent dimension. We first assess the performance of IDEA on a series of theoretical benchmarks to validate its robustness. These experiments allow us to test its reconstruction ability and compare its performance with state-of-the-art intrinsic dimension estimators. The benchmarks show good accuracy and high versatility of our approach. Subsequently, we apply our model to data generated from the numerical solution of a vertically resolved one-dimensional free-surface flow, following a pointwise discretization of the vertical velocity profile in the horizontal direction, vertical direction, and time. IDEA succeeds in estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension and then reconstructs the original solution by working directly within the projection space identified by the network.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional FrBD friction models for rolling contact: extension to linear viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the distributed rolling contact FrBD framework to linear viscoelasticity by considering classic derivative Generalised Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt rheological representations of the bristle element. With this modelling approach, the dynamics of the bristle, generated friction forces, and internal deformation states are described by a system of 2(n+1) hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), which can capture complex relaxation phenomena originating from viscoelastic behaviours. By appropriately specifying the analytical expressions for the transport and rigid relative velocity, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, which account for different levels of spin excitation. For the linear variants, well-posedness and passivity are analysed rigorously, showing that these properties hold for any physically meaningful parametrisation. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical results by illustrating steady-state characteristics and transient relaxation effects. The findings of this paper substantially advance the FrBD paradigm by enabling a unified and systematic treatment of linear viscoelasticity.</description>
