      <title>Some non-trivial cycles of the space of long embeddings detected by configuration space integral invariants using g-loop (g =2, 3) graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give some non-trivial geometric cycles of the space of long embeddings R^j --&gt; R^n (n-j &gt;= 2) modulo immersions. We construct a class of cycles from specific chord diagrams associated with the 2-loop or 3-loop hairy graphs. To detect these cycles, we use cocycles obtained by the 2-loop or 3-loop part of modified configuration space integrals using a modified Bott-Cattaneo-Rossi graph complex. We show the non-triviality of the cycles by pairing argument, which is reduced to pairing of graphs with the chord diagrams. As a corollary of the 2-loop part, we provide an alternative proof of the non-finite generation of the (j-1)-th rational homotopy group of the space of long embeddings of codimension two, which Budney--Gabai and Watanabe first established. We also show the non-finite generation of the 2(j-1)-th homotopy group by using the 3-loop part.</description>

      <title>Nonsmooth Calabi-Yau structures for algebras and coalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that generalised Calabi-Yau dg (co)algebras are Koszul dual to generalised symmetric dg (co)algebras, without needing to assume any smoothness or properness hypotheses. Similarly, we show that Gorenstein and Frobenius are Koszul dual properties. As an application, we give a new characterisation of Poincar\'e duality spaces, which extends a theorem of F\'elix- Halperin-Thomas to the non-simply connected setting.</description>

Abstract: The Hopf index equates the multiplicity of a zero of a section of a vector bundle with a winding number. We give eight analogues for isotropic sections of bundles with quadratic form. There are applications to cosection localised virtual cycles and to DT$^4$ virtual cycles.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of codimension of persistence barcodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a pointwise finite-dimensional persistence module over a totally ordered set $S$, a theorem of Crawley-Boevey guarantees the existence of a barcode. When the set $S$ is finite, the persistence module is an equioriented type-A quiver representation and the barcode identifies a distinguished point in an algebraic variety. We prove a formula for the codimension of this variety inside an ambient space of comparable representations which depends only on the combinatorics of the barcode. We therefore extend the notion of codimension to persistence modules over any set S and prove that this extension is well-defined and can be effectively computed via a stabilization property of approximating quiver representations. Further, we prove realization theorems by constructing explicit examples via persistent homology of data for which the codimension can realize any natural number as its value.</description>

      <title>Comparing tempered and equivariant elliptic cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lurie and Gepner--Meier each define equivariant cohomology theories, namely \emph{tempered cohomology} and \emph{equivariant elliptic cohomology}, respectively, using derived algebraic geometry. We construct a natural equivalence between these theories where they overlap. Moreover, we emphasise the naturality and coherence of both these equivariant theories as well as our comparison. To demonstrate the use of this comparison, we show that the $G$-fixed points of equivariant topological modular forms is dualisable as a $\mathrm{TMF}$-module for all compact Lie groups $G$ that decompose as a product of a torus and a finite group by formally reducing to an argument of Gepner--Meier.</description>

      <title>Topological Optimal Transport for Geometric Cycle Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological data analysis is a powerful tool for describing topological signatures in real world data. An important challenge in topological data analysis is matching significant topological signals across distinct systems. In geometry and probability theory, optimal transport formalises notions of distance and matchings between distributions and structured objects. We propose to combine these approaches, constructing a mathematical framework for optimal transport-based matchings of topological features. Building upon recent advances in the domains of persistent homology and optimal transport for hypergraphs, we develop a transport-based methodology for topological data processing. We define measure topological networks, which integrate both geometric and topological information about a system, introduce a distance on the space of these objects, and study its metric properties, showing that it induces a geodesic metric space of non-negative curvature. The resulting Topological Optimal Transport (TpOT) framework provides a transport model on point clouds that minimises topological distortion while simultaneously yielding a geometrically informed matching between persistent homology cycles.</description>

      <title>On hidden face contributions of configuration space integrals for long embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Configuration space integrals are powerful tools for studying the homotopy type of the space of long embeddings in terms of a combinatorial object called a graph complex. It is unknown whether these integrals give a cochain map due to potential obstructions called hidden faces. The purpose of this paper is to address these hidden faces by modifying configuration space integrals: we incorporate the acyclic bar complex of some dg algebra into the original graph complex, without changing its cohomology. Then, we give a cochain map from the new graph complex to the de Rham complex of the space of long embeddings modulo immersions, by combining the original configuration space integrals with Chen's iterated integrals. As the original complex, we choose quite a modified graph complex so that it is quasi-isomorphic to both the hairy graph complex and a graph complex introduced in the context of embedding calculus.</description>

      <title>G-Mapper: Learning a Cover in the Mapper Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06634v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mapper algorithm is a visualization technique in topological data analysis (TDA) that outputs a graph reflecting the structure of a given dataset. However, the Mapper algorithm requires tuning several parameters in order to generate a ``nice" Mapper graph. This paper focuses on selecting the cover parameter. We present an algorithm that optimizes the cover of a Mapper graph by splitting a cover repeatedly according to a statistical test for normality. Our algorithm is based on G-means clustering which searches for the optimal number of clusters in $k$-means by iteratively applying the Anderson-Darling test. Our splitting procedure employs a Gaussian mixture model to carefully choose the cover according to the distribution of the given data. Experiments for synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm generates covers so that the Mapper graphs retain the essence of the datasets, while also running significantly faster than a previous iterative method.</description>

      <title>Relative Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of optimal transport relative to a distinguished subset, which acts as a reservoir of mass, allowing us to compare measures of different total variation. This relative transportation problem has an optimal solution and we obtain relative versions of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, Wasserstein distance, Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality and Monge-Kantorovich duality. We also prove relative versions of the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani theorem, which connect the spaces of measures arising from the relative optimal transport problem to spaces of Lipschitz functions. For a boundedly compact Polish space, we show that our relative 1-finite real-valued Radon measures with relative Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm coincide with the sequentially order continuous dual of relative Lipschitz functions with the operator norm. As part of our work we develop a theory of Riesz cones that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Cancellation of a critical pair in discrete Morse theory and its effect on (co)boundary operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete Morse theory helps us compute the homology groups of simplicial complexes in an efficient manner. A "good" gradient vector field reduces the number of critical simplices, simplifying the homology calculations by reducing them to the computation of homology groups of a simpler chain complex. This homology computation hinges on an efficient enumeration of gradient trajectories. The technique of cancelling pairs of critical simplices reduces the number of critical simplices, though it also perturbs the gradient trajectories. In this article, we demonstrate that (the matrix of) a certain modified boundary operator of interest can be derived from the corresponding original boundary operator through a sequence of elementary row operations. Thus, it eliminates the need of enumeration of the new gradient trajectories. We also obtain a similar result for coboundary operators.</description>
