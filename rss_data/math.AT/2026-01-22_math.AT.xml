      <title>Computing higher limits over the fusion orbit category via amalgams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study higher limits over the centric orbit category of a fusion system realized by an amalgamated product. In so doing we provide a novel technique for studying the Diaz-Park sharpness conjecture and prove it (in the case of the cohomology Mackey functors) for all the Clelland-Parker and Parker-Stroth fusion systems. This complements previous work from Henke, Libmand and Lynd. We further use the developed technique to study the Benson-Solomon fusion systems thus relating higher limits over the centric fusion orbit category of these systems with the signalizer functors described by Aschbacher and Chermak. We believe that the proposed technique can, in future work, be used as a first step in an induction argument that can bring us closer to providing an answer to this conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Torsion of Automorphisms of Nilpotent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reprise a $K_1$-valued refinement of Whitehead torsion originally studied by Gersten. We use this Gersten torsion to show that for nilpotent spaces with infinite fundamental group, any self-equivalence which acts as the identity on the fundamental group has vanishing Whitehead torsion. We find two applications of our vanishing result. First, we provide many examples of spaces with infinitely many simple structures. Second, we conclude that the group of homotopy classes of simple self-equivalences of a connected nilpotent space that act as the identity on the fundamental group is commensurable to an arithmetic group, building on a theorem of Sullivan. We also give a corrected version of Sullivan's proof as an appendix.</description>

      <title>Linear extensions and directed clique counts via modular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counting linear extensions is a fundamental problem in poset theory. It is known to be #P-complete, with polynomial-time formulas available in special cases. In this work, we develop new recursive formulas for counting linear extensions of posets whose modular partitions have particular structure. Specifically, we focus on posets whose incomparability graph has a modular partition with a skeleton that is a tree, a necklace of cliques, or a combination of both. The proofs are constructive and allow for the explicit generation of all linear extensions. We also discuss equivalent formulations of the problem in terms of permutations and directed graphs. The directed graph perspective is related to counting directed simplices in the directed flag complex of a digraph, with applications to understanding higher-order structure in neural circuits.</description>
