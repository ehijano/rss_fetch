      <title>Three's a crowd: Identification challenges in the triple difference model with spillover effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies identification in triple-difference designs when spillover effects contaminate one or more control groups. We show that, under conventional identifying assumptions, the triple-difference model fails to identify both the treatment effect and the spillover effect under such interference. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative specification, the double-triple-difference model, and explicitly formalize identifying assumptions and spillover structures required for consistent identification of both effects. We derive formal identification results and assess the performance of the proposed model through Monte Carlo simulations. An empirical application evaluating a Special Economic Zone in Italy is provided.</description>

      <title>Robust X-Learner: Breaking the Curse of Imbalance and Heavy Tails via Robust Cross-Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) in industrial applications such as AdTech and healthcare presents a dual challenge: extreme class imbalance and heavy-tailed outcome distributions. While the X-Learner framework effectively addresses imbalance through cross-imputation, we demonstrate that it is fundamentally vulnerable to "Outlier Smearing" when reliant on Mean Squared Error (MSE) minimization. In this failure mode, the bias from a few extreme observations ("whales") in the minority group is propagated to the entire majority group during the imputation step, corrupting the estimated treatment effect structure. To resolve this, we propose the Robust X-Learner (RX-Learner). This framework integrates a redescending {\gamma}-divergence objective -- structurally equivalent to the Welsch loss under Gaussian assumptions -- into the gradient boosting machinery. We further stabilize the non-convex optimization using a Proxy Hessian strategy grounded in Majorization-Minimization (MM) principles. Empirical evaluation on a semi-synthetic Criteo Uplift dataset demonstrates that the RX-Learner reduces the Precision in Estimation of Heterogeneous Effect (PEHE) metric by 98.6% compared to the standard X-Learner, effectively decoupling the stable "Core" population from the volatile "Periphery".</description>

      <title>Estimation and Inference for Synthetic Control Methods with Spillover Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.07343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimation and inference procedures for synthetic control methods often do not allow for the existence of spillover effects, which are plausible in many applications. In this paper, we consider estimation and inference for synthetic control methods, allowing for spillover effects. We propose estimators for both direct treatment effects and spillover effects and show that they are asymptotically unbiased. In addition, we propose an inferential procedure and show that it is asymptotically unbiased. Our estimation and inference procedure applies to cases with multiple treated units and/or multiple post-treatment periods, and to ones where the underlying factor model is either stationary or cointegrated. We discuss the bias from misspecified spillover structures and propose a test for correct specification. We apply our method to a classic empirical example that investigates the effect of California's tobacco control program as in Abadie et al. (2010) and find evidence of spillovers. We contrast our method with the pure-donor approach through a sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>What Impulse Response Do Instrumental Variables Identify?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11828v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local projection-instrumental variable (LP-IV) literature has been largely silent on cases in which impulse responses are set-identified, arising when the shock of interest is composite and instruments are correlated with multiple components. We demonstrate that LP-IV estimands constructed using one instrument at a time identify affine combinations of impulse responses to structural shock components with instrument-specific and potentially negative weights, challenging standard causal interpretation. The two-stage least squares compounds the identification problem. However, we show that individual LP-IV estimands characterize the identified set when sign restrictions on the correlations between instruments and structural shock components are imposed. Under weak stationarity, these identified sets are sharp and cannot be further narrowed in key cases. Two empirical examples--decomposing the U.S. government spending multiplier and disentangling pure monetary shocks from central bank information shocks--illustrate the usefulness of our approach.</description>

      <title>The Subtlety of Optimal Paternalism in a Population with Bounded Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the subtlety of optimal paternalism when a utilitarian planner has the power to design a discrete choice set for a heterogeneous population with bounded rationality. We first consider the planning problem in abstraction. We show that the policy that most effectively constrains or influences choices depends multiplicatively on the preferences of the population and the choice probabilities conditional on preferences that measure the suboptimality of behavior. We then study two settings in which the planner may mandate an action or decentralize decision making. One setting supposes that individuals measure utility with additive random error and maximize mismeasured rather than actual utility. Then optimal planning requires knowledge of the distribution of measurement errors. The other setting studies binary treatment choice when the planner can mandate a treatment conditional on publicly observed personal covariates or can enable individuals to choose their own treatments conditional on private information. Here we focus on situations where bounded rationality takes the form of deviations between subjective and objective probabilities of uncertain outcomes. To illustrate, we consider clinical decision making in medicine. In toto, our cautionary analysis shows that determination of optimal policy requires the planner to possess extensive knowledge that is rarely available. We warn that research in behavioral public economics should avoid overoptimistic claims regarding the nature of optimal paternalistic policies. We argue that credible study of utilitarian planning should consider not only the population but also the planner to be boundedly rational.</description>

      <title>Life Sequence Transformer: Generative Modelling of Socio-Economic Trajectories from Administrative Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative modelling with Transformer architectures can simulate complex sequential structures across various applications. We extend this line of work to the social sciences by introducing a Transformer-based generative model tailored to longitudinal socio-economic data. Our contributions are: (i) we design a novel encoding method that represents socio-economic life histories as sequences, including overlapping events across life domains; and (ii) we adapt generative modelling techniques to simulate plausible alternative life trajectories conditioned on past histories. Using large-scale data from the Italian social security administration (INPS), we show that the model can be trained at scale, reproduces realistic labour market patterns consistent with known causal relationships, and generates coherent hypothetical life paths. This work demonstrates the feasibility of generative modelling for socio-economic trajectories and opens new opportunities for policy-oriented research, with counterfactual generation as a particularly promising application.</description>

      <title>A Blessing in Disguise: How DeFi Hacks Trigger Unintended Liquidity Injections into US Money Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Do vulnerabilities in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) destabilize traditional short-term funding markets? While the prevailing "Contagion Hypothesis" posits that the liquidation of stablecoin reserves triggers fire-sale spirals that transmit distress to traditional markets , we document a robust "Flight-to-Quality" effect to the contrary. In the wake of major DeFi exploits, spreads on 3-month AA-rated commercial paper (CP) exhibit a paradoxical narrowing. We identify a "liquidity recycling" mechanism driving this outcome: capital fleeing DeFi protocols is re-intermediated into the traditional financial system via Prime Money Market Funds (MMFs) , where strict regulatory constraints (e.g., SEC Rule 2a-7) compel these funds to purchase high-quality paper. Our estimates indicate that this institutional demand shock quantitatively overwhelms the supply shock driven by stablecoin issuer redemptions. Rather than acting as vectors of financial contagion , these crypto native shocks serve as an inadvertent "safety valve" in segmented markets , providing transient liquidity support and effectively subsidizing borrowing costs for high-grade issuers in the real economy.</description>

      <title>The Maintenance and Necessity of Universal Rules: Scale, Hierarchy, the Cost of Justice, and Civilizational Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon previous research, this paper further explores the topological foundations for maintaining universal rules within ultra-large-scale societies. It finds that in small-scale societies, absolute egalitarianism and the rule of law can be compatible through peer monitoring within a fully connected network. However, in ultra-large-scale societies, to maintain high-dimensional rules capable of protecting innovation and property rights, a complex hierarchical structure including "high-fragility" nodes must be constructed. Through quantitative analysis of power structures, this paper proves that a flattened, two-tier structure inevitably leads to the degradation of the rule of law. Only a social topology with sufficient hierarchical depth can escape the deathly trap of the Leviathan while expanding in scale, thereby sustaining the dynamic evolution of civilization.</description>
