      <description>arXiv:2403.04815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The small mass limit is derived for a McKean-Vlasov equation subject to environmental noise with state-dependent friction. By applying the averaging approach to a non-autonomous stochastic slow-fast system with the microscopic and macroscopic scales, the convergence in distribution is obtained.</description>

      <title>Fractional stochastic Landau-Lifshitz Navier-Stokes equations in dimension $d \geq 3$: Existence and (non-)triviality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fractional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations in $d\ge 3$, driven by the random force $(-\Delta)^{\frac{\theta}{2}}\xi$ which, as we show, corresponds to a fractional version of the Landau-Lifshitz random force in the physics literature. We obtain the existence and uniqueness of martingale solutions on the torus $\mathbb T^d$ for $\theta &gt; \frac{d}{2}$. For $\theta \le 1$ the equation is supercritical and we regularize the problem by introducing a Galerkin approximation and we study the large scale behavior of the truncated model on $\RR^d$. We show that the nonlinear term in the Galerkin approximation vanishes on large scales when $\theta &lt; 1$ and the model converges to the linearized equation. For $\theta = 1$ the nonlinear term gives a nontrivial contribution to the large scale beahvior, and we conjecture that the large scale behavior is given by a linear model with strictly larger effective diffusivity compared to simply dropping the nonlinear term. The effective diffusivity is explicitly given in terms of the model parameters.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the Ewens sampling formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an infinitely-many neutral allelic model of population genetics where all alleles are divided into a finite number of classes, and each class is characterized by its own mutation rate. For this model the allelic composition of a sample taken from a very large population of genes is characterized by a random matrix, and the problem is to describe the joint distribution of the matrix entries. The answer is given by a new generalization of the classical Ewens sampling formula called the refined Ewens sampling formula in the present paper. We discuss a Poisson approximation for the refined Ewens sampling formula, and present its derivation by several methods. As an application we obtain limit theorems for the numbers of alleles in different asymptotic regimes.</description>

      <title>Time changed spherical Brownian motions with longitudinal drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the time change of the diffusion process on the 2-dimensional unit sphere generated by the Laplace-Beltrami operator, perturbed by means of a longitudinal vector field. First, this is done by addressing the problem of finding strong solutions to suitable time-nonlocal Kolmogorov equations, via a spectral decomposition approach. Next, the desired process is constructed as the composition of the aforementioned diffusion process and the inverse of a subordinator, and it is used to provide a stochastic representation of the solution of the involved time-nonlocal Kolmogorov equation, which in turn leads to the spectral decomposition of its probability density function. A family of operators induced by the process is then adopted to provide very weak solutions of the same time-nonlocal Kolmogorov equation with much less regular initial data. From the spectral decomposition results we also get some bounds on the speed of convergence to the stationary state, proving that the process can be considered an anomalous diffusion. These results improve some known ones in terms of both the presence of a perturbation and the lack of regularity of the initial data.</description>

Abstract: The height of a random PATRICIA tree built from independent, identically distributed infinite binary strings with arbitrary diffuse probability distribution $\mu$ on $\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ is studied. We show that the expected height grows asymptotically sublinearly in the number of leaves for any such $\mu$, but can be made to exceed any specific sublinear growth rate by choosing $\mu$ appropriately.</description>

      <title>The density of imaginary multiplicative chaos is positive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a log-correlated Gaussian field $\Gamma$ and its associated imaginary multiplicative chaos $:e^{i \beta \Gamma}:$ where $\beta$ is a real parameter. In [AJJ22], we showed that for any nonzero test function $f$, the law of $\int f :e^{i \beta \Gamma}:$ possesses a smooth density with respect to Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{C}$. In this note, we show that this density is strictly positive everywhere on $\mathbb{C}$. Our simple and direct strategy could be useful for studying other functionals on Gaussian spaces.</description>

      <title>Tagged particle fluctuations for TASEP with dynamics restricted by a moving wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on $\Z$ with step initial condition and with the presence of a rightward-moving wall that prevents the particles from jumping. This model was first studied in [Borodin-Bufetov-Ferrari'21]. We extend their work by determining the limiting distribution of a tagged particle in the case where the wall has influence on its fluctuations in neighbourhoods of multiple macroscopic times.</description>

      <title>Limit Laws for Critical Dispersion on Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, $M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. In subsequent time steps, all particles that are located on a vertex inhabited by at least two particles jump independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle; we call this (random) time step the dispersion time.
  In this work we study the case where $G$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices and the number of particles is $M=n/2+\alpha n^{1/2} + o(n^{1/2})$, $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$. This choice of $M$ corresponds to the critical window of the process, with respect to the dispersion time. We show that the dispersion time, if rescaled by $n^{-1/2}$, converges in $p$-th mean, as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and for any $p \in \mathbb{R}$, to a continuous and almost surely positive random variable $T_\alpha$. We find that $T_\alpha$ is the absorption time of a standard logistic branching process, thoroughly investigated by Lambert (2005), and we determine its expectation. In particular, in the middle of the critical window we show that $\mathbb{E}[T_0] = \pi^{3/2}/\sqrt{7}$, and furthermore we formulate explicit asymptotics when $|\alpha|$ gets large that quantify the transition into and out of the critical window. We also study the random variable counting the total number of jumps that are performed by the particles until the dispersion time is reached and prove that, if rescaled by $n\ln n$, it converges to $2/7$ in probability.</description>

      <title>Simulating conditioned diffusions on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, most methods for simulating conditioned diffusions are limited to the Euclidean setting. The conditioned process can be constructed using a change of measure known as Doob's $h$-transform. The specific type of conditioning depends on a function $h$ which is typically unknown in closed form. To resolve this, we extend the notion of guided processes to a manifold $M$, where one replaces $h$ by a function based on the heat kernel on $M$. We consider the case of a Brownian motion with drift, constructed using the frame bundle of $M$, conditioned to hit a point $x_T$ at time $T$. We prove equivalence of the laws of the conditioned process and the guided process with a tractable Radon-Nikodym derivative. Subsequently, we show how one can obtain guided processes on any manifold $N$ that is diffeomorphic to $M$ without assuming knowledge of the heat kernel on $N$.
  We illustrate our results with numerical simulations and an example of parameter estimation where a diffusion process on the torus is observed discretely in time.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Propagation of Chaos for Singular Interacting Particle Systems Driven by Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider interacting systems particle driven by i.i.d. fractional Brownian motions, subject to irregular, possibly distributional, pairwise interactions. We show propagation of chaos and mean field convergence to the law of the associated McKean--Vlasov equation, as the number of particles $N\to\infty$, with quantitative sharp rates of order $N^{-1/2}$. Our results hold for a wide class of possibly time-dependent interactions, which are only assumed to satisfy a Besov-type regularity, related to the Hurst parameter $H\in (0,+\infty)\setminus \mathbb{N}$ of the driving noises. In particular, as $H$ decreases to $0$, interaction kernels of arbitrary singularity can be considered, a phenomenon frequently observed in regularization by noise results. Our proofs rely on a combinations of Sznitman's direct comparison argument with stochastic sewing techniques.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for slow-fast processes on connected complete Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of slow-fast processes on a connected complete Riemannian manifold $M$.The limiting dynamics as the scale separation goes to $\infty$ is governed by the averaging principle. Around this limit, we prove large deviation principles with an action-integral rate function for the slow process by nonlinear semigroup methods together with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation techniques. The innovation is solving a comparison principle for viscosity solutions on $M$ and the existence of a viscosity solution via a control problem for a non-smooth Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Long-range competition on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a competition between two growth models with long-range correlations on the torus $\mathbb T_n^d$ of size $n$ in dimension $d$. We append the edge set of the torus $\mathbb T_n^d$ by including all non-nearest-neighbour edges, and from two source vertices, two first-passage percolation (FPP) processes start flowing on $\mathbb T_n^d$ and compete to cover the sites. The FPP processes we consider are long-range first-passage percolation processes, as studied by Chaterjee and Dey. Here, we have two types, say Type-$1$ and Type-$2$, and the Type-$i$ transmission time of an edge $e$ equals $\lambda_i^{-1} \|e\|^{\alpha_i}E_e$ for $i\in\{1,2\}$, where $(E_e)_e$ is a family of i.i.d.\ rate-one exponential random variables, $\lambda_1,\lambda_2&gt;0$ are the global rate parameters, and $\alpha_1,\alpha_2\geq 0$ are the long-range parameters. In particular, we consider the instantaneous percolation regime, where $\alpha_1,\alpha_2\in[0,d)$, and we allow all parameters to depend on $n$. We study \emph{coexistence}, the event that both types reach a positive proportion of the graph, and identify precisely when coexistence occurs. In the case of absence of coexistence, we outline several phase transitions in the size of the losing type, depending on the relation between the rates of both types. One of the consequences of our results is that for constant intensity competition, i.e.\ when the long-range parameters of the two processes are the same, while their rates differ by a constant multiplicative factor, coexistence of the two processes at the scale of the torus volume happen if and only if their global rates are equal. On the other hand, when the long-range parameters differ, it is possible for one of the types, e.g.\ Type-$2$, to reach a significant number of vertices, even when its global rate parameter $\lambda_2$ is much smaller than $\lambda_1$.</description>

      <title>Effective quenched linear response for random dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove ``effective'' linear response for certain classes of non-uniformly expanding random dynamical systems which are not necessarily composed in an i.i.d manner. In applications, the results are obtained for base maps with a sufficient amount of mixing. The fact that the rates are effective is then applied to obtain the differentiability of the variance in the CLT as a function of the parameter, as well as the annealed linear response. These two applications are beyond the reach of the linear response obtained in the general case, when all the random variables appearing in the bounds are only tempered. We also provide several wide examples of one-dimensional maps satisfying our conditions, as well as some higher-dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Ising models: the Semi-infinite with decaying field and the Random Field Long-range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we present results on phase transition for two models: the semi-infinite Ising model with a decaying field, and the long-range Ising model with a random field. We study the semi-infinite Ising model with an external field $h_i = \lambda |i_d|^{-\delta}$, $\lambda$ is the wall influence, and $\delta&gt;0$. This external field decays as it gets further away from the wall. We are able to show that when $\delta&gt;1$ and $\beta &gt; \beta_c(d)$, there exists a critical value $0&lt; \lambda_c:=\lambda_c(\delta,\beta)$ such that, for $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c$ there is phase transition and for $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c$ we have uniqueness of the Gibbs state. In addition, when $\delta&lt;1$ we have only one Gibbs state for any positive $\beta$ and $\lambda$. For the model with a random field, we extend the recent argument by Ding and Zhuang from nearest-neighbor to long-range interactions and prove the phase transition in the class of ferromagnetic random field Ising models. Our proof combines a generalization of Fr\"ohlich-Spencer contours to the multidimensional setting proposed by Affonso, Bissacot, Endo and Handa, with the coarse-graining procedure introduced by Fisher, Fr\"ohlich, and Spencer. Our result shows that the Ding-Zhuang strategy is also useful for interactions $J_{xy}=|x-y|^{- \alpha}$ when $\alpha &gt; d$ in dimension $d\geq 3$ if we have a suitable system of contours, yielding an alternative proof that does not use the Renormalization Group Method (RGM), since Bricmont and Kupiainen claimed that the RGM should also work on this generality. We can consider i.i.d. random fields with Gaussian or Bernoulli distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a locally finite tree whose geometric boundary has infinitely many points. Suppose that a non-amenable group $\G$ acts isometrically and geometrically on the tree $\mathcal{T}$.
  In this paper, we show that if the length spectrum is Diophantine, then there exists a continuous function $C$ on $\mathcal{T}^2$ such that the heat kernel $p(t,x,y)$ of $\mathcal{T}$ satisfies
  $$\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}t^{3/2}e^{\lambda_0t}p(t,x,y)=C(x,y)$$
  for any $x,y\in \mathcal{T}$. Here, $\lambda_0$ is the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplacian on $\mathcal{T}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an asymptotically normal wavelet-based strongly consistent estimator for the Hurst parameter of any Hermite processes. This estimator is obtained by considering a modified wavelet variation in which coefficients are wisely chosen to be, up to negligeable remainders, independent. We use Stein-Malliavin calculus to prove that this wavelet variation satisfies a multidimensional Central Limit Theorem, with an explicit bound for the Wasserstein distance.</description>

Abstract: We do the error analysis in reliability measures due to the assumption of independence amongst the component lifetimes. In reliability theory, we come across different n-component structures like series, parallel, and k-out-of-n systems. A n component series system works only if all the n components work. While studying the reliability measures of a n-component series system, we mostly assume that all the components have independent lifetimes. Such an assumption eases mathematical complexity while analyzing the data and hence is very common. But in reality, the lifetimes of the components are very much interdependent. Such an assumption of independence hence leads to inaccurate analysis of data. In multiple situations like studying a complex system with many components, we turn to assuming independence keeping some room for error. However, if we have some knowledge of the behaviour of errors or some estimate on the error bound, we could decide if we assume independence and prefer mathematical simplicity (if we know the error is within our allowed limit), or keep the mathematical complexity and get accurate results without assuming independence. We aim to find the relative errors in the reliability measures for a n-component series system.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Timescales of a Complex System: A Bayesian Approach to Temporal Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changes in the timescales at which complex systems evolve are essential to predicting critical transitions and catastrophic failures. Disentangling the timescales of the dynamics governing complex systems remains a key challenge. With this study, we introduce an integrated Bayesian framework based on temporal network models to address this challenge. We focus on two methodologies: change point detection for identifying shifts in system dynamics, and a spectrum analysis for inferring the distribution of timescales. Applied to synthetic and empirical datasets, these methologies robustly identify critical transitions and comprehensively map the dominant and subsidiaries timescales in complex systems. This dual approach offers a powerful tool for analyzing temporal networks, significantly enhancing our understanding of dynamic behaviors in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of crossing probabilities in the dilute Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent paper due to Duminil-Copin and Tassion from 2019 introduces a novel argument for obtaining estimates on horizontal crossing probabilities of the random cluster model, in which a range of four possible behaviors is established. To apply the novel renormalization of crossing probabilities that the authors propose can be studied in other models of interest that are not self-dual, we collect results to formulate vertical and horizontal strip, and renormalization, inequalities for the dilute Potts model, whose measure is obtained from the high temperature expansion of the loop $O(n)$ measure supported over the hexagonal lattice in the presence of two external fields. The dilute Potts model was originally introduced in $1991$ by Nienhuis and is another model that enjoys the RSW box crossing property in the Continuous Critical phase, which is one of the four possible behaviors that the model is shown to enjoy. Through a combination of the Spatial Markov Property (SMP) and Comparison between Boundary Conditions (CBC) of the high-temperature spin measure, four phases of the dilute Potts model can be analyzed, exhibiting a class of boundary conditions upon which the probability of obtaining a horizontal crossing is significantly dependent. The exponential factor that is inserted into the Loop $O(n)$ model to quantify properties of the high-temperature phase is proportional to the summation over all spins, and the number of monochromatically colored triangles over a finite volume, which is in exact correspondence with the parameter of a Boltzmann weight introduced in Nienhuis' 1991 paper detailing extensions of the $q$-state Potts model. Asymptotically, in the infinite volume limit we obtain strip and renormalization inequalities that provide conditions on the RSW constants $1-c$ and $c$.</description>

      <title>Random trees have height $O(\sqrt{n})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain new non-asymptotic tail bounds for the height of uniformly random trees with a given degree sequence, simply generated trees and conditioned Bienaym\'e trees (the family trees of branching processes), in the process settling three conjectures of Janson (2012) and answering several other questions from the literature.
  Moreover, we define a partial ordering on degree sequences and show that it induces a stochastic ordering on the heights of uniformly random trees with given degree sequences. The latter result can also be used to show that sub-binary random trees are stochastically the tallest trees with a given number of vertices and leaves (and thus that random binary trees are the stochastically tallest random homeomorphically irreducible trees with a given number of vertices).
  Our proofs are based in part on the bijection between trees and sequences introduced by Foata and Fuchs (1970), which can be recast to provide a line-breaking construction of random trees with given vertex degrees as shown in Addario-Berry, Blanc-Renaudie, Donderwinkel, Maazoun and Martin (2023).</description>

      <title>Generating Galton-Watson trees using random walks and percolation for the Gaussian free field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of Gaussian free field level sets on supercritical Galton-Watson trees has been initiated by Ab\"acherli and Sznitman in Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'{e} Probab. Stat., 54(1):173--201, 2018. By means of entirely different tools, we continue this investigation and generalize their main result on the positivity of the associated percolation critical parameter $h_*$ to the setting of arbitrary supercritical offspring distribution and random conductances. A fortiori, this provides a positive answer to the open question raised at the end of the aforementioned article. What is more, in our setting it also establishes a rigorous proof of the physics literature mantra that positive correlations facilitate percolation when compared to the independent case. Our proof proceeds by constructing the Galton-Watson tree through an exploration via finite random walk trajectories. This exploration of the tree progressively unveils an infinite connected component in the random interlacements set on the tree, which is stable under small quenched noise. Using a Dynkin-type isomorphism theorem, we then infer the strict positivity of the critical parameter $ h_* .$ As a byproduct of our proof we obtain the transience of the random interlacement set and the level sets of the Gaussian free field above small positive levels on such Galton-Watson trees.</description>

      <title>Multiple Partition Structures and Harmonic Functions on Branching Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study multiple partition structures which are sequences of probability measures on families of Young diagrams subjected to a consistency condition. The multiple partition structures are generalizations of Kingman's partition structures, and are motivated by a problem of population genetics. They are related to harmonic functions and coherent systems of probability measures on a certain branching graph. The vertices of this graph are multiple Young diagrams (or multiple partitions), and the edges depend on the Jack parameter. Our main result establishes a bijective correspondence between the set of harmonic functions on the graph and probability measures on the generalized Thoma set. The correspondence is determined by a canonical integral representation of harmonic functions. As a consequence we obtain a representation theorem for multiple partition structures.
  We give an example of a multiple partition structure which is expected to be relevant for a model of population genetics for the genetic variation of a sample of gametes from a large population. Namely, we construct a probability measure on the wreath product of a finite group with the symmetric group. The constructed probability measure defines a multiple partition structure which is a generalization of the Ewens partition structure studied by Kingman. We show that this multiple partition structure can be represented in terms of a multiple analogue of the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution called the multiple Poisson-Dirichlet distribution in the paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotics of the point process induced by an interacting particle system with mean-field drift interaction. Under suitable assumptions, we establish propagation of chaos for this point process: it has the same weak limit as the point process induced by i.i.d. copies of the solution of a limiting Mckean--Vlasov equation. This weak limit is a Poisson point process whose intensity measure is related to classical extreme value distributions. In particular, this yields the limiting distribution of the normalized upper order statistics.</description>

      <title>On large $3/2$-stable maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss asymptotics of large Boltzmann random planar maps such that every vertex of degree $k$ has weight of order $k^{-2}$. Infinite maps of that kind were studied by Budd, Curien and Marzouk. These maps can be seen as the dual of the discrete $\alpha$-stable maps studied by Le Gall and Miermont for $\alpha=3/2$ or as the gaskets of critical $O(2)$-decorated random planar maps. We compute the asymptotics of the graph distance and of the first passage percolation distance between two uniform vertices, which are respectively equivalent in probability to $(\log \ell)^2/\pi^2$ and $2(\log \ell)/(\pi^2 p_{\bf q})$ when the perimeter of the map $\ell$ goes to $\infty$, where $p_{\bf q}$ is a constant which depends on the model. We also show that the diameter is of the same order as those distances for both metrics and obtain in particular that these maps do not satisfy scaling limits in the sense of Gromov-Prokhorov or Gromov-Hausdorff for lack of tightness. To study the peeling exploration of these maps, we prove local limit and scaling limit theorems for a class of random walks with heavy tails conditioned to remain positive until they die at $-\ell$ towards processes that we call stable L\'evy processes conditioned to stay positive until they jump and die at $-1$.</description>

      <title>Features of a spin glass in the random field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A longstanding open question in the theory of disordered systems is whether short-range models, such as the random field Ising model or the Edwards-Anderson model, can indeed have the famous properties that characterize mean-field spin glasses at nonzero temperature. This article shows that this is at least partially possible in the case of the random field Ising model. Consider the Ising model on a discrete $d$-dimensional cube under free boundary condition, subjected to a very weak i.i.d. random external field, where the field strength is inversely proportional to the square-root of the number of sites. It turns out that in $d\ge 2$ and at subcritical temperatures, this model has some of the key features of a mean-field spin glass. Namely, (a) the site overlap exhibits one step of replica symmetry breaking, (b) the quenched distribution of the overlap is non-self-averaging, and (c) the overlap has the Parisi ultrametric property. Furthermore, it is shown that for Gaussian disorder, replica symmetry does not break if the field strength is taken to be stronger than the one prescribed above, and non-self-averaging fails if it is weaker, showing that the above order of field strength is the only one that allows all three properties to hold. However, the model does not have two other features of mean-field models. Namely, (a) it does not satisfy the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities, and (b) it has only two pure states instead of many.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present on-diagonal heat kernel estimates and quantitative homogenization statements for the one-dimensional Bouchaud trap model. The heat kernel estimates are obtained using standard techniques, with key inputs coming from a careful analysis of the volume growth of the invariant measure of the process under study. As for the quantitative homogenization results, these include both quenched and annealed Berry-Esseen-type theorems, as well as a quantitative quenched local limit theorem. Whilst the model we study here is a particularly simple example of a random walk in a random environment, we believe the roadmap we provide for establishing the latter result in particular will be useful for deriving quantitative local limit theorems in other, more challenging, settings.</description>

Abstract: The splitting scheme (the Kato-Trotter formula) is applied to stochastic flows with common noise of the type introduced by Th.E.~Harris. The case of possibly coalescing flows with continuous infinitesimal covariance is considered and the weak convergence of the corresponding finite-dimensional motions is established. As applications, results for the convergence of the associated pushforward measures and dual flows are given. Similarities between splitting and the Euler-Maruyama scheme yield estimates of the speed of the convergence under additional regularity assumptions.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to proving the small noise asymptotic behaviour, particularly large deviation principle, for multi-scale stochastic dynamical systems with fully local monotone coefficients driven by multiplicative noise. The main techniques are based on a combination of the weak convergence approach, the time discretization technique and the theory of pseudo-monotone operator. The main results derived in this paper have broad applicability to various multi-scale models, where the slow component could be such as stochastic porous medium equations, stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equations and stochastic 2D Liquid crystal equations.</description>

Abstract: Let $X=(X_t, t\geq 0)$ be a superprocess in a random environment described by a Gaussian noise $W^g=\{W^g(t,x), t\geq 0, x\in \mathbb{R}^d\}$ white in time and colored in space with correlation kernel $g(x,y)$. We show that when $d=1$, $X_t$ admits a jointly continuous density function $X_t(x)$ that is a unique in law solution to a stochastic partial differential equation
  \begin{align*} \frac{\partial }{\partial t}X_t(x)=\frac{\Delta}{2} X_t(x)+\sqrt{X_t(x)} \dot{V}(t,x)+X_t(x)\dot{W}^g(t, x) , \quad X_t(x)\geq 0, \end{align*} where $V=\{V(t,x), t\geq 0, x\in \mathbb{R}\}$ is a space-time white noise and is orthogonal with $W^g$. When $d\geq 2$, we prove that $X_t$ is singular and hence density does not exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.12731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a network of bank holdings, where every holding has two subsidiaries of different types. A subsidiary can trade with another holding's subsidiary of the same type. Holdings support their subsidiaries up to a certain level when they would otherwise fail to honor their financial obligations. We investigate the spread of contagion in this banking network when the number of bank holdings is large, and find the final number of defaulted subsidiaries under different rules for the holding support. We also consider resilience of this multilayered network to small shocks. Our work sheds light onto the role that holding structures can play in the amplification of financial stress. We find that depending on the capitalization of the network, a holding structure can be beneficial as compared to smaller separated entities. In other instances, it can be harmful and actually increase contagion. We illustrate our results in a numerical case study and also determine the optimal level of holding support from a regulator perspective.</description>

Abstract: We prove well-posedness in $H^{\sigma}(\mathbb{R})$ for any $\sigma \in [0,\infty)$ of a parametrically forced nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (PFNLS) in one dimension driven by multiplicative Stratonovich noise which has spatially homogeneous statistics. The noise is white in time and correlated in space. We first construct local mild solutions via a fixed-point argument. We then formulate a blow-up criterion by showing that the equation has persistence of integrability and regularity as long as the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-norm of the solution remains finite. Afterwards we derive a pathwise estimate on the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-norm using a mild It\^o formula. Our results also apply to the standard cubic NLS equation driven by multiplicative translation-invariant Stratonovich noise.</description>

      <title>Deep Relaxation of Controlled Stochastic Gradient Descent via Singular Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a singularly perturbed system of stochastic differential equations proposed by Chaudhari et al. (Res. Math. Sci. 2018) to approximate the Entropic Gradient Descent in the optimization of deep neural networks, via homogenisation. We embed it in a much larger class of two-scale stochastic control problems and rely on convergence results for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with unbounded data proved recently by ourselves (ESAIM Control Optim. Calc. Var. 2023). We show that the limit of the value functions is itself the value function of an effective control problem with extended controls, and that the trajectories of the perturbed system converge in a suitable sense to the trajectories of the limiting effective control system. These rigorous results improve the understanding of the convergence of the algorithms used by Chaudhari et al., as well as of their possible extensions where some tuning parameters are modelled as dynamic controls.</description>

      <title>Logarithms of Catalan generating functions: A combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the combinatorics behind the operation of taking the logarithm of the generating function $G_k$ for $k^\text{th}$ generalized Catalan numbers. We provide combinatorial interpretations in terms of lattice paths and in terms of tree graphs. Using explicit bijections, we are able to recover known closed expressions for the coefficients of $\log G_k$ by purely combinatorial means of enumeration. The non-algebraic proof easily generalizes to higher powers $\log^a G_k$, $a\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Convex Hull of the Image of a Set with Smooth Boundary: Error Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the convex hull of the image $f(X)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ of a compact set $X\subset\mathbb{R}^m$ with smooth boundary through a smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^n$. Assuming that $f$ is a submersion, we derive a new bound on the Hausdorff distance between the convex hull of $f(X)$ and the convex hull of the images $f(x_i)$ of $M$ sampled inputs $x_i$ on the boundary of $X$. When applied to the problem of geometric inference from a random sample, our results give error bounds that are tighter and more general than in previous work. We present applications to the problems of robust optimization, of reachability analysis of dynamical systems, and of robust trajectory optimization under bounded uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Generalized regular representations of big wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group with $k$ conjugacy classes, and $S(\infty)$ be the infinite symmetric group, i.e. the group of finite permutations of $\left\{1,2,3,\ldots\right\}$. Then the wreath product $G_{\infty}=G\sim S(\infty)$ of $G$ with $S(\infty)$ (called the big wreath product) can be defined. The group $G_{\infty}$ is a generalization of the infinite symmetric group, and it is an example of a ``big'' group, in Vershik's terminology. For such groups the two-sided regular representations are irreducible, the conventional scheme of harmonic analysis is not applicable, and the problem of harmonic analysis is a nontrivial problem with connections to different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics.
  Harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group was developed in the works by Kerov, Olshanski, and Vershik, and Borodin and Olshanski. The goal of this paper is to extend this theory to the case of $G_{\infty}$. In particular, we construct an analogue $\mathfrak{S}_{G}$ of the space of virtual permutations. We then formulate and prove a theorem characterizing all central probability measures on $\mathfrak{S}_{G}$, and introduce generalized regular representations $T_{z_1,\ldots,z_k}$ of the big wreath product $G_{\infty}$. The paper solves a natural problem of harmonic analysis for the big wreath products: our results describe the decomposition of $T_{z_1,\ldots,z_k}$ into irreducible components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in equilibrium for a dynamics of rods with random length. This includes the classical hard rod elastic collisions, when rod lengths are constant and equal to a positive value. We prove that in the diffusive space-time scaling, an initial fluctuation of density of particles of velocity $v$, after recentering on its Euler evolution, evolve randomly shifted by a Brownian motion of variance $\mathcal D(v)$.</description>

      <title>Random matrix statistics and safety rest areas on interstates in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06425v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze physical spacings between locations of safety rest areas on interstates in the United States. We show normalized safety rest area spacings on major interstates exhibit Wigner surmise statistics, which align with the eigenvalue spacings for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble from random matrix theory as well as the one-dimensional gas interactions via the Coulomb potential. We identify economic and geographic regional traits at the state level that exhibit Poissonian statistics, which become more pronounced with increased geographical obstacles in interstate travel. Other regional filters (e.g., historical or political) produced results that did not diverge substantially from the overall Wigner surmise model.</description>

      <title>Free Integral Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of conditional expectations in free random variables and provide closed formulas for the conditional expectation of resolvents of arbitrary non-commutative polynomials in free random variables onto the subalgebra of an arbitray subset of the variables. More precisely, given a linearization of the resolvent we compute a linearization of its conditional expectation. The coefficients of the expressions obtained in this process involve certain Boolean cumulant functionals which can be computed by solving a system of equations. On the way towards the main result we introduce a non-commutative differential calculus which allows to evaluate conditional expectations and the said Boolean cumulant functionals. We conclude the paper with several known and new examples which illustrate the working of the developed machinery and two appendices. The first appendix contains a purely algebraic approach to Boolean cumulants and the second appendix provides a crash course on linearizations of rational series.</description>

      <title>Multistatic-Radar RCS-Signature Recognition of Aerial Vehicles: A Bayesian Fusion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radar Automated Target Recognition (RATR) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) involves transmitting Electromagnetic Waves (EMWs) and performing target type recognition on the received radar echo, crucial for defense and aerospace applications. Previous studies highlighted the advantages of multistatic radar configurations over monostatic ones in RATR. However, fusion methods in multistatic radar configurations often suboptimally combine classification vectors from individual radars probabilistically. To address this, we propose a fully Bayesian RATR framework employing Optimal Bayesian Fusion (OBF) to aggregate classification probability vectors from multiple radars. OBF, based on expected 0-1 loss, updates a Recursive Bayesian Classification (RBC) posterior distribution for target UAV type, conditioned on historical observations across multiple time steps. We evaluate the approach using simulated random walk trajectories for seven drones, correlating target aspect angles to Radar Cross Section (RCS) measurements in an anechoic chamber. Comparing against single radar Automated Target Recognition (ATR) systems and suboptimal fusion methods, our empirical results demonstrate that the OBF method integrated with RBC significantly enhances classification accuracy compared to other fusion methods and single radar configurations.</description>
