      <title>Reider-type theorems on normal surfaces via Bridgeland stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Langer's construction of Bridgeland stability conditions on normal surfaces, we prove Reider-type theorems generalizing the work done by Arcara-Bertram in the smooth case. Our results still hold in positive characteristic or when $\omega_X \otimes L$ is not necessarily a line bundle. They also hold when the dualizing sheaf is replaced by a variant arising from the theory of Du Bois complexes. For complex surfaces with at most rational double point singularities, we recover the optimal bounds for global generation and very ampleness as predicted by Fujita's conjecture.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the various fundamental groupoid schemes and semi-finite bundles on complex tori and Riemann surfaces.

      <title>Approximable Triangulated Categories and Reflexive DG-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We produce a condition for a DG-category to be reflexive, in the sense of Kuznetsov and Shinder, using Neeman's theory of approximable triangulated categories. To do this we provide another description of the completion of an approximable triangulated category under an additional condition. We apply our results to proper schemes, proper connective DG-algebras and Azumaya algebras over proper schemes.</description>

      <title>A Miyaoka-Yau inequality for hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{CP}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{CP}^n$. We define a quadratic form $Q$ on $\mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{H}}$ that is entirely determined by the intersection poset of $\mathcal{H}$. Using the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for parabolic bundles, we show that if $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{H}}$ is such that the weighted arrangement $(\mathcal{H}, \mathbf{a})$ is \emph{stable}, then $Q(\mathbf{a}) \leq 0$.
  As an application, we consider the symmetric case where all the weights are equal. The inequality $Q(a, \ldots, a) \leq 0$ gives a lower bound for the total sum of multiplicities of codimension $2$ intersection subspaces of $\mathcal{H}$. The lower bound is attained when every $H \in \mathcal{H}$ intersects all the other members of $\mathcal{H} \setminus \{H\}$ along $(1-2/(n+1))|\mathcal{H}| + 1$ codimension $2$ subspaces; extending from $n=2$ to higher dimensions a condition found by Hirzebruch for line arrangements in the complex projective plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates flat webs on the projective plane. We present two methods for constructing such webs: the first involves taking the product of two convex reduced foliations and invariant lines, while the second consists of taking the product of finitely many convex homogeneous foliations and invariant lines. In both cases, we demonstrate that the dual web is flat.</description>

      <title>Commensurability Among Deligne-Mostow Monodromy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives the commensurability classification of Deligne-Mostow ball quotients and shows that the 104 Deligne-Mostow lattices form 38 commensurability classes. Firstly, we find commensurability relations among Deligne-Mostow monodromy groups, which are not necessarily discrete. This recovers and generalizes previous work by Sauter and Deligne-Mostow in dimension two. In this part, we consider certain projective surfaces with two fibrations over the projective line, which induce two sets of Deligne-Mostow data. The correspondences of moduli spaces provide the geometric realization of commensurability relations. Secondly, we obtain commensurability invariants from conformal classes of Hermitian forms and toroidal boundary divisors. This completes the commensurability classification of Deligne-Mostow lattices and also reproves Kappes-Moller and McMullen's results on non-arithmetic Deligne-Mostow lattices.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of the universal centralizers I: the adjoint group case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the rational cohomology of the universal centralizer $J_G$ (also known as the Toda system or BFM space) for a complex (connected) semisimple group $G$ of adjoint form. While $J_G$ exhibits interesting and increasingly complex topology as the rank of $G$ rises, its rational cohomology is surprisingly simple--it coincides with that of a point. In a subsequent work [Jin2], we will extend this analysis to the case of $J_G$ for general semisimple $G$. In particular, we will show that its rational cohomology has pure Hodge structure.</description>

      <title>Cohomological VC-density: Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) density is pivotal across various mathematical fields, including model theory, discrete geometry, and probability theory. In this paper, we introduce a topological generalization of VC-density. Let $Y$ be a topological space and $\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Z}^{(0)},\ldots,\mathcal{Z}^{(q-1)}$ be families of subspaces of $Y$. We define a two parameter family of numbers, $\mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X},\overline{\mathcal{Z}}}$, which we refer to as the degree $p$, order $q$, VC-density of the pair \[ (\mathcal{X},\overline{\mathcal{Z}} = (\mathcal{Z}^{(0)},\ldots,\mathcal{Z}^{(q-1)}). \] The classical notion of VC-density within this topological framework can be recovered by setting $p=0, q=1$. For $p=0, q &gt; 0$, we recover Shelah's notion of higher-order VC-density for $q$-dependent families. Our definition introduces a new notion when $p&gt;0$. Our main result establishes that that in any model of these theories \[ \mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X},\overline{\mathcal{Z}}} \leq (p+q) \dim X. \] This result generalizes known VC-density bounds in these structures, extending them in multiple ways, as well as providing a uniform proof paradigm applicable to all of them. We give examples to show that our bounds are optimal. We present combinatorial applications of our higher-degree VC-density bounds, deriving topological analogs of well-known results such as the existence of $\varepsilon$-nets and the fractional Helly theorem. We show that with certain restrictions, these results extend to our higher-degree topological setting.</description>

      <title>A physical basis for cosmological correlators from cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the analytic structure of FRW wavefunction coefficients, facilitated by the development of efficient algorithms to derive the differential equations they satisfy. Moreover, recent findings indicate that the twisted cohomology of the associated hyperplane arrangement defining FRW integrals overestimates the number of integrals required to define differential equations for the wavefunction coefficient. We demonstrate that the associated dual cohomology is automatically organized in a way that is ideal for understanding and exploiting the cut/residue structure of FRW integrals. Utilizing this understanding, we develop a systematic approach to organize compatible sequential residues, which dictates the physical subspace of FRW integrals for any $n$-site, $\ell$-loop graph. In particular, the physical subspace of tree-level FRW wavefunction coefficients is populated by differential forms associated to cuts/residues that factorize the integrand of the wavefunction coefficient into only flat space amplitudes. After demonstrating the validity of our construction using intersection theory, we develop simple graphical rules for cut tubings that enumerate the space of physical cuts and, consequently, differential forms without any calculation.</description>

      <title>Richardson varieties, projected Richardson varieties and positroid varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a survey article on Richardson varieties and their combinatorics. A Richardson variety is the intersection, inside the flag manifold GL_n/B_+, of a Schubert cell (B_- u B_+)/B_+ and an opposite Schubert cell (B_+ w B_+)/B_+ (or the similar intersection of Schubert varieties). In this survey, we provide an overview of what is known about (1) homogeneous coordinate rings of Richardson varieties, their bases and degenerations (2) parametrizations of Richardson varieties using Bott-Samelson varieties (3) Deodhar's decompositions of the flag manifold and of Richardson varieties within it and (4) total positivity in the flag manifold. We also provide an overview of the combinatorics of positroid varieties, their relations to Richardson varieties, and how they are parametrized using plabic graphs. Most of this survey is an overview of other authors' work over the last forty years, but there are also some minor original results: For example, that coordinate rings of open Richardson varieties are UFD's (Corollary 3.23), that the Deodhar decomposition is not a stratification in Lie type A (Section 4.3) and explicit descriptions of the Deodhar decomposition in terms of ranks of submatrices (Section 4.4).</description>

      <title>On the canonical bundle formula in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f: X \to Z$ be a fibration from a normal projective variety $X$ of dimension $n$ onto a normal curve $Z$ over a perfect field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. Let $(X, B)$ be a dlt pair such that the induced pair on a general fibre is log canonical. Assuming the LMMP and the existence of log resolutions in dimension $\leq n$, we prove that, when $K_X+B$ is $f$-nef, the moduli part is nef up to a birational map $Y \dashrightarrow X$. As a corollary, we prove positivity of the moduli part in the $K$-trivial case, i.e. when $K_X+B \sim_{\mathbb{Q}} f^*L$ for some $\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor $L$ on $Z$. In particular, consider a dlt pair $(X, B)$ of dimension $3$ over a perfect field of characteristic $p&gt;5$ such that the induced pair on a general fibre is log canonical, then the canonical bundle formula holds unconditionally.</description>

Abstract: Given a general polarized $K3$ surface $S\subset \mathbb P^g$ of genus $g\le 14$, we study projections $S\hookrightarrow \mathbb P^g\dashrightarrow \mathbb P^2$ of minimal degree and their variational structure. In particular, we prove that the degree of irrationality of all such surfaces is at most $4$, and that for $g=7,8,9,11$ there are no rational maps $S\dashrightarrow \mathbb P^2$ of degree $3$ induced by the primitive linear system. Our methods combine vector bundle techniques \`a la Lazarsfeld with derived category tools, and also make use of the rich theory of singular curves on $K3$ surfaces.</description>

      <title>A new approach to flatness in categories of sheaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, many authors have embraced the study of certain properties of modules such as projectivity, injectivity and flatness from an alternative point of view. This way, Durgun has introduced absolutely pure domains of modules as a mean to gauge the extent of the flatness of any given module (so not just to determine whether or not the module is flat). In this paper, we develop a new treatment of the goemetric flatness in categories of sheaves which shed more light on some of its various important aspects. Namely, in terms of this new approach, some classical schemes are characterized, some new results are established and also known ones are generalized.</description>

Abstract: For the integral canonical model $\mathscr{S}_{\mathsf{K}^p}$ of a Shimura variety $\mathrm{Sh}_{\mathsf{K}_0\mathsf{K}^p}(\mathbf{G},\mathbf{X})$ of abelian type at hyperspecial level $K_0=\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, we construct a prismatic $F$-gauge model for the `universal' $\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$-local system on $\mathrm{Sh}_{\mathsf{K}_0\mathsf{K}^p}(\mathbf{G},\mathbf{X})$. We use this to obtain new $p$-adic information about these Shimura varieties, notably an abelian-type analogue of the Serre--Tate theorem (realizing an expectation of Drinfeld in the abelian-type case) and a prismatic characterization of these models. To do this, we make several advances in integral $p$-adic Hodge theory, notably the development of an integral analogue of the functor $D_{\mathrm{crys}}$.</description>

      <title>A "Staircase" formula for the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson cycle of a matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a formula for the Poincar\'e dual of the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson (CSM) cycle of a matroid in the Chow ring of the matroid. We derive the formula from the case of matroids realizable over the complex numbers and prove that it satisfies a contraction-deletion formula. From this fact, we prove it holds for all matroids, confirming a conjecture of Fife and Rinc\'on.</description>

      <title>Repeated Lefschetz-like decompositions for flag doubly Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complexes and gamma vectors of flag spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find decompositions of $h$-polynomials of flag doubly Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex that yield a direct connection between gamma vectors of flag spheres and constructions used to build them geometrically. More specifically, they are determined by iterated double suspensions and a "net nonnegative set of edge subdivisions" taking it to the given flag doubly Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex. By a "net nonnegative set of edge subdivision", we mean a collection of edge subdivisions and contractions where there are at least as many edge subdivisions as contractions.
  Returning to the flag spheres, these repeated decompositions involve links over collections of disjoint edges and give an analogue of a Lefschetz map that applies to each step of the decomposition. The constructions used also give a direct interpretation of the Boolean decompositions coming from links and those of the entire simplicial complex. Roughly speaking, the Boolean vs. non-Boolean distinction is used to measure how far a flag sphere is from being the boundary of a cross polytope. An analogue of this statement for flag doubly Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complexes would replace boundaries of cross polytopes by repeated suspensions of links over edges of the given simplicial complex.</description>
