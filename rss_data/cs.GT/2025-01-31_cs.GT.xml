      <title>Dynamic Coalitions in Games on Graphs with Preferences over Temporal Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiplayer games with sequential decision-making, self-interested players form dynamic coalitions to achieve most-preferred temporal goals beyond their individual capabilities. We introduce a novel procedure to synthesize strategies that jointly determine which coalitions should form and the actions coalition members should choose to satisfy their preferences in a subclass of deterministic multiplayer games on graphs. In these games, a leader decides the coalition during each round and the players not in the coalition follow their admissible strategies. Our contributions are threefold. First, we extend the concept of admissibility to games on graphs with preferences and characterize it using maximal sure winning, a concept originally defined for adversarial two-player games with preferences. Second, we define a value function that assigns a vector to each state, identifying which player has a maximal sure winning strategy for certain subset of objectives. Finally, we present a polynomial-time algorithm to synthesize admissible strategies for all players based on this value function and prove their existence in all games within the chosen subclass. We illustrate the benefits of dynamic coalitions over fixed ones in a blocks-world domain. Interestingly, our experiment reveals that aligned preferences do not always encourage cooperation, while conflicting preferences do not always lead to adversarial behavior.</description>

      <title>The Core of Approval-Based Committee Elections with Few Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an approval-based committee election, the goal is to select a committee consisting of $k$ out of $m$ candidates, based on $n$ voters who each approve an arbitrary number of the candidates. The core of such an election consists of all committees that satisfy a certain stability property which implies proportional representation. In particular, committees in the core cannot be "objected to" by a coalition of voters who is underrepresented. The notion of the core was proposed in 2016, but it has remained an open problem whether it is always non-empty. We prove that core committees always exist when $k \le 8$, for any number of candidates $m$ and any number of voters $n$, by showing that the Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) rule due to Thiele [1895] always satisfies the core when $k \le 7$ and always selects at least one committee in the core when $k = 8$. We also develop an artificial rule based on recursive application of PAV, and use it to show that the core is non-empty whenever there are $m \le 15$ candidates, for any committee size $k \le m$ and any number of voters $n$. These results are obtained with the help of computer search using linear programs.</description>

      <title>Structural aspects of the Student Project Allocation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Student Project Allocation problem with lecturer preferences over Students (SPA-S), which involves the assignment of students to projects based on student preferences over projects, lecturer preferences over students, and capacity constraints on both projects and lecturers. The goal is to find a stable matching that ensures no student and lecturer can mutually benefit by deviating from a given assignment to form an alternative arrangement involving some project. We explore the structural properties of SPA-S and characterise the set of stable matchings for an arbitrary SPA-S instance. We prove that, similar to the classical Stable Marriage problem (SM) and the Hospital Residents problem (HR), the set of all stable matchings in SPA-S forms a distributive lattice. In this lattice, the student-optimal and lecturer-optimal stable matchings represent the minimum and maximum elements, respectively. Finally, we introduce meta-rotations in the SPA-S setting using illustrations, demonstrating how they capture the relationships between stable matchings. These novel structural insights paves the way for efficient algorithms that address several open problems related to stable matchings in SPA-S.</description>

      <title>Stable Marriage: Loyalty vs. Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stable matching problem (e.g. between doctors and hospitals) in a one-to-one matching setting, where preferences are drawn uniformly at random. It is known that when doctors propose and the number of doctors equals the number of hospitals, then the expected rank of doctors for their match is $\Theta(\log n)$, while the expected rank of the hospitals for their match is $\Theta(n/\log n)$, where $n$ is the size of each side of the market. However, when adding even a single doctor, [Ashlagi, Kanoria and Leshno, 2017] show that the tables have turned: doctors have expected rank of $\Theta(n/\log n)$ while hospitals have expected rank of $\Theta(\log n)$. That is, (slight) competition has a much more dramatically harmful effect than the benefit of being on the proposing side. Motivated by settings where agents inflate their value for an item if it is already allocated to them (termed endowment effect), we study the case where hospitals exhibit ``loyalty".
  We model loyalty as a parameter $k$, where a hospital currently matched to their $\ell$th most preferred doctor accepts proposals from their $\ell-k-1$th most preferred doctors. Hospital loyalty should help doctors mitigate the harmful effect of competition, as many more outcomes are now stable. However, we show that the effect of competition is so dramatic that, even in settings with extremely high loyalty, in unbalanced markets, the expected rank of doctors already becomes $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{n})$ for loyalty $k=n-\sqrt{n}\log n=n(1-o(1))$.</description>

      <title>Conversation Games and a Strategic View of the Turing Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although many game-theoretic models replicate real interactions that often rely on natural language, explicit study of games where language is central to strategic interaction remains limited. This paper introduces the \emph{conversation game}, a multi-stage, extensive-form game based on linguistic strategic interaction. We focus on a subset of the games, called verdict games. In a verdict game, two players alternate to contribute to a conversation, which is evaluated at each stage by a non-strategic judge who may render a conclusive binary verdict, or a decision to continue the dialogue. The game ends once a limit is reached or a verdict is given. We show many familiar processes, such as interrogation or a court process fall under this category. We also, show that the Turing test is an instance of verdict game, and discuss the significance of a strategic view of the Turing test in the age of advanced AI deception. We show the practical relevance of the proposed concepts by simulation experiments, and show that a strategic agent outperforms a naive agent by a high margin.</description>

      <title>TSO Games -- On the decidability of safety games under the total store order semantics (extended LMCS version with appendix)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02862v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an extension of the classical Total Store Order (TSO) semantics by expanding it to turn-based 2-player safety games. During her turn, a player can select any of the communicating processes and perform its next transition. We consider different formulations of the safety game problem depending on whether one player or both of them transfer messages from the process buffers to the shared memory. We give the complete decidability picture for all the possible alternatives.</description>

      <title>Multi-Player Resource-Sharing Games with Fair Reward Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a multi-player resource-sharing game with a fair reward allocation model. Multiple players choose from a collection of resources. Each resource brings a random reward equally divided among the players who choose it. We consider two settings. The first setting is a one-slot game where the mean rewards of the resources are known to all the players, and the objective of player 1 is to maximize their worst-case expected utility. Certain special cases of this setting have explicit solutions. These cases provide interesting yet non-intuitive insights into the problem. The second setting is an online setting, where the game is played over a finite time horizon, where the mean rewards are unknown to the first player. Instead, the first player receives, as feedback, the rewards of the resources they chose after the action. We develop a novel Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm that minimizes the worst-case regret of the first player using the feedback received.</description>

      <title>Bounded Rationality Equilibrium Learning in Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) tractably model behavior in large agent populations. The literature on learning MFG equilibria typically focuses on finding Nash equilibria (NE), which assume perfectly rational agents and are hence implausible in many realistic situations. To overcome these limitations, we incorporate bounded rationality into MFGs by leveraging the well-known concept of quantal response equilibria (QRE). Two novel types of MFG QRE enable the modeling of large agent populations where individuals only noisily estimate the true objective. We also introduce a second source of bounded rationality to MFGs by restricting agents' planning horizon. The resulting novel receding horizon (RH) MFGs are combined with QRE and existing approaches to model different aspects of bounded rationality in MFGs. We formally define MFG QRE and RH MFGs and compare them to existing equilibrium concepts such as entropy-regularized NE. Subsequently, we design generalized fixed point iteration and fictitious play algorithms to learn QRE and RH equilibria. After a theoretical analysis, we give different examples to evaluate the capabilities of our learning algorithms and outline practical differences between the equilibrium concepts.</description>

      <title>Adapting Beyond the Depth Limit: Counter Strategies in Large Imperfect Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of adapting to a known sub-rational opponent during online play while remaining robust to rational opponents. We focus on large imperfect-information (zero-sum) games, which makes it impossible to inspect the whole game tree at once and necessitates the use of depth-limited search. However, all existing methods assume rational play beyond the depth-limit, which only allows them to adapt a very limited portion of the opponent's behaviour. We propose an algorithm Adapting Beyond Depth-limit (ABD) that uses a strategy-portfolio approach - which we refer to as matrix-valued states - for depth-limited search. This allows the algorithm to fully utilise all information about the opponent model, making it the first robust-adaptation method to be able to do so in large imperfect-information games. As an additional benefit, the use of matrix-valued states makes the algorithm simpler than traditional methods based on optimal value functions. Our experimental results in poker and battleship show that ABD yields more than a twofold increase in utility when facing opponents who make mistakes beyond the depth limit and also delivers significant improvements in utility and safety against randomly generated opponents.</description>

      <title>Interference Among First-Price Pacing Equilibria: A Bias and Variance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online A/B testing is widely used in the internet industry to inform decisions on new feature roll-outs. For online marketplaces (such as advertising markets), standard approaches to A/B testing may lead to biased results when buyers operate under a budget constraint, as budget consumption in one arm of the experiment impacts performance of the other arm. To counteract this interference, one can use a budget-split design where the budget constraint operates on a per-arm basis and each arm receives an equal fraction of the budget, leading to ``budget-controlled A/B testing.'' Despite clear advantages of budget-controlled A/B testing, performance degrades when budget are split too small, limiting the overall throughput of such systems. In this paper, we propose a parallel budget-controlled A/B testing design where we use market segmentation to identify submarkets in the larger market, and we run parallel experiments on each submarket.
  Our contributions are as follows: First, we introduce and demonstrate the effectiveness of the parallel budget-controlled A/B test design with submarkets in a large online marketplace environment. Second, we formally define market interference in first-price auction markets using the first price pacing equilibrium (FPPE) framework. Third, we propose a debiased surrogate that eliminates the first-order bias of FPPE, drawing upon the principles of sensitivity analysis in mathematical programs. Fourth, we derive a plug-in estimator for the surrogate and establish its asymptotic normality. Fifth, we provide an estimation procedure for submarket parallel budget-controlled A/B tests. Finally, we present numerical examples on semi-synthetic data, confirming that the debiasing technique achieves the desired coverage properties.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Assisted Space-Air-Ground Integrated Multi-Access Edge Computing for Low-Altitude Economy: An Online Decentralized Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIMEC) networks opens a significant opportunity for the rapidly growing low altitude economy (LAE), facilitating the development of various applications by offering efficient communication and computing services. However, the heterogeneous nature of SAGIMEC networks, coupled with the stringent computational and communication requirements of diverse applications in the LAE, introduces considerable challenges in integrating SAGIMEC into the LAE. In this work, we first present a digital twin-assisted SAGIMEC paradigm for LAE, where digital twin enables reliable network monitoring and management, while SAGIMEC provides efficient computing offloading services for Internet of Things sensor devices (ISDs). Then, a joint satellite selection, computation offloading, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation and UAV trajectory control optimization problem (JSC4OP) is formulated to maximize the quality of service (QoS) of ISDs. Given the complexity of JSC4OP, we propose an online decentralized optimization approach (ODOA) to address the problem. Specifically, JSC4OP is first transformed into a real-time decision-making optimization problem (RDOP) by leveraging Lyapunov optimization. Then, to solve the RDOP, we introduce an online learning-based latency prediction method to predict the uncertain system environment and a game theoretic decision-making method to make real-time decisions. Finally, theoretical analysis confirms the effectiveness of the ODOA, while the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ODOA outperforms other alternative approaches in terms of overall system performance.</description>

      <title>From Natural Language to Extensive-Form Game Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for translating game descriptions in natural language into extensive-form representations in game theory, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning. Given the varying levels of strategic complexity in games, such as perfect versus imperfect information, directly applying in-context learning would be insufficient. To address this, we introduce a two-stage framework with specialized modules to enhance in-context learning, enabling it to divide and conquer the problem effectively. In the first stage, we tackle the challenge of imperfect information by developing a module that identifies information sets along and the corresponding partial tree structure. With this information, the second stage leverages in-context learning alongside a self-debugging module to produce a complete extensive-form game tree represented using pygambit, the Python API of a recognized game-theoretic analysis tool called Gambit. Using this python representation enables the automation of tasks such as computing Nash equilibria directly from natural language descriptions. We evaluate the performance of the full framework, as well as its individual components, using various LLMs on games with different levels of strategic complexity. Our experimental results show that the framework significantly outperforms baseline models in generating accurate extensive-form games, with each module playing a critical role in its success.</description>
