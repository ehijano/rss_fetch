      <title>Structure of odd-A Ag isotopes studied via algebraic approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of the odd-$A$ silver isotopes $^{103-115}$Ag is discussed within the frame of the Interacting boson-fermion model (IBFM). An overview of their key properties is presented, with particular attention paid to the $"$J-1 anomaly$"$, represented by an abnormal ordering of the lowest 7/2$^{+}$ and 9/2$^{+}$ states. By examining previously published data and newly performed calculations, it is demonstrated that the experimentally known level schemes and electromagnetic properties of $^{103-115}$Ag can be reproduced well within IBFM-1 by using a consistent set of model parameters. The contribution of different single-particle orbitals to the structure of the lowest-lying excited nuclear states in $^{103-115}$Ag is discussed. Given that the $J$-1 anomaly brings down the 7/2$^{+}$ level from the $j^{-3}$ multiplet to energies which can be thermally populated in hot stellar environments, the importance of low-lying excited states in odd-$A$ silver isotopes for astrophysical processes is outlined.</description>

      <title>Resonant Structures in $p{}^7\mathrm{Be}$ Scattering and Their Connection to the Astrophysical $S$-Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Variable Phase Approach (VPA) to obtain the scattering phase shifts \( \delta(E, r) \), amplitude function \( A(r) \), and radial wavefunction \( u(r) \) for various channels involved in the astrophysical reaction \( {}^7\mathrm{Be}(p,\gamma)^8\mathrm{B} \). Using the extracted phase shifts, we compute the total and partial cross sections. It is observed that the peaks in the partial cross section correspond to resonant states in the compound nucleus, which also manifest as enhancements in the astrophysical S-factor. These resonances significantly increase the reaction probability at certain energies, particularly in the low-energy regime relevant to stellar nucleosynthesis. The VPA thus serves as a reliable and efficient method for calculating scattering phase shifts and, in turn, extracting the resonance energies of different partial waves. These resonance energies can provide valuable insight into the energy region where the astrophysical \textit{S}-factor is likely to peak.</description>

      <title>Shell effects in nuclear charge radii based on Skyrme density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified description of the charge radii throughout the entire nuclide chart plays an essential role for our understanding of nuclear structure and fundamental nuclear interactions. In this work, the influence of new term, which catches the spirit of neutron and proton pairs condensation around Fermi surface, on the charge radii has been investigated based on the Skyrme density functionals with the effective forces SLy5 and SkM$^{*}$. The differential charge radii of even-even Ca, Ni, Sn, and Pb isotopes are employed to evaluate the validity of this theoretical model. Meanwhile, the results obtained by the relativistic density functional with the effective Lagrangian NL3 are also shown for the quantitative comparison. The calculated results suggest that the modified model can improve the trend of changes of the differential charge radii along Ca, Ni, Sn, and Pb isotopic chains, especially the shell closure effect at the neutron numbers $N=28$, 82 and 126. The shell quenching phenomena of charge radii can also be predicted at the neutron number $N=50$ along the corresponding Ni and Sn isotopes, respectively. The inverted parabolic-like shapes between the two fully filled shells can also be observed, but the amplitude is gradually weakened from Ca to Pb isotopic chains. Combining the existing literatures, it suggests that the discontinuous behavior in nuclear charge radii can be described well by considering the influence of neutron Cooper pairs condensation around Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Framework for phase transitions between the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristics of the hadron-to-quark first-order phase transition differ depending on whether charge neutrality is locally or globally fulfilled. In $\beta$-equilibrated matter, these two possibilities correspond to the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions. Recently, we presented a new framework in which a continuously-varying parameter allows one to describe a first-order phase transition in intermediate scenarios to the two extremes of fully local and fully global charge neutrality. In this work, we extend the previous framework to finite temperatures and out-of-$\beta$ equilibrium conditions, making it available for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. We investigate its impact on key thermodynamic quantities across a range of baryon densities, temperatures, and electron fractions. We find that when matter is not in $\beta$-equilibrium, the pressure in the mixed phase is not constant even for the case of fully-local charge neutrality. Moreover, we compute the thermal index using three different approaches, demonstrating that the finite-temperature extension of an equation of state using a constant thermal index can be ill-defined when applied to the mixed phase.</description>

      <title>The nucleardatapy toolkit for simple access to experimental nuclear data, astrophysical observations, and theoretical predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic comparisons across theoretical predictions for the properties of dense matter, nuclear physics data, and astrophysical observations (also called meta-analyses) are performed. Existing predictions for symmetric nuclear and neutron matter properties are considered, and they are shown in this paper as an illustration of the present knowledge. Asymmetric matter is constructed assuming the isospin asymmetry quadratic approximation. It is employed to predict the pressure at twice saturation energy-density based only on nuclear-physics constraints, and we find it compatible with the one from the gravitational-wave community. To make our meta-analysis transparent, updated in the future, and to publicly share our results, the Python toolkit nucleardatapy is described and released here. Hence, this paper accompanies nucleardatapy, which simplifies access to nuclear-physics data, including theoretical calculations, experimental measurements, and astrophysical observations. This Python toolkit is designed to easily provide data for: i) predictions for uniform matter (from microscopic or phenomenological approaches); ii) correlation among nuclear properties induced by experimental and theoretical constraints; iii) measurements for finite nuclei (nuclear chart, charge radii, neutron skins or nuclear incompressibilities, etc.) and hypernuclei (single particle energies); and iv) astrophysical observations. This toolkit provides data in a unified format for easy comparison and provides new meta-analysis tools. It will be continuously developed, and we expect contributions from the community in our endeavor.</description>

      <title>Comparison between Causal and Acausal Diffusion: a Schwinger-Keldysh Effective Field Theory Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Fick's time-honored theory of diffusion, the system responds instantaneously to external perturbations, resulting in acausal behavior. Maxwell-Cattaneo theory addresses this issue by introducing a relaxation time, rendering the diffusion process causal. We focus on systems where this relaxation time is comparable to the diffusion time and significantly larger than the relaxation times of all other non-conserved operators. In such systems, late-time diffusion is influenced by this relaxation process, leading to a theory of quasi-diffusion. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh Effective Field Theory (SK-EFT) framework, we compare the theories of diffusion and quasi-diffusion by analyzing the real-time dynamics of correlation functions both in linear response and at one-loop order. In particular, we show that the one-loop corrections in the causal (quasi-diffusion) theory, in both the underdamped and the overdamped cases, are governed by two universal functions. In the overdamped case, the behavior mirrors that of the acausal (diffusion) theory, which has recently been applied for precision tests of SK-EFT in diffusive systems. We suggest that our results in the underdamped limit can also be used for precision tests in quasi-diffusive systems.</description>

      <title>Reflection positivity in Euclidean formulations of relativistic quantum mechanics of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the general structure of reflection positive Euclidean covariant distributions that can be used to construct Euclidean representations of relativistic quantum mechanical models of systems of a finite number of degrees of freedom. Because quantum systems of a finite number of degrees of freedom are not local, reflection positivity is not as restrictive as it is in a local field theory. The motivation for the Euclidean approach is that it is straightforward to construct exactly Poincar\'e invariant quantum models of finite number of degrees of freedom systems that satisfy cluster properties and a spectral condition. In addition the quantum mechanical inner product can be computed without requiring an analytic continuation. Whether these distributions can be generated by a dynamical principle remains to be determined, but understanding the general structure of the Euclidean covariant distributions is an important first step.</description>

      <title>DeepQuark: deep-neural-network approach to multiquark bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we implement the deep-neural-network-based variational Monte Carlo approach for the multiquark bound states, whose complexity surpasses that of electron or nucleon systems due to strong SU(3) color interactions. We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound $\bar D^*\Xi_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\frac{5}{2}$ and its bottom partner $P_{bb\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ in the D-wave $J/\psi \Lambda_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers in conventional methods. It also serves as a powerful framework for exploring confining mechanism beyond two-body interactions in multiquark states, which may offer valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD and general many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking nuclear matrix elements of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay with high-energy nuclear collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing uncertainties in the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) remains a critical challenge in designing and interpreting experiments aimed at discovering neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. Here, we identify a class of observables, distinct from those employed in low-energy nuclear structure applications, that are strongly correlated with the NMEs: momentum correlations among hadrons produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. Focusing on the $^{150}$Nd$\rightarrow$$^{150}$Sm transition, we combine a Bayesian analysis of the structure of $^{150}$Nd with simulations of high-energy $^{150}$Nd+$^{150}$Nd collisions. We reveal prominent correlations between the NMEs and features of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in these processes, such as spatial gradients and anisotropies, which are accessible via collective flow measurements. Our findings demonstrate collider experiments involving $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay candidates as a platform for benchmarking theoretical predictions of the NMEs.</description>

      <title>Projective Imaging of High-Energy Nuclei via Coherent Exclusive Vector Meson Production in Electron-Nucleus Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15596v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the major goals of modern nuclear experiments is to study the distributions of gluons inside nuclei at high energy. A key measurement is the coherent exclusive vector meson (VM) production in diffractive electron-nucleus collisions, where the gluon spatial distribution inside the nucleus can be obtained through a Fourier transform of the squared nuclear momentum transfer ($|t|$) distribution. This research aims to overcome the two main obstacles of the $|t|$ measurement: limited precision in measuring $|t|$ arising from the momentum resolution of the outgoing electron and the overwhelming incoherent background. We demonstrate that by measuring the projected $|t|$ distribution along the direction perpendicular to the electron scattering plane, the effect of the outgoing electron's momentum resolution can be effectively mitigated, and the diffractive pattern is largely restored. Furthermore, we propose to measure the angular distribution of the VM's decay daughters to statistically remove the incoherent background.</description>

      <title>Estimating nuclear equation of state parameters away from saturation density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the density variation of the correlation coefficient of the key parameters of the nuclear equation of state (EoS) with the bulk and crustal properties of neutron stars. The analysis was performed using two diverse sets of nuclear effective interaction theories based on nonrelativistic Skyrme-Hartree Fock model and relativistic mean field model. We find that the commonly studied EoS parameters, namely the isoscalar incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter $K(\rho)$ and the isovector slope of symmetry energy $L(\rho)$, reveal consistently maximum correlation with the radius, tidal deformability, and moment of inertia all around twice the saturation density. We find even more tighter and robust correlations beyond the saturation density for constructed parameter $\eta = [KL^2]^{1/3}$ allowing the possibility to impose stringent constraints on high-density $K(\rho)$ and $L(\rho)$. Extensive correlation analysis of the EoS parameters with the radius and tidal deformability bounds from the gravitational wave events and recent pulsar observations allow us to provide reliable constraints on the central values of $K(\rho_0) \approx 240$ MeV and $L(\rho_0) \approx 48$ MeV at saturation density and $K(1.6\rho_0) \approx 332^{+88}_{-50}$ MeV and $L(1.6\rho_0) \approx 122^{+26}_{-18}$ MeV at 1.6 times the saturation density. The crust-core transition density and the crustal fraction of moment of inertia are shown to correlate moderately with $L(\rho)$ and $\eta(\rho)$ near the subsaturation density.</description>

      <title>Scaling and universality in strange quark stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive scaling laws that connect certain macroscopic observables of strange quark stars with key microscopic properties of self-bound quark matter, such as the energy per baryon at zero pressure and the strength of repulsive interactions. We also identify universal relations linking global properties of strange quark stars - specifically, their moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and both gravitational and baryonic compactness. Remarkably, these relations hold for two substantially different microscopic models - the quark-mass density-dependent model with excluded-volume corrections and the vector MIT bag model - underscoring their robust, model-independent nature. We demonstrate that the universal relations for strange quark stars differ significantly from those previously established for neutron stars composed of hadronic matter, thus enabling discrimination between the two types of objects without requiring detailed knowledge of their equations of state. Moreover, observational constraints on the maximum mass of compact stars could place bounds on both the depth of quark-matter self-binding and the strength of quark repulsive interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum molecular dynamics model based on relativistic mean field theory for light nucleus fragmentation in hadron therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates the accuracy of nuclear fragmentation simulations using a quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) model based on relativistic mean field (RMF) theory for an energy range of 50-400 MeV/u, relevant to hadron therapy. A total of 16 parameter sets within the RMF framework are assessed based on their ability to reproduce ground-state properties such as the mean squared radius and binding energy, as obtained in QMD simulations. Among these, the NS2 parameter set is identified as the most suitable for describing stable nuclei over a wide mass range, with the use of an adaptive Gaussian wave packet width. Fragmentation cross sections of carbon ion projectiles on light nuclei targets (H, C, O, Al, Ti, and Cu) are simulated at incident energies of 50, 95, 290, and 400 MeV/u and compared with experimental data. The results indicate that the RQMD.RMF model provides superior reproductions for fragmentation at lower energies (50 and 95 MeV/u) compared to the Light Ion QMD (LIQMD) model implemented in Geant4 version 11.2. At higher energies (290 and 400 MeV/u), the RQMD.RMF model performs comparably to the LIQMD. This study demonstrates that the RQMD.RMF model provides a reliable framework for analyzing nuclear fragmentation and holds potential for applications in the planning and quality assurance of hadron therapy.</description>

Abstract: We consider bosons interacting through a narrow $s$-wave resonance. Such a resonance is characterized by an infinite scattering length and a large and negative effective range $r_0$. We argue that any number $N\ge3$ of bosons can form a self-bound cluster with the binding energy per particle increasing as $N^2$ for $1\ll N\ll (-r_0/a_\text{bg})^{1/2}$, where $a_\text{bg}$ is the background scattering length (between atoms and molecules). In the opposite limit $N\gg (-r_0/a_\text{bg})^{1/2}$, bosons form droplets with binding energy per particle saturating to a constant value independent of the particle number. The stability of clusters and droplets when the interaction is detuned from the resonance is also studied.</description>

      <title>Pole analysis for the $D^{*}\bar K$-$D\bar{K^*}$ coupled-channel system</title>

Abstract: By solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, possible hadronic molecules in the $D^*\bar K$-$D\bar K^*$ coupled-channel system are investigated with the one-meson exchange potentials, where both vector and pseudoscalar mesons are considered as exchange particles. We find an S-wave virtual state with mass $M=2487$ MeV, and a resonance with $M=2759$ and width $\Gamma=18$ MeV. In the $D^* \bar K$ invariant mass distribution, the virtual state appears as a cusp at the $D^*\bar K$ threshold, while the resonance potentially manifests as a dip. In particular, we take into account the $D\bar K \pi$ three-body dynamics due to the on-shell pion exchange and the finite decay width for $\bar K^*$.</description>

      <title>Towards a Quantum Information Theory of Hadronization: Dihadron Fragmentation and Neutral Polarization in Heavy Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pioneer the application of quantum information theory to experimentally distinguish between classes of hadronization models. We adapt the CHSH inequality to the fragmentation of a single parton to hadron pairs, a violation of which would rule out classical dynamics of hadronization altogether. Furthermore, we apply and extend the theory of quantum contextuality and local quantum systems to the neutral polarization of a single spin-1 hadronic system, namely the light constituents of excited Sigma baryons $\Sigma^{*}_{c,b}$ formed in the fragmentation of heavy quarks.</description>
