      <title>Complete ergodicity in one-dimensional reversible cellar automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exactly ergodicity in boundary-driven semi-infinite cellular automata (CA) are investigated. We establish all the ergodic rules in CA with 3, 4, and 5 states. We analytically prove the ergodicity for 12 rules in 3-state CA and 118320 rules in 5-state CA with any ergodic and periodic boundary condition, and numerically confirm all the other rules non-ergodic with some boundary condition. We classify ergodic rules into several patterns, which exhibit a variety of ergodic structure.</description>

      <title>The probabilistic world II : Quantum mechanics from classical statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work discusses simple examples how quantum systems are obtained as subsystems of classical statistical systems. For a single qubit with arbitrary Hamiltonian and for the quantum particle in a harmonic potential we provide explicitly all steps how these quantum systems follow from an overall ''classical" probability distribution for events at all times. This overall probability distribution is the analogue of Feynman's functional integral for quantum mechanics or for the functional integral defining a quantum field theory. In our case the action and associated weight factor are real, however, defining a classical probabilistic system. Nevertheless, a unitary time-evolution of wave functions can be realized for suitable systems, in particular probabilistic automata. Based on these insights we discuss novel aspects for correlated computing not requiring the extreme isolation of quantum computers. A simple neuromorphic computer based on neurons in an active or quiet state within a probabilistic environment can learn the unitary transformations of an entangled two-qubit system. Our explicit constructions constitute a proof that no-go theorems for the embedding of quantum mechanics in classical statistics are circumvented. We show in detail how subsystems of classical statistical systems can explain various ``quantum mysteries". Conceptually our approach is a straightforward derivation starting from an overall probability distribution without invoking non-locality, acausality, contextuality, many worlds or other additional concepts. All quantum laws follow directly from the standard properties of classical probabilities.</description>
