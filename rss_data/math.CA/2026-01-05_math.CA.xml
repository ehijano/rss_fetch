      <title>Symbolic Integration of Differential Forms: From Abel to Zeilberger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on symbolic integration of differential forms, with a particular emphasis on historical and modern developments, from Abel's addition theorems for Abelian integrals to Zeilberger's creative telescoping for parameterized integrals. It explores closed rational $p$-forms and provides algorithmic approaches for their integration, extending classical results like Hermite reduction and Liouville's theorem. The integration of closed differential forms with parameters is further examined through telescopers, offering a unified framework for handling both algebraic and transcendental cases.</description>

      <title>The Lagrangian and symplectic structures of the Kuramoto oscillator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being under intense scrutiny for 50 years, the Kuramoto oscillator model has remained a quintessential representative of non-equilibrium phase transitions. One of the reasons for its enduring relevance is the apparent lack of an optimization formulation, due to the fact that (superficially), the equations of motion seem to not be compatible with a Lagrangian structure. We show that, as a mean-field classical (twisted) spin model on $S^2$, the Kuramoto model can be described variationaly. Based on this result perturbation analysis around (unstable) Kuramoto equilibria are shown to be equivalent to low-energy fluctuations of mean-field Heisenberg spin models.</description>

      <title>Mean Assouad dimension and spectrum, with applications to infinite dimensional fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the mean Assouad dimension of a dynamical system, motivated by the Assouad dimension in fractal geometry. Using dimension interpolation, we further define the mean Assouad spectrum. This provides a new family of bi-Lipschitz invariants of dynamical systems. We study its basic properties and calculate it for several classes of dynamical systems. As an application, we determine explicit formulae for the mean Assouad dimension and spectrum of infinite-dimensional Bedford--McMullen carpet systems, contributing to the program of studying infinite dimensional fractals, initiated recently by Tsukamoto.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear determination and phase retrieval under unimodular constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonlinear determination problems in Hilbert spaces in which inner products are observed up to prescribed rotations in the complex plane. Given a Hilbert space $H$ and a subset $\Theta$ of the unit circle $\mathbb{T}$, we say that a system $\mathbf{G}\subseteq H$ does $\Theta$-phase retrieval ($\Theta$-PR) if for all $f,h\in H$ the condition that for every $g\in\mathbf{G}$ there exists $\theta_g\in\Theta$ with $\langle f,g\rangle=\theta_g\langle h,g\rangle$ forces $f=\theta h$ for some $\theta\in\Theta$. This framework unifies classical phase retrieval ($\Theta=\mathbb{T}$) and sign retrieval ($\Theta=\{1,-1\}$). For every countable $\Theta$ we give a complete characterization of $\Theta$-PR in terms of covers of $\mathbf{G}$ and geometric relations among vectors in the corresponding orthogonal complements, extending the complement-property characterization of Cahill, Casazza, and Daubechies. For cyclic phase sets we show that $\Theta$-PR is equivalent to the existence of specific second-order recurrence relations. We apply this to obtain a sharp lattice density criterion for $\Theta$-PR of exponential systems. For uncountable $\Theta$ we obtain a topological dichotomy in the Fourier determination setting, showing that $\Theta$-PR is characterized in terms of connectedness of $\Theta$. We further develop a M\"obius-invariant framework, proving that $\Theta$-PR is preserved under circle automorphisms and is governed by projective invariants such as the cross ratio. Finally, in $\mathbb{C}^d$ we determine sharp impossibility thresholds and prove that for countable $\Theta$ the property is generic once one passes the failure regime, yielding the minimal number of vectors required for $\Theta$-PR.</description>

      <title>On the Riemann-Hilbert problem for hyperplane arrangements with a good line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00544v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Riemann-Hilbert problem on the complements of hyperplane arrangements. This problem asks whether a given local system on the complement can be realized as the solution sheaf of a logarithmic Pfaffian system with constant coefficients. In this paper, we generalize Katz's middle convolution as a functor for local systems on hyperplane complements and show that it preserves the solvability of this problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z}^n)-$estimates for long $r$-variational seminorm of two families of averages: discrete Birch-Magyar averages, for $r&gt;max\{p,p'\}$ with $p&gt;\frac{2c_{\mathfrak{R}}-2}{2c_{\mathfrak{R}}-3}$ and discrete Hardy-Littlewood type averages over certain algebraic varieties, for $r&gt;max\{p,p'\}$ with $p&gt;1$. Further, we discuss an application of these results in ergodic theory.</description>

      <title>The Beurling and Malliavin Theorem in Several Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12397v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to a new multidimensional generalization of the Beurling and Malliavin Theorem, which is a classical result in the Uncertainty Principle in Fourier Analysis. In more detail, we establish by an elegant but simple new method a sufficient condition for a radial function to be a Beurling and Malliavin majorant in several dimensions (this means that the function in question can be minorized by the modulus of a square integrable function which is not zero identically and which has the support of the Fourier transform included in an arbitrary small ball). As a corollary of the radial case, we also get a new sharp sufficient condition in the nonradial case. The latter result provides an answer to a question posed by L. H\"ormander. Our proof is different in the cases of odd and even dimensions. In the even dimensional case we make use of one classical formula from the theory of Bessel functions due to N. Ya. Sonin.</description>

      <title>Characterization of classical orthogonal polynomials in two variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a family of polynomials in two variables, orthogonal with respect to a weight function, we prove under some conditions, equivalence between: the matrix Pearson equation of the weight, the second order linear partial differential equation, the orthogonality of the gradients, the matrix Rodrigues formula involving tensor product of matrices, and the so-called first structure relation. We then introduce a notion of classical orthogonal polynomials in two variables and relate the corresponding theory for weight functions and moment functionals. Finally, we present a nontrivial example that illustrates and delineates our contribution to the field.</description>

      <title>On resonant energy sets for Hamiltonian systems with reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two uncoupled oscillators, horizontal and vertical, residing in rectilinear polygons (with only vertical and horizontal sides) and impacting elastically from their boundary. The main purpose of the article is to analyze the occurrence of resonance in such systems, depending on the shape of the analytical potentials that determine the oscillators. We define resonant energy levels; roughly speaking, these are levels for which the resonance phenomenon occurs more often than rarely. We focus on unimodal analytic potentials with the minimum at zero. The most important result of the work describes the size of the set of resonance levels in the form of the following trichotomy: it is mostly empty or is one-element or is large, i.e. non-empty and open. In this latter case, we show that an abundance of resonant orbits occurs only when the potentials are of a special type; we denote this family by $\mathcal{SP}$. This result can be regarded as a distant analogue of the classical Bertrand's theorem (1873), which characterizes centrally symmetric potentials in the presence of an abundance of periodic orbits.</description>
