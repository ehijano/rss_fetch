      <title>Light in Slices: How to Enable Precise Laser Processing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.</description>

      <title>Universal Numerical Simulation Model for Laser Material Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High power lasers are used for a variety of manufacturing processes on time and length scales that cover many orders of magnitude and on different materials. The variety of processes achievable through laser-material interaction results from numerous coupled, nonlinear physical phenomena. Simulation models can be used to gain process understanding, explain experimentally observed phenomena, and optimize or design processes. However, the inherent complexity and diversity of the phenomena make modeling a challenging task.
  Within this chapter, a universal model is presented that accurately simulates a broad spectrum of processes, including welding, additive manufacturing, cutting, ablation, drilling, and surface structuring, encompassing both continuous wave and ultrashort pulsed lasers and their interaction with various materials. Starting from the fundamental principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, a continuum mechanical framework is introduced that captures the main multiphysical effects. A numerical solution using the Finite Volume Method is presented and validated against benchmark problems where detailed experimental data are available. Macroscopic examples with continuous wave lasers include keyhole drilling and collapse under stationary illumination as well as melt pool dynamics and pore formation in copper welding. At the microscopic level, copper ablation with femtosecond pulses is simulated.
  Finally, a set of real-world applications is shown, where the model helps to explain and optimize industrial phenomena and defects. Examples include deep penetration welding of steel with dynamic beam shaping, multilayer additive manufacturing via powder bed fusion, and ultrashort pulsed drilling of micro vias in dielectric materials.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the curse of dimensionality: Enabling multi-layer photon transport with recurrent neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are commonly used to calculate photon reflectance, absorptance, and transmittance of multi-layer scattering and absorbing media, but they can quickly become prohibitively expensive as the number of layers increases. In this study, we show that although a plain neural network suffers from the curse of dimensionality and fails to yield acceptable predictions of multilayer media, we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on the same Monte Carlo simulation dataset to achieve accurate prediction with great acceleration. Our RNN architecture solves the curse of dimensionality by keeping the number of inputs into the network constant for any number of layers. We demonstrate the general applicability with three diverse case studies of multilayer architectures: tissue, radiative cooling paint, and atmospheric clouds, achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude acceleration over Monte Carlo simulations while providing up to one order of magnitude less error than a plain neural network. This recurrent neural network approach enables affordable photon multi-layer modeling, optimization, and high throughput screening for broad applications across dosimetry, atmospheric studies, and spectrally selective radiative coatings.</description>

      <title>Comparison of wave-mixing processes in rarefied gas and QED vacuum using numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conditions required to distinguish laser-induced nonlinear quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects in vacuum from competing signals due to interactions of laser pulses with ionized residual gas. The latter is inevitably present in vacuum chambers where experiments are performed because the vacuum is never perfect and there is always some residual pressure. The rarefied gas contribution is modeled statistically using the 1D-1V Vlasov-Maxwell system, while vacuum nonlinearities are described within the weak-field expansion of the Heisenberg-Euler effective action. In both cases, photon spectra from wave-mixing processes are evaluated by solving numerically the resulting partial differential equations using a semi-Lagrangian scheme. We consider short pulses in co- and counter-propagating configurations, allowing us to identify the laser intensities and vacuum pressures for which the vacuum signal dominates. These results provide quantitative guidance for future all-optical experiments aiming to detect light-by-light scattering in vacuum.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale integration of single nanodiamonds via electrostatic-trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanodiamonds (NDs) are key materials for building nanoscale quantum sensing, imaging and communication devices. Scalable configuration of single NDs on heterogeneous platforms, forming photonic quantum source arrays, will be an essential solution towards realizing next-generation practical and industrial quantum devices. However, NDs are challenging to manipulate because their size, shape and surface chemistry vary substantially. Here, we show a simple method based on electrostatic-trapping to rapidly and reliably pattern single ND arrays on arbitrary substrates at scale. Our method, which uses carefully engineered microscale hole templates and electrostatic force, captures single NDs across 8-inch wafers with 82.5% yields within 5 min. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies show the number of deposited NDs primarily depends on the diameter of the hole trap. The method is compatible with mature CMOS technologies, enabling the mass production of scalable and integrable quantum devices. This advancement is expected to accelerate the commercialization and industrial adoption of ND-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Topological Combs for Robust High-Dimensional Information Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sculpting light across its independent degrees of freedom-from orbital angular momentum to the discrete wavelengths of optical frequency combs-has unlocked vast communication bandwidth by enabling massively parallel information channels. However, the Shannon-Hartley theorem sets a hard limit by tying channel capacity to the trade-off between SNR and rate, a central challenge in communication. Inspired by lock-in amplification in electronics, we encode data on THz optical burst carriers so the signal resides beyond the conventional noise band, yielding exceptional robustness. By leveraging a programmable all-degree-of-freedom (All-DoF) modulator, we generate a spatiotemporal topological comb (ST-Comb) that structures light into a vast, highentropy state space for high-dimensional information encoding. Crucially, we find that the associated topological winding number is preserved under diverse perturbations, ensuring stable information encoding and retrieval. This paradigm illustrates how structured light can simultaneously expand channel dimensionality and maintain robustness, charting a pathway to chip-scale, reconfigurable photonic platforms for the PHz era, while also opening previously inaccessible regimes of light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Mid-IR Light Modulators Enabled by Dynamically Tunable Ultra High-Q Silicon Membrane Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces have emerged as a powerful platform to control free-space light at the subwavelength scale, enabling applications in sensing, lasing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photonics. However, their practical deployment is hindered by two key limitations: a tradeoff between low-Q resonances and weak amplitude contrast, and their predominantly static nature allowing only passive functionalities. These challenges are further aggravated in the application-relevant mid-infrared (mid-IR) range, where the lack of suitable low-loss materials and the strong absorption of common substrates such as silicon oxide or sapphire severely constrain performance and scalability. Here, we address these issues with actively tunable single-crystalline silicon membrane metasurfaces that combine high-Q resonances, strong amplitude contrast, and wafer-scale fabrication compatible dimensions for high throughput manufacturing. Our platform achieves record-high measured Q-factors up to 3000 in the mid-IR spectrum, supporting efficient dynamic modulation through two distinct schemes: (i) on-chip electro-thermal tuning via Joule heating, sustaining 50% modulation depth at CMOS-compatible voltages and speeds up to 14.5 kHz, and (ii) ultrafast all-optical modulation via carrier generation in silicon, reaching nanosecond response times and estimated sub-GHz modulation rates. By uniting sharp resonances, strong contrast, large-scale manufacturability, and dynamic tunability, our active silicon membrane metasurfaces advance the frontier of mid-IR nanophotonics and open new opportunities in sensing, free-space communication, thermal radiation management, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Broadband Waveguide-Coupled Photodetectors in a Submicrometer-Wavelength Silicon Photonics Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in silicon (Si) photonics at submicrometer wavelengths are unlocking new opportunities to realize miniaturized, scalable optical systems for biophotonics, quantum information, imaging, spectroscopy, and displays. Addressing this array of applications with a single integrated photonics technology requires the development of high-performance active components compatible with both visible and near-infrared light. Here, we report waveguide-coupled photodetectors monolithically integrated in a foundry-fabricated, short-wavelength, Si photonics platform. We demonstrate two detector variants that collectively cover a continuous wavelength span of $\lambda =$ 400 - 955 nm. The devices exhibited external quantum efficiencies exceeding 60% and 12% over 400 - 748 nm and 749 - 955 nm wavelength ranges, respectively. Measured dark currents were $&lt;$ 2 pA at a 2 V reverse bias. High-speed measurements at $\lambda =$ 785 nm demonstrated optoelectronic bandwidths up to 18 GHz. Avalanche operation was characterized, yielding a gain-bandwidth product of 374 GHz.</description>

      <title>High Finesse Buckled Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical cavities are widely used in modern science and technology to enable a wide range of both quantum and classical applications. Recently, the growing demand for miniaturization and high performance has fueled the exploration of new fabrication methods beyond traditional polishing techniques and macroscopic mirrors. Visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths are particularly important for quantum applications, where achieving low-loss resonators is also more challenging than in the telecom range, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for microscopic cavity systems. Here, we present a novel fabrication method for making NIR microcavities using buckled dielectric membrane mirrors, achieving a record finesse of 0.9 million at 780 nm. We demonstrated flexible device geometries, including singular mirrors and mirror arrays, featuring radii of curvature ranging from 1 mm to 10 mm. The fabrication process offers high uniformity, high yield, and robust performance across a wide range of cavity lengths. Additionally, we can produce easy-to-assemble microcavity packages, with a total volume of ~2 (4) $\,\mathrm{mm}^3\,$, featuring optical modes with a linewidth of 5.16 MHz (570 kHz) and a free spectral range of 3.18 THz (150 GHz). Our results extend the frontier of microcavity fabrication for classical and quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Ultracompact Wide-FOV Near-infrared Camera with Wafer-level Manufactured Meta-Aspheric Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overcoming the trade-off between wide field of view (FOV) and compactness remains a central challenge for integrating near-infrared (NIR) imaging into smartphones and AR glasses. Existing refractive NIR optics cannot simultaneously achieve ultra-wide angles above 100{\deg} and ultrathin total track length (TTL) below 5 mm, limiting their use in portable devices. Here, we present a wafer-level-manufactured meta-aspheric lens (MAL) that achieves a 101.5{\deg} FOV, 3.39 mm TTL, and F/1.64 aperture within a compact volume of 0.02 cubic centimeters. Unlike previous hybrid lenses with separate refractive and diffractive components, our MAL features a fully integrated structure, which enables a compact form factor. This integration also simplifies fabrication, allowing high-throughput production via micrometer-level precision alignment and bonding on a single wafer, with only one dicing step and no need for additional mechanical fixtures. Furthermore, the design process explicitly considers manufacturability and accurately models metalens dispersion, ensuring that experimental performance matches simulated results. We validate our MAL through both direct and computational imaging experiments. Despite its small form factor, our scalable MAL demonstrates strong NIR imaging performance in blood vessel imaging, eye tracking, and computational pixel super-resolution tasks. This scalable MAL technology establishes a new benchmark for high-performance, miniaturized NIR imaging and opens the door to next-generation smartphone and AR optical systems.</description>

      <title>Spatially Parallel All-optical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-optical neural networks (AONNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for ultrafast and energy-efficient computation. These networks typically consist of multiple serially connected layers between input and output layers--a configuration we term spatially series AONNs, with deep neural networks (DNNs) being the most prominent examples. However, such series architectures suffer from progressive signal degradation during information propagation and critically require additional nonlinearity designs to model complex relationships effectively. Here we propose a spatially parallel architecture for all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs). Unlike series architecture that sequentially processes information through consecutively connected optical layers, SP-AONNs divide the input signal into identical copies fed simultaneously into separate optical layers. Through coherent interference between these parallel linear sub-networks, SP-AONNs inherently enable nonlinear computation without relying on active nonlinear components or iterative updates. We implemented a modular 4F optical system for SP-AONNs and evaluated its performance across multiple image classification benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of parallel sub-networks consistently enhances accuracy, improves noise robustness, and expands model expressivity. Our findings highlight spatial parallelism as a practical and scalable strategy for advancing the capabilities of optical neural computing.</description>

      <title>1-GHz VIS-to-MIR frequency combs enabled by CMOS-compatible nanophotonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully stabilized frequency comb is essential for precision metrology and coherent optical synthesis. However, fully-stabilized frequency combs generally require separate stages for supercontinuum generation (SCG) and self-referencing, largely limiting their compactness. Here, enabled by the low-threshold multi-octave supercontinuum generation and concurrent third-harmonic generation in low-loss silicon nitride waveguides, we present a novel approach to a self-referenced frequency comb source at 1 GHz repetition rate spanning from the full visible (VIS) to the mid-infrared (MIR). Our coherent comb is seeded by an all-polarization-maintaining ultrafast fiber laser at 1556 nm, with a pulse duration of 73 fs at 1 GHz repetition rate. With an injected energy of merely 110 pJ, the pulses propagate through dispersion-engineered Si3N4 waveguides, generating supercontinuum spanning over three octaves from 350-3280 nm i.e. 0.76 PHz of coherent bandwidth. Moreover, the on-chip third harmonic generation provides a carrier envelope offset beat note via f-3f with a signal-to-noise ratio of 43 dB. Fueled by the evolving photonic integration providing possibilities of on-chip filtering and photo-detectors, this approach for single-chip self-referencing of high-repetition-rate frequency combs paves the way for ultrabroadband comb sources with unprecedented compactness and field-readiness.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Coupling Induced by Nonlocal Loss Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal coupling between photonic modes enables a range of advanced functionalities, though the available approaches for its practical implementation remain limited. Here, we introduce a novel strategy for achieving nonreciprocal coupling via nonlocal, nonlinear loss. We prove that robust, broadband, and continuously tunable nonreciprocal coupling can be realized by engineering the loss rate as a function of the state of a nonlocal mode, as validated through effective Hamiltonian modeling and numerical simulations. Our results suggest a promising route toward scalable, power-independent, and potentially integrable nonreciprocal photonic systems, with promising applications in non-Hermitian devices and topological photonics.</description>

      <title>Photonics-Aware Planning-Guided Automated Electrical Routing for Large-Scale Active Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising demand for AI training and inference, as well as scientific computing, combined with stringent latency and energy budgets, is driving the adoption of integrated photonics for computing, sensing, and communications. As active photonic integrated circuits (PICs) scale in device count and functional heterogeneity, physical implementation by manual scripting and ad-hoc edits is no longer tenable. This creates an immediate need for an electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) stack in which physical design automation is a core capability. However, there is currently no end-to-end fully automated routing flow that coordinates photonic waveguides and on-chip metal interconnect. Critically, available digital VLSI and analog/custom routers are not directly applicable to PIC metal routing due to a lack of customization to handle constraints induced by photonic devices and waveguides. We present, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end routing framework for large-scale active PICs that jointly addresses waveguides and metal wires within a unified flow. We introduce a physically-aware global planner that generates congestion- and crossing-aware routing guides while explicitly accounting for the placement of photonic components and waveguides. We further propose a sequence-consistent track assignment and a soft guidance-assisted detailed routing to speed up the routing process with significantly optimized routability and via usage. Evaluated on various large PIC designs, our router delivers fast, high-quality active PIC routing solutions with fewer vias, lower congestion, and competitive runtime relative to manual and existing VLSI router baselines; on average it reduce via count by ~99%, user-specified design rule violation by ~98%, and runtime by 17x, establishing a practical foundation for EPDA at system scale.</description>

      <title>General Framework for Twisted Bilayer Photonic Crystal with Interlayer Coupling and Far-Field Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general theory for twisted bilayer photonic crystals that takes into account both far-field response and near-field coupling. The theory is based on the framework of a generalized Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A universal form for interlayer coupling is derived, which relates the hopping strength to the Fourier transforms of the Wannier functions in the single layer photonic crystal. For low energy states at the K point in hexagonal lattices, the interlayer coupling reduces to that in the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for graphene. As an example, we study a twisted bilayer photonic crystal slab with air holes arranged in a honeycomb lattice in each layer. The first order solution of our model predicts a four-fold band splitting in the far-field spectrum compared to the single-layer case, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, our theory reveals that for low energy states at K points, scattering towards the {\Gamma} point via the moir\'e potential is suppressed. Based on our theory, we propose a wide-angle, high-Q tunable flat band cavity by combining the bilayer at a large twist angle with a Brillouinzone-folding perturbation within each layer. The cavity behaves like a collection of quasi-bound states in the continuum with a divergent density of states, with potential applications in nonlinear optics, lasing and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Total Angular Momentum Vectorial Holography Using Bi-Layer Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced holographic techniques are increasingly demanded for high-capacity and secure information processing. In this context, orbital angular momentum (OAM) stands out as a powerful resource for optical multiplexing, offering access to an unbounded set of orthogonal modes. To harness this potential, metasurfaces, with their considerable ability to control light, have emerged as key platforms for OAM-multiplexed holography. Nevertheless, conventional OAM holography suffers from limited polarization engineering capabilities due to the lack of chirality control in single-layer metasurfaces. Here, we introduce a bi-layer metasurface architecture that realizes total angular momentum (TAM) vectorial holography, where TAM represents the combination of spin angular momentum (SAM, equivalent to polarization) and OAM of light. In contrast to previous approaches, this scheme enables true polarization-OAM multiplexing, facilitating the independent generation of vectorial holographic images for each orthogonal TAM input state. This concept is validated numerically and experimentally, confirming the feasibility of TAM vectorial holography. The proposed scheme can be easily integrated with other recent holography generation approaches, such as vector beam multiplexing and bidirectional holography, thereby further expanding its multiplexing capability. This work establishes a versatile framework for advanced full-vectorial holography, showing how metasurfaces can unlock multiplexing strategies for emerging photonic systems.</description>

      <title>A Review of Light-Field Imaging in Biomedical Sciences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-field imaging is an emerging paradigm in biomedical optics, offering the unique ability to capture volumetric information in a single snapshot by encoding both the spatial and angular components of light. Unlike conventional three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities that rely on mechanical or optical scanning, light-field imaging enables high-speed volumetric acquisition, making it particularly well-suited for capturing rapid biological dynamics. This review outlines the theoretical foundations of light-field imaging and surveys its core implementations across microscopy, mesoscopy, and endoscopy. Special attention is given to the fundamental trade-offs between imaging speed, spatial resolution, and depth of field, as well as recent advances that address these limitations through compressive sensing, deep learning, and meta-optics. By positioning light-field imaging within the broader landscape of biomedical imaging technologies, we highlight its unique strengths, existing challenges, and future potential as a scalable and versatile tool for biological discovery and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Chat to Chip: Large Language Model Based Design of Arbitrarily Shaped Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional metasurface design is limited by the computational cost of full-wave simulations, preventing thorough exploration of complex configurations. Data-driven approaches have emerged as a solution to this bottleneck, replacing costly simulations with rapid neural network evaluations and enabling near-instant design for meta-atoms. Despite advances, implementing a new optical function still requires building and training a task-specific network, along with exhaustive searches for suitable architectures and hyperparameters. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs), by contrast, sidestep this laborious process with a simple fine-tuning technique. However, applying LLMs to the design of nanophotonic devices, particularly for arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces, is still in its early stages; as such tasks often require graphical networks. Here, we show that an LLM, fed with descriptive inputs of arbitrarily shaped metasurface geometries, can learn the physical relationships needed for spectral prediction and inverse design. We further benchmarked a range of open-weight LLMs and identified relationships between accuracy and model size at the billion-parameter level. We demonstrated that 1-D token-wise LLMs provide a practical tool to designing 2-D arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces. Linking natural-language interaction to electromagnetic modelling, this "chat-to-chip" workflow represents a step toward more user-friendly data-driven nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Non-epitaxial perovskite polariton laser diode operating under direct current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaching lasing in electrically pumped microdevices based on solution-processed semiconductors poses a major scientific and technological challenge. Halide perovskites offer a promising platform for electrical injection, since their optically excited single-crystal cavities and predesigned or postprocessed microstructures have exhibited low lasing threshold. Indirect electrical pumping of a dual-cavity perovskite laser was recently obtained, utilizing a well-established technological concept of embedding a high-luminosity light-emitting diode (LED) with a high-gain medium into an integrated device. Direct charge-carrier injection into a perovskite LED excited by auxiliary short-, optical-pulses resulted into amplified spontaneous emission. Other efforts for rational engineering of architectures that allow for high charge-carrier density are still to demonstrate lasing. Here, we develop a novel strategy for achieving direct electrical pumping of a perovskite laser. We integrate a solution-grown CsPbBr3 microplate with chemically inert single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes and embed them into an optical microcavity. By cooling the microdevice down to 8 K at a constant current, a perovskite p-i-n diode is formed that facilitates a balanced carrier injection at high current densities. The perovskite microcavity diode operates in the strong coupling regime, exhibiting polariton lasing under a direct current of 65 uA.</description>

      <title>Generating non-diffracting bottle beams with a flat multi-level diffractive lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for creating a high-quality, sharply defined, non-diffracting optical bottle beam by focusing a Bessel beam propagating through a flat multi-level diffractive lens (MDL). This study highlights the impact of the MDL illuminated by a Bessel beam with suppressed sidelobes generated from a binary axicon. The resulting Bessel bottle beam exhibits a series of low- or zero-intensity zones interleaved with high-intensity regions, with variable periods ranging from 0.2 to 1.36 mm along the beam propagation. The transverse intensity profiles of these regions remain shape-invariant over long distances in free space, and thereby the non-diffracting range of the micron-sized optical bottle beam exceeds 5 cm. We also observe that the far-field output from the MDL illuminated by a Bessel beam offers advantages over conventional focusing lenses. Furthermore, this technique can operate on ultrafast timescales (from pico- to femtoseconds) due to the high damage thresholds of the binary axicon and MDL, enabling the generation of high-power optical bottle beams. Ultimately, our experimental approach paves the way for various applications, including high-resolution biological imaging in turbid media, particle manipulation, micromachining, and harmonic generation, leveraging the spatial landscape of the optical bottle beam.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optics Nature of the Elementary Excitations in Few-Layer WSe2 Semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully quantized description of a two-level system resonantly coupled with an electromagnetic field (light) is among the central topics of quantum electrodynamics, which is theorized by the quantum Rabi model. It is also a fundamental issue of light-matter interactions. The rapid development of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) atomically-thin semiconductors brings excellent great chance to test and demonstrate some basic predictions by quantum optics theory in textbook, i.e., by the quantum Rabi model. Such test and demonstration are of both scientific and technological significance because of the quick emergence of the second quantum revolution. In this Letter, we show a quantum optics demonstration of the variable-temperature optical responses of the elementary excitations in few-layer WSe2 flakes. It is unraveled that the variable-temperature reflectance and fluorescence patterns of the elementary excitations (i.e., the band-edge excitons) of monolayer, bilayer and hBN capped WSe2 match well with the predictions by the quantum Rabi model under the rotating wave approximation. Decoherence times, Rabi frequencies, and transition matrix elements of the elementary excitations in these few-layer WSe2 flakes are found to be all negatively correlated with temperature, and to show dependence on layer number and capping layer. These findings may provide a novel perspective for comprehending the fundamental quantum physical properties of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Driven Dissipative Soliton Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the enhancement of the dissipative soliton energy scalability by the injection of a low-power single-mode seed synchronized with a chirped-pulse oscillator round-trip. It is demonstrated that a threshold-like transition to multiple-pulse generation limits the maximum energies of dissipative solitons, in agreement with the thermodynamic interpretation of a strongly chirped pulse stability. We show that there are ``islands'' of instability within a stability range of energies which result from stochastic resonance between ``internal modes'' of soliton and quantum noise of the ``basin''. The transition to multiple-pulsing can be suppressed in a system driven by a comparatively low-power seed. However, seed power growth increases the mode-locking energy threshold and produces ``islands'' of instability as the dissipative soliton energy rises.</description>

Abstract: A novel copper(II) ion sensor has been developed, achieving both a broad dynamic range and high sensitivity, effectively addressing the limitations of conventional fluorescence-based detection methods. The sensor exploits the hydrolysis reaction between rhodamine B hydrazide (RBH) and copper(II) ions, with optical signal amplification enabled by a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microcavity laser. By adjusting the solvent type and utilizing the solvatochromic effect, the detection range of the copper(II) ion and RBH reaction was optimized. The sensor enables rapid, broad dynamic range detection of copper(II) ions, spanning from 5 uM to 3 mM, with a high selectivity, which holds significant potential for future applications in environmental monitoring and biomedical fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials exhibiting hyperbolic dispersion enable unprecedented control over light-matter interactions, from sub-diffraction imaging to enhanced spontaneous emission. However, conventional plasmonic hyperbolic metamaterials suffer from limited tunability and lack intrinsic emission capabilities, constraining their utility for active photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate the first room-temperature, electrically tunable, excitonic hyperbolic metamaterial using aligned films of chirality-pure semiconducting carbon nanotubes. Unlike plasmonic systems, these excitonic metamaterials of aligned nanotubes combine strong optical anisotropy with dynamic electrostatic tunability. Spectroscopic ellipsometry reveals that the hyperbolic dispersion window can be electrically shifted by 53 meV, enabling real-time switching between hyperbolic and elliptical regimes. Theory predicts that this tunability translates to the propagation angle being modulated by 34{\deg}, driven by a momentum enhancement 3.11 times that of free space, limited primarily by material losses that can be mitigated through improved alignment. In addition, simulations of the system exhibit a high Purcell factor of 1550 and a modulation of 37 % without an optical cavity for a dipole placed 5 nm above the aligned nanotubes. These findings establish excitonic carbon nanotubes as a versatile platform for dynamically reconfigurable photonic metamaterials, opening pathways for adaptive optical devices, electrically-controlled spontaneous emission, and tunable hyper-lenses operating at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Spectral-temporal processing using integrated recursive electro-optic circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in integrated photonics have enabled unprecedented level of control of light, powering a wide range of photonic technologies from communications and computing to precision metrology and quantum information. However, the conventional on-chip optical signal processing approaches based on optical waveguides and cavities suffer from their large physical footprint and narrow operating bandwidth, respectively. To address this, we propose and experimentally demonstrate, using the thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonics, a modular, recursive optical signal processing framework. In our approach, fast electro-optic (EO) switch is used to either keep an optical packet inside the loop, with the processing element embedded within, or to release it from the loop and direct it towards the output waveguide. By configuring the switch on a timescale shorter than a time the photon spends traversing the loop, this architecture can achieve different optical pathlengths in a compact footprint without sacrificing optical bandwidth. As an example, we embed a phase-modulator (PM) inside the loop and demonstrate a frequency shift of optical packets up to 420 GHz, using only a 3 GHz sinusoidal microwave signal. By replacing the PM with chirped Bragg gratings (CBG), we demonstrate recursive delay line featuring large group delays of 28 ps/nm over a 30 nm optical bandwidth. Finally, by introducing asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer (AMZI) inside the loop, we demonstrate a reconfigurable differentiation of the optical packet in time, up to an unprecedented fifth-order. Our results establish a powerful and scalable platform for multifunctional photonic processing, setting the stage for next-generation integrated systems with ultrahigh reconfigurability and spectral-temporal versatility.</description>

Abstract: We study experimentally and theoretically optical absorption spectra of neodymium ferroborate in the temperature range $6-32$ K. We show that the temperature dependences of integral intensities of absorption lines demonstrate qualitatively different behavior for $\sigma$- and $\pi$-polarizations of the light. We suggest that this behavior may be caused by the appearance of a spiral magnetic structure in the compound under study. To describe the temperature dependences of lines intensities we propose a theoretical model which takes into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction between Nd$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ ions.</description>

      <title>Strongly chirped dissipative solitons in normal and anomalous dispersion regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an adiabatic theory for strongly chirped dissipative solitons governed by the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and analyze their existence regions in both normal and anomalous dispersion regimes. Closed-form expressions for the frequency cut-off and peak power yield two physical branches whose admissibility is set by a compact dimensionless parameterization. The analysis reveals that dissipative-soliton resonance (chirp-driven temporal stretching with bounded peak power) naturally emerges on the scalable branch, providing a direct pathway to high-energy femtosecond oscillators without external amplification. We interpret these results within a thermodynamic framework that connects energy "condensation" in the soliton to a BEC-like metaphor, providing quantitative indicators for energy scalability limits and breakup onsets, and aligning with a recently formulated thermodynamic methodology for dissipative solitons. Beyond immediate laser design guidance, our approach suggests a generalized thermodynamic theory of strongly chirped dissipative solitons, including measurable entropy and temperature proxies, as well as a phase diagram that distinguishes between single- and multi-soliton states. This unifies practical laser engineering criteria with many-body concepts, pointing to optics-based, metaphorical simulations of condensate phenomena.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Based Optical Thermometry Using Photoluminescence and Raman Spectra of Diamonds Containing SiV Centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro- and nanothermometry enable precise temperature monitoring and control at the micro- and nanoscale, and have become essential diagnostic tools in applications ranging from high-power microelectronics to biosensing and nanomedicine. Most existing techniques rely on secondary micro- and nanothermometers that require individual calibration of each sensor, ideally both off- and in-situ, before use. We present an alternative approach that overcomes this limitation by employing fluorescent diamonds containing silicon-vacancy centers, where the thermo-sensitive physical quantities are the centers' photoluminescence and the diamond host's Raman signals. The photoluminescence and Raman data are analyzed using two multi-feature regression algorithms that leverage a minimal number of calibration diamonds and temperature set points to predict the temperature of previously unseen diamonds. Using this approach, the models achieve accuracies as low as 0.7 K, resolutions down to 0.6 K Hz$^{-1/2}$, and sensitivity as high as 0.04 K$^{-1}$. These correspond to improvements of roughly 70 percent (over threefold) in accuracy, 50 percent (twofold) in resolution, and 567 percent (sevenfold) in sensitivity compared with traditional single-feature models. Our approach is particularly suited to applications where pre-deployment calibration of every thermosensor is impractical, and it is generalizable to any thermometry platform with two or more simultaneously measurable temperature-dependent observables.</description>

      <title>Programmable Focal Elongation and Shaping of High-Intensity Laser Pulses using Adaptive Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the intensity distribution of laser pulses in the focal region is essential for optimizing optically generated plasma waveguides and enabling advanced plasma acceleration techniques, including dephasingless wakefield acceleration. Here, we present a method for programmatic structuring of the high-intensity focal region of a standard off-axis parabolic mirror, extending the length of this region well beyond the Rayleigh length and enabling control over the longitudinal intensity distribution. The theoretical framework is validated through numerical simulations and experimental measurements. Further, we demonstrate the use of this technique in an existing plasma accelerator system using readily available hardware components. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this method to multi-GeV laser plasma acceleration and the generation of flying foci, research areas which would significantly benefit from improved programmatic structuring of high-intensity laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Energy Transfer in Red Algal Photosystem I Reveals an Evolutionary Bridge between Cyanobacteria and Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photosystem I converts light into chemical energy with near-unity quantum efficiency,yet its energy-transfer and charge-separation mechanisms remain debated. Evolution has diversified PSI architectures. The unicellular red algae Cyanidioschyzon merolae represents a key evolutionary intermediate,featuring a cyanobacterial-like monomeric core surrounded by three to five LHCR subunits. This hybrid organization provides a unique system to bridge mechanistic models across lineages. We applied two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy at ultralow temperatures to disentangle overlapping excitation pathways in C. merolae PSI. Cryogenic measurements suppressed thermal broadening, resolving five dynamical components: sub-picosecond equilibration acrossthe core-LHCR interface, subsequent population transfer into progressively lowerenergy manifolds, and slower feeding into red pools distributed across both core and antenna. On the longest timescales, a persistent ground-state bleach signifies excitons stabilised in terminal sinks. Notably, comparison of 8 K and 80 K spectra reveals that excitations are heterogeneously partitioned among multiple sinks at low disorder, whereas modest thermal activation promotes selective convergence into core-associated red chlorophylls. To interpret these dynamics, we employed atomistic excitonic Hamiltonians with time-nonlocal master equations, providing a quantitative framework for exciton migration and thermal redistribution. Together, these results demonstrate that C. merolae PSI broadens the kinetic funnel by distributing sinks across core and antenna, an evolutionary adaptation that extends spectral coverage whilst ensuring efficient trapping. These insights reconcile cyanobacterial and plant paradigms and illuminate how antenna expansion reshaped PSI function during the course of photosynthetic evolution.</description>

      <title>Magnon squeezing near a quantum critical point in a cavity-magnon-qubit system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study a one-dimensional topological model featuring a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger type pattern of nearest-neighbor cou- plings in combination with the longer-range interactions exponentially decaying with the distance. We demonstrate that even relatively weak long-range couplings can trigger the topological transition if their range is large enough. This provides an additional facet in the control of topological phases.</description>

Abstract: We present an experimental test of the use of stress engineered optics incorporated into a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor in such a way that the shape of the point spread function (PSF) provides polarization information while the displacement of the PSF gives information about the local wavefront gradient, allowing a reconstruction of the wavefront gradient. Using calibrated polarizations and wavefront tilts we construct a measurement matrix capable of reconstructing both the Stokes parameters and the wavefront, yielding a measurement of wavefront gradients as small as 100 $\mu$rad with a polarimetric angular error of approximately 0.1 radians on the Poincar\'e sphere in a single frame measurement.</description>

      <title>Reducing Averaging Time in Dual-comb Spectroscopy via Phase-Patterned Higher-Repetition-Rate Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10426v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) is a powerful Fourier-transform spectroscopic technique that provides high-speed, high-resolution, and broadband measurements without moving parts. However, the high peak power of mode-locked pulses limits the photodetector's dynamic range, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per acquisition. While coherent averaging can improve SNR, it sacrifices temporal resolution and demands stringent system stability. Here, we introduce a novel concept to enhance SNR by using phase-patterned higher-repetition-rate combs. We reinterpret the self-imaging process of comb spectrum from a new perspective on mode interference among sub-pulse trains As a proof-of-concept, we densified two 250-MHz frequency combs to 12.5-MHz mode spacings via phase modulation and performed DCS on an $\mathrm{H^{13}C^{14}N}$ gas cell, and compared the results with an emulated conventional 12.5-MHz DCS, demonstrating a 17-fold increase in mode amplitude. This concept is expected to be combined with ultra-high repetition rate combs, such as microcombs, and thereby deployed in practical applications that typically require spectral sampling spacings from hundreds of MHz to GHz range.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Controlled Planar Guided Crystallization of Low-Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) for non-volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar guided crystallization, a novel method for programming the growth of optically homogeneous low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure optically uniform crystalline properties across devices is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we propose the use of an adjustable liquid crystal spin-orbit device to shape bi-colour structured light to create bimodal states. We demonstrate the proof-of-principle for two individual wavelengths in a nonlinear optics framework. The spin-orbit device has an inhomogeneous optical axis orientation and birefringence, allowing it to modulate two wavelengths of light with pre-selected transmission functions by simply tuning a voltage. We combine this bi-colour functionality in a nonlinear optical experiment by employing three-wave mixing in a periodically poled crystal to show how the combined effect of linear spin-orbit transformation rules and nonlinear selection rules gives rise to novel approaches for light to modulate light, and light to unravel light. We show that the roles of the nonlinear crystal and spin-orbit device can be switched to either characterise the device with known light, or unravel unknown light with the device. This synergy between spin-orbit and nonlinear optics offers a novel paradigm where light manipulates and reveals its own structure across spectral domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasicrystals occupy a unique position between periodic and disordered systems, where localization phenomena such as Anderson transitions and mobility edges can emerge even in the absence of disorder. This distinctive behavior motivates the development of robust, all-optical diagnostic tools capable of probing the structural, topological, and dynamical properties of such systems. In this work, focusing on generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper models and on an incommensurate potential in the continuum limit, we demonstrate that high-harmonic generation phenomenon serves as a powerful probe of localization transitions and mobility edges in quasicrystals. We introduce a new parameter--dipole mobility--which captures the impact of intraband dipole transitions and enables classification of nonlinear optical regimes, where excitation and high-harmonic generation yield can differ by orders of magnitude. We show that the cutoff frequency of harmonics is strongly influenced by the position of the mobility edge, providing a robust and experimentally accessible signature of localization transitions in quasicrystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum physics, classical optics, and many other wave systems, wave confinement in a potential well is associated with discrete oscillatory states, and the ground state is typically assumed to vanish uniformly. An open question is whether the ground state can counterintuitively support a flat-top, nonzero envelope, offering new opportunities for quantum emitters, optical antennas, and lasers. Here, we show that by applying the Byers-Yang theorem with an artificial gauge field, energy levels can be continuously shifted, driving eigenstates to morph into a ground state with a uniform yet nontrivial wave envelope. We implement this concept in a photonic crystal slab where a central bulk region is surrounded by heterogeneous bandgaps that engineer reflective phases acting as an artificial local gauge field. By inducing lasing, we probe directly the evolution of the energy levels, demonstrating wave morphing toward a flat-top ground state via near- and far-field measurements.</description>

Abstract: We analyze quantum interference in the triplet-exciton pair generated by singlet exciton fission in a molecular crystal, and introduce transport-induced dephasing (TID) as a key effect that can suppress the expected fluorescence quantum beats when the triplet-exciton wavefunction can localize on inequivalent sites. TID depends on the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites and on the energy-shifts among the stationary states of the entangled triplet pair in different spatial configurations. The theoretical model is confirmed by experiments in rubrene single crystals, where triplet pairs remain entangled for more than 50 ns but quantum beats are suppressed by TID within a few nanoseconds when the magnetic field is misaligned by just a few degrees from specific symmetric directions. Our experiments deliver the zero-field parameters for the rubrene molecule in its orthorhombic lattice and information on triplet-exciton transport, in particular the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites, which we evaluate to be of the order of 150 ps in rubrene.</description>

Abstract: Spin fluctuations are an important issue for the design and operation of future spintronic devices. Femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) was recently applied to detect ultrafast magnetization fluctuations. FemNoC gives direct access to the spontaneous fluctuations of the magnetization in magnetically ordered materials. In FemNoC experiments, the magnetic fluctuations are imprinted on the polarization state of two independent femtosecond probe pulses upon transmission through a magnetic sample. Using a subharmonic demodulation scheme, the cross-correlation of the signals from both pulse trains is calculated. Here, we quantitatively link the FemNoC output signal to an optical polarization rotation, and then in turn to the magnitude of the inherent spin fluctuations. To this end, three different calibration protocols are presented and compared in accuracy. Ultimately, we quantitatively determine both the variance of optical polarization noise in rad$^2$, and that of the ultrafast magnetization fluctuations in (A/m)$^2$.</description>

      <title>Controlling Sloppiness in Two-Phase Estimation with a Tunable Weak Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The description of complex systems requires a progressively larger number of parameters. However, in practice, it often happens that a small subset of parameters suffices to describe the dynamics of the system itself: these combinations are usually referred to as \textit{stiff} combinations. In turn, the remaining combinations, called \textit{sloppy}, only play a minor role in the dynamics of the system, hence provide little information on it. While this effect can reduce model complexity, it can also limit the estimation precision when the stiff and sloppy combinations are unknown to the experimenter, and one is forced to estimate the potentially sloppy model parameters. We explored how such a sloppy behavior can be controlled and counteracted via quantum weak measurements in the estimation of two sequential phases. We showed that the introduction of a weak measurement of variable strength in-between the two phases allows to switch from a fully sloppy setup to a fully determined one where both phases can be estimated with quantum-limited precision. Our work provides an important insight of sloppiness detection in quantum systems, with promising applications in quantum metrology and imaging, as well as to quantum security and quantum monitoring.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal lattice distortions inside crystalline Si upon sub-threshold femtosecond laser-induced excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10420v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Material processing with femtosecond lasers has attracted enormous attention because of its potential for technology and industrial applications. In parallel, time-resolved x-ray diffraction has been successfully used to study ultrafast structural distortion dynamics in semiconductor thin films or surface layers. However, real-world processing applications mostly are concerned with bulk materials, which prevents the use of x-ray surface based techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast x-ray dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon laser excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of thetemporal evolution of ultrafast distorted lattice depth profiles. We demonstrate the potential of UDD by studying a thin Si single crystal upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation. Our study reveals that below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions not only longitudinal, but also transversal to the propagation of the strain wave appear on picosecond time scales along the single crystal. The observation of this transversal deformation after laser excitation contradicts previous work that were not able to observed it, what could be related to the high sensitivity of dynamical diffraction with respect to the lattice distortions. The speed of propagation of this ultrafast transversal strain deformation is observed to be slower to the longitudinal sound speed for Si as described in the bibliography.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconducting pairing via quantum Lyapunov control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum Lyapunov control provides an effective strategy for enhancing superconducting correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model without requiring careful parameter tuning. While photoinduced superconductivity is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of a monochromatic laser pulse, our approach employs a simple feedback-based protocol that prevents the decrease of superconducting correlations once they begin to form. This method enables robust enhancement of pairing across a broad range of initial pumping conditions, eliminating the need for intricate frequency and amplitude optimization. We also show that an alternative implementation, asymptotic quantum control, achieves comparable results. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to suppress previously induced superconducting correlations, providing bidirectional control over quantum pairing states. These findings suggest practical pathways for manipulating quantum correlations in strongly interacting systems with minimal experimental complexity.</description>

      <title>Temporal modulation of second harmonic generation in ferroelectrics by a pulsed electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the relationship between electric polarization modulation $\Delta P$ in ferroelectrics induced by a low-frequency pulsed electric field and the corresponding second harmonic intensity modulation $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Using nonlinear response theory, we derive their time-domain expressions linear in the pulse amplitude, revealing that not only the electric field but also its time derivative contributes to $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Furthermore, even when the time-derivative component is negligible, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can be in antiphase with the pulsed field and thus with $\Delta P$. These theoretical predictions are further supported by real-time simulations of a model for electronic ferroelectrics. Our results demonstrate that the commonly assumed relation $\Delta P \propto \Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can break down under certain conditions, reflecting the complex-valued and frequency-dependent nature of nonlinear dynamical susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Fully quantum perturbative description of correlated Stokes--anti-Stokes scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes--anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs, making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that a four-wave mixing-like correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation and completely characterizes the non-resonant SaS photon pair production. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.</description>

      <title>Ghost Imaging with Free Electron-Photon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coincidence imaging, also known as ghost imaging, is a technique that exploits correlations between two particles to reconstruct information about a specimen. The particle that relays the spatial information about the object remains completely non-interacting, while the particle used to probe the object is not spatially resolved. While ghost imaging has been primarily implemented on photonic platforms, it becomes particularly intriguing when applied to particles with fundamentally different properties, such as massive, charged electrons and massless, neutral photons, especially considering the role of both particles as cornerstones of highly advanced microscopic platforms. In this work, we investigate coincidence imaging using electron-cathodoluminescence photon pairs generated within a transmission electron microscope. Utilizing a custom-built free-space cathodoluminescence setup, we demonstrate ghost imaging of complex patterns. We are able to obtain a spatial resolution down to 2 $\mu$m, paving the way for adaptation of quantum-enhanced imaging techniques from photonic quantum optics to electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Oscillations in Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, which can kinetically mix with ordinary photons, represent the simplest extension to the standard model. Detecting their oscillations with visible photons could provide crucial insights into the nature of dark matter and fundamental interactions beyond the standard model. We propose a novel laboratory-based approach to detect dark photon oscillations using a laser in an Optical Time-domain Relectometry (OTDR) setup. The laser light propagating through the optical fiber undergoes oscillations with the dark photon, leading to measurable changes in the power flow. These oscillations can precisely measured,
  leveraging its high sensitivity and efficiency in detecting small variations in the optical signal. This approach could provide a new avenue for probing dark photon oscillations in the laboratory and greatly improve the current experimental sensitivity to dark photon in a wide mass range.</description>

      <title>Systematic Study of Amorphous ABC Heterostructures at the Atomic Scale as a Nonlinear Optical Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The systematic exploration of ABC type heterostructures reveals that nanoscale morphological modification markedly improves nonlinear optical properties to maximize the artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking centrosymmetry. We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$ pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</description>
