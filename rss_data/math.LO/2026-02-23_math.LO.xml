      <title>A logical approach to concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concentration results say that a sequence of random variables becomes progressively concentrated around the mean. Such results are common in the study of functions of random graphs. We introduce a real-valued logic with various aggregate operators on graphs, including summation, and prove that every term in the language, seen as a random variable on random graphs within the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph model, is concentrated. We prove this for dense and sparse variants of Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs. On the one hand, our results extend the line of work originating with Fagin and Glebskii et al. on zero-one laws for dense random graphs, as well as the zero-one law of Shelah and Spencer for sparse random graphs. On the other hand, they can be seen as a meta-theorem for inferring concentration results on random graphs, and we give examples of such applications.</description>

      <title>On the Category-Theoretic Independence of Meaning, Object, Name and Existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a category-theoretic independence theorem for four fundamental notions: meaning, object, name, and existence. Working in a Lawvere-style categorical semantics and in particular in toposes, we show that these notions occupy distinct structural levels (object, morphism, element, and internal logical level) and are not uniformly recoverable from one another.
  The key separation arises between internal existence and global naming. Using a concrete example in the topos $\mathbf{Sh}(S^1)$-the sheaf of local sections of a nontrivial covering-we exhibit an object that is internally inhabited but admits no global element.
  These results provide a precise structural basis for treating geometric universes as foundational frameworks for information networks.</description>

      <title>Ramsey theory of low-degree semialgebraic relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that hypergraphs defined by low-degree polynomial inequalities contain large homogeneous subsets. Formally, let $H$ be an $r$-uniform hypergraph on $N$ vertices that is semialgebraic of constant description complexity, and each defining polynomial has degree at most $D$. Then $H$ contains a clique or an independent set of size $n$, where $N\leq \mbox{tw}_{3D^3}(n)$.</description>

      <title>Unital Specker $\ell$-groups and boolean multispaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a topological generalization of the notion of a multiset, a boolean multispace is a boolean space $X$ with a continuous function $u\colon X\to \mathbb Z_{&gt;0}$, where $\mathbb Z_{&gt;0}=\{1,2,\dots\}$ has the discrete topology. In this paper the category of boolean multispaces and continuous multiplicity-decreasing morphisms with respect to the divisibility order is shown to be dually equivalent to the category of unital Specker $\ell$-groups and unital $\ell$-homomorphisms. This result extends Stone duality, because unital Specker $\ell$-groups whose distinguished unit is singular are equivalent to boolean algebras. Boolean multispaces, in turn, are categorically equivalent to the Priestley duals of the MV-algebras corresponding to unital Specker $\ell$-groups via the $\Gamma$ functor. Via duality, we show that the category of unital Specker $\ell$-groups has finite colimits and finite products, but lacks some countable copowers and equalizers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every bounded definable open set is a union of finitely many open strong cells in a weakly o-minimal expansion of a real closed field. We prove this fact and another theorem similar to it.</description>

      <title>Scott spectral gaps for trees are bounded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Borel class of trees, we show that there is a tree in that class whose Scott sentence is not too much more complicated than the definition of the class. In particular, if the class is definable by a $\Pi_\alpha$ sentence, then there is a model of Scott rank at most $\alpha + 2$. This gives another proof-and one that does not require first proving Vaught's conjecture for trees-of the fact that trees are not faithfully Borel complete.</description>

      <title>The Sup Connective in IMALL: A Categorical Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02142v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a proof language for intuitionistic multiplicative additive linear logic, incorporating the sup connective that introduces additive pairs with a probabilistic elimination, and sum and scalar products within the proof-terms. We provide an abstract characterisation of the language, revealing that any symmetric monoidal closed category with biproducts and a monomorphism from the semiring of scalars to the semiring Hom(I,I) is suitable for the job. Leveraging the binary biproducts, we define a weighted codiagonal map which is at the core of the sup connective.</description>
