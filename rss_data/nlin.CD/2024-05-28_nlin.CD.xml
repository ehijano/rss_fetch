      <title>Symmetry breaking of three self-organization rules:A general theory for the origin of complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex spatiotemporal patterns in nature significantly challenge reductionism-based modern science. The lack of a paradigm beyond reductionism hinders our understanding of the emergence of complexity. The diversity of countless patterns undermines any notion of universal mechanisms. Here, however, we show that breaking the symmetry of three simple and self-organization rules give rise to nearly all patterns in nature, such as a wide variety of Turing patterns, fractals, spiral, target and plane waves, as well as chaotic patterns. The symmetry breaking is rooted in basic physical quantities, such as positive and negative forces, space, time and bounds. Besides reproducing the hallmarks of complexity, we discover some novel phenomena, such as abrupt percolation of Turing patterns, phase transition between fractals and chaos, chaotic edge in travelling waves, etc. Our asymmetric self-organization theory established a simple and unified framework for the origin of complexity in all fields, and unveiled a deep relationship between the first principles of physics and the complex world</description>

      <title>Identifying Extreme Events in the Stock Market: A Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper employs Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to detect extreme events (EEs) in the stock market at a continental level. Previous approaches, which analyzed stock indices separately, could not detect EEs for multiple time series in one go. TDA provides a robust framework for such analysis and identifies the EEs during the crashes for different indices. The TDA analysis shows that $L^1$, $L^2$ norms and Wasserstein distance ($W_D$) of the world leading indices rise abruptly during the crashes, surpassing a threshold of $\mu+4*\sigma$ where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and the standard deviation of norm or $W_D$, respectively. Our study identified the stock index crashes of the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic across continents as EEs. Given that different sectors in an index behave differently, a sector-wise analysis was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic for the Indian stock market. The sector-wise results show that after the occurrence of EE, we have observed strong crashes surpassing $\mu+2*\sigma$ for an extended period for the banking sector. While for the pharmaceutical sector, no significant spikes were noted. Hence, TDA also proves successful in identifying the duration of shocks after the occurrence of EEs. This also indicates that the Banking sector continued to face stress and remained volatile even after the crash. This study gives us the applicability of TDA as a powerful analytical tool to study EEs in various fields.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity and quantum chaos for periodically driven spin-chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of quantum states under dynamical evolution can be investigated by studying the spread with time of the state over a pre-defined basis. It is known that this complexity is minimised by choosing the Krylov basis, thus defining the spread complexity. We study the dynamics of spread complexity for quantum maps using the Arnoldi iterative procedure. The main illustrative quantum many-body model we use is the periodically kicked Ising spin-chain with non-integrable deformations, a chaotic system where we look at both local and non-local interactions. In the various cases we find distinctive behaviour of the Arnoldi coefficients and spread complexity for regular vs. chaotic dynamics: suppressed fluctuations in the Arnoldi coefficients as well as larger saturation value in spread complexity in the chaotic case. We compare the behaviour of the Krylov measures with that of standard spectral diagnostics of chaos. We also study the effect of changing the driving frequency on the complexity saturation.</description>

      <title>Orbital dynamics in galactic potentials under mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent potentials are common in galactic systems that undergo significant evolution, interactions, or encounters with other galaxies, or when there are dynamic processes like star formation and merging events. Recent studies show that an ensemble approach along with the so-called snapshot framework in dynamical system theory provide a powerful tool to analyze time dependent dynamics.
  In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the phase space structure and dynamical complexity in time-dependent galactic potentials consisting of multiple components. We apply the classical method of Poincar\'e-surface of section to analyze the phase space structure in a chaotic Hamiltonian system subjected to parameter drift. This, however, makes sense only when the evolution of a large ensemble of initial conditions is followed. Numerical simulations explore the phase space structure of such ensembles while the system undergoes a continuous parameter change. The pair-wise average distance of ensemble members allows us to define a generalized Lyapunov-exponent, that might also be time dependent, to describe the system stability. We revise the system parameters for the Milky Way galaxy and provide a comprehensive dynamical analysis of the system under circumstances where linear mass transfer undergoes between the disk and bulge components of the model.</description>

      <title>Gibbs states and Brownian models for coexisting haze and cloud droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clouds microphysics describes the formation and evolution of cloud droplets, rain, and ice particles. It is among the most critical factors in determining the cloud's size, lifetime, precipitation, and radiative effect. Among all cloud types, the small clouds, characterized by weak updrafts, that are close to the haze-to-cloud transition pose challenges in measuring them and understanding their properties. They are superabundant but hard to capture by satellites and often falsely regarded as aerosols. K\"ohler's theory explains droplet activation and their growth by condensation at the earliest stages of cloud development. It fully describes the thermodynamic state of a single drop but falls short when explaining the collective behavior of large populations of particles. This is especially important when the supersaturation pool is limited. We present an analytical framework to extend K\"ohler's theory to coexisting cloud droplets. Our results suggest hysteresis and asymmetry in the process of droplet activation and deactivation. The turbulent nature of clouds is incorporated into our model formulation as Brownian noise to provide explicit droplet size distributions and activation timescales. The theoretical findings are confronted with experimental data stemming from laboratory clouds created in the Pi convection chamber, suggesting a new way of understanding haze-to-cloud transitions and small cloud formation processes.</description>

      <title>Unorientable topological gravity and orthogonal random matrix universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The duality of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and a double scaled matrix integral has led to studies of the canonical spectral form factor (SFF) in the so called $\tau-$scaled limit of large times, $t \to \infty$, and fixed temperature in order to demonstrate agreement with universal random matrix theory (RMT). Though this has been established for the unitary case, extensions to other symmetry classes requires the inclusion of unorientable manifolds in the sum over geometries, necessary to address time reversal invariance, and regularization of the corresponding prime geometrical objects, the Weil-Petersson (WP) volumes. We report here how universal signatures of quantum chaos, witnessed by the fidelity to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, emerge for the low-energy limit of unorientable JT gravity, i.e. the Airy model/topological gravity. To this end, we implement the loop equations for the corresponding dual (double-scaled) matrix model and find the generic form of the Airy WP volumes, supported by calculations using unorientable Kontsevich graphs. In an apparent violation of the gravity/chaos duality, the $\tau-$scaled SFF on the gravity side acquires both logarithmic and power law contributions in $t$, not manifestly present on the RMT side. We show the expressions can be made to agree by means of bootstrapping-like relations hidden in the asymptotic expansions of generalized hypergeometric functions. Thus, we are able to establish strong evidence of the quantum chaotic nature of unorientable topological gravity.</description>

      <title>Suppressing defection by increasing temptation: the impact of smart cooperators on a social dilemma situation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a social dilemma situation, where individual and collective interests are in conflict, it sounds a reasonable assumption that the presence of super or smart players, who simultaneously punish defection and reward cooperation without allowing exploitation, could solve the basic problem. The behavior of such a multi-strategy system, however, is more subtle than it is firstly anticipated. When exploring the complete parameter space, we find that the emergence of cyclic dominance among strategies is rather common, which results in several counter-intuitive phenomena. For example, the defection level can be lowered at higher temptation, or weaker punishment provides better conditions for smart players. Our study indicates that smart cooperators can unexpectedly thrive under high temptation, emphasizing the complexity of strategic interactions. This study suggests that the principles governing these interactions can be applied to other moral behaviors, such as truth-telling and honesty, providing valuable insights for future research in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Jet mixing enhancement with Bayesian optimization, deep learning, and persistent data topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We optimize the jet mixing using large eddy simulations (LES) at a Reynolds number of $3000$. Key methodological enablers consist of Bayesian optimization, a surrogate model enhanced by deep learning, and persistent data topology for physical interpretation. The mixing performance is characterized by an equivalent jet radius ($R_{\rm eq}$) derived from the streamwise velocity in a plane located $8$ diameters downstream. The optimization is performed in a 22-dimensional actuation space that comprises most known excitations. The plant benefits from a 22-dimensional actuation space that comprises most known excitations. This search space parameterizes distributed actuation imposed on the bulk flow and at the periphery of the nozzle in the streamwise and radial directions. The momentum flux measures the energy input of the actuation. The optimization quadruples the jet radius $R_{\rm eq}$ with a $7$-armed blooming jet after around $570$ evaluations. The control input requires $2\%$ momentum flux of the main flow, which is one order of magnitude lower than an ad hoc dual-mode excitation. Intriguingly, a pronounced suboptimum in the search space is associated with a double-helix jet, a new flow pattern. This jet pattern results in a mixing improvement comparable to the blooming jet. A state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization converges towards this double helix solution. The learning is accelerated and converges to another better optimum by including surrogate model trained along the optimization. Persistent data topology extracts the global and many local minima in the actuation space. These minima can be identified with flow patterns beneficial to the mixing.</description>

      <title>Mixed (Regular and Chaotic) Dynamics under the Channeling of the High Energy Positrons in [100] Direction of the Silicon Crystal and Podolskiy-Narimanov Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The character of motion (regular or chaotic) on the quantum level manifests itself in the statistics of the set of the system's energy levels. The completely regular case generates the sequence of the levels with exponential (Poisson) level spacing distribution; the completely chaotic one -- with Wigner distribution. The most interesting case is the co-existence of the regular and chaotic motion domains in the phase space of the system under consideration. The assumption of independent generation of two level sequencies by one chaotic domain and by all regular domains leads to Berry--Robnik distribution. However, the presence of the chaotic motion domain in the phase space affects the levels produced by the regular domains via the so-called chaos-assisted tunneling (CAT) that leads to Podolskiy--Narimanov distribution of the level spacings. This distribution needs the mean amplitude of the tunnel transition and the relative contribution of the regular domains to the mean level density as the parameters. Using their estimations for the transverse motion of the high energy positrons channeling near [100] direction in the silicon crystal we found that Podolskiy--Narimanov distribution demonstrates the best agreement with the level spacing distribution.</description>

      <title>A finite geometry, inertia assisted coarsening-to-complexity transition in homogeneous frictional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of statistical complexity in frictional systems, manifested in broad distributions of various observables, is not yet understood. We study this problem in velocity-driven, homogeneous (no quenched disorder) unstable frictional systems of height $H$. The latter are described at the continuum scale within a realistic rate-and-state friction interfacial constitutive framework, where elasto-frictional instabilities emerge from rate-weakening friction. For large $H$, such frictional systems were recently shown to undergo continuous coarsening until settling into a spatially periodic traveling solution. We show that when the system's height-to-length ratio becomes small, coarsening is less effective and the periodic solution is dynamically avoided. Instead, and consistently with previous reports, the system settles into a stochastic, statistically stationary state. The latter features slip bursts, classified into predominantly non-propagating small bursts and propagating large bursts, which are non-trivially distributed. The statistical distributions emerge from dynamically self-generated heterogeneity, where both the non-equilibrium history of the interface and wave reflections from finite boundaries, mediated by material inertia, play central roles. Specifically, the dynamics and statistics of large bursts reveal a timescale $\sim\!H/c_{\rm s}$, where $c_{\rm s}$ is the shear wave-speed. We discuss the robustness of our findings against variations of the frictional parameters, most notably affecting the magnitude of frictional rate-weakening, as well as against different interfacial state evolution laws. Finally, we demonstrate a reverse transition in which statistical complexity disappears in favor of the spatially periodic traveling solution. Overall, our results elucidate how relatively simple physical ingredients can give rise to the emergence of slip complexity.</description>

      <title>Attractor Memory for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting: A Chaos Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks, an increasing number of models have acknowledged that discrete time series originate from continuous dynamic systems and have attempted to model their dynamical structures. Recognizing the chaotic nature of real-world data, our model, \textbf{\textit{Attraos}}, incorporates chaos theory into LTSF, perceiving real-world time series as observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamic systems. Under the concept of attractor invariance, Attraos utilizes non-parametric Phase Space Reconstruction embedding and the proposed multi-scale dynamic memory unit to memorize historical dynamics structure and predicts by a frequency-enhanced local evolution strategy. Detailed theoretical analysis and abundant empirical evidence consistently show that Attraos outperforms various LTSF methods on mainstream LTSF datasets and chaotic datasets with only one-twelfth of the parameters compared to PatchTST.</description>
