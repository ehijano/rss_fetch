      <title>Mesquite MoCap: Democratizing Real-Time Motion Capture with Affordable, Bodyworn IoT Sensors and WebXR SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion capture remains costly and complex to deploy, limiting use outside specialized laboratories. We present Mesquite, an open-source, low-cost inertial motion-capture system that combines a body-worn network of 15 IMU sensor nodes with a hip-worn Android smartphone for position tracking. A low-power wireless link streams quaternion orientations to a central USB dongle and a browser-based application for real-time visualization and recording. Built on modern web technologies -- WebGL for rendering, WebXR for SLAM, WebSerial and WebSockets for device and network I/O, and Progressive Web Apps for packaging -- the system runs cross-platform entirely in the browser. In benchmarks against a commercial optical system, Mesquite achieves mean joint-angle error of 2-5 degrees while operating at approximately 5% of the cost. The system sustains 30 frames per second with end-to-end latency under 15ms and a packet delivery rate of at least 99.7% in standard indoor environments. By leveraging IoT principles, edge processing, and a web-native stack, Mesquite lowers the barrier to motion capture for applications in entertainment, biomechanics, healthcare monitoring, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality. We release hardware designs, firmware, and software under an open-source license (GNU GPL).</description>

      <title>Multi Agents Semantic Emotion Aligned Music to Image Generation with Music Derived Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When people listen to music, they often experience rich visual imagery. We aim to externalize this inner imagery by generating images conditioned on music. We propose MESA MIG, a multi agent semantic and emotion aligned framework that first produces structured music captions and then refines them with cooperating agents specializing in scene, motion, style, color, and composition. In parallel, a Valence Arousal regression head predicts continuous affective states from music, while a CLIP based visual VA head estimates emotions from images. These components jointly enforce semantic and emotional alignment between music and synthesized images. Experiments on curated music image pairs show that MESA MIG outperforms caption only and single agent baselines in aesthetic quality, semantic consistency, and VA alignment, and achieves competitive emotion regression performance compared with state of the art music and image emotion models.</description>

      <title>Towards Signboard-Oriented Visual Question Answering: ViSignVQA Dataset, Method and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding signboard text in natural scenes is essential for real-world applications of Visual Question Answering (VQA), yet remains underexplored, particularly in low-resource languages. We introduce ViSignVQA, the first large-scale Vietnamese dataset designed for signboard-oriented VQA, which comprises 10,762 images and 25,573 question-answer pairs. The dataset captures the diverse linguistic, cultural, and visual characteristics of Vietnamese signboards, including bilingual text, informal phrasing, and visual elements such as color and layout. To benchmark this task, we adapted state-of-the-art VQA models (e.g., BLIP-2, LaTr, PreSTU, and SaL) by integrating a Vietnamese OCR model (SwinTextSpotter) and a Vietnamese pretrained language model (ViT5). The experimental results highlight the significant role of the OCR-enhanced context, with F1-score improvements of up to 209% when the OCR text is appended to questions. Additionally, we propose a multi-agent VQA framework combining perception and reasoning agents with GPT-4, achieving 75.98% accuracy via majority voting. Our study presents the first large-scale multimodal dataset for Vietnamese signboard understanding. This underscores the importance of domain-specific resources in enhancing text-based VQA for low-resource languages. ViSignVQA serves as a benchmark capturing real-world scene text characteristics and supporting the development and evaluation of OCR-integrated VQA models in Vietnamese.</description>

      <title>SemCovert: Secure and Covert Video Transmission via Deep Semantic-Level Hiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video semantic communication, praised for its transmission efficiency, still faces critical challenges related to privacy leakage. Traditional security techniques like steganography and encryption are challenging to apply since they are not inherently robust against semantic-level transformations and abstractions. Moreover, the temporal continuity of video enables framewise statistical modeling over extended periods, which increases the risk of exposing distributional anomalies and reconstructing hidden content. To address these challenges, we propose SemCovert, a deep semantic-level hiding framework for secure and covert video transmission. SemCovert introduces a pair of co-designed models, namely the semantic hiding model and the secret semantic extractor, which are seamlessly integrated into the semantic communication pipeline. This design enables authorized receivers to reliably recover hidden information, while keeping it imperceptible to regular users. To further improve resistance to analysis, we introduce a randomized semantic hiding strategy, which breaks the determinism of embedding and introduces unpredictable distribution patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that SemCovert effectively mitigates potential eavesdropping and detection risks while reliably concealing secret videos during transmission. Meanwhile, video quality suffers only minor degradation, preserving transmission fidelity. These results confirm SemCovert's effectiveness in enabling secure and covert transmission without compromising semantic communication performance.</description>

      <title>Federated Multi-Task Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral clustering has emerged as one of the most effective clustering algorithms due to its superior performance. However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.</description>

      <title>Bridging Your Imagination with Audio-Video Generation via a Unified Director</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing AI-driven video creation systems typically treat script drafting and key-shot design as two disjoint tasks: the former relies on large language models, while the latter depends on image generation models. We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images.</description>

      <title>RealX3D: A Physically-Degraded 3D Benchmark for Multi-view Visual Restoration and Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce RealX3D, a real-capture benchmark for multi-view visual restoration and 3D reconstruction under diverse physical degradations. RealX3D groups corruptions into four families, including illumination, scattering, occlusion, and blurring, and captures each at multiple severity levels using a unified acquisition protocol that yields pixel-aligned LQ/GT views. Each scene includes high-resolution capture, RAW images, and dense laser scans, from which we derive world-scale meshes and metric depth. Benchmarking a broad range of optimization-based and feed-forward methods shows substantial degradation in reconstruction quality under physical corruptions, underscoring the fragility of current multi-view pipelines in real-world challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Plasticity-Aware Mixture of Experts for Learning Under QoE Shifts in Adaptive Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive video streaming systems are designed to optimize Quality of Experience (QoE) and, in turn, enhance user satisfaction. However, differences in user profiles and video content lead to different weights for QoE factors, resulting in user-specific QoE functions and, thus, varying optimization objectives. This variability poses significant challenges for neural networks, as they often struggle to generalize under evolving targets - a phenomenon known as plasticity loss that prevents conventional models from adapting effectively to changing optimization objectives. To address this limitation, we propose the Plasticity-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE), a novel learning framework that dynamically modulates network plasticity by balancing memory retention with selective forgetting. In particular, PA-MoE leverages noise injection to promote the selective forgetting of outdated knowledge, thereby endowing neural networks with enhanced adaptive capabilities. In addition, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of PA-MoE by deriving a regret bound that quantifies its learning performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that PA-MoE achieves a 45.5% improvement in QoE over competitive baselines in dynamic streaming environments. Further analysis reveals that the model effectively mitigates plasticity loss by optimizing neuron utilization. Finally, a parameter sensitivity study is performed by injecting varying levels of noise, and the results align closely with our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Error Analyses of Auto-Regressive Video Diffusion Models: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auto-Regressive Video Diffusion Models (AR-VDMs) have shown strong capabilities in generating long, photorealistic videos, but suffer from two key limitations: (i) history forgetting, where the model loses track of previously generated content, and (ii) temporal degradation, where frame quality deteriorates over time. Yet a rigorous theoretical analysis of these phenomena is lacking, and existing empirical understanding remains insufficiently grounded. In this paper, we introduce Meta-ARVDM, a unified analytical framework that studies both errors through the shared autoregressive structure of AR-VDMs. We show that history forgetting is characterized by the conditional mutual information between the generated output and preceding frames, conditioned on inputs, and prove that incorporating more past frames monotonically alleviates history forgetting, thereby theoretically justifying a common belief in existing works. Moreover, our theory reveals that standard metrics fail to capture this effect, motivating a new evaluation protocol based on a ``needle-in-a-haystack'' task in closed-ended environments (DMLab and Minecraft). We further show that temporal degradation can be quantified by the cumulative sum of per-step errors, enabling prediction of degradation for different schedulers without video rollout. Finally, our evaluation uncovers a strong empirical correlation between history forgetting and temporal degradation, a connection not previously reported.</description>

      <title>ClassWise-CRF: Category-Specific Fusion for Enhanced Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a result-level category-specific fusion architecture called ClassWise-CRF. This architecture employs a two-stage process: first, it selects expert networks that perform well in specific categories from a pool of candidate networks using a greedy algorithm; second, it integrates the segmentation predictions of these selected networks by adaptively weighting their contributions based on their segmentation performance in each category. Inspired by Conditional Random Field (CRF), the ClassWise-CRF architecture treats the segmentation predictions from multiple networks as confidence vector fields. It leverages segmentation metrics (such as Intersection over Union) from the validation set as priors and employs an exponential weighting strategy to fuse the category-specific confidence scores predicted by each network. This fusion method dynamically adjusts the weights of each network for different categories, achieving category-specific optimization. Building on this, the architecture further optimizes the fused results using unary and pairwise potentials in CRF to ensure spatial consistency and boundary accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of ClassWise-CRF, we conducted experiments on two remote sensing datasets, LoveDA and Vaihingen, using eight classic and advanced semantic segmentation networks. The results show that the ClassWise-CRF architecture significantly improves segmentation performance: on the LoveDA dataset, the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric increased by 1.00% on the validation set and by 0.68% on the test set; on the Vaihingen dataset, the mIoU improved by 0.87% on the validation set and by 0.91% on the test set. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the ClassWise-CRF architecture in semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.

      <title>D-FCGS: Feedforward Compression of Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Free-Viewpoint Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free-Viewpoint Video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient compression of dynamic 3D representation remains a major challenge. Existing dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting methods couple reconstruction with optimization-dependent compression and customized motion formats, limiting generalization and standardization. To address this, we propose D-FCGS, a novel Feedforward Compression framework for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting. Key innovations include: (1) a standardized Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P coding, leveraging sparse control points to extract inter-frame motion tensors; (2) a dual prior-aware entropy model that fuses hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate estimation; (3) a control-point-guided motion compensation mechanism and refinement network to enhance view-consistent fidelity. Trained on Gaussian frames derived from multi-view videos, D-FCGS generalizes across diverse scenes in a zero-shot fashion. Experiments show that it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods, achieving over 17 times compression compared to the baseline while preserving visual quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression of dynamic 3DGS, facilitating scalable FVV transmission and storage for immersive applications.</description>

      <title>SonicMaster: Towards Controllable All-in-One Music Restoration and Mastering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music recordings often suffer from audio quality issues such as excessive reverberation, distortion, clipping, tonal imbalances, and a narrowed stereo image, especially when created in non-professional settings without specialized equipment or expertise. These problems are typically corrected using separate specialized tools and manual adjustments. In this paper, we introduce SonicMaster, the first unified generative model for music restoration and mastering that addresses a broad spectrum of audio artifacts with text-based control. SonicMaster is conditioned on natural language instructions to apply targeted enhancements, or can operate in an automatic mode for general restoration. To train this model, we construct the SonicMaster dataset, a large dataset of paired degraded and high-quality tracks by simulating common degradation types with nineteen degradation functions belonging to five enhancements groups: equalization, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, and stereo. Our approach leverages a flow-matching generative training paradigm to learn an audio transformation that maps degraded inputs to their cleaned, mastered versions guided by text prompts. Objective audio quality metrics demonstrate that SonicMaster significantly improves sound quality across all artifact categories. Furthermore, subjective listening tests confirm that listeners prefer SonicMaster's enhanced outputs over other baselines.</description>

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance. However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical multimodal research.</description>
