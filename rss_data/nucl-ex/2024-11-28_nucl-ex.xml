      <title>On formation of the $^{12}$C(0$^+_2$) and $^{12}$C(3$^-$) states in relativistic dissociation of light nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of the excited states $^{12}$C(0$^+_2$) and $^{12}$C(3$^-$) is investigated in the dissociation of $^{12}$C $\to$ 3$\alpha$ and $^{16}$O $\to$ 4$\alpha$ at the energy of 3.65 GeV per nucleon in the nuclear emulsion. The identification becomes possible by reconstructing the invariant mass from measurements of emission angles in the approximation of conservation of momentum per nucleon of the parent nucleus. The contribution of the decays $^{12}$C(0$^+_2$) and $^{12}$C(3$^-$) to the dissociation $^{12}$C $\to$ 3$\alpha$ is 11 and 19%, and in $^{16}$O $\to$ 4$\alpha$ it is - 20 and 30%, correspondingly.</description>

      <title>Chiral effective theory of scalar and vector diquarks revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory of light diquarks is revisited. We construct an effective Lagrangian based on the linear representation of three-flavor chiral symmetry. Here, we focus on the effect of a chiral and $U(1)_A$ symmetric term originated from an eight-point quark interaction. From this model, we obtain the mass formulas of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial vector diquarks, which also describe the dependence of diquark masses on the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the $U(1)_A$ anomaly. We regard singly heavy baryons as two-body systems composed of one heavy quark and one diquark and then predict the fate of the mass spectrum and the strong decay widths under chiral symmetry restoration.</description>

      <title>"Nuclear thermometers" reveal the origin of the universal r-process nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resembling behaviour of giant dipole resonances built on ground and excited states supports the validity of the Brink-Axel hypothesis and assigns giant dipole resonances as spectroscopic probes -- or ``nuclear thermometers'' -- to explore the cooling of the kilonova ejecta in neutron-star mergers down to the production of heavy elements beyond iron through the rapid-neutron capture or r-process. In previous work, we found a slight energy increase in the giant dipole resonance built on excited states at the typical temperatures of $1.0\gtrapprox T\gtrapprox0.7$ MeV where seed nuclei are produced, before ongoing neutron capture. Crucial data are presented here supporting an enhanced symmetry energy at $T=0.51$ MeV (or $5.9\times 10^9$ K) -- where the r-process occurs -- that lowers the binding energy in the Bethe-Weizs\"acker semi-empirical mass formula and results in the close in of the neutron drip line. Ergo, providing an origin to the universality of elemental abundances by limiting the reaction network for r-process nucleosynthesis. An enhanced symmetry energy away from the ground state is further supported by shell-model calculations of the nuclear electric dipole ({\sc E1}) polarizability -- inversely proportional to the symmetry energy -- as a result of the destructive contribution of the products of off-diagonal {\sc E1} matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of the light collection stability of a PEN-based wavelength shifting reflector in a tonne scale liquid argon detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid argon detectors rely on wavelength shifters for efficient detection of scintillation light. The current standard is tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB), but it is challenging to instrument on a large scale. Poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalate) (PEN), a polyester easily manufactured as thin sheets, could simplify the coverage of large surfaces with wavelength shifters. Previous measurements have shown that commercial grades of PEN have approximately 50% light conversion efficiency relative to TPB. Encouraged by these results, we conducted a large-scale measurement using $4~m^2$ combined PEN and specular reflector foils in a two-tonne liquid argon dewar to assess its stability over approximately two weeks. This test is crucial for validating PEN as a viable substitute for TPB. The setup used for the measurement of the stability of PEN as a wavelength shifter is described, together with the first results, showing no evidence of performance deterioration over a period of 12 days.</description>

      <title>Production of exotic hadrons in $pp$ and nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exotic hadrons beyond the conventional quark model have been discovered in the past two decades. Investigations of these states can lead to deep understanding of nonperturbative dynamics of the strong interaction. In this concise review, we focus on the productions of exotic hadrons in $pp$, $p\bar p$, and nuclear collisions. Experimental observations of light nuclei and hypernuclei, as prototypes of hadronic molecules, in heavy ion collisions will also be briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>High density symmetry energy: A key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is extended to include the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions by assuming the similar density, momentum, and isospin dependence as for the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The parameters in these interactions are determined from either experimental information if any or chiral effective field theory or lattice QCD calculations of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter around nuclear saturation density $\rho_0$. We find that varying the high density behavior of the symmetry energy $E_{\rm sym}(\rho)$ can significantly change the critical density for hyperon appearance in the neutron stars and thus the maximum mass $M_{\rm TOV}$ of static hyperon stars. In particular, a symmetry energy which is soft around $2-3\rho_0$ but stiff above about $4\rho_0$, can lead to $M_{\rm TOV} \gtrsim 2M_\odot$ for hyperon stars and simultaneously be compatible with (1) the constraints on the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter at suprasaturation densities obtained from flow data in heavy-ion collisions; (2) the microscopic calculations of the equation of state for pure neutron matter; (3) the star tidal deformability extracted from gravitational wave signal GW170817; (4) the mass-radius relations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715 measured from NICER; (5) the observation of the unusually low mass and small radius in the central compact object of HESS J1731-347. Furthermore, the sound speed squared of the hyperon star matter naturally displays a strong peak structure around baryon density of $3-4\rho_0$, consistent with the model-independent analysis on the multimessenger data. Our results suggest that the high density symmetry energy could be a key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle in neutron star physics.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Hoyle State Radiative Transition Width</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiative decay of the Hoyle state is the doorway to the production of heavier elements in stellar environment. Here we report, an exclusive measurement of electric quadruple (E$_2$) transitions of the Hoyle state to the ground state of $^{12}$C through the $^{12}$C(p, p$^\prime$$\gamma$$\gamma$)$^{12}$C reaction. Triple coincidence measurement yields a value of radiative branching ratio $\Gamma_{rad}$/$\Gamma$ = 4.01 (30) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$. The result has been corroborated by an independent experiment based on the complete kinematical measurement $via.$ $^{12}$C(p, p$^\prime$)$^{12}$C reaction ($\Gamma_{rad}$/$\Gamma$ = 4.04 (30) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$). Using our results together with the currently adopted values of $\Gamma_{\pi}$(E$_0$)/$\Gamma$ and $\Gamma_{\pi}$($E_0$), the radiative width of the Hoyle state is found to be 3.75 (40) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ eV. We emphasize here that our result is not in agreement with 34 $\%$ increase in the radiative decay width of the Hoyle state measured recently but consistent with the currently adopted value.</description>

      <title>Solar fusion III: New data and theory for hydrogen-burning stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, like our sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. The relevant reactions of solar and stellar hydrogen burning are reviewed here, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical S-factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed, as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, also general recommendations are formed.</description>

      <title>Activation of momentum fluctuations in wave packet molecular dynamics: Impacts on momentum distributions of projectilelike fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics approaches use wave packets as nucleon wave functions to simulate the time evolution of nuclear reactions. It is crucial to activate the momentum fluctuation inherent in each wave packet so that it properly affects the time evolution. In the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) model, this has traditionally been done by splitting the wave packets, i.e., by introducing a random fluctuation to the wave packet center of each particle. The present work proposes an improved approach to activate the fluctuation in both the one-body mean-field propagation and the two-nucleon collision processes, consistently based on the gradual or sudden change of the degree of isolation, which is derived from the fragment number function used for the zero-point energy subtraction. This new method is applied to the 12C + 12C and 12C + p reactions at about 100 MeV/nucleon, focusing on the momentum distribution of the 11B fragments produced by one-proton removal from the 12C projectile. The results show that, with the momentum fluctuation suitably activated, the method correctly accounts for the recoil from the removed nucleon to the residue and the 11B momentum distribution is significantly improved, while without activating the fluctuation the distribution is too narrow compared to the experimental data. Furthermore, the AMD results indicate that the momentum distribution consists of two components; one is the high $P_z$ component with a small shift from the beam velocity, resulting from the simple removal of a proton after an energetic collision with a target particle; the other is the low $P_z$ component with a larger peak shift resulting from the decay of an excited 12C nucleus in a longer time scale. The activation of momentum fluctuation mainly affects the high $P_z$ component to broaden it. The role of cluster correlations in this problem is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Towards a parameter-free determination of critical exponents and chiral phase transition temperature in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to quantify the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we make use of an improved, renormalized order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking which is obtained as a suitable difference of the $2$-flavor light quark chiral condensate and its corresponding light quark susceptibility. Having no additive ultraviolet as well as multiplicative logarithmic divergences, we use ratios of this order parameter constructed from its values for two different light quark masses. We show that this facilitates determining in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $\delta$ which, for sufficiently small values of the light quark masses, controls the quark mass dependence of the order parameter at $T_c$. We present first results of these calculations from our numerical analysis performed with staggered fermions on $N_\tau=8$ lattices.</description>
