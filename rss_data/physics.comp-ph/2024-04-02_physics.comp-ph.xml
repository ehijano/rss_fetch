      <title>Predicting the statistical error of analog particle tracing Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large particle systems are often described by high-dimensional (linear) kinetic equations that are simulated using Monte Carlo methods for which the asymptotic convergence rate is independent of the dimensionality. Even though the asymptotic convergence rate is known, predicting the actual value of the statistical error remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we show how the statistical error of an analog particle tracing Monte Carlo method can be calculated (expensive) and predicted a priori (cheap) when estimating quantities of interest (QoI) on a histogram. We consider two types of QoI estimators: point estimators for which each particle provides one independent contribution to the QoI estimates, and analog estimators for which each particle provides multiple correlated contributions to the QoI estimates. The developed statistical error predictors can be applied to other QoI estimators and nonanalog simulation routines as well. The error analysis is based on interpreting the number of particle visits to a histogram bin as the result of a (correlated) binomial experiment. The resulting expressions can be used to optimize (non)analog particle tracing Monte Carlo methods and hybrid simulation methods involving a Monte Carlo component, as well as to select an optimal particle tracing Monte Carlo method from several available options. Additionally, the cheap statistical error predictors can be used to determine a priori the number of particles N that is needed to reach a desired accuracy. We illustrate the theory using a linear kinetic equation describing neutral particles in the plasma edge of a fusion device and show numerical results. The code used to perform the numerical experiments is openly available.</description>

      <title>Grappa -- A Machine Learned Molecular Mechanics Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating large molecular systems over long timescales requires force fields that are both accurate and efficient. In recent years, E(3) equivariant neural networks have lifted the tension between computational efficiency and accuracy of force fields, but they are still several orders of magnitude more expensive than classical molecular mechanics (MM) force fields.
  Here, we propose a novel machine learning architecture to predict MM parameters from the molecular graph, employing a graph attentional neural network and a transformer with symmetry-preserving positional encoding. The resulting force field, Grappa, outperforms established and other machine-learned MM force fields in terms of accuracy at the same computational efficiency and can be used in existing Molecular Dynamics (MD) engines like GROMACS and OpenMM. It predicts energies and forces of small molecules, peptides, RNA and - showcasing its extensibility to uncharted regions of chemical space - radicals at state-of-the-art MM accuracy. We demonstrate Grappa's transferability to macromolecules in MD simulations, during which large protein are kept stable and small proteins can fold. Our force field sets the stage for biomolecular simulations close to chemical accuracy, but with the same computational cost as established protein force fields.</description>

      <title>A spiking-domain implementation of electronic structure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic Structure Theory (EST) describes the behavior of electrons in matter and is used to predict material properties. Conventionally, this involves forming a Hamiltonian and solving the Schr\"odinger equation through discrete computation. Here, a new perspective to EST is provided by treating a perfectly crystalline material as a Linear Translation Invariant (LTI) system. The validity of this LTI-EST formalism is demonstrated by determining band structures for a one-dimensional chain of atoms, including the phenomenon of band structure folding in super cells. The proposed formalism allows for analytical traceability of band structure folding and offers computational advantage by bypassing the O(N) eigenvalue calculations. The spike-based computing nature of the proposed LTI-EST formalism is highlighted; thereby implying potential for material simulations solely in the spiking domain.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of local environments in molecular crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying local structural motifs and packing patterns of molecular solids is a challenging task for both simulation and experiment. We demonstrate two novel approaches to characterize local environments in different polymorphs of molecular crystals using learning models that employ either flexibly learned or handcrafted molecular representations. In the first case, we follow our earlier work on graph learning in molecular crystals, deploying an atomistic graph convolutional network, combined with molecule-wise aggregation, to enable per-molecule environmental classification. For the second model, we develop a new set of descriptors based on symmetry functions combined with a point-vector representation of the molecules, encoding information about the positions as well as relative orientations of the molecule. We demonstrate very high classification accuracy for both approaches on urea and nicotinamide crystal polymorphs, and practical applications to the analysis of dynamical trajectory data for nanocrystals and solid-solid interfaces. Both architectures are applicable to a wide range of molecules and diverse topologies, providing an essential step in the exploration of complex condensed matter phenomena.</description>

      <title>Representation of fields in inhomogeneous structured waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present the results of a study of the possibility of using a homogeneous basis and a new generalization of coupled modes theory to describe non-periodic structured waveguides. It was shown that for the studied inhomogeneities the single wave approximation gives good results. Within the framework of single wave approximation, the fields are represented as the sum of two components, one of which is associated with the forward eigen wave, and the second with the backward eigen wave. But this second component is not a backward wave. Because of the coupling, characteristics of this component are determined by the first component, which is significantly larger than the second.</description>

      <title>Revealing Symmetry-broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A coherent theory for both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that the electron charge densities of Al, YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO), and LaH10 along with Pb and Nb3Sn share the same feature of electron charge gains in their respective superconducting configurations (SCCs) predicted by first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT). It is discovered that the formation of SCCs is due to the local symmetry breaking from their normal conducting configurations (NCCs), and the electron charge gains in SCCs form electron tunnels in crystals that resemble pontoons, thus termed as electron pontoon tunnel (EPT) here. The nuclei promoting the formation of EPTs in conventional superconductors have strong bonding with other nuclei, resulting in their EPTs easily destroyed and thus low superconducting critical temperature (Tc), while in unconventional superconductor, this bonding is very weak as shown by negative stretching force constants in YBCO, thus resulting in much higher Tc. The fundamental understanding of SCCs and the capability to predict them by DFT enable theoretical search of room temperature superconductors without empirical models.</description>

      <title>An atomic-scale perspective on individual thiol-terminated molecules anchored to single S vacancies in MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sulphur vacancies in MoS$_2$ on Au(111) have been shown to be negatively charged as reflected by a Kondo resonance. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy to show that these vacancies serve as anchoring sites for thiol-based molecules (CF$_3$-3P-SH) with two distinct reaction products, one of them showing a Kondo resonance. Based on comparisons with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, including a random structure search and computation of energies and electronic properties at a hybrid exchange-correlation functional level, we conclude that both anchored molecules are charge neutral. One of them is an anchored intact CF$_3$-3P-SH molecule while the other one is the result of catalytically activated dehydrogenation to CF$_3$-3P-S with subsequent anchoring. Our investigations highlight a perspective of functionalizing defects with thiol-terminated molecules that can be equipped with additional functional groups, such as charge donor- or acceptor-moieties, switching units or magnetic centers.</description>

      <title>Gappy AE: A Nonlinear Approach for Gappy Data Reconstruction using Auto-Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel data reconstruction algorithm known as Gappy auto-encoder (Gappy AE) to address the limitations associated with Gappy proper orthogonal decomposition (Gappy POD), a widely used method for data reconstruction when dealing with sparse measurements or missing data. Gappy POD has inherent constraints in accurately representing solutions characterized by slowly decaying Kolmogorov N-widths, primarily due to its reliance on linear subspaces for data prediction. In contrast, Gappy AE leverages the power of nonlinear manifold representations to address data reconstruction challenges of conventional Gappy POD. It excels at real-time state prediction in scenarios where only sparsely measured data is available, filling in the gaps effectively. This capability makes Gappy AE particularly valuable, such as for digital twin and image correction applications. To demonstrate the superior data reconstruction performance of Gappy AE with sparse measurements, we provide several numerical examples, including scenarios like 2D diffusion, 2D radial advection, and 2D wave equation problems. Additionally, we assess the impact of four distinct sampling algorithms - discrete empirical interpolation method, the S-OPT algorithm, Latin hypercube sampling, and uniformly distributed sampling - on data reconstruction accuracy. Our findings conclusively show that Gappy AE outperforms Gappy POD in data reconstruction when sparse measurements are given.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the frequency space: Discretization schemes for the dynamic-matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic matrix method addresses the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation in the frequency domain by transforming it into an eigenproblem. Subsequent numerical solutions are derived from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamic matrix. In this work we explore discretization methods needed to obtain a matrix representation of the dynamic operator, a fundamental counterpart of the dynamic matrix. Our approach opens a new set of linear algebra tools for the dynamic matrix method and expose the approximations and limitations intrinsic to it. Moreover, our discretization algorithms can be applied to various discretization schemes, extending beyond micromagnetism problems. We present some application examples, including a technique to obtain the dynamic matrix directly from the magnetic free energy function of an ensemble of macrospins, and an algorithmic method to calculate numerical micromagnetic kernels, including plane wave kernels. We also show how to exploit symmetries and reduce the numerical size of micromagnetic dynamic-matrix problems by a change of basis. This procedure significantly reduces the size of the dynamic matrix by several orders of magnitude while maintaining high numerical precision. Additionally, we calculate analytical approximations for the dispersion relations in magnonic crystals. This work contributes to the understanding of the current magnetization dynamics methods, and could help the development and formulations of novel analytical and numerical methods for solving the LLG equation within the frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Far-field Boundary Conditions for Crystalline Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystalline materials exhibit long-range elastic fields due to the presence of defects, leading to significant domain size effects in atomistic simulations. A rigorous far-field expansion of these long-range fields identifies low-rank structure in the form of a sum of discrete multipole terms and continuum correctors. We propose a novel numerical scheme that exploits this low-rank structure to accelerate material defect simulations by minimizing the domain size effects. Our approach iteratively improves the boundary condition, systematically following the asymptotic expansion of the far field. We provide both rigorous error estimates for the method and a range of empirical numerical tests, to assess it's convergence and robustness.</description>

      <title>Inverse Volume Scaling of Finite-Size Error in Periodic Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled cluster theory is one of the most popular post-Hartree-Fock methods for ab initio molecular quantum chemistry. The finite-size error of the correlation energy in periodic coupled cluster calculations for three-dimensional insulating systems has been observed to satisfy the inverse volume scaling, even in the absence of any correction schemes. This is surprising, as simpler theories that utilize only a subset of the coupled cluster diagrams exhibit much slower decay of the finite-size error, which scales inversely with the length of the system. In this study, we review the current understanding of finite-size error in quantum chemistry methods for periodic systems. We introduce new tools that elucidate the mechanisms behind this phenomenon in the context of coupled cluster doubles calculations. This reconciles some seemingly paradoxical statements related to finite-size scaling. Our findings also show that singularity subtraction can be a powerful method to effectively reduce finite-size errors in practical quantum chemistry calculations for periodic systems.</description>

      <title>A PNP ion channel deep learning solver with local neural network and finite element input data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a deep learning method for solving an improved one-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck ion channel (PNPic) model, called the PNPic deep learning solver, is presented. In particular, it combines a novel local neural network scheme with an effective PNPic finite element solver. Since the input data of the neural network scheme only involves a small local patch of coarse grid solutions, which the finite element solver can quickly produce, the PNPic deep learning solver can be trained much faster than any corresponding conventional global neural network solvers. After properly trained, it can output a predicted PNPic solution in a much higher degree of accuracy than the low cost coarse grid solutions and can reflect different perturbation cases on the parameters, ion channel subregions, and interface and boundary values, etc. Consequently, the PNPic deep learning solver can generate a numerical solution with high accuracy for a family of PNPic models. As an initial study, two types of numerical tests were done by perturbing one and two parameters of the PNPic model, respectively, as well as the tests done by using a few perturbed interface positions of the model as training samples. These tests demonstrate that the PNPic deep learning solver can generate highly accurate PNPic numerical solutions.</description>
