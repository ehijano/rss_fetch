      <title>Neutrino Oscillations as a Probe of Macrorealism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlations between successive measurements of a quantum system can violate a family of Leggett-Garg Inequalities (LGIs) that are analogous to the violation of Bell's inequalities of measurements performed on spatially separated quantum systems. These LGIs follow from a macrorealistic point of view, imposing that a classical system is at all times in a definite state and that a measurement can, at least in principle, leave this state undisturbed. Violations of LGIs can be probed by neutrino flavour oscillations if the correlators of consecutive flavour measurements are approximately stationary. We discuss here several improvements of the methodology used in previous analyses based on accelerator and reactor neutrino data. We argue that the strong claims of LGI violations made in previous studies are based on an unsuitable modelling of macrorealistic systems in statistical hypothesis tests. We illustrate our improved methodology via the example of the MINOS muon-neutrino survival data, where we find revised statistical evidence for violations of LGIs at the $(2-3)\sigma$ level, depending on macrorealistic background models.</description>

      <title>Identified Hadron Production in Deeply Inelastic Neutrino-Nucleon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of identified hadrons in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) is sensitive to parton distribution functions and hadron fragmentation functions. Neutrino-induced SIDIS processes probe combinations of these functions different from their charged-lepton-induced counterparts. We compute charged pion production in (anti-)neutrino induced SIDIS up to second order in perturbative QCD and compare our predictions to precise legacy fixed-target data. We demonstrate the high sensitivity of these data on the parametrization of the fragmentation functions and discuss future SIDIS probes at the LHC Forward Physics Facility.</description>

      <title>Logarithmically-accurate and positive-definite NLO shower matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present methods to achieve NLL+NLO accurate parton showering for processes with two coloured legs: neutral- and charged-current Drell-Yan, and Higgs production in $pp$ collisions, as well as DIS and $e^+e^-$ to jets. The methods include adaptations of existing approaches, as well as a new NLO matching scheme, ESME, that is positive-definite by construction. Our implementations of the methods within the PanScales framework yield highly competitive NLO event generation speeds. We validate the fixed-order and combined resummation accuracy with tests in the limit of small QCD coupling and briefly touch on phenomenological comparisons to standard NLO results and to Drell-Yan data. The progress reported here is an essential step towards showers with logarithmic accuracy beyond NLL for processes with incoming hadrons.</description>

      <title>Neutrino properties from muonium-antimuonium mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of neutrino mass -- whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles -- remains one of the central open questions in particle physics. While observation of neutrinoless double beta decay would confirm the Majorana case, the absence of a signal offers no definitive insight. In light of this, we investigate muonium-antimuonium mixing -- proposed for further study at the MACE experiment -- as an alternative probe of neutrino properties. We compute the mixing amplitude in the Standard Model minimally extended to include massive Dirac or Majorana neutrinos, and correct previous calculations by properly treating the relevant infrared scales. As the GIM mechanism strongly suppresses the Dirac contribution, we explore whether relaxing unitarity of the PMNS matrix can enhance the mixing without obscuring neutrino properties. Surprisingly, the answer to this question is negative. We also examine the pseudo-Dirac case -- predominantly Dirac neutrinos with small Majorana masses -- and find that this scenario can significantly enhance the mixing compared to the pure Dirac case, especially for normal mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Audible Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the audible axion mechanism, axion-like particles source primordial gravitational waves via their coupling to a dark Abelian gauge field. The original setup, however, relies on a large axion decay constant and coupling to produce sizable signals. In this article, we show that delaying the onset of axion oscillations opens up the testable parameter space and reduces the required coupling to $\alpha \gtrsim 1$. Furthermore, we investigate the emission of gravitational waves via the axion coupling to the Standard Model photon in the presence of Schwinger pair production, generating a strong signal in the $\mu$Hz or ultra-high frequency range. Cosmological constraints and gravitational wave projections are provided for both scenarios.</description>

      <title>Primordial Stochastic Gravitational Waves from Massive Higher-Spin Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can a stationary stone radiate gravitational waves (GWs)? While the answer is typically "no" in flat spacetime, we get a "yes" in inflationary spacetime. In this work, we study the stationary-stone-produced GWs in inflation with a concrete model, where the role of stones is played by massive higher-spin particles. We study particles of spin-2 and higher produced by helical chemical potentials, and show that the induced GWs feature a scale-invariant and helicity-biased power spectrum in the slow-roll limit. Including slow-roll corrections leads to interesting backreactions from the higher-spin boson production, resulting in an intriguing scale-dependence of GWs at small scales. Given the existing observational and theoretical constraints, we identify viable parameter regions capable of generating visibly large GWs for future observations.</description>

      <title>Dark photons from dineutron decays in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we focus on the process where two neutrons are allowed to transit into two dark photons ($nn \rightarrow VV$) via new Higgs-like scalar bosons. This process violates baryon number by two units ($|\Delta \mathcal{B}| = 2$). Since neutron stars contain a large number of neutrons, the $nn \rightarrow VV$ process can be greatly enhanced inside a neutron star. This process could result in non-trivial effects that are different from previous studies and can be explored through astrophysical and laboratory observations. Furthermore, a large number of dark photons, which may be dark matter candidates, can be emitted from the interior of the neutron star. The energy spectrum of the emitted dark photons show a particular pattern that can be uniquely determined by the mass and radius of the neutron star. The joint analysis, which combines astrophysics and particle phenomenology, could provide an excellent opportunity for the study of the new physical effects beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Photon self-interaction through gravitons and axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to employ the concept of photon self-interaction for axion detection. In particular, we derive the interaction Hamiltonian for photons via axions in a ring cavity. We show that when the incoming photons are considered in plane-wave basis, the interaction vanishes. However, when the realistic case of photon wavepackets are assumed, a self-interaction whose strength is proportional to the size of the wavepacket and the cavity length exists. Under specific conditions, we find that the axion-mediated interaction dominates the gravitationally induced self-interaction. We discuss the implications of this setup for axion detection, focusing on the range of axion mass, $10^{-10}~\text{eV}&lt;m_a&lt;10^{-4}~\text{eV}$ for which the best accuracy of coupling constants is constrained in some cases to $g_{a\gamma \gamma}&gt; 9 \times 10^{-12}~ \text{GeV}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Vector-like tops from first generation quarks: the role of width and coupling chiralities in same-charge production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tension the scope of the $q\bar q, gg\to T \bar T$ production process against that of the same-charge $uu\to TT$ one in searching for Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) with electromagnetic charge $+2/3$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The study is conducted by considering a simplified model in which such new states couple exclusively to Standard Model quarks of the first generation through $W^\pm, Z$ and $H$ currents. We consider both left-handed or right-handed dominant chiralities, representative of $SU(2)_L$ singlets or doublets, and the total widths are allowed to reach large values relatively to the VLQ masses. By deconstructing the signal into all its components, we assess current and projected constraints, emphasize the role of interference terms and isolate peculiar features which can be used for dedicated searches at the LHC or future colliders.</description>

      <title>Hyperons and $\Delta$'s in Rotating Protoneutron Stars I: global properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation plays an important role in the evolution of most types of stars, in particular, it can have a strong influence on the evolution of a newly born proto-neutron star. In this study, we investigate the effects of rotation on four snapshots of the evolution of proto-neutron stars with hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances in their cores, from birth as neutrino-rich objects to maturity as cold, catalyzed neutron stars. We focus on the effects of uniform rotation on the macroscopic structure of the star at three rotational frequencies -- 346.53 Hz, 716 Hz, and the Kepler frequency. Our investigation indicates that the impact of rotation at frequencies of $346.53$~Hz and $716$~Hz causes minor changes in the maximum gravitational mass but leads to significant changes in the stellar radius, particularly for stars with masses smaller than $2$~\msun. However, we observe drastic changes in the star's mass and radius when considering the Kepler frequency. In addition, we investigate other relevant characteristics of the rotating proto-neutron stars as they evolve such as the moment of inertia, compactness, central temperature, and Kerr parameter. Our results suggest that the inclusion of new degrees of freedom in the stellar core lead the star to be more sensitive to rotational dynamics, owing to an increase in compactness, a decrease in the central temperature, and a decrease in the moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Exploring exclusive decay $B^+\to \omega\ell^+\nu$ within LCSR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{ub}|$ by the semileptonic decay $B^+\to \omega\ell^+\nu$. For the transition form factors (TFFs) $A_1(q^2)$, $A_2(q^2)$ and $V(q^2)$ of $B^+\to \omega$, we employ the QCD light-cone sum rules method for calculation, and by constructing the correlation function using left-handed chiral current, we make the $\delta^1$-order twist-2 LCDA $\phi^\| _{2;\omega}(x,\mu)$ dominate the contribution. In which the twist-2 LCDA $\phi^\| _{2;\omega}(x,\mu)$ is constructed by light-cone harmonic oscillator model. Then, we obtain $A_1(0)=0.209^{+0.049}_{-0.042}$, $A_2(0)=0.206^{+0.051}_{-0.042}$ and $V(0)=0.258^{+0.058}_{-0.048}$ at large recoil region. Two important ratios of TFFs are $r_V=1.234_{-0.322}^{+0.425}$ and $r_2=0.985_{-0.274}^{+0.347}$. After extrapolating TFFs to the whole physical $q^2$-region by simplified $z(q^2,t)$-series expansion, we obtain the differential decay width and branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(B^+\to \omega\ell^+\nu)=(1.35^{+1.24}_{-0.69})\times 10^{-4}$, which show good agreement with BaBar and Belle Collaborations. Finally, we extract the $|V_{ub}|$ by using the $\mathcal{B}(B^+\to \omega\ell^+\nu)$ result from BaBar Collaboration, which leads to $|V_{ub}|=(3.66^{+1.38}_{-1.12})\times 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Mass spectrum of S-wave mesons in the relativistic independent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The confining strength or model parameters and constituent quark masses are reparametrized for predicting the ground state meson masses. We analyzed these from the hyperfine splitting of $S$-wave heavy-flavored, heavy-light and light (except non-strange) mesons in the framework of a relativistic independent quark (RIQ) model with one gluon exchange and centre-of-mass correction. These mesons with spin parity $J^P=0^-$ and $1^-$, the masses obtained are in accordance with the experimental physical masses. The results will serve as good complementary tools in further study of hadron dynamics and will behave as a foundation for the higher excited and exotic states of hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: That chiral symmetry is a crucial feature of the strong force was realized before the discovery of Quantum Chromodynamics. However, the full power it exerts on the structure of the nucleon became apparent only afterwards. We present a high-level and somewhat personal overview of its role in almost every aspect of proton structure, from its mass and spin to the asymmetry of its antimatter content and its strange quark content. The lessons learned from studying the proton are also vital with respect to the modern challenge of the nature of baryon excited states.</description>

      <title>Higgs alignment limits in the type-II 2HDM and the MSSM with explicit CP-violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the general two-Higgs doublet model with Yukawa sector of type II (type II 2HDM), the Higgs alignment limit conditions are obtained for the neutral Higgs bosons with indefinite CP-parity $h_1, h_2$ or $h_3$, based on the symbolic results relating the elements of the mixing matrix to the masses of the Higgs bosons and the mixing angles. The results are valid up to dimension-six operators in the decomposition of the effective Higgs potential. Within the framework of the obtained Higgs alignment conditions, the possibility of the existence of light scalars is discussed. Within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) framework, four benchmark scenarios are proposed. It is shown that two of them predict phenomenologically distinguishable CP-violating interactions of the Higgs boson $h_3$ with up-fermions.</description>

      <title>Proper constituent gluon mass as the final piece to construct hybrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After treating hybrid as a three-body system, we recalculate the spectra and decay widths of the $1^{-+}$ light hybrids via the Gauss Expansion Method (GEM). Our result shows that, after adding into only one more parameter $m_g$=450 MeV, i.e., the constituent gluon mass, we can reproduce nearly all the results in our previous work by just using the model parameters from meson spectra calculation, which shows the unification of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). As a result, $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ may not be explained as $1^{-+}$ hybrids simultaneously, and the $\eta_1(1855)$ observed by BESIII may not be a hybrid. In addition, we predict an existence of a hybrid $\eta_1(1640)$, which can be verified by searching the $a_1(1260)\pi$ channel. Furthermore, to search for an isospin-0 and an isospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hybrid, the golden channels may be $K_1(1270)\bar{K}$ and $K_1(1270)\pi$, respectively.</description>

      <title>A high-resolution imaging of the collinear substructure of the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate Standard Model predictions of proton-proton collisions are essential for interpreting the current and forthcoming experimental measurements from high-energy colliders. The quest for physics beyond the Standard Model is in fact strongly related to a reliable determination of systematic uncertainties, among which the theoretical ones have nowadays become a significant component. In particular, an important role is played by the universal Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs). This thesis presents a collection of studies aimed at improving the accuracy and precision of collinear PDF determinations. By employing the NNPDF methodology, we present recent polarized and unpolarized PDF fits including higher order QCD corrections and theoretical uncertainties. Additionally, we examine the presence of non-vanishing intrinsic charm and its phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>Scalar-assisted magnetogenesis during the radiation-dominated epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism to generate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) strong enough to explain the observed cosmic magnetic fields. We employ a scalar field charged under U(1) gauge symmetry with a non-trivial VEV to provide an effective mass term to the EM field and thus break its conformal invariance. The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation dominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase. As a result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-production of electric fields due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon isocurvature problem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB phase. In addition, we find that a significant amount of PMFs can be generated when the scalar field experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar field is light and weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to the cold dark matter, hence the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction problem are also absent. Therefore, our model is free from the above-mentioned problems that frequently appear in other primordial magneto-genesis scenarios.</description>

      <title>Leptophilic ALPs in Laboratory Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collider phenomenology of leptophilic axion-like particles (ALPs), i.e. pseudoscalar particles that couple only to charged leptons. Loops of charged leptons induce effective interactions of the ALPs with photons, which depend on the momenta of the interacting particles and differ between pseudoscalar and derivative lepton couplings. We systematically discuss the form of the interaction with photons for general external momenta and identify the regimes when it can be safely approximated by an effective coupling constant. We use these results to derive novel constraints from LEP and calculate state-of-the-art limits from E137 and NA64 for four different scenarios, in which the ALPs couple either to a single lepton generation or universally to all, for both pseudoscalar and derivative lepton couplings. We collect complementary bounds from astrophysics, flavour, and other laboratory experiments to chart the allowed parameter space of leptophilic ALPs in the MeV-GeV mass range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk I review various notions of generalised global symmetry: higher-form, higher-group, and non-invertible symmetry. All these notions have had profound impact on quantum field theory research in the last decade. I highlight various applications of these new symmetries in particle physics, focussing on theories beyond the Standard Model. Areas touched upon include axions, gauge unification, dark matter, neutrino masses, and flavour hierarchies.</description>

      <title>The Higgs trilinear coupling in the SMEFT at the HL-LHC and the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the updated HL-LHC projections for Higgs pair production from ATLAS and CMS and by the release of the FCC-ee Feasibility Study, we critically revisit the sensitivity of the global SMEFT analysis to deformations of the Higgs self-coupling modifier $\kappa_3$. To this end, we quantify the impact of SMEFT operators modifying double Higgs production at the LHC and single Higgs production, including loop corrections, at the FCC-ee, and include Renormalisation Group Evolution throughout. We demonstrate that significantly improving on the legacy HL-LHC constraints on $\kappa_3$ at the FCC-ee is not possible without the $\sqrt{s}=365$ GeV run; that individual and marginalised determinations are similar at the HL-LHC while differing by up to a factor 3 at the FCC-ee; and that quadratic EFT corrections cannot be neglected. Overall, the combination of HL-LHC and FCC-ee data offers unique potential to pin down the Higgs self-coupling with $\sim$$15\%$ precision.</description>

      <title>Consistency Relation for Fixed Point Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We gain insight on the fixed point dynamics of $d$ dimensional quantum field theories by exploiting the critical behavior of the $d-\epsilon$ sister theories. To this end we first derive a self-consistent relation between the $d-\epsilon$ scaling exponents and the associated $d$ dimensional beta functions. We then demonstrate that to account for an interacting fixed point in the original theory the related $d-\epsilon$ scaling exponent must be multi-valued in $\epsilon$. We elucidate our findings by discussing several examples such as the QCD Banks-Zaks infrared fixed point, QCD at large number of flavors, as well as the O(N) model in four dimensions. For the latter, we show that although the $1/N$ corrections prevent the reconstruction of the renormalization group flow, this is possible when adding the $1/N^2$ contributions.</description>

Abstract: In this text different theoretical approaches towards multi-quark states are introduced, namely hadrocharmonia, compact tetraquarks and hadronic molecules. The predictions derived from either of them are contrasted with current and possible future observations. The focus is on doubly heavy systems, but singly heavy and light systems are mentioned briefly as well.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Renormalization of a Chiral $SU(2)$ Gauge Theory in Dimensional Regularization with Non-Anticommuting $\gamma_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher order calculations in chiral gauge theories such as the Electroweak Standard Model require a sound treatment of the notoriously problematic $\gamma_5$-matrix in Dimensional Regularization (DReg). In the all-order consistent BMHV scheme anticommutativity has to be sacrificed, resulting in spurious breakings of BRST invariance, the restoration of which necessitates finite, symmetry-restoring counterterms. Following recent advances in successfully applying this scheme to multi-loop calculations for Abelian models, we shall here present the first complete non-Abelian two-loop result for the case of $SU(2)$, which is of particular interest to the Standard Model. We provide the complete list of finite, two-loop symmetry restoring counterterms and discuss intricacies of the non-Abelian implementation. Except for one novel term, the finite counterterm action exhibits the same structure as at one-loop order.</description>

      <title>Doubly-charmed hexaquarks in the diquark picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate doubly-charmed hexaquark states within the diquark picture, by employing the constituent quark model and the quark-interchange model as our theoretical frameworks. Using the Gaussian expansion method, we systematically study these states, with calculating various properties such as mass spectra, internal contributions of each Hamiltonian component, root-mean-square radii, and two-body strong decay widths. Our analysis of the mass spectra reveals no stable state in this system. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radii suggest that the doubly-charmed hexaquark states exhibit a compact configuration. By examining the decay widths, we identify potentially detectable states and their primary decay channels within each subsystem. Despite the large decay phase space, we still find narrow states with total widths of less than 10 MeV. This study provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the structures and interactions of doubly-charmed hexaquark states and offers valuable insights for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquarks from lattice QCD: incorporating diquark-antidiquark operators and the left-hand cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice studies of the doubly-charm tetraquark $T_{cc}=cc\bar u\bar d$ require the determination of the $DD^*$ scattering amplitude, which most often incorporate only meson-meson interpolators. We additionally incorporate diquark-antidiquark operators and find that these have some impact on certain eigenenergies, render slightly smaller values of $p\cot \delta_0$ for $DD^*$ scattering and a $T_{cc}$ pole slightly closer to the threshold. A more significant effect of diquark-antidiquark operators on eigen-energies is found for larger heavy quark masses relevant for $T_{bb}$. The $DD^*$ scattering amplitude is extracted from eigenenergies by adopting plane-wave and effective-field-theoretic methods, which also incorporate the left-hand cut and address the partial wave mixing. The $T_{cc}$ is found to be a subthreshold resonance with a pole at $m_{T_{cc}}-m_D-m_{D^*}=-5.2^{+0.7}_{-0.8} - i \cdot 6.3^{+2.4}_{-4.8}~$MeV. Lattice simulations were performed on CLS ensembles with $m_\pi\simeq 280~$MeV using the distillation method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the recent result that the action of matter fields is conformal form-invariant in its standard form and on the active and passive approaches to conformal transformations, we review the conformal form-invariant parametrization of scalar-tensor gravity theories. We investigate whether this parametrization is actually different from other existing parametrizations. We also check the accuracy of the claim that the classical physical predictions of these theories are conformal-frame invariants.</description>

      <title>First law of de Sitter thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The de Sitter state has a special symmetry: it is homogeneous, and its curvature is constant in space. Since all the points in the de Sitter space are equivalent, this state is described by local thermodynamics. This state has the local temperature $T=H/\pi$ (which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature), the local entropy density, the local energy density, and also the local gravitational degrees of freedom -- the scalar curvature ${\cal R}$ and the effective gravitational coupling $K$. On the other hand, there is the cosmological horizon, which can be also characterized by the thermodynamic relations. We consider the connections between the local thermodynamics and the thermodynamics of the cosmological horizon. In particular, there is the holographic connection between the entropy density integrated over the Hubble volume and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the horizon, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=A/4G$. We also consider the first law of thermodynamics in these two approaches. In the local thermodynamics, on the one hand, the first law is valid for an arbitrary volume $V$ of de Sitter space. On the other hand, the first law is also applicable to the thermodynamics of the horizon. In both cases, the temperature is the same. This consideration is extended to the contracting de Sitter with its negative entropy, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=-A/4G$.</description>

      <title>Effects of strange molecular partners of $P_c$ states in $\gamma p \to K \Sigma$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our previous studies revealed evidence of the strange molecular partners of $P_c$ states, $N(2080)3/2^-$ and $N(2270)3/2^-$, in the $\gamma p \to K^{*+} \Sigma^0 / K^{*0} \Sigma^+$ and $\gamma p \to \phi p$ reactions. Motivated by the differential cross-section data for $\gamma p \to K^+ \Sigma^0$ from CLAS 2010, which exhibits some bump structures at $W \approx$ 1875, 2080 and 2270 MeV, we extend our previous analysis by investigating the effects of $N(1535)1/2^-$, $N(1875)3/2^-$, $N(2080)1/2^- \&amp;\ 3/2^-$ and $N(2270)1/2^- , 3/2^- \&amp;\ 5/2^-$, as strange partners of $P_c$ molecular states, in the reactions $\gamma p \to K^+ \Sigma^0$ and $\gamma p \to K^0 \Sigma^+$. The theoretical model employed in this study utilizes an effective Lagrangian approach in the tree-level Born approximation. It contains the contributions from $s$-channel with exchanges of $N$, $\Delta$, $N^*$ (including the hadronic molecules with hidden strangeness), and $\Delta^*$; $t$-channel; $u$-channel; and the generalized contact term. The results corresponding to the final fitted parameters are in good agreement with all available experimental data of both cross-sections and polarization observables for $\gamma p \to K^+ \Sigma^0$ and $\gamma p \to K^0 \Sigma^+$. Notably, the $s$-channel exchanges of molecules significantly contribute to the bump structures in cross-sections for $\gamma p \to K \Sigma$ at $W \approx$ 1900, 2080 and 2270 MeV, and show considerable coherence with contributions from $s$-channel exchanges of general resonances to construct the overall structures of cross-sections. More abundant experiments, particularly for the reaction $\gamma p \to K^0 \Sigma^+$, are necessary to further strengthen the constraints on the theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Has ACT measured radiative corrections to the tree-level Higgs-like inflation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starobinsky inflation and non-minimally coupled Higgs inflation have been among the most favored models of the early universe, as their predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ fall comfortably within the constraints set by Planck and BICEP/Keck. However, new results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) suggest a preference for higher values of $n_s$, introducing tension with the simplest realizations of these models. In this work, being agnostic about the nature of the inflaton, we show that incorporating one-loop corrections to a Higgs-like inflationary scenario leads to a shift in the predicted value of $n_s$, which brings Higgs-like inflation into better agreement with ACT observations. Remarkably, we find that this can be achieved with non-minimal couplings $\xi &lt; 1$, in contrast to the large values typically required in conventional Higgs inflation, thereby pushing any unitarity-violation scale above the Planck scale. The effect is even more significant when the model is formulated in the Palatini approach, where the modified field-space structure naturally enhances deviations from the metric case. These findings highlight the importance of quantum corrections and gravitational degrees of freedom in refining inflationary predictions in light of new data.</description>

      <title>Inclusive semileptonic decays of the $D_s$ meson: A first-principles lattice QCD calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a first-principles theoretical study of the inclusive semileptonic decays of the $D_s$ meson. We performed a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation using the gauge ensembles produced by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) with dynamical light, strange and charm quarks with physical masses and employed the so-called Hansen-Lupo-Tantalo (HLT) method to extract the decay rate and the first two lepton-energy moments from the relevant Euclidean correlators. We have carefully taken into account all sources of systematic errors, including the ones associated with the continuum and infinite-volume extrapolations and with the HLT spectral reconstruction method. We obtained results in very good agreement with the currently available experimental determinations and with a total accuracy at the few-percent level, of the same order of magnitude of the experimental error. Our total error is dominated by the lattice QCD simulations statistical uncertainties and is certainly improvable. From the results presented and thoroughly discussed in this paper we conclude that it is nowadays possible to study heavy mesons inclusive semileptonic decays on the lattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy. The phenomenological implications of our physical results are the subject of a companion letter [1].</description>

      <title>Inclusive semileptonic decays of the $D_{s}$ meson: Lattice QCD confronts experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a first-principles theoretical study of the inclusive semileptonic decays of the $D_{s}$ meson. We performed a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation by taking into account all sources of systematic errors. A detailed discussion of our lattice calculation, demonstrating that inclusive semileptonic decays can nowadays be studied on the lattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy, is the subject of a companion paper [1]. Here we focus on the phenomenological implications of our results. Using the current best estimates of the relevant Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, our theoretical predictions for the decay rate and for the first two lepton-energy moments are in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. We also argue that, while the inclusive $D_{s}$ channel is not yet competitive with the exclusive channels in the $|V_{cs}|$ determination, the situation can be significantly improved in the near future.</description>

      <title>Greedy Emulators for Nuclear Two-Body Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applications of reduced basis method emulators are increasing in low-energy nuclear physics because they enable fast and accurate sampling of high-fidelity calculations, enabling robust uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we develop, implement, and test two model-driven emulators based on (Petrov-)Galerkin projection using the prototypical test case of two-body scattering with the Minnesota potential and a more realistic local chiral potential. The high-fidelity scattering equations are solved with the matrix Numerov method, a reformulation of the popular Numerov recurrence relation for solving special second-order differential equations as a linear system of coupled equations. A novel error estimator based on reduced-space residuals is applied to an active learning approach (a greedy algorithm) to choosing training samples ("snapshots") for the emulator and contrasted with a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach. Both approaches allow for computationally efficient offline-online decompositions, but the greedy approach requires much fewer snapshot calculations. These developments set the groundwork for emulating scattering observables based on chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions and optical models, where computational speed-ups are necessary for Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our emulators and error estimators are widely applicable to linear systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Tails of Gravitational Waves in Schwarzschild Black Hole Ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schwarzschild black holes evolve toward their static configuration by emitting gravitational waves, which decay over time following a power law at fixed spatial positions. We derive this power law analytically for the second-order even gravitational perturbations, demonstrating that it is determined by the fact that the second-order source decays as the inverse square of the distance. Quadratic gravitational modes with multipole $\ell$ decay according to a law $\sim t^{-2\ell-1}$, in contrast to the linear Price law scaling $\sim t^{-2\ell-3}$. Consequently, nonlinear tails may persist longer than their linear counterparts.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group in far-from-equilibrium states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study renormalization group flows in far-from-equilibrium states. The study is made tractable by focusing on states that are spatially homogeneous, time-independent, and scale-invariant. Such states, in which mode $k$ has occupation numbers $n_k \sim k^{-\gamma}$, are well known in nonlinear physics. RG flow in such states is qualitatively different from that in the vacuum -- a positive $\gamma$ decreases the dimension of an operator, turning marginal interactions into relevant interactions. We compute one-loop beta functions. Depending on the sign of the beta function, backreaction may either cause a minor shift of the state in the IR, or completely change the nature of the state. Focusing on nearly marginal interactions, we construct an analog of the epsilon expansion and IR fixed points, with epsilon now set by the scaling of the interaction rather than the spacetime dimension. In the language of RG flow, critical-balance scaling -- which has applications in fields as varied as astrophysics and ocean waves -- corresponds to the state dynamically adjusting itself along the RG flow until the interaction becomes marginal.</description>

      <title>Status of QCD precision predictions for Drell-Yan rapidity distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute differential distributions for Drell-Yan processes at the LHC and the Tevatron colliders at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD, including fiducial cuts on the decay leptons in the final state. The comparison of predictions obtained with four different codes shows excellent agreement, once linear power corrections from the fiducial cuts are included in those codes that rely on phase-space slicing subtraction schemes. For Z-boson production we perform a detailed study of the symmetric cuts on the transverse momenta of the decay leptons. Predictions at fixed order in perturbative QCD for those symmetric cuts, typically imposed in experiments, suffer from an instability. We show how this can be remedied by an all-order resummation of the fiducial transverse momentum spectrum, and we comment on the choice of cuts for future experimental analyses.</description>

      <title>Processes $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \phi_i\phi_j$ in Inert Higgs Doublet Models and Two Higgs Doublet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a phenomenological analysis of one-loop induced processes $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \phi_i\phi_j$, where the CP-even Higgs bosons are denoted as $\phi_{i,j} \equiv h,~H$, in high-energy photon-photon collisions, within the frameworks of the Inert Higgs Doublet Model and the Two Higgs Doublet Model. The total cross sections are evaluated as functions of the center-of-mass energy, finding that the cross sections for the considered processes in all the models under investigation are significantly enhanced around the threshold for charged Higgs boson pair production ($\sim 2 M_{H^\pm}$). Furthermore, the enhancement factors, defined as the ratios of cross sections of $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \phi_i\phi_j$ in the investigated models to those for $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow hh$ in the Standard Model, are examined in the relevant regions of the model's parameter space. In the Inert Higgs Doublet Model, the factors are studied in the parameter space of $(M_{H^\pm},~\mu^2_2)$ and $(M_{H^\pm},~\lambda_2)$. In the Two Higgs Doublet Model, the factors are examined in the planes defined by $(M_{H^\pm},~t_{\beta})$ as well as in the space of the charged Higgs mass $M_{H^\pm}$ and the soft-breaking $Z_2$ parameter $m_{12}^2$. Two scenarios characterized by $c_{\beta-\alpha} &gt; 0$ and $c_{\beta-\alpha} &lt; 0$ are studied in further detail. The factors exhibit distinct behaviors between these two scenarios. As a result, it is possible to discriminate between them at future colliders. The dependence of the cross section for the process $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow hH$ on $m_{12}^2$ provides a potential probe of the soft $Z_2$-breaking scale in the Two Higgs Doublet Model.</description>

      <title>Dimming Starlight with Dark Compact Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a new technique to search for dark compact objects. When dark matter comprising a dark compact object interacts with photons, the compact object can disperse light traveling though it. As these objects pass between Earth and a distant star, they act as "lampshades" that dim the star. We examine how dimming effects from clumps of dark matter in the Galaxy could be searched for in microlensing surveys, which measure the brightness of stars as a function of time. Using the EROS-2 and OGLE surveys, we show that a dimming analysis of existing data can be used to constrain dark sectors, and could be used to discover dark matter in compact objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next goalpost in precision calculations for physics beyond the Standard Model is determining the two-loop renormalization group (RG) equations in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We progress towards this goal by determining the RG equations for a simplified version of the SMEFT without any fermion fields. Our calculation relies on functional methods that are newly developed for multi-loop computations and adapted for the determination of RG equations here.</description>

Abstract: We conduct an investigation on the spin $\frac{3}{2}\rightarrow \frac{1}{2}$ semileptonic weak transition of single heavy baryons for the exclusive decay $\Sigma_{b}^{*0}\,\rightarrow\, \Sigma_{c}^{+}\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ in three possible lepton channels within the three point QCD sum rule method. We compute the responsible form factors of this semileptonic decay by incorporating both perturbative and nonperturbative contributions of the operator product expansion series up to a mass dimension six. Having acquired the form factors, the decay widths of the processes in all lepton channels are determined. Our findings as well as possible future experimental information can be employed in order to check the SM predictions and explore the possibility of new physics in heavy baryonic decay channels.</description>

      <title>Confined but chirally and chiral spin symmetric hot matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate properties of the quark--antiquark mesons at zero and finite temperature in the framework of a solvable chirally symmetric quark model with linear confining potential. The interquark interaction in the model is reminiscent of that derived in Coulomb gauge QCD, with the string tension being the only model parameter. We demonstrate that while the confining interaction induces spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, chiral symmetry gets restored at a temperature Tch ~ 90 MeV for the string tension fixed to provide the phenomenological value of the quark condensate. This temperature is similar to Tch ~ 130 MeV observed on the lattice in the chiral limit for N_c=3. The physical mechanism responsible for the chiral symmetry restoration in the confining regime is Pauli blocking of the quark levels, required for the existence of a nonvanishing quark condensate, by the thermal excitations of the quarks and antiquarks. Thus, above the chiral restoration temperature, the meson-like states are chirally symmetric and approximately chiral spin symmetric. A crucial property of the confined meson-like light-light states above Tch is their size that exceeds drastically that in the chirally broken phase below Tch, in contrast to the heavy-heavy mesons that nearly preserve their size irrespective of the temperature. This property is a result of Pauli blocking of the quark and antiquark levels with small momenta. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radius of the states with J=0,1 diverges in the chiral limit. This unexpected property must be a key to understanding unusual features of the hot QCD matter as observed at RHIC and LHC. Consequently, the confining but chirally symmetric matter above Tch can be considered as a dense system of very large and strongly overlapping meson-like states (``strings'').</description>

      <title>Probing Type-I 2HDM light Higgs in the top-pair-associated diphoton channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the potential of the Type-I Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM-I) to account for the 95 GeV diphoton excess observed at the LHC, under current theoretical and experimental constraints. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are performed for the process $pp \to t(\to W^+ b)\, \bar{t}(\to W^- \bar{b})\, h(\to \gamma\gamma)$ to evaluate the discovery potential of a 95 GeV Higgs boson at future colliders. The analysis shows that direct Higgs search data impose strong constraints on the model parameter $\alpha$, excluding parameter space with $\alpha \lesssim 0.95$. The diphoton excess observed by CMS and ATLAS can be explained by samples with $\sin(\beta-\alpha)\approx-0.2$ or $\sin(\beta-\alpha)\approx0.35$. According to the MC results, a statistical significance of $2\sigma$ can be reached at the HL-LHC with an integrated luminosity of $L = 764\ \mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, while achieving $5\sigma$ significance at the HL-LHC is not feasible. At the HE-LHC, $2\sigma$ and $5\ \sigma$ significance levels require integrated luminosities of at least $L = 390\ \mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ and $L = 2.4\ \mathrm{ab}^{-1}$, respectively. The same levels of significance can be achieved at the FCC-hh with significantly lower luminosities: $L = 36 \mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ for $2\sigma$ and $L = 227\ \mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ for $5\sigma$. Parameter points with $\sin(\beta-\alpha)\approx0$ remain difficult to probe in diphoton channel, even with further increases in collider energy and luminosity.</description>

      <title>$P$-wave charmonium contribution to hidden-charm states from reanalysis of lattice QCD data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reanalyze, considering the contribution of $P$-wave charmonia, lattice data for the $D \bar{D}$-$D_s\bar{D}_s$ coupled-channel of S. Prelovsek et al. [JHEP 06, 035 (2021)] and $D\bar{D}^*$ systems of S. Prelovsek et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 192001 (2013)] with $m_{\pi}\simeq 280$ and $266$ MeV, and $L=24a/32a$ ($a\simeq 0.09$ fm) and $L=16a$ ($a\simeq0.1239(13)$ fm), respectively. The hidden-charm states with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{++}$, and $2^{++}$ quantum numbers are then searched for. For $0^{++}$, the analysis reveals three poles in the $D\bar{D}$-$D_s\bar{D}_s$ coupled-channel amplitude, corresponding to three states. Two of these poles, located near the $D\bar{D}$ and $D_s\bar{D}_s$ thresholds, can be interpreted as mostly molecular states. A third pole above the $D_s\bar{D}_s$ threshold is originated from the $P$-wave $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ charmonium state. The number of poles found in the $D\bar D$-$D_s \bar D_s$ system is the same as that found in the original lattice analysis though the position of the third pole changes sizeably. In the $1^{++}$ sector, we find two poles in the complex energy plane. The first one is related to the molecular $X(3872)$ state, with a compositeness exceeding $90\%$, while the second one, stemming from the $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ charmonium, appears above the $D\bar{D}^*$ threshold and it likely corresponds to the recently discovered $\chi_{c1}(4010)$ state. In the $2^{++}$ sector, we also report two poles and find that the dressed $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ is lighter than the $D^*\bar{D}^*$ molecular state, with the dynamics of the latter closely related to that of the heavy-quark spin-symmetry partner of the $X(3872)$. Our exploratory study of the $1^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ sectors offers valuable insights into their dynamics, but given that the fits that we carry out are underconstrained, more lattice data are required to draw robust conclusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the discrepancies observed in the $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ neutral current decays, we study the decay channel $B_c\to D_s^{(\ast)} \,\ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell=\mu,\tau$), which is based on the same flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) transition at the quark level. The current study shows that this decay channel can provide a useful probe for physics beyond the standard model. We use the helicity formalism while employing the effective theory approach where we include the effects of vector and axial vector `new' physics (NP) operators. In this study, we have computed the branching ratio $\mathcal{B}_r$, the $D^\ast$ helicity fraction $f_L$, the lepton forward-backward asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{FB}$, and the lepton flavor universality ratio (LFU) $R^{\tau\mu}_{D_s^*}$. In addition, as a complementary check on the LFU, we also calculate the various other LFU observables, $R_{i}^{\tau\mu}$ where $i=A_{FB}$, $f_L$. We assume that the NP universal coupling is present for both muons and tauons, while the non-universal coupling is only present for muons. Regarding these couplings, we employ the latest global fit to the $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ data, which is recently computed in arXiv:2304.07330. We give predictions of some of the mentioned observables within the SM and the various NP scenarios. We have found that not only are the considered observables sensitive to NP but are also helpful in distinguishing among the different NP scenarios. These results can be tested at the LHCb, HL-LHC, and FCC-ee, and therefore, a precise measurements of these observables not only deepens our understanding of the $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ process but also provides a window of opportunity to possibly study various NP scenarios.</description>

      <title>Masquerading hybrid stars with dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of dark matter on hybrid stars. Using a two-fluid approach, where normal and dark matter components interact only gravitationally, we explore how dark matter can trigger the appearance of quark matter in neutron stars for unprecedented low masses. Our findings reveal that dark matter increases the central pressure of neutron stars, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid stars with quark cores even at very low compact star masses. The critical mass for the appearance of quark matter decreases with increasing dark matter content. We introduce the concept of "masquerading hybrid stars", where dark matter admixed stars exhibit similar mass-radius relations to purely hadronic stars, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on these parameters. Additionally, we identify a unique class of objects termed "dark oysters", characterized by a large dark matter halo and a small normal matter core, highlighting the diverse structural possibilities for compact stars influenced by dark matter.</description>

      <title>Probing Standard Model and Beyond with Reactor CE$\nu$NS Data of CONUS+ experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential of reactor antineutrino-induced Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) data from the CONUS+ experiment to investigate both the Standard Model (SM) and Beyond Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. Alongside CE$\nu$NS, Elastic Neutrino-Electron Scattering (E$\nu$ES) events are also included in our analysis, enabling more stringent constraints on new physics. Within the SM, we examine the weak mixing angle as a precision test of the electroweak sector. For BSM scenarios, we constrain the parameter space of light mediators arising from neutrino generalized interactions (NGI), while also setting limits on the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, including their charge radius, millicharge, and magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Ball Lightning as a profound manifestation of the Dark Matter physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ball lighting (BL) has been observed for centuries. There are large number of books, review articles, and original scientific papers devoted to different aspects of BL phenomenon. Yet, the basic features of this phenomenon have never been explained by known physics. The main problem is the source which could power the dynamics of the BL. We advocate an idea that the dark matter (DM) in form of the axion quark nuggets (AQN) made of standard model quarks and gluons (similar to the old idea of the Witten's strangelets) could internally generate the required power. The AQN model was invented long ago without any relation to the BL physics. It was invented with a single motivation to explain the observed similarity $\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ between visible and DM components. This relation represents a very generic feature of this framework, not sensitive to any parameters of the construction. However, with the same set of parameters being fixed long ago this model is capable to address the key elements of the BL phenomenology, including the source of the energy powering the BL events.
  In particular, we argue that the visible size of BL, its typical life time, the frequency of appearance, etc are all consistent with suggested proposal when BL represents a profound manifestation of the DM physics represented by the AQN objects. We also argue that some of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) might be closely related to BL events, and therefore also represent profound manifestations of the DM physics within AQN framework. We also formulate a number of specific possible tests which can refute or unambiguously substantiate this unorthodox proposal on nature of BL and UAP.</description>

      <title>Mono-lepton Signature of a Neutrino-philic Dark Fermion at Hadron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searching for dark matter at high-energy colliders and direct detection experiments can effectively cover nearly the entire mass range from the MeV to the TeV scale. In this paper, we focus on four-fermion contact interactions formulated within the framework of Effective Field Theory. Specifically, we present a detailed analysis of mono-lepton production at the LHC. Our results demonstrate that tensor operators exhibit superior sensitivity in the mono-lepton channel, constraining energy scales up to 3\,TeV for a nearly massless dark fermion using current LHC data. Moreover, these operators mediate both spin-independent and spin-dependent absorption processes in nuclear targets. A systematic comparison of constraints between direct detection experiments and collider measurements reveals the LHC's distinct advantage in exploring sub-GeV dark matter candidates while maintaining competitive sensitivity at the TeV scale. Notably, direct detection experiments such as Super-Kamiokande and Borexino achieve complementary constraints in the 10-100\,TeV mass range through their unique capabilities: utilization of light nuclei targets, large exposure volumes, and distinctive features of the recoil energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Isotropic cosmic birefringence from string axion domain walls without cosmic strings, and DESI results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 have shown a preference for isotropic cosmic birefringence, consistent with previous analyses based on Planck and WMAP data. Separately, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 results suggest that dark energy evolves over cosmic history, pointing to new physics in the late-time universe. In this paper, we propose that domain walls associated with the string axion can naturally explain the isotropic cosmic birefringence, focusing on the case in which the axion starts near a hilltop. Interestingly, to avoid the domain wall problem, these walls must form well after recombination. The predicted rotation angle, $\beta \approx 0.21\,c_\gamma$ degrees (with anomaly coefficient $c_\gamma \approx 1$), is in excellent agreement with observations. This scenario can be further tested by probing anisotropic birefringence of photons emitted long after recombination, as well as gravitational waves. Moreover, starting the axion oscillation from a hilltop naturally enhances its abundance via anharmonic effects, thus contributing to the dark energy component. We discuss how this hilltop axion scenario may connect with the DESI results.</description>

      <title>Large CP violation in $\Lambda^0_b \to pK^-\pi^+\pi^-$ and its U-spin partner decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LHCb Collaboration has recently found a large CP-violating rate asymmetry in the $b$-baryon decay $\Lambda^0_b \to pK^-\pi^+\pi^-$. This is the first observation of CP violation in baryon processes, opening a new window to test its standard model origin. Many more baryon decays are expected to exhibit observable signals of CP violation. We show that there also exists large CP violation in the U-spin partner decay mode, $\Xi^0_b \to \Sigma^+\pi^- K^+K^-$, with rate asymmetry $$A_{CP}(\Xi^0_b \to \Sigma^+\pi^- K^+ K^-) = - A_{CP}(\Lambda^0_b \to p K^- \pi^+ \pi^-)~ \frac{Br(\Lambda^0_b \to p K^- \pi^+ \pi^-)}{Br(\Xi^0_b \to \Sigma^+ \pi^- K^+ K^-)}~ \frac{\tau^{\Xi_b}}{\tau^{\Lambda_b}} $$ in the U-spin symmetry limit. By neglecting a subleading contribution in the amplitudes, we obtain $$A_{CP}(\Lambda^0_b \to p \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^-) = A_{CP}( \Xi^0_b \to \Sigma^+\pi^- K^+ K^-) = -(12 \pm 3 ) \%. $$ These predictions provide crucial tests for the standard model.</description>

Abstract: We present and discuss the release of novel sets of collinear, variable-flavor-number-scheme fragmentation functions for axial-vector, fully heavy $T_{4c}(1^{+-})$ and $T_{4b}(1^{+-})$ tetraquarks. Working within the single-parton approximation at leading power and employing nonrelativistic QCD factorization adapted for tetraquark Fock states, we model the initial-scale fragmentation input using a recent calculation for the constituent heavy-quark channel. Standard DGLAP evolution is then applied, ensuring consistent implementation of evolution thresholds. To support phenomenology, we investigate NLL/NLO$^+$ rates for tetraquark-jet systems at the HL-LHC and FCC from (sym)JETHAD. This study further integrates exotic matter explorations with precision QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>A New Probe of Cosmic Birefringence Using Galaxy Polarization and Shapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel statistical method to measure cosmic birefringence and demonstrate its power in probing parity violation due to axions. Exploiting an empirical correlation between the integrated radio polarization direction of a spiral galaxy and its apparent shape, we devise an unbiased minimum-variance estimator for the rotation angle, which should achieve an uncertainty of $5^\circ$--$ 15^\circ$ per galaxy. Large galaxy samples from the forthcoming SKA continuum surveys, together with optical shape catalogs, promise a comparable or even lower noise power spectrum for the rotation angle than in the CMB Stage-IV (CMB-S4) experiment, with different systematics.</description>

      <title>Impacts of dark energy on weighing neutrinos after DESI BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, DESI has released baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, and DES has also published its five-year supernova (SN) data. These observations, combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, support a dynamically evolving dark energy at a high confidence level. When using cosmological observations to weigh neutrinos, the results of weighing neutrinos will be significantly affected by the measurement of dark energy due to the degeneracy between neutrino mass and the dark-energy equation of state. Therefore, we need to understand how the dynamical evolution of dark energy in the current situation will affect the measurement of neutrino mass. In this work, we utilize these latest observations and other additional distance measurements to discuss the mutual influence between neutrinos and dark energy, then calculate the Bayes factor to compare models. We consider three neutrino mass hierarchies including degenerate hierarchy (DH), normal hierarchy (NH), and inverted hierarchy (IH), as well as three dark energy models including $\Lambda \rm CDM$, $w\rm CDM$, and $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ models. Cosmological data combined with the prior of particle physics experiments can provide strong to decisive evidence favoring the $w_0w_a {\rm CDM}+\sum m_\nu$ model with NH. In the $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ model, using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we obtain constraints on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.171\ \rm eV,\ 0.204\ \rm eV,\ 0.220\ \rm eV$, for DH, NH, and IH, respectively. Furthermore, taking into account the neutrino hierarchy or incorporating additional distance measurements results in a more pronounced deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model for dark energy. The latter, particularly, exhibits a deviation at a confidence level that surpasses $4\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Probing a nonminimal coupling through superhorizon instability and secondary gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of scalar fluctuations ($\chi$) non-minimally coupled to gravity, $\xi\chi^2 R$, as a potential source of secondary gravitational waves (SGWs). Our study reveals that when reheating EoS $\wre &lt; 1/3$ and $\xi \lesssim 1/6$ or $\wre &gt; 1/3$ and $\xi \gtrsim 1/6$, the super-horizon modes of scalar field experience a \textit{Tachyonic instability} during the reheating phase. Such instability causes a substantial growth in the scalar field amplitude leading to pronounced production of SGWs in the low and intermediate-frequency ranges that are strong enough to be detected by Planck and future gravitational wave detectors. Such growth in super-horizon modes of the scalar field and associated GW production may have a significant effect on the strength of the tensor fluctuation at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales (parametrized by $r$) and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (parametrized by $\dneff$) at the time of CMB decoupling. To prevent such overproduction, the PLANCK constraints on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \leq 0.036$ and $\dneff \leq 0.284$ yield a strong lower bound on $\xi$ for $\wre &lt; 1/3$, and upper bound on the value of $\xi$ for $\wre &gt; 1/3$. Taking into account all the observational constraints we found the value of $\xi$ should be $ \gtrsim 0.02$ for $\wre =0$, and $\lesssim 4.0$ for $\wre \geq 1/2$ for a wide range of reheating temperature within $10^{-2} \lesssim \Tre \lesssim 10^{14}$ GeV, and for a wide range of inflationary energy scales. Further, as one approaches $\wre$ towards $1/3$, the value of $\xi$ remains unconstrained. Finally, we identify the parameter regions in $(\Tre,\xi)$ plane which can be probed by the upcoming GW experiments namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark energy and modified gravity from the BOSS Full-Shape and DESI BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain dark energy and modified gravity within the effective field theory of dark energy framework using the full-shape BOSS galaxy power spectrum, combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and recent baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from DESI. Specifically, we focus on a varying braiding parameter $\alpha_{\rm B}$, a running of the ``effective'' Planck mass $\alpha_{\rm M}$, and a constant dark energy equation of state $w$. The analysis is performed with two of these parameters at a time, including all the other standard cosmological parameters and marginalizing over bias and nuisance parameters. The full-shape galaxy power spectrum is modeled using the effective field theory of large-scale structure up to 1-loop order in perturbation theory. We find that the CMB data is most sensitive to $\alpha_{\rm B}$, and that adding large-scale structure information only slightly changes the parameter constraints. However, the large-scale structure data significantly improve the bounds on $\alpha_{\rm M}$ and $w$ by a factor of two. This improvement is driven by background information contained in the BAO, which breaks the degeneracy with $H_0$ in the CMB. We confirm this by comparing the BOSS full-shape information with BOSS BAO, finding no significant differences. This is likely to change with future high-precision full-shape data from Euclid and DESI however, to which the pipeline developed here is immediately applicable.</description>

      <title>Scattering of Quantum Particles in de Sitter Spacetime I: The Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes in maximally symmetric de Sitter spacetime with compact spatial dimensions. We describe quantum states by using the representation theory of de Sitter symmetry group and link the Hilbert space to geodesic observers. The positive and negative ``energy'' wavefunctions are uniquely determined by the requirement that in observer's neighborhood, short wavelengths propagate as plane waves with positive and negative frequencies, respectively; they define a unique ``Euclidean'' (a.k.a.\ Bunch-Davies) de Sitter invariant vacuum, common to all inertial observers. By following the same steps as in Minkowski spacetime, we show that the scattering amplitudes are given by a generalized Dyson's formula. Compared to the flat case, they describe the scattering of wavepackets with the frequency spectrum determined by geometry. The frequency spread shrinks as the masses and/or momenta become larger than the curvature scale. Asymptotically, de Sitter amplitudes agree with the amplitudes evaluated in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight bosons, proposed as candidates for dark matter (DM), are predicted by various new physics models. In the presence of bosons with suitable masses, superradiant (SR) instability can naturally transform a spinning black hole (BH) into a gravitational atom (GA). Here we study the dynamics of intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) around a GA formed by ultralight vector field saturated in its SR ground state. We employ a perturbative model at the leading Newtonian order to consistently account for both the conservative effect of cloud gravity and the dissipative effect of cloud ionization. We find the cloud can make a sizable negative contribution to the secular periastron precession at binary separations comparable to the gravitational Bohr radius. Meanwhile, the backreaction of ionization could significantly accelerate the process of orbital decay and circularization. Considering reasonably small vector boson masses, we examine the adiabatic orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms of eccentric inspirals. The results indicate that vector GAs might be detectable through observations of low-frequency IMRIs by the future space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of dense nucleon matter at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport property of cold and dense nucleon matter is important for nuclear physics but is relatively less studied than that at finite temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta&gt;0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model.</description>

      <title>S-dual Quintessence, the Swampland, and the DESI DR2 Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dark energy model in which a quintessence field $\phi$ rolls near the vicinity of a local maximum of its potential characterized by the simplest $S$ self-dual form $V(\phi) = \Lambda \ {\rm sech}(\sqrt{2} \, \phi/M_p)$, where $M_p$ is the reduced Planck mass and $\Lambda \sim 10^{-120} M_p^4$ is the cosmological constant. We confront the model with Swampland ideas and show that the $S$-dual potential is consistent with the distance conjecture, the de Sitter conjecture, and the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture. We also examine the compatibility of this phenomenological model with the intriguing DESI DR2 results and show that the shape of the $S$-dual potential is almost indistinguishable from the axion-like potential, $V (\phi) = m_a^2 \ f_a^2 \ [ 1 + \cos(\phi/f_a)]$, with $m_a$ and $f_a$ parameters fitted by the DESI Collaboration to accommodate the DR2 data. The self-dual potential has the advantage that one starts at the self-dual point and this is a theoretical motivation, because as the universe cools off the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gets broken leading to a natural rolling away from the symmetric point.</description>
