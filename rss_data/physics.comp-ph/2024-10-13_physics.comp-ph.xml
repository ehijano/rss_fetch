      <title>Embedding an ANN-Based Crystal Plasticity Model into the Finite Element Framework using an ABAQUS User-Material Subroutine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a practical method for incorporating trained Neural Networks (NNs) into the Finite Element (FE) framework using a user material (UMAT) subroutine. The work exemplifies crystal plasticity, a complex inelastic non-linear path-dependent material response, with a wide range of applications in ABAQUS UMAT. However, this approach can be extended to other material behaviors and FE tools. The use of a UMAT subroutine serves two main purposes: (1) it predicts and updates the stress or other mechanical properties of interest directly from the strain history; (2) it computes the Jacobian matrix either through backpropagation or numerical differentiation, which plays an essential role in the solution convergence. By implementing NNs in a UMAT subroutine, a trained machine learning model can be employed as a data-driven constitutive law within the FEM framework, preserving multiscale information that conventional constitutive laws often neglect or average. The versatility of this method makes it a powerful tool for integrating machine learning into mechanical simulation. While this approach is expected to provide higher accuracy in reproducing realistic material behavior, the reliability of the solution process and the convergence conditions must be paid special attention. While the theory of the model is explained in [Heider et al. 2020], exemplary source code is also made available for interested readers [https://doi.org/10.25835/6n5uu50y]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large-scale dynamics of event chain Monte Carlo algorithms in one dimension, and their relation to the true self-avoiding walk. In particular, we study the influence of stress, and different forms of interaction on the equilibration and sampling properties of algorithms with global balance, but no local balance.</description>

      <title>Accelerated ray-tracing simulations using McXtrace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: McXtrace is an established Monte Carlo based ray-tracing tool to simulate synchrotron beamlines and X-ray laboratory instruments. This work explains and demonstrates the new capability of GPU-accelerated McXtrace ray-tracing simulations. The openACC implementation is presented, followed by a demonstration of the achieved speed-up factor for several types of instruments across different types of hardware. The instruments achieve speed-up factors around \SIrange{250}{600}{} dependent on the instrument complexity. Instruments requiring repeated memory access might require optimised memory access procedures to avoid severe penalties in the simulation time when using GPUs. The importance of reducing the simulations was demonstrated for an aviation security application by comparing the simulation time of a projection of an energy-dispersive X-ray computed tomography instrument.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure prediction of medium and high entropy alloys across composition space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.</description>

      <title>Regulating protocols of globally coupled continuum systems: Effects on dynamics and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling and understanding phenomena in coupled systems remains a significant challenge across diverse fields. This study investigates a simple globally coupled chemical system that exhibits a range of rich collective dynamics, from coherence to chimera states, controllable by a system parameter. We explore the effects of altering this control parameter using two different protocols. In protocol-I, a continuous variation of the control parameter leads to memory effects, resulting in two distinct sets of phenomena in the forward and reverse directions. In contrast, protocol-II, which includes a resetting feature, yields an entirely distinct collection of behaviors. Additionally, we capture the evolution of key elements of nonequilibrium thermodynamics associated with these dynamical states under both protocols, revealing distinct signatures for each. This work highlights the complexity and uniqueness of regulating coupled systems via control parameters compared to corresponding single systems, and it carries potential implications for the manipulation and application of collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>Bodge: Python package for efficient tight-binding modeling of superconducting nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bodge is a free and open-source Python package for constructing large-scale real-space tight-binding models for calculations in condensed matter physics. "Large-scale" means that it should remain performant even for lattices with millions of atoms, and "real-space" means that the model is formulated in terms of individual lattice sites and not in momentum space, for example.
  Although general tight-binding models can be constructed with this package, the main focus is on the Bogoliubov-De Gennes ("BoDGe") Hamiltonian used to model superconductivity in the clean limit. The package is designed to be easy to use, flexible, and extensible - and very few lines of code are required to model heterostructures containing, e.g., conventional and unconventional superconductors, ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, altermagnetism, and spin-orbit coupling.
  In other words: If you want a lattice model for superconducting nanostructures, and want something that is computationally efficient yet easy to use, Bodge should be a good choice.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic interactions between a sedimenting squirmer and a planar wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions between a sedimenting microswimmer and a solid wall have ubiquitous biological and technological applications. A plethora of gravity-induced swimming dynamics near a planar no-slip wall provides a platform for designing artificial microswimmers that can generate directed propulsion through their translation-rotation coupling near a wall. In this work we provide exact solutions for a squirmer (a model swimmer of spherical shape with a prescribed slip velocity) facing either towards or away from a planar wall perpendicular to gravity. These exact solutions are used to validate a numerical code based on the boundary integral method with an adaptive mesh for distances from the wall down to 0.1% of the squirmer radius. This boundary integral code is then used to investigate the rich gravity-induced dynamics near a wall, mapping out the detailed bifurcation structures of the swimming dynamics in terms of orientation and distance to the wall. Simulation results show that a squirmer may transverse along the wall, move to a fixed point at a given height with a fixed orientation in a monotonic way or in an oscillatory fashion, or oscillate in a limit cycle in the presence of wall repulsion.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning framework for accelerating spin-lattice relaxation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular and lattice vibrations are able to couple to the spin of electrons and lead to their relaxation and decoherence. Ab initio simulations have played a fundamental role in shaping our understanding of this process but further progress is hindered by their high computational cost. Here we present an accelerated computational framework based on machine-learning models for the prediction of molecular vibrations and spin-phonon coupling coefficients. We apply this method to three open-shell coordination compounds exhibiting long relaxation times and show that this approach achieves semi-to-full quantitative agreement with ab initio methods reducing the computational cost by about 80%. Moreover, we show that this framework naturally extends to molecular dynamics simulations, paving the way to the study of spin relaxation in condensed matter beyond simple equilibrium harmonic thermal baths.</description>

      <title>Comparing Meta-GGAs, +U Corrections, and Hybrid Functionals for Polaronic Point Defects in Layered MnO$_2$, NiO$_2$, and KCoO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14317v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defects in a material can significantly tune properties and enhance utility. Hybrid functionals like HSE06 are often used to describe solids with such defects. However, geometry optimization (including accounting for effects such as Jahn-Teller distortion) using hybrid functionals is challenging for the large supercells needed for defect study. The proposed r$^2$SCAN+rVV10+U+$\mathrm{U_d}$ method, which is computationally much cheaper and faster than hybrid functionals, can successfully describe defects in materials with the proper choice of U (for the d orbitals of the host atom) and $\mathrm{U_d}$ (for those of the defect atom), as shown here for small polaron defects in layered transition-metal oxides. For a range of U and $\mathrm{U_d}$ around literature values (from solid-state reaction energies) for a given transition-metal ion and its oxidation state, we find that this approach predicts localized polaronic states in band gaps, as hybrid functionals do. The layered materials birnessite ($\mathrm{K_nMnO_2}, n=0.03 $) and $\mathrm{K_nNiO_2},n=0.03$, with one K atom intercalated between layers in a supercell, are found to have one localized occupied $\mathrm{e_g}$ polaronic state on the transition metal ion reduced by the insertion of the K atom, when the geometry is calculated as above using published U values. The expected Jahn-Teller distortion is not observed when U=$\mathrm{U_d}$=0. Layered cobalt oxide with additional potassium ions intercalated ($\mathrm{K_nCoO_2},n=1.03$) is different, due to a dramatic difference in electronic configuration of the defected Co(II) ion: A single extra K atom in the supercell leads to four localized electrons in the band gap, using standard U values, and even for U=$\mathrm{U_d}$=0.</description>

      <title>Multi-Derivative Runge-Kutta Flux Reconstruction for hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the fourth order, two stage Multi-Derivative Runge Kutta (MDRK) scheme to the Flux Reconstruction (FR) framework by writing both stages in terms of a time averaged flux and then using the approximate Lax-Wendroff procedure to compute the time averaged flux. Numerical flux is carefully constructed to enhance Fourier CFL stability and accuracy. A subcell based blending limiter is developed for the MDRK scheme which ensures that the limited scheme is provably admissibility preserving. Along with being admissibility preserving, the blending scheme is constructed to minimize dissipation errors by using Gauss-Legendre solution points and performing MUSCL-Hancock reconstruction on subcells. The accuracy enhancement of the blending scheme is numerically verified on compressible Euler's equations, with test cases involving shocks and small-scale structures.</description>

      <title>H-Matrix Accelerated Direct Matrix Solver for Maxwell's Equations using the Chebyshev-based Nystr\"om Boundary Integral Equation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An H-matrix accelerated direct solver employing the high-order Chebyshev-based Boundary Integral Equation (CBIE) method has been formulated, tested, and profiled for performance on high contrast dielectric materials and electrically large perfect electric conductor objects. The matrix fill performance of the CBIE proves to be fast for small to moderately sized problems compared to its counterparts, e.g. the locally corrected Nystr\"om (LCN) method, due to the way it handles the singularities by means of a global change of variable method. However, in the case of electrically large scattering problems, the matrix fill and factorization still dominate the solution time when using a direct solution approach. To address this issue, an H-Matrix framework is employed, effectively resolving the challenge and establishing the CBIE as a competitive high-order method for solving scattering problems with poorly conditioned matrix equations. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through extensive numerical results, showcasing its robustness to problems that are electrically large, near physical resonances, or that have large dielectric permittivities. The capability of the proposed solver for handling arbitrary geometries is also demonstrated by considering various scattering examples from complex CAD models.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity-Driven Metallicity and Magnetic Skyrmions in van der Waals Cr2Ge2Te6/Hf2Ge2Te6 Multiferroic Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic heterostructures present a promising platform for advanced spin devices by leveraging the coexisting ferromagnetic (FM) and ferroelectric (FE) orders. Through first-principles calculations and micromagnetic simulations, we reveal non-volatile control of metallicity and topological spin textures in the Cr2Ge2Te6/Hf2Ge2Te6(CGT/HGT) heterostructure. Notably, manipulating ferroelectric polarization in HGT significantly modulates the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) of CGT/HGT, reversing the easy magnetization axis from in-plane to out-of-plane. By analyzing the atomic-resolved SOC energy (\Delta Esoc), it is found that the cause of the change comes from the Fert-Levy mechanism. Additionally, this polarization control enables the creation and annihilation of bimerons and skyrmions, with interlayer sliding further altering magnetic ordering. Our findings offer valuable insights into magnetoelectric coupling and spin texture manipulation in 2D magnets, highlighting their potential for next-generation spintronic and memory devices.</description>
