      <title>Dynamic and Streaming Algorithms for Union Volume Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The union volume estimation problem asks to $(1\pm\varepsilon)$-approximate the volume of the union of $n$ given objects $X_1,\ldots,X_n \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. In their seminal work in 1989, Karp, Luby, and Madras solved this problem in time $O(n/\varepsilon^2)$ in an oracle model where each object $X_i$ can be accessed via three types of queries: obtain the volume of $X_i$, sample a random point from $X_i$, and test whether $X_i$ contains a given point $x$. This running time was recently shown to be optimal [Bringmann, Larsen, Nusser, Rotenberg, and Wang, SoCG'25]. In another line of work, Meel, Vinodchandran, and Chakraborty [PODS'21] designed algorithms that read the objects in one pass using polylogarithmic time per object and polylogarithmic space; this can be phrased as a dynamic algorithm supporting insertions of objects for union volume estimation in the oracle model.
  In this paper, we study algorithms for union volume estimation in the oracle model that support both insertions and deletions of objects. We obtain the following results:
  - an algorithm supporting insertions and deletions in polylogarithmic update and query time and linear space (this is the first such dynamic algorithm, even for 2D triangles);
  - an algorithm supporting insertions and suffix queries (which generalizes the sliding window setting) in polylogarithmic update and query time and space;
  - an algorithm supporting insertions and deletions of convex bodies of constant dimension in polylogarithmic update and query time and space.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds for Discrete Voronoi Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the planar one-round discrete Voronoi game, two players $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ compete over a set $V$ of $n$ voters represented by points in $\mathbb{R}^2$. First, $\mathcal{P}$ places a set $P$ of $k$ points, then $\mathcal{Q}$ places a set $Q$ of $\ell$ points, and then each voter $v\in V$ is won by the player who has placed a point closest to $v$. It is well known that if $k=\ell=1$, then $\mathcal{P}$ can always win $n/3$ voters and that this is worst-case optimal. We study the setting where $k&gt;1$ and $\ell=1$. We present lower bounds on the number of voters that $\mathcal{P}$ can always win, which improve the existing bounds for all $k\geq 4$. As a by-product, we obtain improved bounds on small $\varepsilon$-nets for convex ranges. These results are for the $L_2$ metric. We also obtain lower bounds on the number of voters that $\mathcal{P}$ can always win when distances are measured in the $L_1$ metric.</description>

      <title>Ratio Covers of Convex Sets and Optimal Mixture Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study density estimation in Kullback-Leibler divergence: given an i.i.d. sample from an unknown density $p$, the goal is to construct an estimator $\widehat p$ such that $\mathrm{KL}(p,\widehat p)$ is small with high probability. We consider two settings involving a finite dictionary of $M$ densities: (i) model aggregation, where $p$ belongs to the dictionary, and (ii) convex aggregation (mixture density estimation), where $p$ is a mixture of densities from the dictionary. Crucially, we make no assumption on the base densities: their ratios may be unbounded and their supports may differ. For both problems, we identify the best possible high-probability guarantees in terms of the dictionary size, sample size, and confidence level. These optimal rates are higher than those achievable when density ratios are bounded by absolute constants; for mixture density estimation, they match existing lower bounds in the special case of discrete distributions.
  Our analysis of the mixture case hinges on two new covering results. First, we provide a sharp, distribution-free upper bound on the local Hellinger entropy of the class of mixtures of $M$ distributions. Second, we prove an optimal ratio covering theorem for convex sets: for every convex compact set $K\subset \mathbb{R}_+^d$, there exists a subset $A\subset K$ with at most $2^{8d}$ elements such that each element of $K$ is coordinate-wise dominated by an element of $A$ up to a universal constant factor. This geometric result is of independent interest; notably, it yields new cardinality estimates for $\varepsilon$-approximate Pareto sets in multi-objective optimization when the attainable set of objective vectors is convex.</description>

      <title>Sweeping Arrangements of Non-Piercing Curves in Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be an arrangement of Jordan curves in the plane, i.e., simple closed curves in the plane. For any curve $\gamma \in \Gamma$, we denote the bounded region enclosed by $\gamma$ as $\tilde{\gamma}$. We say that $\Gamma$ is non-piercing if for any two curves $\alpha , \beta \in \Gamma$, $\tilde{\alpha} \,\setminus\, \tilde{\beta}$ is connected. A non-piercing arrangement of curves generalizes a set of $2$-intersecting curves in which each pair of curves intersect in at most two points. Snoeyink and Hershberger (``Sweeping Arrangements of Curves'', SoCG '89) proved that if we are given an arrangement $\Gamma$ of $2$-intersecting curves and a {\em sweep} curve $\gamma\in{\Gamma}$, then the arrangement can be \emph{swept} by $\gamma$ while always maintaining the $2$-intersecting property of the curves in $\Gamma$. We generalize the result of Snoeyink and Hershberger to the setting of non-piercing arrangements. Given an arrangement $\Gamma$ of non-piercing curves, a sweep curve $\gamma\in \Gamma$, and a point $P$ in $\tilde{\gamma}$, we show that we can continuously shrink $\gamma$ to $P$ so that throughout the process, the arrangement remains non-piercing (except at a finite set of points in time where $\gamma$ crosses other curves), and $P$ lies in $\tilde{\gamma}$. We show that our arguments can be modified if $P$ lies outside $\tilde{\gamma}$, and we want to sweep $\gamma$ \emph{outwards} so that $P$ lies outside $\tilde{\gamma}$, and the arrangement remains non-piercing. As a second contribution, we give an alternate proof of the result of Snoeyink and Hershberger, and give several applications of our results to combinatorial and algorithmic questions including to the \emph{multi-hitting set} problem involving points and non-piercing regions.</description>

      <title>Minimum Selective Subset on Unit Disk Graphs and Circle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01931v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a connected simple graph G = (V(G),E(G)), each vertex is assigned one of c colors, where V(G) can be written as a union of a total of c subsets V_{1},...,V_{c} and V_{i} denotes the set of vertices of color i. A subset S of V(G) is called a selective subset if, for every i, every vertex v in V_{i} has at least one nearest neighbor in $S \cup (V(G) \setminus V_{i})$ that also lies in V_{i}. The Minimum Selective Subset (MSS) problem asks for a selective subset of minimum size.
  We show that the MSS problem is log-APX-hard on general graphs, even when c=2. As a consequence, the problem does not admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) unless P = NP. On the positive side, we present a PTAS for unit disk graphs, which works without requiring a geometric representation and applies for arbitrary c. We further prove that MSS remains NP-complete in unit disk graphs for arbitrary c. In addition, we show that the MSS problem is log-APX-hard on circle graphs, even when c=2.</description>

      <title>PartUV: Part-Based UV Unwrapping of 3D Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.
