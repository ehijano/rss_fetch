      <title>An Explicit M1 Radiation-hydrodynamics Scheme for Three-dimensional Protostellar Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) scheme that enables three-dimensional simulations resolving both protostellar interiors and their surrounding accretion flows within a single framework, to clarify how a protostar evolves while interacting with the accretion flow. The method builds on an explicit M1 closure scheme with a reduced speed of light approximation (RSLA) for massively parallel computation. Our scheme introduces a complementary non-RSLA radiation component that dominates in optically thick regions. This hybrid treatment restores physical energy conservation inside protostars, which would otherwise be violated under the RSLA, while retaining the advantage of large time steps. To overcome the limitation of the conventional M1 closure in solving radiative transfer in extremely optically thick regions inside protostars and across steep optical-depth gradients near their surfaces, we incorporate the optical-depth information of neighboring cells into the radiative transfer calculation. We further evolve photon number densities in addition to radiation energy densities to reconstruct an effective local spectrum on the fly without resorting to costly multi-frequency transport. We implement this scheme in the adaptive mesh refinement code SFUMATO and verify its validity through a series of test calculations. As an application, we follow the early evolution of a massive protostar formed at high redshift, within a full cosmological context. The results reveal a continuous structure connecting the swollen protostar and its surrounding disk, which cannot be captured in conventional one-dimensional models. This explicit RHD scheme opens a path to studies of protostellar evolution and its interaction with the accretion flow in realistic three-dimensional environments.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of the Class I protostar L1489 IRS with NOEMA - II. A disk replenished by a massive streamer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) Streamers are newly identified channels that transport mass from large, molecular-cloud scales down to small, protoplanetary-disk scales. To better understand their impact on planet formation, it is essential to study their physical and chemical properties. In this framework, we aim to characterize the longest streamer identified in carbon chain emission within the Class I system L1489 IRS, connecting the nearby prestellar core L1489 to the young stellar object (YSO). We observed multiple transitions of C$_2$H, ortho-c-C$_3$H$_2$, and HC$_3$N in L1489 IRS with NOEMA and IRAM-30m at 3mm and 2mm. Using a variety of radiative transfer methods, including a hyperfine structure (HFS) fitting, rotational diagrams, and proposing a new self-consistent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach combined with the non-LTE RADEX code, we derived the column densities and abundances of those molecules, as well as the H$_2$ number density along the streamer. This enabled us to estimate its mass, infall rate, and its impact on the {star+disk} system's mass. We found lower limits on the streamer mass of $\geq(4.67-18.3)\times10^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ (i.e., $\geq0.65-2.57$ times the current disk mass) and an infall rate of $\geq(1.94-7.57)\times10^{-7}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, where the ranges correspond to the different molecular tracers. These values are consistent with those derived in similar Class I objects. This suggests that the disk could be fully replenished by streamer material. Given its mass, the streamer is likely at the origin of the external warped disk seen in this system, as predicted by numerical simulations. Moreover, the first investigations based on the C$_2$H/c-C$_3$H$_2$ and HC$_3$N/c-C$_3$H$_2$ abundance ratios suggest that the streamer chemistry may be inherited from the core. These results suggest, for the first time, that the chemical composition of a Class I object is [...]</description>

      <title>Conversion and Damping of Non-axisymmetric Internal Gravity Waves in Magnetized Stellar Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism is thought to play an important role in the evolution and dynamics of stars, though little is known about magnetic fields deep within stellar interiors. A promising avenue for probing these fields uses asteroseismic observations of global oscillations that result from the coupling of acoustic waves in the convective zone to internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the radiative interior. Recent modeling efforts implicate deep magnetic fields in the suppression of dipole mixed modes observed in 20% of red giants and a number of high-mass main sequence stars. Previous numerical and theoretical work shows that core magnetic fields could suppress axisymmetric global modes by refracting down-going IGWs into slow-magnetosonic (SM) waves that damp at magnetic cutoff heights. Here, we extend these results to the non-axisymmetric case, for which the IGWs and SM waves are coupled to a continuous spectrum of Alfven waves (AWs). We consider a Cartesian model of the radiative interior with uniform stratification and a spatially-varying, current-free magnetic field. Using a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation to solve for the vertical mode structure, corroborated with numerical simulations, we show that IGWs convert to up-going SM waves, which resonate with the Alfven spectrum and produce mixed SM-AW modes. We find cutoff heights (as in the axisymmetric case), above which the SM/SM-AWs convert to AWs. Latitudinal variations of the background magnetic field lead to phase mixing of the AWs, resulting in rapid damping. Our results suggest that energy in both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric IGWs is lost via interactions with a strong magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Breaking gyrochronology through the collapse of coronal winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gyrochronology, a method for dating aged field stars ($\gtrsim$ a few Gyr) based on their rotation rate, has recently been shown to fail for many stars older than the sun. The explanation most often put forth is that a shutdown or mode change in the stellar dynamo leads to a sharp decrease in angular momentum loss in magnetized coronal winds. In this paper, we explore an alternate possibility, namely a collapse of the wind itself through a reduction of coronal heating. We show that in the low coronal temperature ($T_0$) limit, even at solar-like low rotation rates ($\Omega$) and coronal magnetic field strength ($B_{r0}$), magnetocentrifugal effects are important and preclude expression of the mass and angular momentum loss rates as power-laws of $T_0$ or $\Omega$ when $T_0$ drops below $\simeq 1.5\,$MK. Mass loss is found to scale linearly with power input into the wind at all coronal temperatures. Introducing an ad hoc power law relationship $T_0\propto B_{r0}^\sigma$ while retaining the ``standard'' dynamo relationship $B_{r0}\propto\Omega$, we show that reproducing the observed break in gyrochronology requires an exponent $\sigma\gtrsim 1.5$, with which is associated a drop by over 3 orders of magnitude in power input into the quiet corona. This appears physically unrealistic, given current observations of chromospheric and coronal non-thermal emission in aged solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>Radiation pressure and equation of state are important in the envelope unbinding process in common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In common envelope evolution, the ultimate unbinding of the envelope during the plunge-in phase involves complex and poorly understood physical processes that may give rise to luminous red novae. In this work, we investigate the roles of radiation and gas pressures in envelope unbinding. We perform a parameter space survey using a self-consistent one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic model that is solved by {\tt Guangqi} to study the impact of key parameters on the mass unbound fraction and resulting light curves. The parameters include the radiation to gas energy ratio $\E/\eg\in[0.2,3.2]$, speed of the ejecta, ranging from 70\% to 85\% of the escape velocity, and EoS. For comparison, we also perform simulations with pure hydrodynamic or no radiation pressure conditions. Our simulations demonstrate that the radiation pressure is crucial for the envelope unbinding. Specifically, the radiation pressure may dominate in a high opacity and high luminosity layer just below the recombination front, where it can accelerate the sub-escape material to escape velocities. A realistic EoS further enhances the pressure gradient, especially during the early phase of ejection at small radii, promoting additional envelope ejection. Both $\E/\eg$ and EoS significantly alter light curve shapes, provide observable diagnostics for these processes. We show that the relative energy error of all the simulations is no more than 1.4\%, and all the simulations are close to convergence.</description>

      <title>Estimation of gravitational wave from solar emerging magnetic flux tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the gravitational waves (GWs) generated by the emergence of magnetic flux tubes in the solar convection zone. We focus on the upward buoyancy of magnetic flux tubes, which leads to significant magnetic activity and the formation of active region sunspots. This study adopts parameters representative of a moderate-sized solar active region to estimate the GWs generated by the emergence of magnetic flux tubes. Our results indicate that the GW strain amplitude, achievable through signal superposition and detection at close proximity (e.g., approximately one solar radius from the solar surface), may reach $\sim$10$^{-29}$. The characteristic GW frequency is estimated at $\sim$10$^{-5}$ Hz, placing it at the high-frequency end of the sensitivity band of Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) methods. However, the estimated strain amplitudes remain orders of magnitude below the sensitivity thresholds of current and foreseeable gravitational wave detectors. Notably, reducing the cadence $\Delta t$ of Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations to approximately 2 hours ($\Delta t = 2\text{hours}$) would raise the maximum detectable frequency to about $5.8 \times 10^{-5} \text{Hz}$, thereby encompassing the dominant spectral component of solar activity-related GWs predicted in this study, offering a potential pathway for future detection. Successful detection in the future may help to predict the super solar active region emergence in space weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Water Snowline in Young Stellar Objects with Various Density Structures Using Radiative Transfer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracing the water snowline in low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) is important because dust grain growth is promoted and the chemical composition varies at the water snowline, which influences planet formation and its properties. In protostellar envelopes, the water snowline can be estimated as a function of luminosity using a relation derived from radiative transfer models, and these predictions are consistent with observations. However, accurately estimating the water snowline in protoplanetary disks requires new relations that account for the disk structure. We present the relations between luminosity and water snowline using the dust continuum radiative transfer models with various density structures. We adopt two-dimensional density structures for an envelope-only model (Model E), an envelope+disk+cavity model (Model E+D), and a protoplanetary disk model (Model PPD). The relations between the water snowline, where T_dust = 100 K, and the total luminosity, ranging 0.1-1,000 solar luminosity, are well fitted by a power-law relation, R_snow=a * (L/L_solar)^p au. The factor a decreases with increasing disk density, while the power index p has values around 0.5 in all models. As the disk becomes denser, the water snowline forms at smaller radii even at the same luminosity, since dense dust hinders photon propagation. We also explore the effect of viscous heating on the water snowline. In Model PPD with viscous heating, the water snowline shifts outward by a few au up to 15 au, increasing the factor a and decreasing the power index p. In Model E+D with lower disk mass, the effect of viscous heating is negligible, indicating that the disk mass controls the effect. The discrepancy between our models and direct observations provides insights into the recent outburst event and the presence of a disk structure in low-mass YSOs.</description>

      <title>Combining spectral analysis and narrow band pass filtering to predict solar cycle parameters in the next solar grand minimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for predicting sunspot number (SSN) that, based on successful back projections, can predict features of the SSN several solar cycles in advance. The method applies Fourier analysis to the annual SILSO SSN record, from 1700.5 to 2023.5, to identify in the spectrum, four strong components in the decadal, 10 to 11 year period, range and four weaker components in the octal, 8 to 9 year period, range. The time variation of each component is isolated by a new method of narrow band pass filtering. The components are fitted with sinusoids at the beginning/end of the SSN record for back/forward projection. Back projection successfully replicated the long term features of the Maunder Minimum. Forward projection predicts a Maunder-like grand minimum from 2030 to 2110, encompassing solar cycles 26 to 35. Details of short term features of SSN within the grand minimum are less certain. The octal contribution to SSN is shown to occasionally exceed the decadal contribution both in the projection and also within the observational record. Predicted SSN amplitudes for cycles 26 and 28 are about 50, about half the amplitude of cycles 24 and 25. The amplitude of cycle 27 is difficult to forecast as it may emerge as a double peak of cycle 26 rather than as two separate cycles 26 and 27. Amplitudes forecast for cycles 29 to 33 are, on average, about half the amplitude of cycles 26 and 27 with the lowest cycle of the grand minimum, cycle 30, occurring around 2070. Macro changes in SSN such as the occurrence of grand solar minima and maxima and micro changes such as the Waldmeier Effect are explained in terms of interference between the octal and decadal components evident in the SSN spectrum. The explanation differs from current theories that suggest SSN variability is due to stochastic forcing of a single solar dynamo process.</description>

      <title>New Level Resolved Ground and Excited State Pb III, IV, V &amp; VI Photoionization Cross Sections for Heavy Metal Subdwarf Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High abundances of various lead (Pb) species have been identified in the spectra of many Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and O- and B-type subdwarfs (sdO/B). Additional atomic data relating to Pb, and in particular photoionization cross sections, are needed to allow a greater understanding of the origin of these observed Pb abundances, and hence discern the evolutionary pathway of these stars. We have calculated level-resolved photoionization cross sections for Pb III, IV, V and VI. Four new target structures have been developed with the General Relativistic Atomic Structure Package (GRASP0), whose corresponding energy levels, Einstein A-coefficients and oscillator strengths have been found to be in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical sources. The photoionization cross sections calculated using the Dirac Atomic R-matrix Codes (DARC) are available in TOPBASE format, and follow the trends expected for an isonuclear series. These new Pb data sets will now allow for the modelling of Pb abundances and line opacities under Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (non-LTE) conditions. Using the helium-rich hot subdwarf EC 22536-5304 as a test case, we show that there are noticeable differences in the Pb line profiles across the ultraviolet and optical wavelength regions under LTE and non-LTE conditions. There is both depletion and enrichment of individual Pb species. This highlights the importance of applying non-LTE conditions when modelling EC 22536-5304, as well as other O/B-type stars.</description>

      <title>Influence of kinetic effects in large-scale magnetic reconnection with multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a multiscale phenomenon where fluid- and particle-scale processes interact. The particle-in-cell (PIC) method, capable of resolving kinetic (particle-scale) physics, is extensively used to study the kinetic effects in magnetic reconnection. Meanwhile, because of the high computational cost, PIC simulations cannot capture the interaction between kinetic and fluid dynamics, which poses a major obstacle to understanding magnetic reconnection in large-scale phenomena such as solar flares. A multi-hierarchy simulation that combines Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and PIC provides a promising means to overcome these spatial and temporal scale gaps. We developed a multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY (Kinetic And Magnetohydrodynamic MUlti-hierarchY simulation code), in which an ideal MHD simulation for a large domain and a PIC simulation for a smaller domain are solved in parallel with mutual information exchange. To validate the code, we conducted test simulations of MHD wave propagation and the shock tube problem. The results demonstrate that short-wavelength, high-frequency waves generated in the PIC region do not propagate into the MHD region, whereas MHD-scale structures propagate smoothly into the PIC region, highlighting the capability of our code for numerical studies of magnetic reconnection. By applying the KAMMUY code to magnetic reconnection while varying the PIC domain size, we find that the reconnection rate remains unchanged, regardless of the extent of the PIC region where the Hall magnetic field is present. It suggests that the spatial extension of the Hall magnetic field on the scale of $10 \sim 100 \lambda_i$ does not influence the reconnection rate.</description>

      <title>The bimodal distribution of donor stars in X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of X-ray binaries into high- and low-mass types has historically lacked a unified, data-driven quantitative criterion, and large-scale statistical studies of the donor star population have been limited. In this work, we address this gap by compiling data for 3,964 XRBs and deriving a plentiful set of physical parameters (mass, radius, age, and evolutionary stage) for a sub-sample of 288 donor stars using Gaia DR3 spectral data and stellar evolution models. We find a statistically bimodal distribution in the donor star parameters, which is characterized by a valley at approximately 3 $M_{\odot}$ or 11,000 K. We uncover the physical mechanism behind this bimodality: a previously unreported ``parallel tracks'' phenomenon observed in the relationship between the donor's evolutionary stage and its fundamental parameters, such as luminosity and radius. These two tracks represent distinct main-sequence populations, and the valley between them corresponds to the sparsely populated pre- and post-main-sequence evolutionary phases.</description>

      <title>Eclipsing Stellar Flare on the Demon Star Algol Binary System Observed during the MAXI-NICER Follow-up Campaign in 2018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algol is a well-known eclipsing binary hosting an active and variable star that exhibits frequent stellar flares. Here, we report our pre-planned and coordinated rapid X-ray follow-up observations of an eclipsing flare on Algol. The Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) detected a flare on Algol at 05:52 UT on 2018 July 4. Subsequently, we carried out a prompt X-ray monitoring with the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) starting at 19:45 UT on the same day, and the observation ended at 06:02 UT on 2018 July 6. During the decaying phase of the flare, we successfully detected a 5.8-hour-long eclipse, corresponding to the secondary eclipse in which Algol A blocks the line of sight to Algol B. During the eclipse, the 2--10 keV X-ray flux is decreased to 20\% level from $1.9\times10^{-10}~ \mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$ to $4.5\times10^{-11}~ \mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$. We found a configuration of the flare size and location to explain the X-ray observations; e.g., the flare occurred at the latitude 45{\deg}S of the Algol B surface with a flare height of $1.9\times10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}$, corresponding to 0.8 times the stellar radius of Algol B, giving 80% obscuration of the flare loop by Algol A. The apparent absorption increase before the eclipse might originate from coronal mass ejection (CME) in the line of sight ejected during the flare.</description>

      <title>Local Particle Acceleration in an ICME-in-Sheath Structure Observed by Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local particle acceleration in the shock sheath region formed during the interaction between multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is a complicated process that is still under investigation. On March 23, 2024, the successive eruption of two magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) from the solar active region 3614 produced twin CMEs, as identified in coronagraph images. By analyzing in-situ data from Solar Orbiter and Wind, it is found that the primary ICME-driven shock overtook the preceding ICME, trapping it in the sheath between the shock and the primary ICME, forming the ICME-in-sheath (IIS) structure. Using Solar Orbiter observations, we show that both electrons and ions are accelerated within the IIS. A clear enhancement of suprathermal electrons was observed at the IIS boundary, where strong flow shear and large magnetic field variation suggest possible local electron acceleration. Electrons (&gt;38 keV) exhibit a long-lasting enhancement in the IIS with a spectral index of ~2.2, similar to that in the shock sheath and the primary ICME, indicating a similar solar origin. Inside both the sheath and IIS, spectra of proton and 4He are generally consistent with the prediction of the diffusive shock acceleration, whereas Fe and O present a double power-law shape. Additionally, the Fe/O ratio in the IIS is higher than that in the sheath, and more close to the abundance of the flare-related particles, suggesting the remnant particles of flare confined in the IIS.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Free Dynamics in Rotating Spherical Shell Convection Driven By Internal Heating and Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk properties of convection in stellar and giant planet interiors are often assumed to be independent of the molecular diffusivities, which are very small. By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating, spherical shells, which are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield results that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to extrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory models and Cartesian-box simulations suggest diffusion-free dynamics can be obtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling instead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of Boussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this set-up unambiguously yields diffusion-free behaviour for bulk 'thermal' properties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the convective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde equatorial zonal flow is diffusion-free and only depends on the convective Rossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk 'kinematic' properties is regime-dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the convective velocities, and the strength and structure of the zonal flow, are diffusion-dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a diffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations that are uninfluenced by rotation, or are only influenced by rotation at large scales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flow amplitudes are obtained. The result that many aspects of our idealised simulations are diffusion-free has promising implications for the development of realistic stellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free regimes.</description>

      <title>Detection of spin-modulated circular polarisation and radial velocity variations in the long period Intermediate Polar 1RXS J080114.6-462324</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric study of the intermediate polar (IP) 1RXS J080114.6-462324, using observations from the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) 1.0-m and 1.9-m telescopes and the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), complemented by archival TESS photometry. Photometric and photo-polarimetric data reveal a coherent modulation at the white dwarf (WD) spin period. TESS confirms periodicities of 1307.517 s (spin) and 11.803 h (orbital). Photopolarimetric and circular spectropolarimetric measurements show circular polarisation reaching ~+5%, modulated with the WD spin period, consistent with cyclotron emission from an accreting magnetic pole. Time-resolved optical spectra display prominent Balmer (H$\gamma$, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$) and He\textsc{ii} $\lambda$4686 emission features and additional He\textsc{i} emissions, all exhibiting minimal radial-velocity variations. We detect red-shifted absorption dips adjacent to the He\textsc{ii} and H$\beta$ lines, modulated at the WD spin period; periodogram analysis of the emission lines also yields spin modulation. These observations indicate that the system is a disc-fed, low-inclination IP. The combination of circular polarisation and spin-modulated absorption by infalling accretion curtain material supports this classification. Its comparatively long orbital period among IPs and the detection of polarised emission render 1RXS J080114.6-462324 an appealing candidate for evolutionary studies, potentially offering insight into how magnetic accretion systems evolve toward synchronism at longer orbital periods.</description>

      <title>Expansion kinematics of young clusters. II. NGC 2264 N &amp; S and Collinder 95 with HectoSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: Studying the dynamical evolution of young clusters is crucial for a more general understanding of the star formation process. Methods: We took spectra of &gt;600 candidate pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in several nearby young clusters (NGC 2264 N &amp; S, Collinder 95, and Collinder 359) using MMT/Hectospec. These spectra were analyzed for H{\alpha} emission and lithium absorption, features indicative of low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) still in their PMS evolution. We complemented these samples with YSOs identified via Gaia DR3 variability. In conjunction with Gaia astrometry, these data enable an analysis of cluster structure, kinematics and ages. In particular, we searched for halos of YSOs around our targets to test models of young cluster dynamical evolution. Results: For the NGC 2264 N &amp; S cluster pair we identified 354 YSOs, while for Collinder 95 and 359 we identified 130 and 7 YSOs, respectively. We calculate kinematic "traceback ages" for YSOs in these clusters, which we compare to isochronal ages estimated using several sets of stellar evolution models. We find for NGC 2264 N &amp; S that kinematic ages are generally smaller than their isochronal ages, which may indicate these systems remained bound for a few Myr before their current state of expansion. On the other hand, kinematic ages for Collinder 95 are often significantly larger than isochronal ages, which implies many of these YSOs did not originate from a central, dense region, leading to overestimated kinematic ages. Conclusions: We conclude that NGC 2264 N &amp; S clusters likely formed as initially bound and compact systems, but have been gradually evaporating as cluster members become unbound, forming halos of unbound YSOs surrounding the cluster cores. We conclude that Collinder 95 likely formed initially sparse and substructured and has been dispersing since gas expulsion.</description>

      <title>QFP Waves Driven by the Tuning-Fork Effect during Magnetic Reconnecion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through three-dimensional MHD simulations, we have uncovered a kind of fast coronal wave originating from both ends of a current sheet (CS) during a solar eruption. These waves are observed to appear near the top and bottom ends of the reconnection-related CS. The simulations demonstrate the presence of termination shock regions above the two ends of the CS. As the reconnection outflows escape from the vertical CS and encounter these termination shocks, they undergo partial reflection, redirecting towards the CS terminal fork walls. The identified waves propagate rapidly at a speed of approximately 1400 km/s with a period of just 2 s. Concurrently, the time-evolution of intensity within a small region of the CS terminal fork structures, exhibits a similar oscillation period of 2 s. All these evidence supports the notion that these QFP (Quasi-periodic Fast-Propagating) waves were excited by tuning fork effects within the CS system. Essentially, the rapid reconnection outflows are reflected by the terminal shocks, striking the fork walls at the CS ends. Moreover, parts of the oscillations along the tuning fork handle are transformed into thermal energy, accumulating in the CS center and elevating the temperature. This is the first time to report such QFP waves resulting from tuning fork effects within the CS during a solar eruption. These waves are anticipated to manifest closely following the propagation of CMEs and adjacent to the related post-flare loops in observations, with partial confirmation in current observations.</description>

      <title>Stellar population astrophysics (SPA) with the TNG. The Phosphorus abundance on the young side of MilkyWay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present phosphorus abundance measurements for a total of 102 giant stars, including 82 stars in 24 open clusters and 20 Cepheids, based on high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained with GIANO-B. Evolution of phosphorus abundance, despite its astrophysical and biological significance, remains poorly understood due to a scarcity of observational data. By combining precise stellar parameters from the optical, a robust line selection and measurement method, we measure phosphorus abundances using available P I lines. Our analysis confirms a declining trend in [P/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H] around solar metallicity for clusters and Cepheids, consistent with previous studies. We also report a [P/Fe]-age relation among open clusters older than 1 Gyr, indicating a time-dependent enrichment pattern. Such pattern can be explained by the different stellar formation history of their parental gas, with more efficient stellar formation in the gas of older clusters (thus with higher phosphorus abundances). [P/Fe] shows a flat trend among cepheids and clusters younger than 1 Gyr (along with three Cepheids inside open clusters), possibly hinting at the phosphorus contribution from the previous-generation low-mass stars. Such trend suggests that the young clusters share a nearly common chemical history, with a mild increase in phosphorus production by low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>A new photometric ephemeris for the 2M1510 AB double brown dwarf eclipsing binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing brown dwarfs are important calibrators of sub-stellar evolution models used to infer the characteristics of directly imaged brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. Only two double brown dwarf eclipsing binary systems are known, among them 2MASS J15104786-2818174 (2M1510 AB), published in 2020 with a poorly constrained orbital period. Here we analyse TESS full-frame image (FFI) photometry of this faint ($T=15.9$) binary and detect a significant (${&gt;}10\sigma$) periodic signal spanning TESS Cycles 1-7, consistent with previous data. We refine the orbital period to $20.897782 \pm 0.000036$ d, reducing its present-day uncertainty from 18 h to 8 min. Our work is crucial for scheduling follow-up observations of this system for detailed study with other photometric facilities. We also find that a recent orbital solution from Doppler data is inconsistent with existing photometry. A timing offset in the Doppler data may have produced a spurious signal mimicking retrograde apsidal precession, from which the claimed circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb was inferred. From our best attempt at correcting the data we were unable to reconcile the radial velocity data with the photometry, suggesting that the radial velocity uncertainties are underestimated, and that the circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb may be a false positive.</description>

      <title>AREPO-RSG: Aspherical Circumstellar Material and Winds from Pulsating Dusty Red Supergiants in Global 3D Radiation Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed a surprisingly large fraction of hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) interacting with dense confined circumstellar material (CSM), whose origin is heavily debated. Exploiting our recent implementation of a sophisticated radiation transport scheme in the moving-mesh code AREPO, we perform full-sphere 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of red supergiant envelopes. For $10\, M_\odot$ and $20\, M_\odot$ core-carbon-burning stars, we find that large-amplitude radial pulsations lift the surface material of density $10^{-14}$-$10^{-12}\; \mathrm{g\; cm^{-3}}$ to the circumstellar environment up to $3\times10^{14}$ cm, consistent with the inferred density for the interacting SN 2013fs. There, radiation acts on dust to drive highly anisotropic outflows of $10^{-6}$-$10^{-5}\, M_\odot\, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The total CSM masses for both simulations are $\sim 0.01\, M_\odot$. Due to convection, the CSM density structure has order-of-magnitude angular variations, dominated by large-scale asymmetries. We suggest that (1) the CSM around the progenitor is bound material instead of a widely-assumed steady wind, (2) highly aspherical CSM is common and can be created by surface convection rather than only from binary interactions, and (3) 3D effects need to be incorporated in 1D SN modeling, potentially via effective clumping. Based on our simulations, we propose a 1D analytical CSM model to be directly used for SN observable modeling. We predict that progenitor pulsations (seen in SN 2023ixf) and highly-confined CSM (seen in SN 2013fs) should be common among most hydrogen-rich SNe. This can be tested with progenitor monitoring using Rubin Observatory and near-future high-cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT and UVEX.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Planetary Nebulae in the Milky Way: Physical Properties, Chemical Abundances, and Galactic Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the physical and chemical properties of planetary nebulae (PNe) from the Milky Way Galaxy using the largest number of sources to date, with 1,449 True PNe from the HASH database. Among the Galactic components thin disk, thick disk, halo, and bulge-most PNe are concentrated in the Galactic disk, with a median angular size of 12 arcseconds (0.45 pc), while halo PNe tend to have larger sizes. Physical parameters of whole PNe, extinction coefficent c(Hbeta), electron temperature (Te), and density (Ne) show Gaussian-like distributions with medians of 1.5, 9,900 K, and 1,200 cm(-3), respectively. The abundances of He, N, O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar in PNe show Gaussian distributions with slight variations across Galactic components. PNe located in thin disk exhibit higher abundances, except for O and Ne, while PNe in halo have the lowest values for all elements. Strong correlations between elements, particularly Sulphur vs. Nitrogen (r=0.87), were identified using statistical tests. Comparisons with previous studies reveal variations ( 2 dex.) in abundance ratios, particularly in halo PNe. We also present the first detailed database in the literature, providing 7,200 abundance values for these elements, derived from 16,500 emission line measurements, to support the testing and development of theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Linear damping of magneto-acoustic waves in two-fluid partially ionized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-acoustic waves in partially ionized plasmas are damped due to elastic collisions between charged and neutral particles. Here, we use a linearized two-fluid model to describe the influence of this collisional interaction on the properties of small-amplitude waves propagating in a uniform and static background. Mainly focusing on the case of waves generated by a periodic driver, we perform a detailed study of the dependence of the wavenumbers and damping rates on the ionization degree of the plasma, the strength of the collisional coupling, and the angle of propagation. We describe how the different wave modes (fast, slow, acoustic) are related to the individual properties of each fluid in a wide range of physical conditions. In addition, we derive analytical approximations for the damping rates due to charge-neutral collisions in the limits of weak and strong coupling and check their range of validity in comparison with the exact numerical results. These approximations can be generally applied to a large variety of astrophysical and laboratory partially ionized plasmas, but here we also discuss the particular application to plasmas only composed of hydrogen.</description>

      <title>The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey III: First data release of JCMT CO-line observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low- to intermediate-mass ($\sim$0.8$-$8 M$_\odot$) evolved stars contribute significantly to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium in the local Universe, making accurate mass-return estimates in their final stages crucial. The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS) is a large multi-telescope project targeting a volume-limited sample of $\sim$850 stars within 3 kpc in order to derive the dust and gas return rates in the Solar Neighbourhood, and to constrain the physics underlying these processes. We present an initial analysis of the CO-line observations, including detection statistics, carbon isotopic ratios, initial mass-loss rates, and gas-to-dust ratios. We describe a new data reduction pipeline to analyse the available NESS CO data from the JCMT, measuring line parameters and calculating empirical gas mass-loss rates. We present the first release of the available data on 485 sources, one of the largest homogeneous samples of CO data to date. Comparison with a large literature sample finds that high mass-loss rate and especially carbon-rich sources are over-represented in literature, while NESS is probing significantly more sources at low mass-loss rates, detecting 59 sources in CO for the first time and providing useful upper limits. CO line detection rates are 81% for the CO (2--1) line and 75% for CO (3--2). The majority (82%) of detected lines conform to the expected soft parabola shape, while eleven sources show a double wind. Calculated mass-loss rates show power-law relations with both the dust-production rates and expansion velocities up to $\sim 5 \times 10^{-6}$~\msunyr. Median gas-to-dust ratios of 250 and 680 are found for oxygen-rich and carbon-rich sources, respectively. Our analysis of CO observations in this first data release highlights the importance of our volume-limited approach in characterizing the local AGB population as a whole.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</description>

      <title>NGC 2392 and NGC 4361: Spectroscopic Diagnostics of Planetary Nebula Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study presents a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the planetary nebulae (PNe) NGC~2392 and NGC~4361 using optical spectra obtained from the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) and mid-infrared spectra from archival \textit{Spitzer} IRS data. The physical conditions, such as electron temperature ($T_e$) and density ($n_e$), were derived using diagnostic emission lines through the PyNeb software. Elemental abundances of key species, including He, O, N, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar, were determined for both nebulae, offering insights into their nucleosynthesis history and evolutionary status. High-resolution HST and Pan-STARRS imaging further elucidate the morphological structures of the nebulae. NGC~2392 exhibits a well-defined double-shell structure and moderate excitation characteristics, while NGC~4361 displays a diffuse elliptical morphology with high-excitation conditions and a notably low nitrogen content. The observed line spectra and derived abundances point toward distinct progenitor histories for the two PNe, with NGC~2392 originating from a younger, intermediate-mass progenitor, while NGC~4361 traces an older, metal-poor Population II star. This comparative study enhances our understanding of the evolution and chemical enrichment processes of low- to intermediate-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Effects of Parameters in Widespread SEP Events with EPREM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located $\geq 90^\circ$ from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.</description>

      <title>Do tides play a role in the determination of the pre-stellar core mass function?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have examined the role of tides in the star formation process. They suggest, notably, that the tides determine the characteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by preventing the collapse of density fluctuations that would become gravitationally unstable in the absence of the tidal field generated by a neighboring central mass. However, most of these studies consider the tidal collapse condition as a 1D process or use a scalar virial condition and thus neglect the anisotropy of the tidal field and its compressive effects. In the present paper, we consider a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the envelope of a central core. This perturbation is subject to a tidal field generated by the central core. We study its evolution taking dynamical effects and the anisotropy of the tides into account. Based on the general tensorial virial equations, we determine a new collapse condition that takes these mechanisms into account. We identify two regimes: (i) a weak tidal regime in which the dynamics of the perturbation is only slightly modified by the action of the tides and (ii) a strong tidal regime in which the density threshold for collapse can potentially be increased due to the combined effects of the tides and the rotational support generated by the tidal synchronization of the perturbation with the orbital motion. In the case of a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the vicinity of a first Larson core, we show that the density threshold above which the perturbation collapses is increased only for low-mass perturbations (less than 2.7 solar mass) and only by at most a factor of 1.5. We conclude that tides likely do not play a major role in the process of star formation or in the determination of the characteristic mass of the IMF. We propose an alternative explanation for the observed value of the characteristic mass of the IMF.</description>

      <title>A Panchromatic View of Late-time Shock Power in the Type II Supernova 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present multi-wavelength observations of the type II supernova (SN II) 2023ixf during its first two years of evolution. We combine ground-based optical/NIR spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) far- and near-ultraviolet spectroscopy and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy to create spectral energy distributions of SN 2023ixf at +374 and +620 days post-explosion, covering a wavelength range of ~0.1-30 $\mu$m. The multi-band light curve of SN 2023ixf follows a standard radioactive decay decline rate after the plateau until ~500 days, at which point shock powered emission from ongoing interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) begins to dominate. This evolution is temporally consistent with 0.3-10 keV X-ray detections of SN 2023ixf and broad ''boxy'' spectral line emission from reprocessing of shock luminosity in a cold dense shell located between forward and reverse shocks. Using the expected absorbed radioactive decay power and the detected X-ray luminosity, we quantify the total shock powered emission at the +374 and +620 day epochs and find that it can be explained by nearly complete thermalization of the reverse shock luminosity as SN 2023ixf interacts with a continuous, ''wind-like'' CSM with a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot M \approx 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w = 20 \pm 5$ km/s). Additionally, we construct multi-epoch spectral models from the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN, which contain radioactive decay and shock powers, as well as dust absorption, scattering, and emission. We find that models with shock powers of $L_{sh} = (0.5-1) \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $(0.5 - 1) \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ of silicate dust in the cold dense shell and/or inner SN ejecta can effectively reproduce the global properties of the late-time (&gt;300 days) UV-to-IR spectra of SN 2023ixf.</description>
