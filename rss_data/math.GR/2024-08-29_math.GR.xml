      <title>Orbits of permutation groups with no derangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a nontrivial finite permutation group of degree $n$. If $G$ is transitive, then a theorem of Jordan states that $G$ has a derangement. Equivalently, a finite group is never the union of conjugates of a proper subgroup. If $G$ is intransitive, then $G$ may fail to have a derangement, and this can happen even if $G$ has only two orbits, both of which have size $(1/2+o(1))n$. However, we conjecture that if $G$ has two orbits of size exactly $n/2$ then $G$ does have a derangement, and we prove this conjecture when $G$ acts primitively on at least one of the orbits. Equivalently, we conjecture that a finite group is never the union of conjugates of two proper subgroups of the same order, and we prove this conjecture when at least one of the subgroups is maximal. We prove other cases of the conjecture, and we highlight connections our results have with intersecting families of permutations and roots of polynomials modulo primes. Along the way, we also prove a linear variant on Isbell's conjecture regarding derangements of prime-power order.</description>

      <title>Harmonious sequences in groups with a unique involution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study several combinatorial properties of finite groups that are related to the notions of sequenceability, R-sequenceability, and harmonious sequences. In particular, we show that in every abelian group $G$ with a unique involution $\imath_G$ there exists a permutation $g_0,\ldots, g_{m}$ of elements of $G \backslash \{\imath_G\}$ such that the consecutive sums $g_0+g_1, g_1+g_2,\ldots, g_{m}+g_0$ also form a permutation of elements of $G\backslash \{\imath_G\}$. We also show that in every abelian group of order at least 4 there exists a sequence containing each non-identity element of $G$ exactly twice such that the consecutive sums also contain each non-identity element of $G$ twice. We apply several results to the existence of transversals in Latin squares.</description>

      <title>Harada's conjecture II and Gramian determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. Harada's conjecture II states that the ratio of the product of all the number of elements in conjugacy classes over that of all degrees of irreducible complex characters of $G$ is an integer. The ratio is called Harada's number. In this article, we discuss the Harada's number from the view point of Gramian determinants for suitable inner spaces and introduce an invariants generalizing the square of Harada's number associated to central characters of $G$. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition so that Harada's conjecture II holds. We calculate explicitly Harada's numbers in some examples by using the method given in this article.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of translations on maximal compact subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dynamics of translations of an element of a semisimple Lie group $G$ acting on its maximal compact subgroup $K$. First, we extend to our context some classical results in the context of general flag manifolds, showing that when the element is hyperbolic its dynamics is gradient and its fixed points components are given by some suitable right cosets of the centralizer of the element in $K$. Second, we consider the dynamics of a general element and characterizes its recurrent set, its minimal Morse components and their stable and unstable manifolds in terms of the Jordan decomposition of the element, and we show that each minimal Morse component is normally hyperbolic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a new hypergraph $\mathcal{H(V,E)}$ on a loop $L$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is the set of points of the loop $L$ and $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of hyperedges $e=\{x,y,z\}$ such that $x,y$ and $z$ associate in the order they are written. We call this hypergraph as the associating hypergraph on a loop $L$. We study certain properites of associating hypergraphs on the Moufang loop $M(D_n,2)$, where $D_n$ denotes the dihedral group of order $2n$.</description>

      <title>Geometry and arithmetic of semi-arithmetic Fuchsian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-arithmetic Fuchsian groups is a wide class of discrete groups of isometries of the hyperbolic plane which includes arithmetic Fuchsian groups, hyperbolic triangle groups, groups admitting a modular embedding, and others. We introduce a new geometric invariant of a semi-arithmetic group called stretch. Its definition is based on the notion of the Riemannian center of mass developed by Karcher and collaborators. We show that there exist only finitely many conjugacy classes of semi-arithmetic groups with bounded arithmetic dimension, stretch and coarea. The proof of this result uses the arithmetic Margulis lemma. We also show that when stretch is not bounded there exist infinite sequences of such groups.</description>

      <title>Free-by-cyclic groups are equationally Noetherian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group $G$ is said to be equationally Noetherian if every system of equations in $G$ is equivalent to a finite subsystem. We show that all free-by-cyclic groups are equationally Noetherian. As a corollary, we deduce that the set of exponential growth rates of a free-by-cyclic group is well ordered. Along the way, we prove that free-by-cyclic groups with polynomially growing monodromies of infinite order admit non-elementary 4-acylindrical actions on trees. We show that the splittings arising from the improved relative train track machinery of Bestvina-Feighn-Handel are 2-acylindrical when the growth is at least quadratic.</description>

      <title>The density of orders of quotients of triangle groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper it is shown that for the natural density (among the positive integers) of the orders of the finite quotients of every ordinary triangle group is zero, using a modification of a component of a 1976 theorem of Bertram on large cyclic subgroups of finite groups, and the Turan-Kubilius inequality from asymptotic number theory. This answers a challenging question raised by Tucker, based on some work for special cases by May and Zimmerman and himself.</description>

      <title>Some Properties of Order-Divisor Graphs of Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the properties of order-divisor graphs associated with finite groups. An order-divisor graph of a finite group is an undirected graph in which the set of vertices includes all elements of the group, and two distinct vertices with different orders are adjacent if the order of one vertex divides the order of the other. We prove some beautiful results in order-divisor graphs of finite groups. The primary focus is on examining the girth, degree of vertices, and size of the order-divisor graph. In particular, we provide a comprehensive description of these parameters for the order-divisor graphs of finite cyclic groups and dihedral groups.</description>

      <title>Weyl-invariants of totally disconnected locally compact groups acting cocompactly on buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In several instances, the invariants of compactly generated totally disconnected locally compact groups acting on locally finite buildings can be conveniently described via invariants of the Coxeter group representing the type of the building. For certain totally disconnected locally compact groups acting on buildings, we establish and collect several results concerning, for example, the rational discrete cohomological dimension (cf. Thm. A), the flat-rank (cf. Thm. C) and the number of ends (cf. Cor. K). Moreover, for an arbitrary compactly generated totally disconnected locally compact group, we express the number of ends in terms of its cohomology groups (cf. Thm. J). Furthermore, generalising a result of F. Haglund and F. Paulin, we prove that visual graph of groups decompositions of a Coxeter group $(W,S)$ can be used to construct trees from buildings of type $(W,S)$. We exploit the latter result to show that all $\sigma$-compact totally disconnected locally compact groups acting chamber-transitively on buildings can be decomposed accordingly to any visual graph of groups decomposition of the type $(W,S)$ (cf. Thm. F and Cor. G).</description>

      <title>Large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for zeros in character tables of symmetric groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a brief report on some recent large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for approximating the density of zeros in character tables of large symmetric groups. Previous computations suggested that a large fraction of zeros cannot be explained by classical vanishing results. Our computations eclipse previous ones and suggest that the opposite is true. We find empirically that almost all of the zeros are of a single classical type.</description>

      <title>The Period of Ducci Cycles on $\mathbb{Z}_{2^l}$ for Tuples of Length $2^k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let the Ducci function $D: \mathbb{Z}_m^n \to \mathbb{Z}_m^n$ be defined as
  \[D(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)=(x_1+x_2 \; \text{mod} \; m, x_2+x_3 \; \text{mod} \; m, ..., x_n+x_1 \; \text{mod} \; m)\]
  and let the Ducci sequence of $\mathbf{u}$ be the sequence $\{D^{\alpha}(\mathbf{u})\}_{\alpha=0}^{\infty}$.
  %In this paper, we will prove that if $n,m$ are powers of $2$, then repeatedly applying $D$ will eventually result in $(0,0,...,0)$, as well as establish an upper bound for how many iterations it will take for this to happen.
  In this paper, we will provide another proof that for $n=2^k$ and $m=2^l$, that all Ducci sequences will end in $(0,0,...,0)$ and additionally prove that this will happen in at most $2^{k-1}(l+1)$ iterations of $D$.</description>

      <title>Ducci on $\mathbb{Z}_m^n$ and the Maximum Length for $n$ Odd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Define the Ducci function $D: \mathbb{Z}_m^n \to \mathbb{Z}_m^n$ so \[D(x_1,x_2, ...,x_n)=(x_1+x_2 \;\text{mod} \; m, x_2+x_3 \; \text{mod} \; m, ..., x_n+x_1 \; \text{mod} \; m).\]
  Call $\{D^{\alpha}(\mathbf{u})\}_{\alpha=0}^{\infty}$ the Ducci sequence of $\mathbf{u}$. Because $\mathbb{Z}_m^n$ is finite, every Ducci sequence will enter a cycle. In this paper, we will prove that if $n$ is odd and $m=2^lm_1$ where $m_1$ is odd, then the longest it will take for a Ducci sequence to enter its cycle is $l$ iterations. Furthermore, we will prove the set of all tuples in a cycle for $\mathbb{Z}_m^n$ is $\{(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \in \mathbb{Z}_m^n \; \mid \; x_1+x_2+ \cdots +x_n \equiv 0 \; \text{mod} \; 2^l\}$.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strict lower bound for the diameter of a symmetric graph is proposed, which is calculable with the order ($n$) and other local parameters of the graph such as the degree ($k$), even girth $g$ ($\geq 4$), and number of $g$-cycles traversing a vertex, which are easily determined by inspecting a small portion of the graph (unless the girth is large). It is applied to the symmetric Cayley graphs of some Rubik's Cube groups of various sizes and metrics, yielding slightly tighter lower bounds of the diameters than those for random $k$-regular graphs proposed by Bollob\'{a}s and de la Vega. They range from 60% to 77% of the correct diameters of large-$n$ graphs.</description>
