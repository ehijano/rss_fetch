      <title>A novel framework for disinfection analisys in drinking water networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disinfection in drinking water networks is performed to ensure water safety and potability. However, disinfectants can react with organic compounds present in the water networks. The reaction of disinfectants with such compounds generates byproducts that could be dangerous for human health. The compounds are generally endogenous, i.e., adhered or/and released by the pipe wall, and not introduced from reservoirs because water utilities efficiently monitor and manage their water quality. The present effort, starting from the relevant scientific literature, proposes a novel framework which is based on analysing the disinfectant consumption using a second order kinetic model. The novel framework allows analysing the two endogenous mechanisms of compounds reactions: the first mechanism refers to compounds detached by the momentum of water flow and reacting into the bulk while transported by flow, the second one refers to local reaction at wall. The use of a chemically based second order kinetic model, furthermore, allows for emphasizing the role of stoichiometry and reaction rate constants of reactants and byproducts as relevant parameters to be evaluated at laboratory scale for the specific water system. Thus, the proposed framework can effectively support water quality management using monitoring data together with hydraulic modelling. Two real water distribution systems, located in southern Italy and managed by Acquedotto Pugliese, were used as case studies: the small-sized network of Monteparano and the large-sized one of Bari.</description>

      <title>Impact of ligand (OH) deformation on LuOH$^+$ rovibrational spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triatomic cation $^{175}$LuOH$^+$, featuring near-degenerate, opposite-parity $l$-doublets, offers enhanced sensitivity to $\mathcal{P}$- and $\mathcal{T}$-violating interactions. We present \emph{ab initio} calculations of its electronic structure and rovibrational structure beyond the rigid-ligand approximation by explicitly including OH-ligand deformation together with bending and stretching motions. Potential-energy surfaces are computed at the relativistic coupled cluster level of theory. The nuclear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in Jacobi coordinates is solved by means of a coupled-channel expansion. Ligand deformation reduces the bending frequency by a few percent and increases the $l$-doubling constant $q$, while the stretching frequencies and rotational constants remain largely unchanged. For the first excited bending level, we predict $\Delta E_{J=1}=2q \approx 24.9$--$26.4$ MHz. These results establish LuOH$^+$ as a viable platform for precision searches for $\mathcal{CP}$-violating physics via the electron electric dipole moment and the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment.</description>

      <title>Re-Engineering Hematite: Synergistic Co-Doping Routes to Efficient Solar Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar-driven water electrolysis requires high-performance photoelectrodes that exhibit excellent photoabsorption, superior charge transport, and optimized thermal management. In this work, we conducted a first-principles investigation to explore optimized doping conditions for hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$) by incorporating boron (B), yttrium (Y), and niobium (Nb) mono-dopants, as well as (B, Y) and (B, Nb) co-dopants. To identify the optimal dopant elements and concentrations, we evaluated electronic charge transport, thermal properties, and magnetic susceptibility over a temperature ($T$) range of 300 to 900 K and doping densities ($N$) from $10^{19}$ to $10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$. The B-doped, (B, Y)-doped, and (B, Nb)-doped $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ photoelectrodes showed significantly reduced band gap energy ($E_g$) relative to $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. In comparison, Y and Nb dopants only slightly reduced $E_g$ relative to $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. While B doping introduced impurity states near the Fermi level that limited thermoelectric charge transport, $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ photoelectrodes doped by other elements exhibited notable improvements, including enhanced visible-light absorption, increased carrier concentration, improved electrical conductivity ($\sigma$), and efficient thermal management. Additionally, these doped photoelectrodes exhibited a remarkable increase in Pauli magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) by two orders of magnitude compared to pristine $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, indicating exciting potential for generating spin-selective polarized currents. Overall, our findings revealed that the co-doping conditions are the most effective for enhancing the performance of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, providing a low-cost and high-efficiency solution for sustainable green hydrogen (H$_2$) generation in photocatalytic water splitting.</description>

      <title>Clay Edges Are Dynamic Proton-conducting Networks Modulated by Structure and pH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Montmorillonite, a ubiquitous clay mineral, plays a vital role in geochemical and environmental processes due to its chemically complex edge surfaces. However, the molecular-scale acid-base reactivity of these interfaces remains poorly understood due to the limitations of both experimental resolution and conventional simulations. Here, we employ machine learning potentials with first-principles accuracy to perform nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations of montmorillonite nanoparticles across a range of pH. Our results reveal clear amphoteric behavior: edge sites undergo protonation in acidic environments and deprotonation in basic conditions. Even at neutral pH, spontaneous and directional proton transfer events are common, proceeding via both direct and solvent-mediated pathways. These findings demonstrate that montmorillonite edges are not static arrays of hydroxyl groups but dynamic, proton-conducting networks whose reactivity is modulated by local structure and solution conditions. This work offers a molecular-level framework for understanding proton transport and buffering in clay-water systems, with broad implications for catalysis, ion exchange, and environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating Anomalous Electric Fields at the Air-Water Interface: A Surface-Specific Spectroscopic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion that large electric fields at the air-water interface catalyze spontaneous chemical reactions has sparked significant debate, with far reaching implications for atmospheric chemistry and interfacial reactivity. Using vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy, we test this hypothesis by directly comparing local electric field strengths at the air-water interface and in bulk water. By applying established vibrational frequency-to-field mappings to the OH stretch of interfacial and bulk water, we extract effective electric field distributions under ambient conditions. Contrary to prevailing claims, our results reveal no spectroscopic evidence for exceptionally strong or long-lived interfacial electric fields. Instead, bulk water consistently exhibits broader distributions and statistically larger field magnitudes. The absence of key spectral signatures, such as redshifted continua, or slowed spectral diffusion, further undermines the idea of anomalous surface fields. Our findings call into question the growing narrative that electrostatic forces at pristine and charge neutral water surfaces can drive chemical reactions and instead highlight the importance of rigorous spectroscopic benchmarks when evaluating interfacial phenomena.</description>

      <title>GridFF: Efficient Simulation of Organic Molecules on Rigid Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GridFF, an efficient method for simulating molecules on rigid substrates, derived from techniques used in protein-ligand docking in biochemistry. By projecting molecule-substrate interactions onto precomputed spatial grids with tricubic B-spline interpolation, GridFF reduces the computational cost by orders of magnitude compared to traditional pairwise atomistic models, without compromising the accuracy of forces or trajectories. The CPU implementation of GridFF in the open-source FireCore package provides a 100-1000x speedup over all-atom simulations using LAMMPS, while the GPU implementation - running thousands of system replicas in parallel - samples millions of configurations per second, enabling an exhaustive exploration of the configuration space of small flexible molecules on surfaces within minutes. Furthermore, as demonstrated in our previous application of a similar technique to high-resolution scanning probe microscopy, GridFF can be extended beyond empirical pairwise potentials to those derived from ab initio electron densities. Altogether, this unlocks accurate high-throughput modeling of molecular self-assembly, adsorption, and scanning probe manipulation in surface science.</description>

      <title>LoUQAL: Low-fidelity informed Uncertainty Quantification for Active Learning in the chemical configuration space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important scheme in active learning techniques, including applications in predicting quantum chemical properties. In quantum chemical calculations, there exists the notion of a fidelity, a less accurate computation is accessible at a cheaper computational cost. This work proposes a novel low-fidelity informed uncertainty quantification for active learning with applications in predicting diverse quantum chemical properties such as excitation energies and \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces. Computational experiments are carried out in order to assess the proposed method with results demonstrating that models trained with the novel method outperform alternatives in terms of empirical error and number of iterations required. The effect of the choice of fidelity is also studied to perform a thorough benchmark.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Reliability of Truncated Coupled Cluster Wavefunction: Estimating the Distance from the Exact Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach is proposed to assess the reliability of the truncated wavefunction methods by estimating the deviation from the full configuration interaction (FCI) wavefunction. While typical multireference diagnostics compare some derived property of the solution with the ideal picture of a single determinant, we try to answer a more practical question, how far is the solution from the exact one. Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to provide an approximate FCI solution for the self-consistently determined relevant active space, we compare the low-level CI expansions and one-body reduced density matrixes to determine the distance of the two solutions ($\tilde{d}_\Phi$, $\tilde{d}_\gamma$). We demonstrate the applicability of the approach for the CCSD method by benchmarking on the W4-17 dataset, as well as on transition metal-containing species. We also show that the presented moderate-cost, purely wavefunction-based metric is truly unique in the sense that it does not correlate with any popular multireference measures. We also explored the usage of CCSD natural orbitals ($\tilde{d}_{\gamma,\mathrm{NO}}$) and its effect on the active space size and the metric. The proposed diagnostic can also be applied to other wavefunction approximations, and it has the potential to provide a quality measure for post-Hartree-Fock procedures in general.</description>

      <title>Metatensor and metatomic: foundational libraries for interoperable atomistic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporation of machine learning (ML) techniques into atomic-scale modeling has proven to be an extremely effective strategy to improve the accuracy and reduce the computational cost of simulations. It also entails conceptual and practical challenges, as it involves combining very different mathematical foundations, as well as software ecosystems that are very well developed in their own merit, but do not share many commonalities. To address these issues and facilitate the adoption of ML in atomistic simulations we introduce two dedicated software libraries. The first one, metatensor, provides cross-platform and cross-language storage and manipulation of arrays with many potentially sparse indices, designed from the ground up for atomistic ML applications. By combining the actual values with metadata that describes their nature and that facilitates the handling of geometric information and gradients with respect to the atomic positions, metatensor provides a common framework to enable data sharing between ML software - typically written in Python - and established atomistic modeling tools - typically written in Fortran, C or C++. The second library, metatomic, provides an interface to store an atomistic ML model and metadata about this model in a portable way, facilitating the implementation, training and distribution of models, and their use across different simulation packages. We showcase a growing ecosystem of tools, from low-level libraries, training utilities, to interfaces with existing software packages that demonstrate the effectiveness of metatensor and metatomic in bridging the gap between traditional simulation software and modern ML frameworks.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-Based Periodic Grand Canonical Density Functional Theory with Implicit Solvation for Computational Electrochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for grand canonical density functional theory (DFT) tailored to solid-state systems, employing Gaussian-type orbitals as the primary basis. Our approach directly minimizes the grand canonical free energy using the density matrix as the sole variational parameter, while self-consistently updating the electron number between self-consistent field iterations. To enable realistic electrochemical modeling, we integrate this approach with implicit solvation models. Our solvation scheme introduces less than 50% overhead relative to gas-phase calculations. Compared to existing plane wave-based implementations, our method shows improved robustness in grand canonical simulations. We validate the approach by modeling corrosion at silver surfaces, finding excellent agreement with previous studies. This work lays the groundwork for future wavefunction-based simulations beyond DFT under electrochemical operando conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Dynamics of the Helix-Coil Transition in Polyalanine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the nonequilibrium pathways of the collapse of the helix-forming biopolymer polyalanine are investigated. To this end, the full time evolution of the helix-coil transition is simulated using molecular dynamics simulations. At the start of the transition short $3_{10}$-helices form, seemingly leading to the molecule becoming more aspherical midway through the collapse. After the completed collapse, the formation of $\alpha$-helices seems to become the prevalent ordering mechanism leading to helical bundles, a structure representative for the equilibrium behavior of longer chains. The dynamics of this transition is explored in terms of the power-law scaling of two associated relaxation times as a function of the chain length.</description>

      <title>Octahedral tilting and B-site off-centering in halide perovskites are not coupled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites show exceptional potential for solar energy, thermoelectrics, catalysis, and other photochemical technologies, with performance rooted in electronic structure-driven properties. In ABX3 halide perovskites, localized and often aspherical local electron densities from B-site lone pairs or polarizable X- anions can distort the lattice. However, the links among electronic structure fluctuations and distortions like tilting of the BX6 octahedra and off-centering of the B-site from the center of its octahedron are not fully understood. Using group theory and ab initio molecular dynamics, we quantify how lone pairs, halide polarization, off-centering, and octahedral tilting interact in the cubic phase CsBBr3, with B = Pb, Sn, and Ge. We find that lone pair-induced off-centering and octahedral tilting are symmetry-decoupled. Instead, stereochemical lone pair expression of the B-site ion is correlated to octahedral tilting through the propensity of the B-site to form a transient, partial covalent bond with the surrounding halide ions that stiffens octahedral tilting modes. These results link local electronic asymmetry to structural fluctuations and suggest that dynamic modulation of electronic symmetry offers a pathway to control functional properties in halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Regularized Perturbation Theory for Ab initio Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) for ab initio simulations of solids is often limited by divergence or over-correlation issues, particularly in metallic, narrow-gap, and dispersion-stabilized systems. We develop and assess three regularized second-order perturbation theories: $\kappa$-MP2, $\sigma$-MP2, and the size-consistent Brillouin-Wigner approach (BW-s2), across metals, semiconductors, molecular crystals, and rare gas solids. BW-s2 achieves high accuracy for cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli in metals, semiconductors, and molecular crystals, rivaling or surpassing coupled-cluster with singles and doubles at lower cost. In rare gas solids, where MP2 already underbinds, $\kappa$-MP2 does not make the results much worse while BW-s2 struggles. These results illustrate both the potential and the limitations of regularized perturbation theory for efficient and accurate solid-state simulations. While broader testing is warranted, BW-s2($\alpha$ = 2) appears particularly promising, with possible advantages over modern random-phase approximations and coupled-cluster theory.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Multiwavelets and DMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</description>

      <title>"Ensemblization" of density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has transformed our ability to investigate and understand electronic ground states. In its original formulation, however, DFT is not suited to addressing (e.g.) degenerate ground states, mixed states with different particle numbers, or excited states. All these issues can be handled, in principle exactly, via ensemble DFT (EDFT). This Perspective provides a detailed introduction to and analysis of EDFT, in an in-principle exact framework that is constructed to avoid uncontrolled errors and inconsistencies that may be associated with {\it ad hoc} extensions of conventional DFT. In particular, it focuses on the "ensemblization" of both exact and approximate density functionals, a term we coin to describe a rigorous approach that lends itself to the construction of novel approximations consistent with the general ensemble framework, yet applicable to practical problems where traditional DFT tends to fail or does not apply at all. Specifically, symmetry considerations and ensemble properties are shown to enable each other in shaping a practical DFT-based methodology that extends beyond the ground state and, in doing so, highlights the need to look outside the standard ground state Kohn-Sham treatment.</description>

      <title>MC-PDFT Nuclear Gradients and L-PDFT Energies with Meta and Hybrid Meta On-Top Functionals for Ground- and Excited-State Geometry Optimization and Vertical Excitation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) is a post-MCSCF multireference electronic-structure method that explicitly models strong electron correlation, and linearized pair-density functional theory (L-PDFT) is a recently developed multi-state extension that can accurately model conical intersections and locally-avoided crossings. Because MC-PDFT and L-PDFT rely on an on-top energy functional, their accuracy depends on the quality of the on-top functional used. Recent work has introduced translated meta-gradient-approximation (meta-GA) on-top functionals, and specifically the MC23 hybrid meta-GA on-top functional, which is the first on-top functional specifically optimized for MC-PDFT. Here we report the derivation and implementation of analytic nuclear gradients for MC-PDFT calculations using meta-GA and hybrid meta-GA on-top functionals. This development also enables analytic nuclear gradients for the widely successful tPBE0 hybrid on-top functional. Because MC-PDFT nuclear-gradient calculations involve the derivative of the on-top functional, this development also enables the use of meta-GA on-top functionals in L-PDFT single-point energy calculations. We use the new capabilities to test MC23 for ground-state geometries, excited-state geometries, and vertical excitation energies of s-trans-butadiene and benzophenone as well as to test MC23, another hybrid meta-GA, and seven other meta-GA on-top functionals for 441 vertical excitation energies. We find MC23 performs the best of all nine meta and hybrid meta functionals for vertical excitation energies and is comparable in accuracy to tPBE0 and to the NEVPT2 multireference wave function method. Additionally, we directly compare our MC-PDFT vertical excitation results to previously computed TD-DFT values and find that MC-PDFT outperforms even the best performing Kohn-Sham density functional.</description>

      <title>Electron-Transfer and Exchange-Interaction Model of the Ligand Hyperfine Structure of Alkylated Iron-Sulfur Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iron-sulfur clusters conduct a wide variety of biochemical reactions that are conserved across all domains of life. The hyperfine structure of reactive ligands of these clusters can be studied experimentally and theoretically by means of hyperfine spectroscopy, which can reveal catalytic intermediates in these biochemical processes. Their theoretical prediction, however, requires either advanced methods that describe strongly correlated systems, or Hamiltonian modeling based on symmetry-broken electronic structure methods. This work shows that the addition of electron-transfer interactions to the Heisenberg-Dirac-van Vleck Hamiltonian model leads to the quantitative explanation of hyperfine coupling constants at active organic ligand sites. Comparison with experimentally available results confirms our extended approach can be used in calculations aimed at describing cutting-edge systems.</description>

      <title>On the Onset of Coherent Phonon Motion in Peierls-Distorted Antimony by Attosecond Transient Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy measurements on the Peierls-distorted phase of the semimetal antimony (Sb) are presented. After excitation by an ultrashort, broad band near-infrared (NIR) pulse, the distortion is (partly) lifted causing the well-known coherent phonon motion of the lattice. While the overall observed dynamics generally follow a displacive excitation model, a delayed onset of the pump-induced carrier dynamics due to hot-carrier thermalization is observed, as well as a large spectral phase dependence in the coherent phonon oscillation. This is attributed to significantly different carrier relaxation timescales for carrier energies above and near the Fermi level of the semimetal and corroborated by a simple theoretical model that considers the carrier relaxation timescales in the displacive phonon model to explain the observed dynamics. Our results provide direct experimental evidence about the role of carrier-relaxation in the origin of displacive coherent phonon motion.</description>

      <title>Resolving exciton and polariton multi-particle correlations in an optical microcavity in the strong coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14744v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-particle correlations of exciton-polaritons and reservoir-excitons in the strong light-matter coupling regime dictate the quantum dynamics of optical microcavities. In this letter, we examine the many-body exciton-polariton dynamics in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity of a two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductor over timescales involving polariton ($\ll 1$\,ps) and exciton ($\gg 1$\,ps) scattering. We find enhanced exciton nonlinear dynamics in the microcavity versus the bare semiconductor, concomitant with ultrafast polariton scattering dynamics. We measure, by means of coherent spectroscopy, the coupling between exciton-polaritons, bright excitons, and reservoir-excitons that highlight the complex scattering landscape that fundamentally drives polariton condensation.</description>

      <title>Integrating Density Functional Theory with Deep Neural Networks for Accurate Voltage Prediction in Alkali-Metal-Ion Battery Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the voltage of battery materials plays a pivotal role in the advancement of energy storage technologies and the rational design of high-performance cathode materials. In this work, we present a deep neural network (DNN) model, built using PyTorch, to estimate the average voltage of cathode materials across Li-ion, Na-ion, and other alkali-metal-ion batteries. The model is trained on an extensive dataset from the Materials Project, incorporating a wide range of specific structural, physical, chemical, electronic, thermodynamic, and battery descriptors, ensuring a comprehensive representation of material properties. Our model exhibits strong predictive performance, as corroborated by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The close alignment between the DNN predictions and the DFT outcomes highlights the robustness and accuracy of our machine learning framework to effectively select and identify viable battery materials. Using this validated model, we successfully proposed novel Na-ion battery compositions, with their predicted behavior confirmed by rigorous computational assessment. By seamlessly integrating data-driven prediction with first-principles validation, this study presents an effective framework that significantly accelerates the discovery and optimization of advanced battery materials, contributing to the development of more reliable and efficient energy storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Bridging Electrostatic Screening and Ion Transport in Lithium Salt-Doped Ionic Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alkali salt-doped ionic liquids are emerging as promising electrolyte systems for energy applications, owing to their excellent interfacial stability. To address their limited ionic conductivity, various strategies have been proposed, including modifying the ion solvation environment and enhancing the transport of selected ions (e.g., Li$^+$). Despite the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions in determining key physicochemical properties, their influence on ion transport in such systems has received relatively little attention. In this work, we investigate the connection between ion transport and electrostatic screening using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([pyr$_{14}$][TFSI]) doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at molar fractions x$_{LiTFSI}$ $\le$ 0.3. We find that the charge-charge and density-density correlation functions exhibit oscillatory exponential decay, indicating that LiTFSI doped [pyr$_{14}$][TFSI] is a charge- and mass-dense system. The electrostatic screening length decreases with increasing LiTFSI concentration, whereas the decay length of the density-density correlation functions remains nearly unchanged. Notably, we find that the x$_{LiTFSI}$-sensitive screening length serves as a central length scale for disentangling species-specific contributions of ion pairs to collective ion transport upon LiTFSI doping. This framework provides a unifying perspective on the interplay between structure and transport in ionic liquid systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the attractive electrosolvation force between colloidal particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct measurement of the pair interaction potential between electrically like-charged particles in solution reveals a strong and long-ranged attractive force. This counterintuitive attraction has been suggested to arise from the orientation of solvent molecules at the interface between the object and the electrolyte. Measuring interactions between charged microspheres carrying a variety of surface chemistries reveals that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held. Furthermore, the length scale governing the decay of the attractive force depends on particle properties. The observations highlight significant departures from current thinking and the need for a model of interparticle interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations.</description>
