      <title>Thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the evolution of low-temperature thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice models without symmetry breaking. This transition moves from a heavy Fermi liquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to an 'FL*' state, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is driven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge under an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random Kondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical transport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower. Our findings are consistent with recent observations in heavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao {\it et al.\/}, arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an enhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a non-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side.
  Our results also apply to single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In the ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an {\it inverted\/} Kondo lattice transition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the condensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower on the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the cuprates (C. Collignon {\it et al.\/}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 103}, 155102 (2021); A. Gourgout {\it et al.\/}, Phys. Rev. X {\bf 12}, 011037 (2022)). We argue that these observations support a non-symmetry-breaking Fermi-volume-changing transition as the underlying description of the onset of the pseudogap in the cuprates.</description>

      <title>Giant number-parity effect leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking in finite-size quantum spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) occurs when a many-body system governed by a symmetric Hamiltonian, and prepared in a symmetry-broken state by the application of a field coupling to its order parameter $O$, retains a finite $O$ value even after the field is switched off. SSB is generally thought to occur only in the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$ (for $N$ degrees of freedom). In this limit, the time to restore the symmetry once the field is turned off, either via thermal or quantum fluctuations, is expected to diverge. Here we show that SSB can also be observed in \emph{finite-size} quantum spin systems, provided that three conditions are met: 1) the ground state of the system has long-range correlations; 2) the Hamiltonian conserves the (spin) parity of the order parameter; and 3) $N$ is odd. Using a combination of analytical arguments and numerical results (based on time-dependent variational Monte Carlo and rotor+spin-wave theory), we show that SSB on finite-size systems can be achieved via a quasi-adiabatic preparation of the ground state -- which, in U(1)-symmetric systems, is shown to require a symmetry breaking field vanishing over time scales $\tau \sim O(N)$. In these systems, the symmetry-broken state exhibits spin squeezing with Heisenberg scaling.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy for the one-dimensional flat-band ferromagnetic Tasaki model: spontaneous symmetry breaking with one type-B Goldstone mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional flat-band ferromagnetic Tasaki model exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking from ${\rm SU}(2)$ to ${\rm U}(1)$ with one type-B Goldstone mode, featuring that the highest weight state is entangled at quarter filling, but there is always a choice to keep the highest weight state unentangled away from quarter filling. It is found that the ground-state degeneracies under both periodic and open boundary conditions constitute essentially the Fibonacci sequences, behaving asymptotically as the golden spiral - a self-similar geometric object. A set of orthonormal basis states are generated from the repeated action of the lowering operator of the symmetry group ${\rm SU}(2)$ on the highest weight state at a specific filling. In particular, it is possible to construct the orthonormal basis states reflecting an abstract fractal underlying the ground-state subspace, which are permutation-invariant away from quarter filling, but not at quarter filling. As a consequence, there exists a singularity that accounts for the emergence of the saturated flat-band ferromagnetism at quarter filling. We perform a systematic finite system-size scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy, thus confirming that it scales logarithmically with the block size in the thermodynamic limit, with the prefactor being half the number of type-B Goldstone modes, for the orthonormal basis states at and away from quarter filling.</description>

      <title>Topological strongly correlated phases in orthorhombic diamond lattice compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the Mott transition in orthorhombic diamond lattices relevant to (ET)Ag$_4$(CN)$_5$ molecular compounds. The non-interacting phases include nodal line, Dirac and/or Weyl semimetals depending on the strength of spin-orbit coupling and the degree of dimerization of the lattice. Based on an extension of slave-rotor mean-field theory which accounts for magnetic order, we find a transition from a semimetal to a paramagnetic Mott insulator at a critical $U_c$ which becomes N\'eel ordered at a larger Coulomb repulsion, $U_{cm}&gt;U_{c}$. The resulting intermediate Mott phase is a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) consisting on spinon preserving the nodal structure of the nearby semimetallic phases. An analysis of the Green's function in this Mott phase shows how the zeros follow the spinon band dispersions carrying the topology while the poles describe the Hubbard bands. Our results are relevant to recent observations in (ET)Ag$_4$(CN)$_5$ molecular compounds in which the ambient pressure N\'eel ordered Mott insulator is gradually suppressed until semimetallic behavior arises at larger pressures.</description>

      <title>On the relation between fractional charge and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Ro\v{c}ek, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Observation of distorted tilted conical phase at the surface of a bulk chiral magnet with resonant elastic x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on various magnetic configurations including spirals and skyrmions at the surface of the magnetic insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ at low temperatures with a magnetic field applied along &lt;100&gt; using resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS). We observe a well-ordered surface state referred to as a distorted tilted conical spiral (TC) phase over a wide range of magnetic fields. The distorted TC phase shows characteristic higher harmonic magnetic satellites in the REXS reciprocal space maps. Skyrmions emerge following static magnetic field cycling and appear to coexist with the distorted TC phase. Our results indicate that this phase represents a distinct and stable surface state that does not disappear with field cycling and persists until the field strength is increased sufficiently to create the field-polarized state.</description>

      <title>Mean-field analysis of a Hubbard interaction on Bernal Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculations on the 2D Hubbard model on a honeycomb and bilayer honeycomb lattice at both zero and finite temperatures. Finite size real space calculations are supplemented with RPA calculations in the thermodynamic limit. Our motivation comes from high doping levels achieved in graphene and Bernal bilayer graphene by interacalation. We present phase diagrams in doping and temperature for a moderate Hubbard interaction. The magnetic states we find are classified systematically based on the dominant Fourier components of their spin patterns, their average magnetization and spin incommensurabilities. The dominant spin patterns are N\'eel order and various types of stripes. Around Van Hove filling, we resolve the competition between stripe and chiral spin density waves in the symmetry-broken regime. We also investigate the effect of an applied external displacement field on the spin patterns of BBG.</description>

      <title>Exact correlation functions at finite temperatures in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with an open end</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paradigmatic state of a 1D collective metal, the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), offers us an exact analytic solution for a strongly interacting quantum system not only for infinite systems at zero temperature but also at finite temperature and with a boundary. Potentially, these results are of high relevance for technology as they could lay the foundation for a many-body description of various nanostructures. For this to happen, we need expressions for local (i.e., spatially resolved) correlations as a function of frequency. In this study, we find such expressions and study their outcome. Based on our analytic expressions we are able to identify two distinct cases of TLL which we call Coulomb metal and Hund metal, respectively. We argue that these two cases span all the situations possible in nanotubes made out of p-block elements. From an applications viewpoint, it is crucial to capture the fact that the end of the 1D system can be coupled with the external environment and emit electrons into it. We discuss such coupling on two levels for both Coulomb and Hund metals: i) in the zeroth order approximation, the coupling modifies the 1D system's boundary conditions; ii) stronger coupling, when the environment can self-consistently modify the 1D system, we introduce spatially dependent TLL parameters. In case ii) we were able to capture the presence of plasmon-polariton particles, thus building a link between TLL and the field of nano-optics.</description>

      <title>Identifying and quantifying Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like interactions with RIXS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)-like electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions can drive the formation of light (bi)polarons and several novel states of matter. It is, therefore, prudent to develop experimental protocols for identifying such couplings in real materials and quantifying their strength. Here, we investigate how resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) probes e-ph interactions in the one-dimensional half-filled Hubbard-SSH model with onsite phonons. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we compute the full RIXS response and find that the lattice excitations generated during the scattering process inevitably couple to the system's charge and magnetic sectors, resulting in combined multi-particle excitations that cannot be easily disentangled from one another. While this aspect complicates the interpretation of RIXS experiments, we outline how it can be leveraged to identify and quantify SSH-like interactions in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a non-Hermitian phase transition in a bulk condensed-matter system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions are fundamental in nature. A small parameter change near a critical point leads to a qualitative change in system properties. Across a regular phase transition, the system remains in thermal equilibrium and, therefore, experiences a change of static properties, like the emergence of a magnetisation upon cooling a ferromagnet below the Curie temperature. When driving a system far from equilibrium, novel, otherwise inaccessible quantum states of matter may arise. Such states are typically non-Hermitian, that is, their dynamics break time-reversal symmetry, a basic law of equilibrium physics. Phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems are of fundamentally new nature in that the dynamical behaviour rather than static properties may undergo a qualitative change at a critical, here called exceptional point. Here we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian phase transition in a bulk condensed-matter system. Optical excitation creates charge carriers in the ferromagnetic semiconductor EuO. In a temperature-dependent interplay with the Hermitian transition to ferromagnetic order, a non-Hermitian change of the relaxation dynamics occurs, manifesting in our time-resolved reflection data as a transition from bi-exponential real to single-exponential complex decay. Our theory models this behavior and predicts non-Hermitian phase transitions for a large class of condensed-matter systems, where they may be exploited to sensitively control bulk-dynamic properties.</description>

      <title>Terbium under High Pressure: First-Principles Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elemental rare-earth metals provide a playground for studying novel electron correlation effects and complex magnetism. However, ab initio simulations of these systems remain challenging. Here, we employ fully charge self-consistent density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) to investigate terbium (Tb) metal under pressure. We show that Tb exhibits a strong band renormalization due to correlation effects, with the calculated electron density of states in good agreement with the experiments. At higher pressures, the correlated electronic structures persist but with modulation in the Hubbard gap, highlighting the tunability of effective Coulomb interactions and kinetic energies. Our DFT+DMFT calculations further indicate a ferromagnetic ground state of Tb at low pressure and low temperature, as well as a transition from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism at elevated temperatures. These ab initio results also align with the experiments. Our study paves the way for exploring heavy lanthanides via advanced first-principles simulations.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic preparation of a number-conserving atomic Majorana phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a protocol to adiabatically prepare the ground state of a widely discussed number-conserving model Hamiltonian for ultracold atoms in optical lattices that supports Majorana edge states. In particular, we introduce a symmetry breaking mass term that amounts to threading a commensurate (artificial) magnetic flux through the plaquettes of the considered two-leg ladder which opens a constant bulk gap. This enables the preparation of the topological Majorana phase from a trivial Mott insulator state with optimal asymptotic scaling of the ramp time in system size, which is linear owing to the critical nature of the target state. Using constructive bosonization techniques that account for both finite size effects and global fermion number conservation, we are able to fully explain with theory the somewhat counterintuitive necessity of the aforementioned commensurate flux for a controlled bulk gap. Our analytical predictions are corroborated and quantified by unbiased numerical matrix product states (MPS) simulations. Directly building up on previous experimental work, the crucial flux-term of the proposed protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art experimental techniques in atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Operator K-complexity in DSSYK: Krylov complexity equals bulk length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the notion of complexity under time evolution in chaotic quantum systems with holographic duals. Continuing on from our previous work, we turn our attention to the issue of Krylov complexity upon the insertion of a class of single-particle operators in the double-scaled SYK model. Such an operator is described by a matter-chord insertion, which splits the theory into left/right sectors, allowing us, via chord-diagram technology, to compute two different notions of complexity associated to the operator insertion: firstly the Krylov complexity of Heisenberg evolution, and secondly the complexity of a state obtained by an operator acting on the thermofield double state. We will provide both an analytical proof and detailed numerical evidence, that both Krylov complexities arise from a recursively defined basis of states characterized by a constant total chord number. As a consequence, in all cases we are able to establish that Krylov complexity is given by the expectation value of a length operator acting on the Hilbert space of the theory, expressed in terms of basis states, organized by left and right chord number. We find analytical expressions for the semiclassical limit of K-complexity, and study how the size of the operator encodes the scrambling dynamics upon the matter insertion in Krylov language. We furthermore determine the effective Hamiltonian governing the evolution of K-complexity, showing that evolution on the Krylov chain can equivalently be understood as a particle moving in a Morse potential. A particular type of triple scaling limit allows to access the gravitational sector of the theory, in which the geometrical nature of K-complexity is assured by virtue of being a total chord length, in an analogous fashion to what was found for the K-complexity of the thermofield double state.</description>

      <title>Scaling theory of fading ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In most noninteracting quantum systems, the scaling theory of localization predicts one-parameter scaling flow in both ergodic and localized regimes. On the other hand, it is expected that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis breaks down for interacting systems that exhibit the many-body ergodicity breaking transition. Here we introduce a scaling theory of fading ergodicity, which is a precursor regime of many-body ergodicity breaking. We argue that the two-parameter scaling governs the entire ergodic regime; however, (i) it evolves into the one-parameter scaling at the ergodicity breaking critical point with the critical exponent $\nu=1$, and (ii) it gives rise to the resilient one-parameter scaling close to the ETH point. Our theoretical framework may serve as a building block for two-parameter scaling theories of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf non-invertible symmetry-protected topological spin liquid and lattice realization of (1+1)D symmetry topological field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce weak Hopf symmetry as a tool to explore (1+1)-dimensional topological phases with non-invertible symmetries. Drawing inspiration from Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), we construct a lattice model featuring two boundary conditions: one that encodes topological symmetry and another that governs non-topological dynamics. This cluster ladder model generalizes the well-known cluster state model. We demonstrate that the model exhibits weak Hopf symmetry, incorporating both the weak Hopf algebra and its dual. On a closed manifold, the symmetry reduces to cocommutative subalgebras of the weak Hopf algebra. Additionally, we introduce weak Hopf tensor network states to provide an exact solution for the model. As every fusion category corresponds to the representation category of some weak Hopf algebra, fusion category symmetry naturally corresponds to a subalgebra of the dual weak Hopf algebra. Consequently,the cluster ladder model offers a lattice realization of arbitrary fusion category symmetries.</description>

      <title>The density profile of a Coulomb plasma on a cylinder: boundary oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional one-component plasma (2D OCP) confined to a cylindrical geometry, focusing on density profiles, fluctuations, and their connection to bulk correlation functions. The cylindrical geometry eliminates geometric frustration, allowing for a precise study of boundary density oscillations, the dependence on boundary conditions, and their relationship to the melting transition and triangular lattice structure. By triangulating particle configurations, we quantify the exponential suppression of topological defects in the crystalline phase. Furthermore, we propose an oriented correlation function that better links boundary density profiles with bulk correlation functions, motivating anisotropic generalizations of the phase-field crystal (PFC) model. These results provide new insights into the interplay between boundary effects, bulk correlations, and phase transitions in the 2D OCP.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy scaling laws from fluctuations of non-conserved quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement patterns reveal essential information on many-body states and provide a way to classify quantum phases of matter. However, experimental studies of many-body entanglement remain scarce due to their unscalable nature. The present work aims to mitigate this theoretical and experimental divide by introducing reduced fluctuations of observables, consisting of a sum of on-site operators, as a scalable experimental probe of the entanglement entropy. Specifically, we illustrate by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations in spin chains that the reduced fluctuations exhibit the same size scaling properties as the entanglement entropy. Generalizing previous observations restricted to special systems with conserved quantities, our work introduces experimentally feasible protocol to extract entanglement scaling laws.</description>

      <title>QUANTUM ESPRESSO implementation of the RPA-based functional</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detail our implementation of the random-phase-approximation based functional (RPAF) derived in our previous publication [Phys. Rev. B 110, 195151 (2024)] for the QUANTUM ESPRESSO (QE) package. We also make available the source files required in order to apply this functional within QE. We also provide the corresponding RPAF projector augmented wave (PAW) and ultrasolf pseudopotentials for most elements. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the RPAF by calculating the equilibrium lattice constant and bulk modulus of a set of the same 60 crystals used by other authors to benchmark other functionals for both PAW and ultrasoft pseudopotentials. We find that the RPAF performs better overall as compared to the other most popular functionals.</description>

      <title>Twist-tuned quantum criticality in moir\'e bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that moir\'e bilayer graphene at charge neutrality hosts a continuous semimetal-to-insulator quantum phase transition that can be accessed experimentally by tuning the twist angle between the two layers. For small twist angles near the first magic angle, the system realizes a Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator, characterized by circulating currents and spontaneously broken time reversal and U(1) valley symmetries. For larger twist angles above a critical value, the spectrum remains gapless down to the lowest temperatures, with a fully symmetric Dirac semimetal ground state. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory applied to a realistic model of twisted bilayer graphene, based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian augmented by screened Coulomb interactions, we find that the twist-tuned quantum phase transition is continuous. We argue that the quantum critical behavior belongs to the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY universality class, and we characterize it through an effective field theory analysis. Our theoretical predictions can be directly tested using current experimental setups incorporating the recently developed quantum twisting microscope.</description>

      <title>Local structure and phonon states mediated by intercalation-driven doping in superconducting $Li_{1.0}(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intercalation of two-dimensional (2D) iron chalcogenides with molecular species requires disentangling electronic and structural contributions to understand the puzzling limit to superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) at the frontier of long interlayer separations. Here, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Se K-edge sheds light on the impact of carrier-doping on the local structure of the high-$T_c$ (~39 K) $Li_{1.0}(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$ phase. This material is derived by annealing the structurally related as-made derivative ($T_c$~ 44 K), with layers being primed apart by [alkali-molecule] guests. Metrics, such as, a reduced filling of Se $4p$ orbitals and shorter Fe-Se bonds in the annealed phase, corroborate to a lower electron doping level with respect to the as-made one. Analysis of the metal-ligand thermal motion, based on the correlated Debye model, further relates the higher $T_c$ intercalates with the softening of the local Fe-Se bond. Beyond electronic effects, intercalation brings forth host-guest interactions that mediate the dynamics of the bulk crystal structure. For this, neutron time-of-flight spectroscopy on the annealed derivative, corroborates to the Se-Fe-Se layer being sensitive to chemical pressure effects imposed by the confined organic guests. This reflects in the phonon density of states, where harder low-energy transverse acoustic matrix phonons and molecular vibrations are witnessed, with respect to the pristine inorganic ($\beta$-FeSe) and organic ($C_5D_5N$) counterparts. On cooling through $T_c$, these excitations arrive without a collective magnetic-resonance mode - essential in unconventional, spin-mediated mechanisms - enquiring about deviations from optimal doping. The work highlights that when the Fe-square planes are tuned far apart, carrier-doping leveraged by intercalation plays a key role in the $T_c$ parametrization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a superconducting order featuring spatial pair modulations on the kagome lattice subject to onsite Hubbard U and nearest neighbor V interactions. Within our functional renormalization group analysis, this state appears with a concomitant d-wave superconducting (SC) instability at zero lattice momentum, where it distinguishes itself through intra-unit cell modulations of the pairing function thus breaking the discrete space group symmetry. The relative weight of the sublattice modulated superconductor (SMS) and d-wave SC is influenced by the absolute interaction strength and coupling ratio V /U . Parametrically adjacent to this domain at weak coupling, we find an intra-unit cell modulated vestigial charge density wave and an s-wave SC instability. Our study provides a microscopic setting and thorough description of this novel SMS arising within a translation symmetry broken background.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is one of the powerful computational approaches to study electron correlation effects in solid-state materials and molecules. Its practical applicability is, however, limited by the quantity of numerical resources required for the solution of the underlying auxiliary Anderson impurity model. Here, the one-to-one mapping between electronic orbitals and the state of a qubit register suggests a significant computational advantage for the use of a Quantum Computer (QC) for solving this task. In this work we present a QC approach to solve a two-site DMFT model based on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. We analyse the propagation of stachastic and device errors through the algorithm and their effects on the calculated self-energy. Therefore, we systematically compare results obtained on simulators with calculations on the IBMQ Ehningen QC hardware. We suggest a means to overcome unphysical features in the self-energy which already result from purely stochastic noise. Based heron, we demonstrate the feasibility to obtain self-consistent results of the two-site DMFT model based on VQE simulations with a finite number of shots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van-Hove (vH) singularities in the vicinity of the Fermi level facilitate the emergence of electronically mediated Fermi surface instabilities. This is because they provide a momentum-localized enhancement of density of states promoting selective electronic scattering channels. High-temperature topological superconductivity has been argued for in graphene at vH filling which, however, has so far proven inaccessible due to the demanded large doping from pristine half filling. We propose compensated metallicity as a path to unlock vH-driven pairing close to half filling in an electronic honeycomb lattice model. Enabled by an emergent multi-pocket fermiology, charge compensation is realized by strong breaking of chiral symmetry from intra-sublattice hybridization, while retaining vH dominated physics at the Fermi level. We conclude by proposing tangible realizations through quantum material design.</description>

      <title>Spin waves and three-dimensionality in the high-pressure antiferromagnetic phase of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum magnetic materials can provide explicit realizations of paradigm models in quantum many-body physics. In this context, SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ is a faithful realization of the Shastry-Sutherland model (SSM) for ideally frustrated spin dimers, even displaying several of its quantum magnetic phases as a function of pressure. We perform inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ at 5.5 GPa and 4.5 K, observing spin waves that characterize the high-pressure antiferromagnetic phase. The experimental spectra are well described by linear spin-wave calculations on a SSM with an inter-layer interaction, which is determined accurately as $J_c = 0.053(3)$ meV. The presence of $J_c$ indicates the need to account for the three-dimensional nature of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ in theoretical models, also at lower pressures. We find that the ratio between in-plane interactions, $J'/J = 1.8(2)$, undergoes a dramatic change compared to lower pressures that we deduce is driven by a sharp drop in the dimer coupling, $J$. Our results underline the wide horizons opened by high-pressure INS experiments on quantum magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted MoTe$_2$ homobilayers exhibit transport signatures consistent with a fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) state. We describe a route to construct topological quantum memory elements, dubbed Cheshire qudits, formed from punching holes in such a FQSH state and using proximity-induced superconductivity to gap out the resulting helical edge states. Cheshire qudits encode quantum information in states that differ by a fractional topological "Cheshire" charge that is hidden from local detection within a condensate anyons. Control of inter-edge tunneling by gates enables both supercurrent-based readout of a Cheshire qudit, and capacitive measurement of the thermal entropy associated with its topological ground-space degeneracy. Additionally, we systematically classify different types of gapped boundaries, Cheshire qudits, and parafermionic twist defects for various Abelian and non-Abelian candidate FQSH orders that are consistent with the transport data, and describe experimental signatures to distinguish these orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the electronic structure of Ta2NiSe5 in its low-temperature semiconducting phase, using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ta L3 edge. We also investigate the electronic properties of Ta2NiSe5 within the density-functional theory using the generalized gradient approximation in the framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital band-structure method. While ARPES, dc transport, and optical measurements indicate that Ta2NiSe5 is a small band-gap semiconductor, DFT gives a metallic nonmagnetic solution in Ta2NiSe5 . To obtain the semiconducting ground state in Ta2 NiSe5 we use a self-interaction correction (SIC) procedure by introducing an orbital-dependent potential Vl into the Hamiltonian. We investigate theoretically the x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and RIXS spectra at the Ni and Ta L3 edges and analyze the spectra in terms of interband transitions. We investigate the RIXS spectra as a function of momentum transfer vector Q and incident photon energy. Because Ta2 NiSe5 possesses only fully occupied (Ni 3d and Se 4p) and completely empty (Ta 5d) shells with the formal valencies Ta5+ (5d0), Ni0 (3d10 ), and Se2- (4p6 ), both the Ni and Ta L3 RIXS spectra belong to a charge transfer type with ligand-to-metal excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a bosonized effective field theory for a 2d Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field using the coadjoint orbit approach, which was recently developed as a nonlinear bosonization method in phase space for Fermi liquids and non-Fermi liquids. We show that by parametrizing the phase space with the guiding center and the mechanical momentum, and by using techniques in noncommutative field theory, the physics of Landau levels and Landau level degeneracy ($N_{\Phi}$) naturally arises. For a parabolic dispersion, the resulting theory describes $N_{\Phi}$ flavors of free chiral bosons propagating in \emph{momentum space}. In addition, the action contains a linear term in the bosonic field, which upon mode expansion becomes a topological $\theta$-term. By properly quantizing this theory, we reproduce the well-known thermal and magnetic responses of a Fermi surface, including linear-in-$T$ specific heat, Landau diamagnetism, and the de Haas-van Alphen effect. {In particular, the de Haas-van Alphen effect is shown to be a direct consequence of the topological $\theta$-term.} Our theory paves the way toward understanding correlated gapless fermionic systems in a magnetic field using the powerful approach of bosonization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The competition between the Kondo spin-screening effect and the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in heavy-fermion systems drives the quantum phase transition between the magnetically ordered and the heavy-Fermi-liquid ground states. Despite intensive investigations of heavy quasiparticles on the Kondo-screened side of the quantum phase transition and of their breakdown at the quantum critical point, the magnetically ordering side has not systematically been studied. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we report a suppression of the Kondo quasiparticle weight in CeCu$_{6-x}$Au$_x$ samples on the antiferromagnetic side of the quantum phase transition at temperatures as much as two orders of magnitude above the N\'{e}el temperature $T_\text{N}$. With our systematic investigations into the high-temperature, paramagnetic region on the antiferromagnetic side of the phase diagram of CeCu$_{6-x}$Au$_x$, i.e., with $x =$ 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5, we show that the suppression results from a quantum frustration effect induced by the temperature-independent RKKY interaction. Hence, our results emphasize that besides critical fluctuations, the RKKY interaction may play an important role in the quantum-critical scenario.</description>

      <title>Surface topological quantum criticality: Conformal manifolds and Discrete Strong Coupling Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study quantum critical phenomena in surfaces of symmetry-protected topological matter, i.e. surface topological quantum criticality. A generic phase boundary of gapless surfaces in a symmetry-protected state shall be a co-dimension one manifold in an interaction parameter space of dimension $D_p$ (where $p$ refers to the parameter space) where the value of $D_p$ further depends on bulk topologies. In the context of fermionic topological insulators that we focus on, $D_p$ depends on the number of half-Dirac cones $\mathcal{N}$. We construct such manifolds explicitly for a few interaction parameter spaces with various $D_p$ values. Most importantly, we further illustrate that in cases with $D_p=3$ and $6$, there are sub-manifolds of fixed points that dictate the universalities of surface topological quantum criticality. These infrared stable manifolds are associated with emergent symmetries in the renormalization-group-equation flow naturally appearing in the loop expansion. Unlike in the usual order-disorder quantum critical phenomena, typically governed by an isolated Wilson-Fisher fixed point, we find in the one-loop approximation surface topological quantum criticalities are naturally captured by conformal manifolds where the number of marginal operators uniquely determines their co-dimensions. Isolated strong coupling fixed points also appear, usually as the endpoints in the phase boundary of surface topological quantum phases. However, their extreme infrared instabilities along multiple directions suggest that they shall be related to multi-critical surface topological quantum critical phenomena rather than generic surface topological quantum criticality. We also discuss and classify higher-loop symmetry-breaking effects, which can either distort the conformal manifolds or further break the conformal manifolds down to a few distinct fixed points.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional spin helix and magnon-induced singularity in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene exhibits two prominent correlated phenomena in distinct regimes: a Kondo lattice near the magic angle, resembling heavy fermion systems, and a triangular correlated domain wall network under interlayer bias, akin to sliding Luttinger liquids previously introduced for cuprates. Combining these characteristics, here we investigate a system where interacting electrons in the domain wall network couple to localized spins. Owing to inter-domain-wall correlations, a two-dimensional spin helix phase emerges as a result of spatial phase coherence across parallel domain walls. Within the spin helix phase, magnons can induce a singularity in the scaling dimensions of various operators, accessible by adjusting the interaction strength between electrons. We predict observable features in magnetic resonance and anisotropic paramagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix and the magnon-induced singularity, serving as experimental indicators of the interplay between the Kondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids.</description>

      <title>Spin fractionalization at the edge of quantum Hall fluids induced by bulk quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>A bosonic matrix product state description of Read-Rezayi states and its application to quasi-hole spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>Robust quantum gap estimation with a noise-resilient hybrid algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum algorithm for estimating gaps in many-body energy spectra, supported by an analytic proof of its inherent resilience to state preparation and measurement errors, as well as global multi-qubit depolarizing noise. Our analysis extends to a broader class of Markovian noise using numerical methods. By leveraging trial-state optimization and classical signal processing, we amplify the signal peak corresponding to the exact target gap beyond the noise threshold, significantly reducing gap estimate errors. The algorithm's robustness is demonstrated through noisy simulations on the Qiskit Aer simulator and demonstrations on IBM Quantum processors. These results underscore its potential for enabling accurate quantum simulations on near-term noisy quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Floquet Analysis on an Irradiated Nodal Surface Semimetal with Non-Symmorphic Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nodal surface semimetal (NSSM) features symmetry enforced band crossings along a surface within the three-dimensional (3D) Brillouin zone (BZ) and a presence of a nonsymmorphic symmetry there pushes such surfaces to stick to the BZ center or boundaries. The topological robustness of the same does not always come with nonzero Berry fluxes. We consider two such nodal surfaces (NS), one with zero and another with nonzero topological charges and investigate the effect of light irradiation on them. We find that depending on the state of polarization, one can obtain additional Weyl points/ nodal surfaces in the corresponding Floquet Hamiltonians. Particularly, using a simple two band spinless/spin polarized models with no spin orbit coupling, we emphasize the low energy behavior of the continuum Hamiltonians close to the band crossings and its evolution in a Floquet system in the high frequency limit. In the Floquet system, we also find the nodal surfaces to perish or new multi Weyl points to get popped up for different polarization scenario or different NSSM Hamiltonians. Our findings open up important avenues on what out of equilibrium NSSM systems can offer in many active fields including quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Robust gap closing and reopening in topological-insulator Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the seminal proposal by Fu and Kane, the superconducting proximity effect is used to realize topological superconductivity in the topological surface state (TSS) of a 3D topological insulator (TI). In a line Josephson junction made on the TI surface, the spin-momentum locking of the TSS guarantees the existence of a pair of spin-non-degenerate, perfectly transmitted Andreev modes. These modes lead to robust gap closing and parity alteration as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$ across the junction. Here, we report the observation of the predicted gap closing at $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$ in a TI Josephson junction ($n$ integer), where the local density of states is probed via tunnel contacts and $\varphi$ is controlled by a flux loop. This phenomenon is robust for a wide range of chemical potentials, supporting its TSS origin. Under an applied perpendicular magnetic field, Josephson vortices form, making $\varphi$ position-dependent. In this case, the gap closing occurs locally at the Josephson vortex cores where $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$, which we also observe. Our results confirm the fundamental role of spin-momentum locking in the Andreev physics in the TSS, which implies that the observed gap closing and reopening has a topological nature.</description>

      <title>Excited-State-Specific Kohn-Sham Formalism for the Asymmetric Hubbard Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on our recent study [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02052, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</description>
