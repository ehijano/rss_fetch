      <title>Green's Function Formalism for Impurity-Induced Resonances in Sub-barrier Proton-Nucleus Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental refinements of stellar reaction rates, we establish a non-perturbative Green's function formalism based on the exact solution of the Dyson equation for sub-barrier proton-nucleus resonant scattering. By utilizing bare Green's functions to map the quantum tunneling problem onto a scattering formalism, we demonstrate that the summation of infinite quantum paths recovers the exact tunneling coefficients, enabling an analytical solution of the Dyson equation where the strong nuclear force is modeled as a surface delta-shell impurity embedded within the Coulomb field. Applying this framework to the astrophysically relevant $p + {}^{7}\text{Li}$, $p + {}^{14}\text{N}$, and $p + {}^{23}\text{Na}$ systems, we achieve precise agreement with experimental resonance energies while revealing a fundamental physical distinction in resonance formation. The heavier ${}^{23}\text{Na}$ system is identified as a saturated state, residing on a geometric plateau where the resonance energy becomes insensitive to the interaction strength; our calculated value of $2.11$~MeV aligns remarkably well with the experimental level of $2.08$~MeV. In contrast, the lighter ${}^7\text{Li}$ and ${}^{14}\text{N}$ systems emerge as threshold states in a weak-coupling window, where the resonance energy is highly sensitive to the potential parameters and is sustained near the continuum edge. In this regime, our model yields energies of $0.489$~MeV and $1.067$~MeV, closely reproducing the experimental benchmarks of $0.441$~MeV and $1.058$~MeV, respectively. We demonstrate that these threshold states are characterized by a significant enhancement of the resonant cross-section, driven by the inverse relationship between the tunneling width and the spectral density peak.</description>

      <title>How transverse momentum conservation breaks azimuthal correlation factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The breakdown of azimuthal two-particle correlation factorization, quantified by the ratios $r_2$ and $r_3$, serves as a sensitive probe of transverse-momentum-dependent flow fluctuations. While hydrodynamic models predict $r_3 \leq 1$, experimental data from CMS in p-Pb collisions exhibit $r_3 &gt; 1$, presenting a clear puzzle. We show that transverse momentum conservation (TMC) is the key mechanism dictating this factorization breakdown in small systems. We systematically calculate the effect of TMC as a function of the momentum difference between particles across various multiplicity and momentum ranges. Our results are in quantitative agreement with CMS p-Pb data for both $r_2$ and $r_3$. A central finding is a sign rule: under TMC, the deviation $r_n - 1$ follows $\left ( - 1 \right )^{n+1} $, being negative for even and positive for odd harmonic orders $n$. This work establishes an analytical framework to quantify transverse-momentum-dependent flow fluctuations and provides new insights into the origin of collectivity in small colliding systems.</description>

      <title>Octet baryon electroweak form factors in dense nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the necessity of developing theoretical models for studying the electroweak structure of baryons in a nuclear medium, we apply a covariant quark model to study interactions of baryons with nuclear matter. The electromagnetic and axial form factors of the octet baryons are determined by combining a covariant quark model that takes into account the meson cloud dressing of the baryon cores, developed for free space, with the quark-meson coupling model in the extension to the nuclear medium. We discuss the medium modifications on the electroweak form factors of octet baryons for the range of densities from $\rho=0$ up to $\rho=2 \rho_0$, where $\rho_0= 0.15$ fm$^{-3}$ is the normal nuclear matter density. We also study how the shape of the form factors is modified in finite nuclei due to the profile of the nuclear density distributions compared with calculations using the average density of the nucleus</description>

      <title>First observation of the $\gamma$-ray beam production by the backward Compton scattering of extreme ultraviolet light emitted from an undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compton scattering of photons off high-energy electrons is a fundamental quantum mechanical process widely utilized to produce a $\gamma$-ray beam for scientific research. Instead of injecting laser light into a storage ring as a conventional way, we have developed an innovative method to achieve drastically higher energies approaching the ring energy by the backward Compton scattering of extreme ultraviolet light. In this method, $92$ $\mathrm{eV}$ photons obtained from an undulator in a storage ring were reflected back to the original ring using a Mo/Si multilayer mirror. Consequently, $\gamma$-ray beam production through the extreme ultraviolet light Compton scattering was observed for the first time in a demonstration experiment at the $1$ $\mathrm{GeV}$ ring, NewSUBARU. The measured energy spectrum was well reproduced by a theoretical calculation with the maximum energy of $0.543$ $\mathrm{GeV}$. The production rate was $1.4 \pm 0.1$ kcps for the energies above $0.160$ $\mathrm{GeV}$. This rate was quantitatively explained by the luminosity and the scattering cross section. The present work paved the way to create a new $\gamma$-ray beam source for future applications such as hadron photoproduction experiments.</description>

      <title>Discriminating QCD Compton and Quark-Antiquark Annihilation Processes in $\gamma$ + Jets Using Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how effectively final-state jet substructure can discriminate between QCD Compton and quark-antiquark annihilation processes from photon-jet production in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Using infrared- and collinear-safe jet observables, multivariate classifiers -- boosted decision trees and multilayer perceptrons -- are trained on labeled quark- and gluon-initiated jets from dijet events and applied to photon-jet samples. Observables probing soft and wide-angle radiation, in particular jet multiplicity and jet girth, dominate the discrimination. The jet mass provides a complementary but weaker contribution, while the jet charge exhibits negligible discriminating power. A comparison of the two classifiers demonstrates that the achievable separation is limited primarily by QCD radiation effects rather than by classifier complexity. These findings quantify the extent to which information about the underlying hard process survives hadronization and realistic jet reconstruction, providing a physics-driven baseline for precision jet measurements in $pp$, $ep/$A, and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Identifying $\alpha$-cluster configurations in $^{20}$Ne via ultracentral Ne+Ne Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial-state geometry in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides a novel probe to nuclear cluster structure. For $^{20}$Ne, a novel approach is proposed to distinguish between the cluster configurations (5$\alpha$ versus $\alpha + ^{16}$O) in order to gain insight into nuclear structure transitions governed by many-body quantum correlations. Through analytical calculations with the microscopic Brink model and event-by-event simulations using the hydrodynamic framework, we establish the normalized symmetric cumulant NSC (3, 2) and the Pearson coefficient $\rho_2 (v_{2}^{2},\ \delta [p_{\mathrm{T}}])$ as quantitative discriminators to reveal enhanced cluster degrees of freedom in the ground state of $^{20}$Ne. The ultracentral Ne+Ne collisions at the LHC can experimentally identify these two competing configurations via these flow correlation observables, opening a new paradigm for probing clustering in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulation of Rotating Nuclei using Quantum Variational Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum variational algorithms (QVAs) are increasingly potent tools for simulating quantum many-body systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work examines the application of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to four progressively complex models based on the cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky (CNS) framework. By incorporating single-particle spacings, pairing correlations, and rotational cranking terms, we evaluate VQE performance against exact diagonalization (ED) benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that while simpler models achieve high precision (errors $&lt;0.005$), the transition to 8-spin-orbital Hamiltonians reveals significant scaling and optimization challenges. Notably, we show that Model IV, which employs a more expressive RealAmplitudes ansatz, successfully captures the qualitative physics of rotational alignment and reduces energy deviations compared to intermediate benchmarks. These results establish a systematic methodological baseline, identifying the breaking points of hardware-efficient ansatz while validating the potential of QVAs to model the complex competition between pairing and rotation in deformed nuclei.</description>

      <title>Existence of nuclear modifications on longitudinal-transverse structure-function ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been assumed that nuclear modification does not exist in the longitudinal-transverse structure-function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$ in lepton deep inelastic scattering. This assumption is widely used in obtaining structure functions of the "nucleon" from nuclear data such as the deuteron ones. However, nuclear modifications do exist theoretically at least in medium- and large-$x$ regions because nucleons in a nucleus move in any direction, which is not necessarily the longitudinal direction of the virtual-photon or weak-boson momentum in lepton scattering. Because of this transverse motion, the nucleon's transverse and longitudinal structure functions should mix with each other in nuclei with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this work, numerical results are explicitly shown regarding such nuclear modifications in the deuteron. These nuclear modifications are important for determining precise structure functions of the nucleon. Furthermore, modifications of $R_N$ should be investigated also at small $x$ by the future electron-ion collider to find interesting gluon dynamics in nuclei. Hopefully, this nuclear effect of $R_N$ could be found by future experimental measurements at lepton accelerator facilities.</description>
