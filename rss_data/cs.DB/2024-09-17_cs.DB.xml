      <title>Development of Data Evaluation Benchmark for Data Wrangling Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CoWrangler is a data-wrangling recommender system designed to streamline data processing tasks. Recognizing that data processing is often time-consuming and complex for novice users, we aim to simplify the decision-making process regarding the most effective subsequent data operation. By analyzing over 10,000 Kaggle notebooks spanning approximately 1,000 datasets, we derive insights into common data processing strategies employed by users across various tasks. This analysis helps us understand how dataset quality influences wrangling operations, informing our ongoing efforts to possibly expand our dataset sources in the future.</description>

      <title>Control-flow Reconstruction Attacks on Business Process Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process models may be automatically generated from event logs that contain as-is data of a business process. While such models generalize over the control-flow of specific, recorded process executions, they are often also annotated with behavioural statistics, such as execution frequencies.Based thereon, once a model is published, certain insights about the original process executions may be reconstructed, so that an external party may extract confidential information about the business process. This work is the first to empirically investigate such reconstruction attempts based on process models. To this end, we propose different play-out strategies that reconstruct the control-flow from process trees, potentially exploiting frequency annotations. To assess the potential success of such reconstruction attacks on process models, and hence the risks imposed by publishing them, we compare the reconstructed process executions with those of the original log for several real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>TISIS : Trajectory Indexing for SImilarity Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms enable users to share diverse types of information, including geolocation data that captures their movement patterns. Such geolocation data can be leveraged to reconstruct the trajectory of a user's visited Points of Interest (POIs). A key requirement in numerous applications is the ability to measure the similarity between such trajectories, as this facilitates the retrieval of trajectories that are similar to a given reference trajectory. This is the main focus of our work. Existing methods predominantly rely on applying a similarity function to each candidate trajectory to identify those that are sufficiently similar. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale datasets. To mitigate this challenge, we propose TISIS, an efficient method that uses trajectory indexing to quickly find similar trajectories that share common POIs in the same order. Furthermore, to account for scenarios where POIs in trajectories may not exactly match but are contextually similar, we introduce TISIS*, a variant of TISIS that incorporates POI embeddings. This extension allows for more comprehensive retrieval of similar trajectories by considering semantic similarities between POIs, beyond mere exact matches. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline method based on the well-known Longest Common SubSequence (LCSS) algorithm, yielding substantial performance improvements across various real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Linguistic Coverage of OpenAlex: An Assessment of Metadata Accuracy and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10633</link>

Abstract: Clarivate's Web of Science (WoS) and Elsevier's Scopus have been for decades the main sources of bibliometric information. Although highly curated, these closed, proprietary databases are largely biased towards English-language publications, underestimating the use of other languages in research dissemination. Launched in 2022, OpenAlex promised comprehensive, inclusive, and open-source research information. While already in use by scholars and research institutions, the quality of its metadata is currently being assessed. This paper contributes to this literature by assessing the completeness and accuracy of its metadata related to language, through a comparison with WoS, as well as an in-depth manual validation of a sample of 6,836 articles. Results show that OpenAlex exhibits a far more balanced linguistic coverage than WoS. However, language metadata is not always accurate, which leads OpenAlex to overestimate the place of English while underestimating that of other languages. If used critically, OpenAlex can provide comprehensive and representative analyses of languages used for scholarly publishing. However, more work is needed at infrastructural level to ensure the quality of metadata on language.</description>

      <title>Can Graph Reordering Speed Up Graph Neural Network Training? An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a type of neural network capable of learning on graph-structured data. However, training GNNs on large-scale graphs is challenging due to iterative aggregations of high-dimensional features from neighboring vertices within sparse graph structures combined with neural network operations. The sparsity of graphs frequently results in suboptimal memory access patterns and longer training time. Graph reordering is an optimization strategy aiming to improve the graph data layout. It has shown to be effective to speed up graph analytics workloads, but its effect on the performance of GNN training has not been investigated yet. The generalization of reordering to GNN performance is nontrivial, as multiple aspects must be considered: GNN hyper-parameters such as the number of layers, the number of hidden dimensions, and the feature size used in the GNN model, neural network operations, large intermediate vertex states, and GPU acceleration.
  In our work, we close this gap by performing an empirical evaluation of 12 reordering strategies in two state-of-the-art GNN systems, PyTorch Geometric and Deep Graph Library. Our results show that graph reordering is effective in reducing training time for CPU- and GPU-based training, respectively. Further, we find that GNN hyper-parameters influence the effectiveness of reordering, that reordering metrics play an important role in selecting a reordering strategy, that lightweight reordering performs better for GPU-based than for CPU-based training, and that invested reordering time can in many cases be amortized.</description>

      <title>Semantic Units: Increasing Expressivity and Simplicity of Formal Representations of Data and Knowledge in Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs and ontologies are becoming increasingly vital as they align with the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We address eleven challenges that may impede the full realization of the potential of FAIR knowledge graphs, as conventional solutions are perceived to be overly complex and lacking in cognitive interoperability. We extend the concept of "semantic units" as a conceptual solution by adding further subcategories. Semantic units structure a knowledge graph into identifiable and semantically meaningful subgraphs, with each subgraph being represented by a resource that instantiates a semantic unit class. We introduce some-instance, most-instances, every-instance, and all-instances resources as new types of representational entities in addition to named-individual, class, and property resources. We combine these new resource types with the concept of semantic units and introduce new subcategories of statement units and semantically meaningful collections of statement units (i.e., compound units) that provide solutions to the eleven challenges. These include, for instance, schemes for modelling assertional, contingent, prototypical, and universal statements, including class axioms, as well as absence statements, negations, and cardinality restrictions. The schemes are alternatives to existing OWL-based modelling schemes, and we provide corresponding representations for them that do not involve blank nodes. With question units we also introduce a way of representing questions in a knowledge graph that can be made readily executable as graph queries. We also provide schemes for directive statements, directive conditional statements, and logical arguments. We argue that semantic units provide a framework that increases the overall expressivity and cognitive interoperability of knowledge graphs compared to conventional OWL-based solutions.</description>
