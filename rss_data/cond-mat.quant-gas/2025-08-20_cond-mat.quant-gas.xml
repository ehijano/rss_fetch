      <title>$p$-orbital self-organization of ultracold atoms coupled to optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atoms coupled to optical cavities provide a novel platform for understanding high-orbital exotic phenomena in strongly correlated materials. In this study, we investigate strongly correlated ultracold bosonic gases that are coupled to two orthogonally arranged optical cavities and driven by a blue-detuned running-wave laser field. Our results demonstrate that atoms initially in the $s$-orbital state can be scattered into $p_x$- and $p_y$-orbital states in either a symmetric or asymmetric manner, depending on the frequencies of the two cavities. For the symmetric configuration, we observe that atoms are scattered into the $p_x$- and $p_y$-orbitals equally. In the asymmetric case, photons emitted into one cavity mode suppress the scattering into the orthogonal mode. Notably, the coupling of atoms with multiple cavity modes leads to the emergence of high-orbital self-organized phases, accompanied by orbital-density waves that break different symmetries.</description>

      <title>Generalized Brillouin Zone Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ) encodes how lattice momentum is complex-deformed due to non-Hermitian skin accumulation, and has proved essential in restoring bulk-boundary correspondences. However, we find that generically, the GBZ is neither unique nor well-defined if more than one skin localization direction or strength exists, even in systems with no asymmetric hoppings. Instead, open boundary condition (OBC) eigenstates become complicated superpositions of multiple competing skin modes from "fragments" of all possible GBZs solutions. We develop a formalism that computes the fragmented GBZ in a scalable manner, with fragmentation extent quantified through our newly-defined composition IPR and spectral relative entropy. GBZ fragmentation is revealed to fundamentally challenge the notion of discontinuous phase transitions, since topological winding contributions from different GBZ fragments can "melt away" at different rates. Phenomenologically, GBZ fragmentation also leads to edge localization in all observables in energetically weighted ensembles such as thermal ensembles. This contrasts with conventional GBZs where the skin localization completely cancels in biorthogonal expectations. Occurring universally in multi-mode non-Hermitian media, as we concretely demonstrate with photonic crystal simulations, GBZ fragmentation points towards a new paradigm that is essential for understanding the band structure and the topological and dynamical properties of diverse generic non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum phases and transitions of bosons on a comb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated to elucidate the nature of quantum phases and their criticality when entangled with a correlated quantum bath, we study interacting bosons on a "comb lattice" -- a one-dimensional backbone (system) coupled at its sites to otherwise independent one-dimensional "teeth" chains (bath). We map out the corresponding phase diagram, detailing the nature of the phases and phase transitions. Controlled by the backbone and teeth hopping amplitudes, on-site interaction and chemical potential, phases include a Mott-insulator (MI), backbone (LLb) and teeth (LLp) Luttinger liquids, and the long-range ordered incoherent superfluid (iSF). We explore their properties and potential realizations in condensed matter and cold-atom experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics under continuous measurements for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential by using the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model with hopping rate $J$ and potential strength $V$. On the basis of the quantum trajectory method, we obtain the phase diagram for the steady-state entanglement entropy and demonstrate that robust logarithmic system-size scaling emerges up to a critical potential strength $V_c/J \sim 2.3$. Moreover, we find that the measurement induces entanglement phase transitions from the logarithmic-law phase to the area-law phase for the potential strength $V&lt; V_c$, while any finite measurement stabilizes the area-law phase for $V&gt;V_c$. This result is distinct from the entanglement scaling in the unitary limit, where volume-law and area-law phases undergo a transition at $V/J=2$. To further support the phase diagram, we analyze the connected correlation function and find that it shows algebraic decay in the logarithmic-law phase, while it decays quickly in the area-law phase. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by introducing quasiperiodic potentials and continuously monitoring the local occupation number with an off-resonant probe light.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous symmetry breaking in spontaneous Floquet states: temporal Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone modes, Floquet thermodynamics, and the time operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study simultaneous symmetry breaking in spontaneous Floquet states, focusing on the specific case of an atomic condensate. We first describe the quantization of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes for a stationary state simultaneously breaking several symmetries of the Hamiltonian by invoking the generalized Gibbs ensemble, which enables a thermodynamical description of the problem. The quantization procedure involves a Berry-Gibbs connection, which depends on the macroscopic conserved charges associated to each broken symmetry and whose curvature is not invariant under generalized gauge transformations. We extend the formalism to Floquet states, where Goldstone theorem translates into the emergence of Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone (FNG) modes with zero quasi-energy. In the case of a spontaneous Floquet state, there is a genuine temporal FNG mode arising from the continuous time-translation symmetry breaking, whose quantum amplitude provides a rare realization of a time operator in Quantum Mechanics. Furthermore, since they conserve energy, spontaneous Floquet states can be shown to possess a conserved Floquet charge. Conventional Floquet systems also admit a thermodynamic description in terms of the Floquet enthalpy, the Legendre transform of the energy with respect to the Floquet charge, as these operate at fixed frequency. We apply our formalism to a particular realization of spontaneous Floquet state, the CES state, which breaks $U(1)$ and time-translation symmetries, representing a time supersolid. We numerically compute its density-density correlations, predicted to be dominated by the temporal FNG mode at long times, observing a remarkable agreement between simulation and theory. Based on these results, we propose a feasible experimental scheme to observe the temporal FNG mode of the CES state.</description>

      <title>Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of certain interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra, and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e., the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$ plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the return amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate the key difference between QMBS and strong ergodicity breaking including their distinctive renormalization group flows on the complex $\beta$ plane. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of spotting scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.</description>
