      <title>Deep learning-enhanced chemiluminescence vertical flow assay for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Democratizing biomarker testing at the point-of-care requires innovations that match laboratory-grade sensitivity and precision in an accessible format. Here, we demonstrate high-sensitivity detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) through innovations in chemiluminescence-based sensing, imaging, and deep learning-driven analysis. This chemiluminescence vertical flow assay (CL-VFA) enables rapid, low-cost, and precise quantification of cTnI, a key cardiac protein for assessing heart muscle damage and myocardial infarction. The CL-VFA integrates a user-friendly chemiluminescent paper-based sensor, a polymerized enzyme-based conjugate, a portable high-performance CL reader, and a neural network-based cTnI concentration inference algorithm. The CL-VFA measures cTnI over a broad dynamic range covering six orders of magnitude and operates with 50 uL of serum per test, delivering results in 25 min. This system achieves a detection limit of 0.16 pg/mL with an average coefficient of variation under 15%, surpassing traditional benchtop analyzers in sensitivity by an order of magnitude. In blinded validation, the computational CL-VFA accurately measured cTnI concentrations in patient samples, demonstrating a robust correlation against a clinical-grade FDA-cleared analyzer. These results highlight the potential of CL-VFA as a robust diagnostic tool for accessible, rapid cardiac biomarker testing that meets the needs of diverse healthcare settings, from emergency care to underserved regions.</description>

      <title>Preclinical Water-Mediated Ultrasound Platform using Clinical FOV for Molecular Targeted Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: This protocol introduces an ultrasound (US) configuration for whole-body 3D dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US) imaging in preclinical applications. The set-up relies on a clinical abdominal matrix US probe to enable mice imaging beyond current preclinical systems that are generally unable to capture whole-body volumetric and dynamic imaging. We demonstrate via this protocol the feasibility of volumetric contrast-enhanced and molecular 3D imaging in the entire lower body of mouse, as well as the capability of imaging multiple lesions in the same animal simultaneously with a single contrast bolus injection.
  Methods: We modified a silicone cup with a 101.6 mm inner diameter and 6.4 mm wall thickness, to a height of 76.2 mm and cut out a rectangular side window (12.7 mm x 15.9 mm) at the lower part of the cup. Mice were positioned with their head and the two front legs outside of the cup while the rest of the body remained inside the cup and submerged under water; the edges around the mouse's body in contact with the cup's wall were sealed with Vaseline to prevent water leakage, and the cup was filled with warm water to maintain the mouse's body heat. Imaging was conducted using a portable clinical ultrasound system (EPIQ 7 Philips) with an abdominal matrix-array transducer (PM mode, X6-1) inserted into the top of the cup, and positioned to visualize the entire of the mouse's abdomen. The mice were imaged before and after the injection of P-selectin-targeted microbubbles.
  Results: Here, in nude mice with two adjacent tumors, we demonstrate that a commercially available clinical matrix transducer can be utilized to achieve whole-body 3D DCE-US and molecular US imaging, as well as capture independent qualitative and quantitative information from several lesions or organs at different locations in the animal, through a single bolus injection.</description>

      <title>A Physics-based Generative Model to Synthesize Training Datasets for MRI-based Fat Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques have potential to optimize scan and post-processing times required for MRI-based fat quantification, but they are constrained by the lack of large training datasets. Generative models are a promising tool to perform data augmentation by synthesizing realistic datasets. However no previous methods have been specifically designed to generate datasets for quantitative MRI (q-MRI) tasks, where reference quantitative maps and large variability in scanning protocols are usually required. We propose a Physics-Informed Latent Diffusion Model (PI-LDM) to synthesize quantitative parameter maps jointly with customizable MR images by incorporating the signal generation model. We assessed the quality of PI-LDM's synthesized data using metrics such as the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), obtaining comparable scores to state-of-the-art generative methods (FID: 0.0459). We also trained a U-Net for the MRI-based fat quantification task incorporating synthetic datasets. When we used a few real (10 subjects, $~200$ slices) and numerous synthetic samples ($&gt;3000$), fat fraction at specific liver ROIs showed a low bias on data obtained using the same protocol than training data ($0.10\%$ at $\hbox{ROI}_1$, $0.12\%$ at $\hbox{ROI}_2$) and on data acquired with an alternative protocol ($0.14\%$ at $\hbox{ROI}_1$, $0.62\%$ at $\hbox{ROI}_2$). Future work will be to extend PI-LDM to other q-MRI applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic optical coherence tomography algorithm for label-free assessment of swiftness and occupancy of intratissue moving scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) statistically analyzes fluctuations in time-sequential OCT signals, enabling label-free and three-dimensional visualization of intratissue and intracellular activities. Current DOCT methods, such as logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) and OCT correlation decay speed (OCDS) have several limitations.Namely, the DOCT values and intratissue motions are not directly related, and hence DOCT values are not interpretable in the context of the tissue motility. We introduce a new DOCT algorithm that provides more direct interpretation of DOCT in the contexts of dynamic scatterer ratio and scatterer speed in the tissue.The detailed properties of the new and conventional DOCT methods are investigated by numerical simulations, and the experimental validation with in vitro and ex vivo samples demonstrates the feasibility of the new method.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Dynamical Low-rank Approach for Charged Particle Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministically solving charged particle transport problems at a sufficient spatial and angular resolution is often prohibitively expensive, especially due to their highly forward peaked scattering. We propose a model order reduction approach which evolves the solution on a low-rank manifold in time, making computations feasible at much higher resolutions and reducing the overall run-time and memory footprint.
  For this, we use a hybrid dynamical low-rank approach based on a collided-uncollided split, i.e., the transport equation is split through a collision source method. Uncollided particles are described using a ray tracer, facilitating the inclusion of boundary conditions and straggling, whereas collided particles are represented using a moment method combined with the dynamical low-rank approximation. Here the energy is treated as a pseudo-time and a rank adaptive integrator is chosen to dynamically adapt the rank in energy. We can reproduce the results of a full-rank reference code at a much lower rank and thus computational cost and memory usage. The solution further achieves comparable accuracy with respect to TOPAS MC as previous deterministic approaches.</description>

      <title>Multiple scattering suppression for in vivo optical coherence tomography measurement using B-scan-wise multi-focus averaging method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method that reduces the noise caused by multi-scattering (MS) photons in an \invivo optical coherence tomography image. This method combines a specially designed image acquisition (i.e., optical coherence tomography scan) scheme and subsequent complex signal processing. For the acquisition, multiple cross-sectional images (frames) are sequentially acquired while the depth position of the focus is altered for each frame by an electrically tunable lens. In the signal processing, the frames are numerically defocus-corrected, and complex averaged. Because of the inconsistency in the MS-photon trajectories among the different electrically tunable lens-induced defocus, this averaging reduces the MS signal. This method was validated using a scattering phantom and in vivo unanesthetized small fish samples, and was found to reduce MS noise even for unanesthetized in vivo measurement.</description>
