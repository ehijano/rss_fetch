      <title>A theoretical prediction for the dipole in nearby distances using cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Impact of Source Galaxy Photometric Redshift Uncertainties on the LSST $3\times2$pt Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric redshifts of the source galaxies are a key source of systematic uncertainty in the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)'s galaxy clustering and weak lensing analysis, i.e., the $3\times 2$pt analysis. This paper introduces a Fisher forecast code FisherA2Z for the LSST Year 10 (Y10) $3 \times 2$pt and cosmic shear analyses, utilizing a 15-parameter redshift distribution model, with one redshift bias, variance, and outlier rate per tomographic bin. FisherA2Z employs the Core Cosmology Library CCL to compute the large-scale structure power spectrum and incorporates a four-parameter nonlinear alignment model for intrinsic alignments. We evaluate the impact of marginalizing over redshift distribution parameters on weak lensing, forecast biases in cosmological parameters due to redshift errors, and assess cosmological parameter sensitivity to redshift systematic parameters using decision trees. The sensitivity study reveals that for LSST $3\times2$pt analysis, $S_8$ is most sensitive to the mean redshift of the fourth out of the five source tomographic bins, while other cosmological parameters possess different sensitivities. Additionally, we provide cosmological analysis forecasts based on different scenarios of spectroscopic training datasets. We find that the figures-of-merit for the cosmological results increase with the number of spectroscopic training galaxies, and with the completeness of the training set above $z=1.6$, assuming the redshift information comes solely from the training set galaxies without other external constraints.</description>

      <title>Modelling Galaxy Clustering and Tomographic Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing with HSC Y3 and SDSS using the Point-Mass Correction Model and Redshift Self-Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy clustering is a powerful probe of the cosmological model, and exploration of how to best model and extract this information from the signals is essential. We present the measurement of the galaxy-galaxy weak lensing signals using the SDSS DR11 spectroscopic galaxies as lens galaxies, and the HSC Y3 shear catalog as source galaxies, binned into four tomographic bins by their photometric redshift. The SDSS DR11 galaxies, with a redshift range $0.15&lt;z&lt;0.7$, are binned into three redshift bins, each as a probe for measuring the projected correlation function, $w_p(R_p)$. We measure the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal $\Delta \Sigma (R_p)$ in 12 lens-source bin pairs and show that there is no evidence for significant systematic biases in the measurement with null testing. We combine our $w_p(R_p)$ and $\Delta \Sigma (R_p)$ ($2\times2$pt) data vectors and perform likelihood inference with a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. For $\Delta \Sigma (R_p)$, we extend the lower limit of the scale cut compared to previous HSC Y3 analyses to $2 h^{-1}$Mpc by including a point-mass correction term in addition to the minimal bias model. We present various tests to validate our model and provide extended consistency tests. In the $\Lambda$CDM context, our fiducial model yields $S_8 = 0.804^{+0.051}_{-0.051}$. The $2\times2$pt data vector provides redshift parameter constraints for the third and fourth redshift bins $\Delta z_3 = -0.079^{+0.074}_{-0.084}$, and $\Delta z_4 = -0.203^{+0.167}_{-0.206}$, which is consistent with results from the previous tomographic cosmic shear studies, and serves as the foundation for a future $3\times 2$pt analysis.</description>

      <title>Constraining $\Lambda$CDM, $\omega$CDM, and $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM models with DESI DR2 BAO: Redshift-Resolved Diagnostics and the Role of $r_d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed comparison of  $\Lambda$CDM, $\omega$CDM, and $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM cosmologies using the latest redshift-resolved BAO measurements from DESI DR2. By separating $r_d$-dependent and $r_d$-independent observables and applying both fixed and model-derived sound horizon values, we test the consistency of each model across 24 observables spanning redshift 0.2 to 2.3. Our results show that the $\omega$CDM model is statistically favored over $\Lambda$CDM, with lower $\chi^2$, AIC, and BIC values and reduced residuals, especially at $z = 0.706$ and 0.934. In contrast, the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model is strongly disfavored, even when using model-specific $r_d$, due to large residuals caused by the unphysical high-redshift behavior.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and Source Redshift Constraints from Galaxy Clustering and Tomographic Weak Lensing with HSC Y3 and SDSS using the Point-Mass Correction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of galaxy clustering and weak lensing is a powerful probe of the cosmology model. We present a joint analysis of galaxy clustering and weak lensing cosmology using SDSS data as the tracer of dark matter (lens sample) and the HSC Y3 dataset as source galaxies. The analysis divides HSC Y3 galaxies into four tomographic bins for both galaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear measurements, and employs a point-mass correction model to utilize galaxy-galaxy lensing signals down to 2$h^{-1}$Mpc, extending up to 70$h^{-1}$Mpc. These strategies enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the galaxy-galaxy lensing data vector. Using a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we find $S_8 = 0.780^{+0.029}_{-0.030}$, and using a $w$CDM model, we obtain $S_8 = 0.756^{+0.038}_{-0.036}$ with $w = -1.176^{+0.310}_{-0.346}$. We apply uninformative priors on the redshift mean-shift parameters for the third and fourth tomographic bins. Leveraging the self-calibration power of tomographic weak lensing, we measure $\Delta z_3 = -0.112^{+0.046}_{-0.049}$ and $\Delta z_4 = -0.185^{+0.071}_{-0.081}$, in agreement with previous HSC Y3 results. This demonstrates that weak lensing self-calibration can achieve redshift constraints comparable to other methods such as photometric and clustering redshift calibration.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear reconstruction of general dark energy theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large variety and number of dark energy (DE) theories make it impractical to perform detailed analyses on a case-by-case basis, which has motivated proposals to ``parameterize" theories to reduce the size of theory space. The leading approach to do this is the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE), which can describe general Horndeski-type theories with a small number of observationally accessible time-dependent functions. However, the EFTofDE primarily works for linear perturbations, and extending it to obtain a fully non-linear description of DE theories, which is critical for theories with screening mechanisms, is challenging. In this paper, we present a general method for reconstructing the non-linear DE Lagrangian from the background expansion history and certain linear-perturbation quantities, building upon the EFTofDE framework. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that this method is applicable to a wide range of single-scalar-field dark energy and modified gravity theories, including quintessence, scalar-tensor theory, $k$-essence, and generalized cubic Galileon with shift symmetry. For each of these theories, we discuss the validity of the method and factors affecting its results. While this method involves solving differential equations, we find that the initial conditions are not important for quintessence, scalar-tensor theory and $k$-essence, while for shift-symmetric cubic Galileon, the generic tracker solution can help transform differential equations into algebraic equations. This offers a useful framework to connect cosmological observations at the background and linear-perturbation levels to the underlying non-linear dynamics of dark energy, and will enable cosmological simulations to analyze and examine DE theories systematically and in much greater detail.</description>

      <title>Numerical treatment of annual modulation of relic neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical treatment of the annual modulation of relic neutrinos due to the Sun's gravitational influence. Extending our previously developed N-1-body simulation framework from Milky Way scales to solar system dynamics, we model how cosmic neutrino background densities might vary throughout Earth's orbital cycle. We validate our numerical approach against analytical expectations from previous studies that assumed idealized relic neutrino populations. Our results suggest that the prior gravitational history of neutrinos traversing asymmetric dark matter distributions can affect annual modulation patterns. While our simulations reproduce modulation amplitudes similar to analytical predictions for heavier neutrinos, we find that the amplitude can vary considerably depending on the specific morphology of dark matter halos. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating realistic structure formation effects when predicting potential observational relic neutrino signatures.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the impact of detection bias from blended galaxies on cosmic shear surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasingly large areas in cosmic shear surveys lead to a reduction of statistical errors, necessitating to control systematic errors increasingly better. One of these systematic effects was initially studied by Hartlap et al. in 2011, namely that image overlap with (bright foreground) galaxies may prevent some distant (source) galaxies to remain undetected. Since this overlap is more likely to occur in regions of high foreground density -- which tend to be the regions in which the shear is largest -- this detection bias would cause an underestimation of the estimated shear correlation function. This detection bias adds to the possible systematic of image blending, where nearby pairs or multiplets of images render shear estimates more uncertain and thus may cause a reduction in their statistical weight. Based on simulations with data from the Kilo-Degree Survey, we study the conditions under which images are not detected. We find an approximate analytic expression for the detection probability in terms of the separation and brightness ratio to the neighbouring galaxies. Applying this fitting formula to weak lensing ray tracing through, and the galaxy distribution in the Millennium Simulation, we estimate that the detection bias alone leads to an underestimate of $S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3}$ by almost 2\% and can therefore not be neglected in current and forthcoming cosmic shear surveys.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints from galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing with extended SubHalo Abundance Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing using extended SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAMe). We analyse stellar mass-selected Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) galaxy clustering and Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) galaxy-galaxy lensing and find constraints on $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}=0.793^{+0.025}_{-0.024}$, in agreement with Planck at 1.7$\sigma$, and consistent with previous results. We are able to constrain all 5 SHAMe parameters, which describe the galaxy-subhalo connection. We validate our methodology by first applying it to simulated catalogues, generated from the TNG300 simulation, which mimic the stellar mass selection of our real data. We show that we are able to recover the input cosmology for both our fiducial and all-scale analyses. Our all-scale analysis extends to scales of galaxy-galaxy lensing below $r_\mathrm{p}&lt;1.4\,\mathrm{Mpc}/h$, which we exclude in our fiducial analysis to avoid baryonic effects. When including all scales, we find a value of $S_8$, which is 1.26$\sigma$ higher than our fiducial result (against naive expectations where baryonic feedback should lead to small-scale power suppression), and in agreement with Planck at 0.9$\sigma$. We also find a 21% tighter constraint on $S_8$ and a 29% tighter constraint on $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ compared to our fiducial analysis. This work shows the power and potential of joint small-scale galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses using SHAMe.</description>

      <title>Luminosity Function of Galaxies in Voids: A Modification Inspired by Excursion Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard picture of cosmology, the galaxies reside in dark matter (DM) halos. DM halos are distributed in the cosmic web in different environments. The luminosity of the galaxies in different environments can be used as a probe to assess a cosmological model. This study focuses on the properties of galaxies in void regions, where halos typically do not experience extreme conditions. By examining the galaxy luminosity function, we aim to understand the dependence of galaxy properties on their environment and redshift so that later, we could use this as a tool to evaluate cosmological models. We employ the Excursion Set Theory to incorporate parameters related to the number density of DM halos into the luminosity function. Using the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and 2dFGRS datasets, we fit our theoretical models to observational data, examining the environmental and redshift dependence of the galaxy luminosity function. Our results indicate that we model the galaxy luminosity function in voids effectively by considering the linear density contrast of the environment and the growth function $D(z)$ for redshift dependence. This study provides a model for the environmental dependence of galaxy luminosity function that offers an improvement in the $\chi ^2$ parameter compared to the previously proposed model in \cite{mcnaught2014galaxy}. Both BIC and AIC tests support the superiority of this model for the void region.</description>

      <title>Tidal Suppression of Fuzzy Dark Matter Heating in Milky Way Satellite Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many previous studies have imposed stringent constraints on the particle mass of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) by analyzing observations of Galactic satellite galaxies, which show no significant evidence of the heating effect predicted by FDM. However, these analyses have generally neglected the tidal influence of the Milky Way, which can substantially suppress the FDM-induced heating in satellites. This oversight arises from computational challenges of accurately capturing the tidal effects in FDM simulations. In this study, we present a novel simulation framework that, for the first time, enables the simulation of an FDM-stellar system within an observationally motivated gravitational potential of the Milky Way. This framework incorporates the diverse Galactic components, including the gravitational influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Using the Fornax dwarf galaxy as a case study, we demonstrate that tidal effects significantly alleviate the tension between observational data and the predicted heating effect for an FDM particle mass of $m_a\sim 10^{-22}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Generative modeling of convergence maps based on predicted one-point statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Weak gravitational lensing is a key cosmological probe for current and future large-scale surveys. While power spectra are commonly used for analyses, they fail to capture non-Gaussian information from nonlinear structure formation, necessitating higher-order statistics and methods for efficient map generation. Aims: To develop an emulator that generates accurate convergence maps directly from an input power spectrum and wavelet l1-norm without relying on computationally intensive simulations. Methods: We use either numerical or theoretical predictions to construct convergence maps by iteratively adjusting wavelet coefficients to match target marginal distributions and their inter-scale dependencies, incorporating higher-order statistical information. Results: The resulting kappa maps accurately reproduce the input power spectrum and exhibit higher-order statistical properties consistent with the input predictions, providing an efficient tool for weak lensing analyses.</description>

      <title>Inflationary magnetogenesis beyond slow-roll and its induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic fields observed on both astrophysical and cosmological scales is a compelling problem that has the potential to shed light on the early Universe. We analytically investigate inflationary magnetogenesis in scenarios where a brief departure from slow-roll inflation - akin to mechanisms proposed for primordial black hole formation - leads to enhanced magnetic field generation with a growing power spectrum. Focusing on the Ratra model, we derive an analytic bound on the growth of the magnetic field power spectrum in this context, showing that the spectral index can reach $d \ln {\cal P}_B / d \ln k = 4.75$ during the growth phase. This growth enables amplification from CMB-safe large-scale amplitudes to values of astrophysical relevance. We further compute the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by the resulting magnetic fields, incorporating their rich spectral features. Under suitable conditions, the induced signal exhibits a characteristic frequency dependence and amplitude within reach of future gravitational wave observatories, providing a distinctive signature of this mechanism and a specific class of templates for upcoming gravitational wave searches.</description>

      <title>Where are all the dark galaxies? Predicting galaxy/halo locations from their bright neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical objects in our universe that are too faint to be directly detectable exist and are important - an obvious example being dark matter. The same can also apply to very faint baryonic objects, such as low luminosity dwarf galaxies and gravitationally compact objects (e.g., rogue planets, white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, dark sirens). While they are very difficult to observe directly, they have locations that are highly important when studying astrophysical phenomena. Here, we use a machine learning algorithm known as symbolic regression to model the probability of a dark object's existence as a function of their separation distances to their closest two ``bright" (directly observable) neighbors, and the distances of these bright objects to each other. An advantage of this algorithm is that it is interpretable by humans and can be used to make reproducible predictions. Galaxies with masses above $10^9 M_{\odot}$ and halos above $10^{12} M_{\odot} $ are the objects that we separate into ``bright" and ``dark" to be used in our analysis. We find that it is possible to predict the density of dark objects using an analytic expression that depends on their distances to their closest bright neighbors in Illustris-TNG galaxy formation simulations, which is significantly better than the (linear) scale-dependent biasing prediction for $k \sim 1.0~ h$Mpc$^{-1}$ (and potentially beyond, if allowed by the resolution). This could potentially open the avenue for finding dark objects based on their vicinity to directly observable bright sources and make future surveys more targeted and efficient.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological analysis of X-ray cluster surveys VII. Bypassing scaling relations with Lagrangian Deep Learning and Simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters, the pinnacle of structure formation in our universe, are a powerful cosmological probe. Several approaches have been proposed to express cluster number counts, but all these methods rely on empirical explicit scaling relations that link observed properties to the total cluster mass. These scaling relations are over-parametrised, inducing some degeneracy with cosmology. Moreover, they do not provide a direct handle on the numerous non-gravitational phenomena that affect the physics of the intra-cluster medium. We present a proof-of-concept to model cluster number counts, that bypasses the explicit use of scaling relations. We rather implement the effect of several astrophysical processes to describe the cluster properties. We then evaluate the performances of this modelling for the cosmological inference. We developed an accelerated machine learning baryonic field-emulator, built upon the Lagrangian Deep Learning method and trained on the CAMELS simulations. We then created a pipeline that simulates cluster counts in terms of XMM observable quantities. We finally compare the performances of our model, with that involving scaling relations, for the purpose of cosmological inference based on simulations. Our model correctly reproduces the cluster population from the calibration simulations at the fiducial parameter values, and allows us to constrain feedback mechanisms. The cosmological-inference analyses indicate that our simulation-based model is less degenerate than the approach using scaling relations. This novel approach to model observed cluster number counts from simulations opens interesting perspectives for cluster cosmology. It has the potential to overcome the limitations of the standard approach, provided that the resolution and the volume of the simulations will allow a most realistic implementation of the complex phenomena driving cluster evolution.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Fragmentation of the QCD Axion on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic misalignment, one of the most compelling scenarios for the non-thermal generation of axion dark matter, is generally accompanied by axion fragmentation, a process in which the energy of the axion condensate is transferred to its perturbations. The dynamics of fragmentation, at least in the context of dark matter production, have so far been studied semi-analytically using perturbation theory. In this work, we present the first classical lattice simulation of kinetic axion fragmentation in the context of dark matter production, focusing on parameters relevant to the QCD axion. Our findings indicate that the non-perturbative dynamics captured by the lattice lead to a significantly broader spectrum of axion fluctuations, with a sustained transfer of energy to mildly relativistic modes and with smaller occupation numbers compared to the linear approximation. As a consequence, the final dark matter abundance is typically O(1) lower than in the linear approximation, which is itself O(1) lower than the zero-mode-only prediction. This broadening and suppression of the spectrum could have a significant impact on axion mini-halo formation, one of the main experimental handles on kinetic fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass tension or suppressed growth rate of matter perturbations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming a minimal $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM value ($\gamma \simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\sum m_\nu \gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\gamma &gt; 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\gamma &gt; 0.55$ at the level of $\sim 2\sigma$. This preference increases to $\sim 2.5$-$3\sigma$ when a physically motivated prior $\sum m_\nu \ge 0.06$ eV from oscillation experiments is imposed.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Frequency Combs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a new class of time periodic attractor solutions in scalar field cosmology, which we term Cosmological Frequency Combs (CFC). These solutions arise in exponential quintessence models with a phantom matter background and exhibit coherent phase-locked oscillations in the scalar field's normalized variables. We demonstrate that such dynamics induce modulations in observables like the Hubble parameter and growth rate, offering a dynamical mechanism to even address the H0 tension exactly. Our results uncover a previously unexplored phase of cosmic acceleration, linking the concept of frequency combs to large scale cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>ML-Driven Strong Lens Discoveries: Down to $\theta_E \sim 0.03''$ and $M_\mathrm{halo}&lt; 10^{11} M_\odot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results on extending the strong lens discovery space down to much smaller Einstein radii ($\theta_E\lesssim0.03''$) and much lower halo mass ($M_\mathrm{halo}&lt;10^{11}M_\odot$) through the combination of JWST observations and machine learning (ML) techniques. First, we forecast detectable strong lenses with JWST using CosmoDC2 as the lens catalog, and a source catalog down to 29th magnitude. By further incorporating the VELA hydrodynamical simulations of high-redshift galaxies, we simulate strong lenses. We train a ResNet on these images, achieving near-100\% completeness and purity for ``conventional" strong lenses ($\theta_E\gtrsim 0.5''$), applicable to JWST, HST, the Roman Space Telescope and Euclid VIS. For the first time, we also search for very low halo mass strong lenses ($M_{halo}&lt;10^{11}M_\odot$) in simulations, with $\theta_E\ll 0.5''$, down to the best resolution ($0.03''$) and depth (10,000~sec) limits of JWST using ResNet. A U-Net model is employed to pinpoint these small lenses in images, which are otherwise virtually impossible for human detection. Our results indicate that JWST can find $\sim 17$/deg$^2$ such low-halo-mass lenses, with the locations of $\sim 1.1$/deg$^2$ of these detectable by the U-Net at $\sim100$\% precision (and $\sim 7.0$/deg$^2$ at a 99.0\% precision). To validate our model for finding ``conventional" strong lenses, we apply it to HST images, discovering two new strong lens candidates previously missed by human classifiers in a crowdsourcing project (Garvin et al. 2022). This study demonstrates the (potentially ``superhuman") advantages of ML combined with current and future space telescopes for detecting conventional, and especially, low-halo-mass strong lenses, which are critical for testing CDM models.</description>

      <title>Universal lower bound on the axion decay constant from free streaming effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that enhancement of the axion relic abundance compared to the standard misalignment contribution generically leads to the production of nonzero momentum axion modes, resulting in warm dark matter behavior and enhanced isocurvature perturbations. It leads to universal constraints on the axion parameter space that are independent of detailed model assumptions and cosmological history. For models enhancing relic abundance with gradient axion modes, observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest impose a lower bound on the axion decay constant, $f_a \gtrsim 10^{15} {\rm GeV}\,(10^{-18}{\rm eV}/m_a)$, from the free-streaming effect. For models relying on the delay of coherent axion oscillations, we obtain a slightly weaker bound, $f_a \gtrsim 10^{14} {\rm GeV}\,(10^{-18}{\rm eV}/m_a)$. We make relatively conservative choices to establish these universal bounds but also provide scaling parameters that can be calibrated for stronger constraints in concrete models and updated as observations improve.</description>

      <title>PQ-ball and its Real Scalar Analogue in an Expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of quasi-stable localized scalar configurations in spontaneously symmetry breaking U(1) model by 3+1-dimensional classical lattice simulations. Such configurations are called PQ-balls, as the primary motivation of this kind of configuration is Peccei-Quinn theory under the kinetic misalignment mechanism. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that they can form if the PQ charge is generated through the coherent rotation of a complex scalar field in the complex plane, via dynamics analogous to the Affleck-Dine mechanism. These configurations subsequently decay due to the U(1)-breaking effect induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also demonstrate the formation and decay of oscillons in a similar setup in a real scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Searching for intermediate mass ratio binary black hole mergers in the third observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of binary black holes with mass ratios $10^{-4}\lesssim q \lesssim 0.1$ are astrophysically interesting sources of gravitational waves. Mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with stellar-mass black holes would be IMRIs, so their detection can help us probe the formation mechanisms of IMBHs. They can also help us perform precise tests of general relativity due to the presence of strong higher-order mode emission. We perform a search for aligned-spin IMRIs within the data of the two LIGO detectors in the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, including higher modes in the template banks for the first time. We use the IAS-HM pipeline for our search and construct template banks in the range $1/100 &lt; q&lt;1/18$ using the SEOBNRv5HM waveform model. Our banks retain a similar level of effectualness for IMRPhenomXHM and BHPTNRSur2dq1e3 waveforms, making our search results relatively robust against waveform systematics. We show that the sensitivity volume of the search increases by up to $\sim 500\%$ upon inclusion of higher modes. We do not find any significant candidates with inverse false alarm rate (IFAR) $&gt; 1$ year in the O3 data. This gives us upper limits on the IMRI merger rate in the local Universe, ranging from $\sim 30$ to $10^3$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ depending on the masses of the black holes in the binary. These constraints are consistent with rate predictions in the literature. Our projections indicate that we would be able to detect IMRIs or constrain some of their proposed formation channels in the fourth (O4) and fifth (O5) observing runs.</description>

      <title>A Mid-Thirties Crisis: Dissecting the Properties of Gravitational Wave Sources Near the 35 Solar Mass Peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One striking feature of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in the first decade of gravitational-wave astronomy is an excess of events with component masses around $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Multiple formation channels have been proposed to explain this excess. To distinguish among these channels, it is essential to examine their predicted population-level distributions across additional parameters. In this work, we focus on BBH mergers near the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak and infer the population distributions of primary mass ($m_1$), mass ratio ($q$), effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$), and redshift ($z$). We observe a gradual increase in the merger rate with $m_1$, rising by a factor of $3$ from $20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to a peak around $34\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, followed by a sharp, order-of-magnitude decline by $50\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This population also shows a weak preference for equal-mass mergers and has a $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution skewed toward positive values, with a median of zero excluded at approximately $90\%$ confidence. We find no significant $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation in the $35\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak population, suggesting that lower-mass systems ($m_1&lt;20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) likely drive the $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ anti-correlation observed in the full BBH merger catalog. The redshift evolution of the merger rate is consistent with the cosmic star formation rate. We compare our findings with predictions from a wide range of formation channels. We find that common variants of the pair-instability supernova scenario, as well as hierarchical merger models, are incompatible with the observed features of the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ population. Ultimately, none of the formation channels we consider can explain all or even most of the features observed in this population. The ''mid-thirties'' of black hole mergers are in crisis.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes and their surroundings: MeV signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational potential of supermassive black holes is so powerful that it triggers some of the most intense phenomena in the Universe. Accretion onto these objects and relativistic jet emission from their vicinity are observable across a wide range of frequencies and throughout cosmic history. However, despite this wealth of data, many aspects of their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Investigating this phenomena across all frequencies is crucial, yet some energy windows are still poorly explored. One such window is the MeV energy range: many key signatures related to the emission from the SMBH environment - both in quiescent and active phases - are expected to lie between one and several hundreds MeV. In this work, we explore some of the open questions regarding the behavior and emission processes in the surroundings of SMBHs, and how these questions might be approached. From the elusive nature of Fermi bubbles around our Galactic Centre, to the origin of high-energy neutrinos in the nuclei and jets of Active Galactic Nuclei, to the nature and emission mechanisms of the most powerful blazars, the MeV window stands out as a crucial key to understanding SMBH physics.</description>

      <title>Impact of a complex scalar spectator field on baryon asymmetry within spontaneous baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the framework of spontaneous baryogenesis by investigating the generation of baryon asymmetry when the inflaton, $\theta$, is minimally coupled with a complex spectator scalar field $\phi$, as $\theta^2|\phi|^2$. To do so, we also consider $\phi$ non-minimally coupled with the Ricci scalar curvature $R$ through a Yukawa-like interaction. We do not consider further interactions of the spectator field with the fermions of the Standard Model, considering it \emph{de facto} as a dark scalar field. In evaluating the violation of the baryon-number conservation during the reheating epoch, in a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe, we follow a semiclassical approach, where $\theta$, $\phi$ and gravity are considered as classical fields, whereas the fermions are quantized. We solve the equations of motion for the inflaton and spectator fields, respectively at first and zero-order in perturbation theory, neglecting at first stage the expansion of the universe. Afterwards, we quantify how the spectator field modifies the inflationary dynamics and thus find the baryon asymmetry produced via the inflaton decays into fermion-antifermion pairs by computing the corresponding decay amplitudes. We therefore obtain small first order correction to standard spontaneous baryogenesis and finally discuss the mass-mixing between fermions. Accordingly, the effects of considering the universe expansion are accounted, showing when the coupling between $\phi$ and $R$ becomes noticeable in altering the overall baryon asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength variability analysis of the blazar S5 0716+714 during a long-lasting period of low activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring campaign of the blazar S5 0716+714 from 2022 November 26 to 2023 May 28 using optical telescopes in Egypt and Bulgaria. Data were taken during 84 nights in 11 of which intranight monitoring was performed. We also use optical and gamma-ray survey data. On long-term time-scales, we find a gradual decrease of the S5 0716+714 activity since the beginning of 2020 in both optical and gamma-rays. On short-term time-scales, the individual optical light curves are strongly correlated among each other with no time lags observed. The V-band percentage variability amplitude equals 97.59 +/- 0.02 per cent. We find moderate flatter-when-brighter spectral behaviour with the strength of the 'spectral index - flux' anti-correlation decreasing towards the longer wavelengths. The main feature of the short-term light curves is a transient quasi-periodic oscillation with a period of 43.5 +/- 3.6 d. The V-band light curve is modelled with two helically moving blobs and a synchrotron flare. We estimate the resulting parameters, as well as limits on the radius, magnetic field strength, and electron Lorentz factor of the region responsible for the flare. On intranight time-scales, we find smooth flux variations with no flares and derive a duty cycle in the range ~10-20 per cent. The lack of flares on intranight time-scales could result from a temporarily homogeneous jet flow without formation of turbulent cells in terms of prevented Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The analysis of the data reveals a low activity of S5 0716+714 on all time-scales during the observation period.</description>

      <title>Flux of Extragalactic Dark Matter in Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the contribution of extragalactic dark matter to the local dark matter density and flux in the Milky Way. By analyzing the Galactic escape velocity as a function of direction, we establish the criterion for separating dark matter particles bound to the Milky Way and those originating from the Local Group environment. Our analysis reveals that approximately 25% of dark matter particles in the Solar neighborhood have an extragalactic origin, contributing nearly 38% of the total mass flux. The directional dependence of this extragalactic component shows significant anisotropy across the sky, with implications for direct detection experiments. We provide quantitative predictions for detection rates and signatures that could help identify the extragalactic dark matter component in current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from a dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a `QCD dilaton' field, whose vacuum expectation value sets the strong coupling, can render the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) confinement transition first-order. The QCD dilaton is cosmologically attracted to a false vacuum at weak coupling in the early universe. Quantum tunnelling towards the true vacuum triggers prompt chiral symmetry breaking and confinement of QCD, leading to detonating bubbles of the hadronic phase. We find that plasma sound waves produced by this dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition generate a stochastic gravitational wave signal strikingly similar to the recently detected gravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Arrays. We briefly comment on how this theory can be probed through collider experiments and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Avoiding (photo-$z$) Catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral modeling codes that estimate photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) are a powerful and often reliable method for determining redshifts of galaxies. However, there are notable instances where degeneracies in spectral energy distribution (SED) colors lead to `catastrophic' failures. We highlight the case of COSBO-7, a dusty, intermediate-$z$ galaxy that masqueraded as a high-$z$ source, because it demonstrates a unique scenario where photo-$z$ codes run into issues despite extensive multi-wavelength photometry. We advocate that photo-$z$ fitting should aim to: (1) use the entire available SED (UV--radio) whenever possible to help break color degeneracies, (2) allow flexible dust attenuation prescriptions, both in terms of the attenuation curve slope and a varying 2175{\AA} absorption feature, and (3) implement uncertainty floors to account for limitations in spectral models and also on the photometry itself.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Quiescent Black Hole Population of Nearby Dwarf Galaxies with the Habitable World Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remain a significant unsolved problem in astrophysics, particularly in the low-mass regime, where observations are sparse. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), with its diffraction-limited imaging and high-resolution UV-optical spectroscopy, presents a unique opportunity to explore the demographics of massive black holes (MBHs) in nearby dwarf galaxies. We propose a program to dynamically detect quiescent MBHs with masses as low as $10^{4.5} \, \rm M_\odot$ in galaxies within $10-30$ Mpc, by resolving stellar velocity dispersions down to 30 $\rm km \, s^{-1}$. This effort will dramatically extend current black hole-host galaxy scaling relations into the dwarf regime, probing the fundamental connection between black hole seeds and their environments. Using a volume-limited sample of $\sim 100$ dwarf galaxies drawn from existing catalogs, HWO will resolve the gravitational sphere of influence of MBHs and enable precision measurements of stellar kinematics via Ca II triplet absorption lines. These observations will test predictions from competing seed formation scenarios -- light seeds from Population III remnants versus heavy seeds from direct collapse -- and clarify whether dwarf galaxies retain imprints of their initial black hole population. The results will offer critical insight into SMBH formation channel and the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Hot SM, Magnetic Flux &amp; Baryogenesis from Helicity Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the electroweak crossover of the Standard Model (SM) in the early Universe, focusing on the interplay between generalized global symmetries, magnetic flux dynamics, and baryogenesis. Employing the dimensionally reduced 3d effective field theory of the SM at high temperature, we identify the symmetry structure -- including higher-form and magnetic symmetries -- and analyze their spontaneous breaking patterns across the crossover. We further define a gauge-invariant mixing angle that interpolates between $\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ and $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{em}$ magnetic fields. Based on this framework, we examine baryogenesis via decaying magnetic helicity and identify three key effects: the baryon asymmetry is modified by an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor due to (1) the gauge-invariant definition of the mixing angle and (2) the approximate conservation of the unconfined magnetic flux; (3) a novel non-perturbative process in the presence of magnetic flux, which has been overlooked in previous analyses. Our findings suggest that the previous estimation of baryon asymmetry from the magnetic helicity decay may have sizable uncertainties, and we caution against relying on it, calling for further investigation.</description>

      <title>DESI DR2 reference mocks: clustering results from Uchuu-BGS and LRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to construct mock galaxy catalogues that accurately reproduce the redshift evolution of galaxy number density, clustering statistics, and baryonic properties, such as stellar mass for luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and absolute magnitude in the $r$-band for the bright galaxy sample (BGS), based on the first three years of observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). To achieve this, we applied the subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) technique to the Uchuu $N$-body simulation, which follows the evolution of 2.1 trillion particles within a volume of $8\,h^{-3}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{3}$, assuming a Planck base-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Using SHAM, we populated Uchuu subhalos with LRGs and BGS-BRIGHT ($r&lt;19.5$) galaxies up to redshift $z=1.1$, assigning stellar masses to LRGs and luminosities to BGS galaxies (up to $M_{\rm r}\leq 20$). Furthermore, we analyzed the clustering dependence on stellar mass and luminosity for each tracer. Our results show that the Uchuu BGS-BRIGHT and LRG mocks accurately reproduce the observed redshift evolution of clustering, with better than 5\% agreement for separations of $1&lt;r&lt;20\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and below 10\% for $0.1&lt;r&lt;1\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. For the Uchuu-LRG mock, we successfully captured the stellar mass dependence of clustering, while for the Uchuu-BGS mock, we replicated the clustering for various volume-limited subsamples. We also find good agreement between the data and mocks in the dependence of large-scale bias on luminosity for BGS-BRIGHT galaxies and on stellar mass for LRGs. Altogether, these results equip DESI with robust tools for generating high-fidelity lightcones for the remainder of the survey, thereby enhancing our understanding of the galaxy--halo connection.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Distortions of the High-Redshift Universe as Seen from Quasar Proper Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in optical astrometry allow us to infer the non-radial kinematic structure of the Universe directly from observations. Here I use a supervised machine learning neural network method to predict 1.57 million redshifts based on several photometric and metadata classifier parameters from the unWISE mid-infrared database and from Gaia. These estimates are used to divide the sample into three redshift bins: 1-2, 2-3, and $&gt;3$. For each subset, all available Gaia proper motions are used in a global vector spherical harmonic solution to degree 3 (30 fitting vector functions). I find significant differences in a few fitted proper motion patterns at different redshifts. The largest signals are seen in the comparison of the vector spherical harmonic fits for the 1-2 and 2-3 redshift bins. The significant harmonics include a rigid spin, a dipole glide from the north Galactic pole to the south and an additional quadrupole distortion. Validation tests with filtered subsamples indicate that the detected effect can be caused by hidden systematic errors in astrometry. The results are verified by using an independent source of redshifts and computing the observer's Galactocentric acceleration. This study offers a new observational test of alternative cosmological models.</description>

      <title>$E_6$ Unification of Freeze-In Dark Matter and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of \emph{freeze-in} dark matter production and baryogenesis in an $E_6$ extension of the Standard Model, featuring a residual $U(1)_{\psi'}$ gauge symmetry. This symmetry arises from a linear combination of $U(1)\chi$ and $U(1)_{\psi}$, both of which are subgroups of the $E_6$. The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{\psi'}$ symmetry governs the dynamics of a singlet fermion, which naturally serves as a freeze-in dark matter candidate. The dark matter mass arises from dimension-five operators, and a discrete symmetry ensures their stability. We show that freeze-in production from scalar decay can yield the correct relic abundance for dark matter masses between few MeV to a few hundred GeV. Simultaneously, heavy right-handed neutrinos generate light neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw and produce the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.</description>

Abstract: We provide a fully analytical approach to calculate the nonlinearities of the gravitational waves in the ringdown of a Kerr black hole in the eikonal limit. The corresponding quasi-normal modes are associated to the orbits of a closed circular null geodesic and the problem can be analyzed by taking the Penrose limit around it. We calculate analytically the amplitude and the phase of the quadratic quasi-normal modes as well as its dependence on the black hole spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the ionization of dense molecular clouds can be used to set strong constraints on dark matter models producing UV/X-ray photons in their annihilation or decay. We place robust and competitive constraints on various dark matter models, such as axion-like particles, scalars and sterile neutrinos, for masses between $\sim30$~eV and $10$~keV, and project forecasts to illustrate the potential of this target. We discuss how these constraints can be significantly improved by considering a more refined sample of molecular clouds near the Galactic Center and above the Galactic plane, a detailed modeling of the cosmic-ray ionization contribution and, potentially, a more refined analysis of the gas density in clouds through dust extinction maps. Thus, ionization of molecular clouds emerges as one of the most powerful tools for probing sub-keV dark matter.</description>

      <title>Is the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization evidence for dark energy dynamics partially caused by the excess smoothing of Planck CMB anisotropy data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the performance of the spatially-flat dynamical dark energy (DE) $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, with redshift-dependent DE fluid equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$, with and without a varying CMB lensing consistency parameter $A_L$, against Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (P18 and lensing) and a combination of non-CMB data composed of baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements that do not include DESI BAO data, Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) data points. From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\to\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\sigma$ errors). This joint analysis of CMB and non-CMB data favors DE dynamics over a cosmological constant at $\sim 1\sigma$ and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim 2\sigma$, i.e. more smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data than is predicted by the best-fit model. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\sim 2\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$, there is a difference of $2.8\sigma$ between P18 and non-CMB cosmological parameter constraints and $2.7\sigma$ between P18+lensing and non-CMB constraints. When $A_L$ is allowed to vary these tensions reduced to $1.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ respectively. Our P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation positively favors the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization without and with a varying $A_L$ parameter over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ is also positively favored over $w_0w_a$CDM.</description>

      <title>The Redshift-Space Momentum Power Spectrum III: measuring the growth rate from the SDSSv survey using auto- and cross- power spectrum of the galaxy density and momentum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution over time contains an abundance of cosmological information. One way to unlock this is by measuring the density and momentum power spectrum from the positions and peculiar velocities of galaxies, and fitting the cosmological parameters from these power spectrum. In this paper, we will explore the cross power spectrum between the density and momentum fields of galaxies. We derive the estimator of the density-momentum cross power spectrum multipoles. The growth rate of the large-scale-structure, $f\sigma_8$ is measured from fitting the combined density monopole, momentum monopole and cross dipole power spectrum. The estimators and models of power spectrum as well as our fitting method have been tested using mock catalogues, and we find that they perform well in recovering the fiducial values of the cosmological parameters of the simulations, and we also find that the errors of the parameters can be largely reduced by including the cross-power spectrum in the fit. We measure the auto-density, auto-momentum and cross power spectrum using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 peculiar velocity catalogue. The fit result of the growth rate $f\sigma_8$ is $f\sigma_8=0.413^{+0.050}_{-0.058}$ at effective redshift $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.073$, and our measurement is consistent with the prediction of the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter cosmological model assuming General Relativity.</description>

Abstract: We study spatially-flat dynamical dark energy parametrizations, $w(z)$CDM, with redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ expressed using three different quadratic and other polynomial forms (as functions of $1-a$, where $a$ is the scale factor), without and with a varying cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We use Planck CMB anisotropy data (P18 and lensing) and a large, mutually-consistent non-CMB data compilation that includes Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Hubble parameter ($H(z)$), and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, but not recent DESI BAO data. The six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations show higher consistency between the CMB and non-CMB data constraints compared to the XCDM ($+A_L$) and $w_0 w_a$CDM ($+A_L$) cases. Constraints from the most-restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation on the six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations indicate that dark energy dynamics is favored over a cosmological constant by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, but only by $\gtrsim 1\sigma$ when $A_L$ is allowed to vary (and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim2\sigma$ significance). Non-CMB data dominate the P18+lensing+non-CMB compilation at low $z$ and favor quintessence-like dark energy. At high $z$ P18+lensing data dominate, favoring phantom-like dark energy with significance from $1.5\sigma$ to $2.9 \sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, and from $1.1\sigma$ to $1.8\sigma$ when $A_L$ varies. These results suggest that the observed excess weak lensing smoothing of some of the Planck CMB anistropy multipoles is partially responsible for the $A_L = 1$ cases $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ evidence for dark energy dynamics over a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Constraint on Neutrino Statistics from Cosmological Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of neutrino statistical property on cosmology and the constraints imposed by cosmological data on neutrino statistics. Cosmological data from probes such as Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) radiation and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) are used to constrain the statistical parameter of neutrino. This constraint is closely related to the degeneracy effects among neutrino statistical property, the sum of neutrino masses, and the Hubble constant. Our results show that purely bosonic neutrinos can be ruled out at 95\% confidence level and purely fermionic neutrinos are preferred.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic galaxy alignments in the KiDS-1000 bright sample: dependence on colour, luminosity, morphology, and galaxy scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxies is a major astrophysical contaminant to weak gravitational lensing measurements, and the study of its dependence on galaxy properties helps provide meaningful physical priors that aid cosmological analyses. This work studied for the first time the dependence of IA on galaxy structural parameters. We measured the IA of bright galaxies, selected on apparent r-band magnitude r&lt;20, in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). Machine-learning-based photometric redshift estimates are available for this galaxy sample that helped us obtain a clean measurement of its IA signal. We supplemented this sample with a catalogue of structural parameters from Sersic profile fits to the surface-brightness profiles of the galaxies. We split the sample on galaxy intrinsic colour, luminosity, and Sersic index, and we fitted the non-linear linear alignment model to galaxy position-shape projected correlation function measurements on large scales. We observe a power-law luminosity dependence of the large-scale IA amplitude, $A_{IA}$, for both the red and high-Sersic-index ($n_s&gt;2.5$) samples, and find no significant difference between the two. We measure an $\sim1.5\sigma$ lower $A_{IA}$ for red galaxies that also have a Sersic index of $n_s&lt;4$ compared to the expected amplitude predicted using the sample's luminosity. We also probe the IA of red galaxies as a function of galaxy scale by varying the radial weight employed in the shape measurement. On large scales (above 6 Mpc/$h$), we do not detect a significant difference in the alignment. On smaller scales, we observe that IA increase with galaxy scale, with outer galaxy regions showing stronger alignments than inner regions. Finally, for intrinsically blue galaxies, we find $A_{IA}=-0.67\pm1.00$, which is consistent with previous works, and we find IA to be consistent with zero for the low-Sersic-index ($n_s&lt;2.5$) sample.</description>

      <title>Is Dynamical Dark Energy Necessary? DESI BAO and Modified Recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) exhibit a mild-to-moderate tension with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) observations when interpreted within a flat $\Lambda$CDM framework. This discrepancy has been cited as evidence for dynamical dark energy (DDE). Given the profound implications of DDE for fundamental physics, we explore whether the tension can instead be resolved by modifying the physics of recombination. We find that a phenomenological model of modified recombination can effectively reconcile the BAO and CMB datasets and, unlike DDE, also predicts a higher Hubble constant $H_0$, thereby partially alleviating the Hubble tension. A global fit to BAO, CMB, and calibrated SN data favors modified recombination over DDE.</description>

      <title>What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial black holes or companion stars?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the scenario that the observable universe emerged from the vicinity of a negative mass ring singularity, and all content of the universe travels at the same group velocity close to the speed of light on a geodesic trajectory along the axis of rotation of the singularity. In appropriate coordinate parametrization and evaluated on the trajectory, we find that the metric tensor in the vicinity of the trajectory exhibits a conformal scale factor $a(\eta)$ with contraction and subsequent expansion properties that solve the horizon problem. We then introduce a static flow of gravitating radiation along the trajectory (perturbatively with respect to the mass scale of the singularity) to model a homogeneous radiation dominated universe. Solving the Einstein field equations with a physically motivated ansatz of metric perturbation then reveals that the effective conformal scale factor indeed grows asymptotically with the same power law as expected in a conventional radiation dominated universe.</description>

      <title>$\tilde\xi$-attractors in metric-affine gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new class of inflationary attractors in metric-affine gravity. Such class features a non-minimal coupling $\tilde\xi \, \Omega(\phi)$ with the Holst invariant $\tilde{\cal R}$ and an inflaton potential proportional to $\Omega(\phi)^2$. The attractor behaviour of the class takes place with two combined strong coupling limits. The first limit is realized at large $\tilde\xi$, which makes the theory equivalent to a $\tilde{\cal R}^2$ model. Then, the second limit considers a very small Barbero-Immirzi parameter which leads the inflationary predictions of the $\tilde{\cal R}^2$ model towards the ones of Starobinsky inflation. Because of the analogy with the renown $\xi$-attractors, we label this new class as $\tilde\xi$-attractors.</description>

      <title>Minimal Dirac seesaw dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal Type-I Dirac seesaw which accommodates a thermal scalar dark matter (DM) candidate protected by a charge conjugation symmetry in dark sector $C_{\rm dark}$, without introducing any additional field beyond the ones taking part in the seesaw. A $Z_4$ symmetry is introduced to realise the tree level Dirac seesaw while the Majorana mass terms are prevented by an unbroken global lepton number symmetry. While the spontaneous $Z_4$ breaking together with electroweak symmetry breaking lead to the generation of light Dirac neutrino mass, it also results in the formation of domain walls. These cosmologically catastrophic walls can be made to annihilate away by introducing bias terms while also generating stochastic gravitational waves (GW) within reach of near future experiments like \texttt{LISA}, \texttt{BBO}, $\mu$-\texttt{ARES} etc. The scalar DM parameter space can be probed at direct and indirect search experiments. Light Dirac neutrinos also enhance the relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. The model can also explain the observed baryon asymmetry via Dirac leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Causality and Stability from Acoustic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories with derivative interactions, backgrounds spontaneously break local Lorentz invariance. We study the motion of perturbations of the scalar, "phonons", on these anisotropic time-dependent backgrounds in curved spacetimes. The phonons propagate on null geodesics of an effective acoustic spacetime which has its own metric and a connection featuring non-metricity with respect to the metric defined by gravity. These acoustic geodesics correspond to motion with four-acceleration in the usual spacetime. We indicate the differences and duality between the phonons' canonical four-momenta and four-velocities, and the analogies with photons in media. For an arbitrary moving observer, we covariantly define the phonon's energy, relative phase velocity, effective refraction index and mass tensor. We point out that true instabilities (ghosts, gradient) are observer independent, being identified by the acoustic metric's signature and determinant. However, apparent instabilities, such as complex phonon energies, can stem from an ill-posed Cauchy problem in certain observer frames. Negative phonon energies appear for supersonic observers, not signaling true instabilities, but leading to Cherenkov radiation. We extend this local picture to a global foliation, deriving the condition for a spatial slice to be a Cauchy surface for a well-posed initial value problem. This Hamiltonian is bounded if the foliation's comoving observer is subsonic. Otherwise, for a Killing vector timelike in both metrics, an alternative conserved charge that bounds motion exists. The action for perturbations yields an acoustically conserved asymmetric energy-momentum tensor (EMT), not conserved in the usual spacetime. Yet, with a timelike acoustic Killing vector, this EMT forms a current conserved in both the acoustic and usual spacetimes, with the acoustic Hamiltonian functional as its conserved charge.</description>

Abstract: In the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) model with n extra compactified dimensions, the gravitational potential scales as 1/r^{n+1} and becomes significantly stronger at short distances. We investigate the possibility of forming small-sized composite systems of Standard Model particles bound by this potential. Such bound states, composed of quarks, neutrinos, axions, or other particles, exhibit a small cross-section-to-mass ratio, making them viable candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Consistency relations bridging gravitational wave and large scale structure observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy provides a unified model independent theoretical framework to study the effects of dark energy and modified gravity. We show that applying the EFT to Horndeski theories it is possible to derive consistency relations (CR) between physically observable quantities, valid for different classes of theories defined by the brading parameter behavior, while leaving the other property functions free. As expected, the CRs are also valid for general relativity, and relate the effective gravitational constant, the slip parameter, the gravitational and electromagnetic waves (EMW) luminosity distances, the speed of gravitational waves (GW) and the sound speed. Inspired by the form of the CRs for no-brading and constant brading theories, we propose a generalized phenomenological consistency condition. We apply the CRs to map the large scale structure observational constraints on the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter to GW-EMW distance ratio constraints. The CRs allow to probe the value of the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter with multimessenger observations, independently from large scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Q-balls Under Spontaneously Broken U(1) Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of Q-balls under a spontaneously broken global $U(1)$ symmetry. Q-balls are stabilized by the conservation of $U(1)$ charge, but when the symmetry is spontaneously broken, the resulting Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson can carry charge away from the Q-ball, potentially leading to charge leakage. To study this process in a controlled setting, we consider a scenario where Q-balls first form under an unbroken $U(1)$ symmetry, which is then spontaneously broken. We introduce two complex scalar fields: one responsible for forming the Q-ball, and the other for spontaneously breaking the $U(1)$ symmetry, allowing us to clearly separate the formation and symmetry-breaking phases. Using numerical simulations in a spherically symmetric system, we find that the evolution of Q-balls depends sensitively on the structure of the interaction between the two fields and the magnitude of symmetry breaking. Depending on parameters, Q-balls can completely decay, evaporate into smaller, stable Q-balls, or transition into oscillons/I-balls. In particular, we find that stable, localized remnants often survive the evolution over long timescales, especially when the symmetry-breaking scale is small. These results demonstrate that, even though spontaneous $U(1)$ breaking can lead to significant energy and charge loss from Q-balls, stable localized objects with reduced or no charge can frequently survive and potentially contribute to cosmological relics.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Dispersion of Gravitational Waves using Multi-Band Observation including Deci-Hertz: A Unique Probe to Cosmic Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dispersion in the speed of gravitational waves is a novel way to test the general theory of relativity and understand whether the origin of cosmic acceleration is due to any alternative theory of gravity. Several alternative theories of gravity predict dispersion in the gravitational wave signal in a frequency-dependent deviation from the speed of light at lower frequencies than accessible from current ground-based detectors. We show how a multi-band observation of gravitational wave signal combining deci-Hertz gravitational wave signal from LGWA (Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna) with ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope, and also including LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), we can probe the energy scale associated with effective theory of modified gravity scenarios by combining only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ high signal to noise ratio (SNR) with a precision of approximately $8.6\%$. This precision will further improve with the inclusion of more events as $\sqrt{N}$. In the future, this measurement will shed light on an unexplored domain of fundamental physics and will bring deeper insights into the phenomenon of cosmic acceleration. The operation of the gravitational wave detector in the deci-Hertz frequency band is key to exploring this frontier of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Dark-matter-induced transients over cosmic time: The role of star formation history profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.</description>
