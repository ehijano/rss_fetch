      <title>Equivalence of dynamics of disordered quantum ensembles and semi-infinite lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a formalism for mapping the exact dynamics of an ensemble of disordered quantum systems onto the dynamics of a single particle propagating along a semi-infinite lattice, with parameters determined by the probability distribution of disorder realizations of the original heterogeneous quantum ensemble. This mapping provides a geometric interpretation on the loss of coherence when averaging over the ensemble and allows computation of the exact dynamics of the entire disordered ensemble in a single simulation. Alternatively, by exploiting the reverse map, one can obtain lattice dynamics by averaging over realisations of disorder. The potential of this equivalence is showcased with examples of the map in both directions: obtaining dephasing of a qubit via mapping to a lattice model, and solving a simple lattice model via taking an average over realizations of disorder of a unit cell.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classes of classical stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic symmetry classification of the Markov generators of classical stochastic processes. Our classification scheme is based on the action of involutive symmetry transformations of a real Markov generator, extending the Bernard-LeClair scheme to the arena of classical stochastic processes and leading to a set of up to fifteen allowed symmetry classes. We construct families of solutions of arbitrary matrix dimensions for five of these classes with a simple physical interpretation of particles hopping on multipartite graphs. In the remaining classes, such a simple construction is prevented by the positivity of entries of the generator particular to classical stochastic processes, which imposes a further requirement beyond the usual symmetry classification constraints. We partially overcome this difficulty by resorting to a stochastic optimization algorithm, finding specific examples of generators of small matrix dimensions in six further classes, leaving the existence of the final four allowed classes an open problem. Our symmetry-based results unveil new possibilities in the dynamics of classical stochastic processes: Kramers degeneracy of eigenvalue pairs, dihedral symmetry of the spectra of Markov generators, and time reversal properties of stochastic trajectories and correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Spectral Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that noisy quantum dynamics exposed to weak measurements exhibit a spectral transition between gapless and gapped phases. To this end, we employ the Lyapunov spectrum obtained through singular values of a non-unitary matrix describing the dynamics. We discover that the gapless and gapped phases respectively correspond to the volume-law and area-law phases of the entanglement entropy for the dominant Lyapunov vector. This correspondence between the spectral gap and the scaling of entanglement offers an intriguing analogy with ground-state phase transitions. We also discuss some crucial differences from ground-state transitions, such as the scaling law of the entanglement and the exponentially small gaps. Furthermore, we show that the spectral transition leads to the transition of the timescale for the memory loss of initial states.</description>

      <title>Real-space model for activated processes in rejuvenation and memory behavior of glassy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We offer an alternative real-space description, based purely on activated processes, for the understanding of relaxation dynamics in hierarchical landscapes. To this end, we use the cluster model, a coarse-grained lattice model of a jammed system, to analyze rejuvenation and memory effects during aging after a hard quench. In this model, neighboring particles on a lattice aggregate through local interactions into clusters that fragment with a probability based on their size. Despite the simplicity of the cluster model, it has been shown to reproduce salient observables of the aging dynamics in colloidal systems, such as those accounting for particle mobility and displacements. Here, we probe the model for more complex quench protocols and show that it exhibits rejuvenation and memory effects similar to those attributed to the complex hierarchical structure of a glassy energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Animals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we introduce simple structures for the analysis of complex hypergraphs, hypergraph animals. These structures are designed to describe the local node neighbourhoods of nodes in hypergraphs. We establish their relationships to lattice animals and network motifs, and we develop their combinatorial properties for sparse and uncorrelated hypergraphs. We make use of the tight link of hypergraph animals to partition numbers, which opens up a vast mathematical framework for the analysis of hypergraph animals. We then study their abundances in random hypergraphs. Two transferable insights result from this analysis: (i) it establishes the importance of high-cardinality edges in ensembles of random hypergraphs that are inspired by the classical Erd\"os-Reny\'i random graphs; and (ii) there is a close connection between degree and hyperedge cardinality in random hypergraphs that shapes animal abundances and spectra profoundly. Both findings imply that hypergraph animals can have the potential to affect information flow and processing in complex systems. Our analysis of also suggests that we need to spend more effort on investigating and developing suitable conditional ensembles of random hypergraphs that can capture real-world structures and their complex dependency structures.</description>

      <title>Time crystal embodies chimeralike state in periodically driven quantum spin system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16523v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are a captivating occurrence in which a system composed of multiple interconnected elements exhibits a distinctive combination of synchronized and desynchronized behavior. The emergence of these states can be attributed to the complex interdependence between quantum entanglement and the delicate balance of interactions among system constituents. The emergence of discrete-time crystal (DTC) in typical many-body periodically driven systems occurs when there is a breaking of time translation symmetry. Coexisting coupled DTC and a ferromagnetic dynamically many-body localized (DMBL) phase at distinct regions have been investigated under the controlled spin rotational error of a disorder-free spin-1/2 chain for different types of spin-spin interactions. We contribute a novel approach for the emergence of the DTC-DMBL-chimeralike state, which is robust against external static fields in a periodically driven quantum many-body system.</description>

      <title>Duality analysis in symmetric group and its application to random tensor network model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ising model is the simplest to describe many-body effects in classical statistical mechanics. Duality analysis leads to a critical point under several assumptions. The Ising model itself has $Z(2)$ symmetry. The basis of the duality analysis is a nontrivial relationship between low and high-temperature expansions. However, the discrete Fourier transformation finds the hidden relationship automatically. The duality analysis can be naturally generalized into the case with the degrees of freedom with $Z(q)$ symmetry and random spin systems. We further obtain the duality in a series of permutation models in the present study by considering the symmetric group $S_q$ and its Fourier transformation. The permutation model in the symmetric group is closely related to the random quantum circuits and random tensor network model, often discussed in the context of quantum computing and the holographic principle, a property of string theories and quantum gravity. We provide a systematic way by our duality analysis to analyze the phase transition in these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The random XXZ quantum spin chain manifests localization (in the form of quasi-locality) in any fixed energy interval, as previously proved by the authors. In this article it is shown that this property implies slow propagation of information, one of the putative signatures of many-body localization, in the same energy interval.</description>

      <title>Complexity-stability relationships in disordered dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robert May famously used random matrix theory to predict that large, complex systems cannot admit stable fixed points. However, this general conclusion is not always supported by empirical observation: from cells to biomes, biological systems are large, complex and, often, stable. In this paper, we revisit May's argument in light of recent developments in both ecology and random matrix theory. Using a non-linear generalization of the competitive Lotka-Volterra model, we show that there are, in fact, two kinds of complexity-stability relationships in disordered dynamical systems: if self-interactions grow faster with density than cross-interactions, complexity is destabilizing; but if cross-interactions grow faster than self-interactions, complexity is stabilizing.</description>

      <title>Scaling and renormalization in high-dimensional regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a succinct derivation of the training and generalization performance of a variety of high-dimensional ridge regression models using the basic tools of random matrix theory and free probability. We provide an introduction and review of recent results on these topics, aimed at readers with backgrounds in physics and deep learning. Analytic formulas for the training and generalization errors are obtained in a few lines of algebra directly from the properties of the $S$-transform of free probability. This allows for a straightforward identification of the sources of power-law scaling in model performance. We compute the generalization error of a broad class of random feature models. We find that in all models, the $S$-transform corresponds to the train-test generalization gap, and yields an analogue of the generalized-cross-validation estimator. Using these techniques, we derive fine-grained bias-variance decompositions for a very general class of random feature models with structured covariates. These novel results allow us to discover a scaling regime for random feature models where the variance due to the features limits performance in the overparameterized setting. We also demonstrate how anisotropic weight structure in random feature models can limit performance and lead to nontrivial exponents for finite-width corrections in the overparameterized setting. Our results extend and provide a unifying perspective on earlier models of neural scaling laws.</description>
