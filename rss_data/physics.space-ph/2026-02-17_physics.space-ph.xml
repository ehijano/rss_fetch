      <title>Leveling of MHD turbulence imbalance in shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in plane shear flows with a streamwise background magnetic field in the super-Alfv\'enic regime. We show that the large-scale velocity shear suppresses turbulence imbalance, driving the system toward a balanced state -- the energies of counter-propagating Alfv\'en waves become essentially equal, even at initially perfectly imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence. This balancing is due to the shear-induced linear non-modal dynamics of Alfv\'en waves, including their transient growth and over-reflection. This linear route to balancing turbulence is new -- fundamentally different from nonlinear ones operative in shearless MHD turbulence -- and have direct implications for understanding balanced/imbalanced MHD turbulence in the solar wind, which is modeled as a shear flow in a thermodynamically complex plasma.</description>

      <title>Theoretical calculation of the antenna impedance and shot noise at low-frequencies: application to Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The voltage power spectral density measured around the ambient plasma frequency in space is not affected by spacecraft perturbations that impact traditional plasma analysers. The spectroscopy of this noise, produced by the quasi-thermal motion of ambient charged particles, is thus an efficient tool for measuring in situ plasma properties in space. In contrast, the spectrum at lower frequencies, which is determined by the parallel antenna resistance due to electric currents, depends on the spacecraft local environment. Recently, \citet{zhe26} erroneously estimated this resistance from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) data. We hereby present a theoretical calculation of this resistance, which determines the shot noise and the receiver gain at low frequencies, and provide a preliminary comparison to PSP/FIELDS data. We also show that this resistance can change the receiver gain in the frequency range used for QTN spectroscopy during PSP inner orbits.</description>

      <title>Description of 4 Spacecraft, Moving on Elliptic Kepler Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The four-spacecraft formation is essential for measurements of various physical fields. The use of this formation on substantially elliptical heliocentric Kepler orbits allows measuring gradients of gravitation field in Solar system. The accuracy of the measurements will be sufficient to confirm or to refute modified theories of gravity. In this paper a new approach for the description of this formation is presented. The analytical solutions of the linearized motion equations are obtained. The distinctive feature of the solutions is that they use Cartesian coordinates of one of the spacecraft, termed the chief. These solutions have a clear physical meaning. It is shown, that the volume of a tetrahedron formed by spacecraft is a polynomial of 3-rd degree of Cartesian coordinates of the chief. The polynomial's coefficients are functions of initial spacecraft coordinates and velocities and linearly depend on time. If all spacecraft have the same periods of rotation around the Sun, the volume is a polynomial of 2-nd degree of the chief coordinates with time-independent coefficients. In this case the volume can be zeroed from 0 to 4 times per the period. Suggested approach can significantly simplify planning missions for measurements of various interplanetary fields.</description>

      <title>Unprecedented Multipoint Observation of Spatially Varying ICME Turbulence of Different Ages during October 2024 Extreme Solar Storm at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding turbulence in interplanetary coronal mass ejections is fundamental to space plasma research and critical for assessing the impact of space weather on geospace. Turbulence governs energy cascade, plasma heating, magnetic reconnection, and solar wind magnetosphere coupling, thereby influencing both ICME evolution and geoeffectiveness. While previous event-based and statistical studies have examined ICME turbulence and its radial evolution in great detail, no significant measurements of ICME magnetic turbulence at a specific vantage point have been made using multiple observatories separated azimuthally. Here, we present the first multipoint analysis of MHD turbulence across ICME plasma regions, using four spacecraft at the Sun-Earth L1 point, separated by 80 RE along the dawn-dusk direction. Previous studies reveal that ICME shocks, sheaths, and magnetic clouds are highly non-uniform, with strong azimuthal variability. Using high-resolution magnetic field observations from ISRO's Aditya-L1, NASA's Wind and ACE, and NOAA's DSCOVR, we analyze turbulence associated with the 10th October 2024 solar storm, which triggered the second-strongest geomagnetic storm of solar cycle 25. Our results reveal significant variability and differing turbulence maturity across small separations, supported by analysis of field-aligned and perpendicular magnetic field cascades, indicating strong anisotropies. Sheath turbulence is substantially modified by shock induced energy injection. Evidence of compressible turbulence and plasma energization at the flux rope interaction region indicates that internal processes, such as magnetic reconnection, strongly influence ICME plasma evolution, highlighting pronounced spatial variability in turbulence and plasma states observed by multiple L1 monitors near Earth and underscoring their potential role in space weather impacts.</description>
