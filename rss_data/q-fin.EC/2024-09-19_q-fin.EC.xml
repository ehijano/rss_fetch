      <title>The long-term human capital and health impacts of a pollution reduction programme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of the staggered roll-out of a pollution reduction programme introduced in the UK in the 1950s. The policy allowed local authorities to introduce so-called Smoke Control Areas (SCAs) which banned smoke emissions. We start by digitizing historical pollution data to show that the policy led to an immediate reduction in black smoke concentrations. We then merge data on the exact location, boundary and month of introduction of SCAs to individual-level outcomes in older age using individuals' year-month and location of birth. We show that exposure to the programme increased individuals' birth weights as well as height in adulthood. We find no impact on their years of education or fluid intelligence.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Hierarchy in Day-to-day Network Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When making route decisions, travelers may engage in a certain degree of reasoning about what the others will do in the upcoming day, rendering yesterday's shortest routes less attractive. This phenomenon was manifested in a recent virtual experiment that mimicked travelers' repeated daily trip-making process. Unfortunately, prevailing day-to-day traffic dynamical models failed to faithfully reproduce the collected flow evolution data therein. To this end, we propose a day-to-day traffic behavior modeling framework based on the Cognitive Hierarchy theory, in which travelers with different levels of strategic-reasoning capabilities form their own beliefs about lower-step travelers' capabilities when choosing their routes. Two widely-studied day-to-day models, the Network Tatonnement Process dynamic and the Logit dynamic, are extended into the framework and studied as examples. Calibration of the virtual experiment is performed using the extended Network Tatonnement Process dynamic, which fits the experimental data reasonably well. We show that the two extended dynamics have multiple equilibria, one of which is the classical user equilibrium. While analyzing global stability is intractable due to the presence of multiple equilibria, local stabilities near equilibria are developed analytically and verified by numerical experiments. General insights on how key parameters affect the stability of user equilibria are unveiled.</description>

      <title>It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many socio-economic systems require positive economic growth rates to function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises, these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years, more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of 'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization, which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the concept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general definition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a long-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence: employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of findings across different cases and disciplines.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evidence That Conversational Artificial Intelligence Can Steer Consumer Behavior Without Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational AI models are becoming increasingly popular and are about to replace traditional search engines for information retrieval and product discovery. This raises concerns about monetization strategies and the potential for subtle consumer manipulation. Companies may have financial incentives to steer users toward search results or products in a conversation in ways that are unnoticeable to consumers. Using a behavioral experiment, we show that conversational AI models can indeed significantly shift consumer preferences. We discuss implications and ask whether regulators are sufficiently prepared to combat potential consumer deception.</description>

      <title>Unlocking NACE Classification Embeddings with OpenAI for Enhanced Analysis and Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE) is the standard classification system for the categorization of economic and industrial activities within the European Union. This paper proposes a novel approach to transform the NACE classification into low-dimensional embeddings, using state-of-the-art models and dimensionality reduction techniques. The primary challenge is the preservation of the hierarchical structure inherent within the original NACE classification while reducing the number of dimensions. To address this issue, we introduce custom metrics designed to quantify the retention of hierarchical relationships throughout the embedding and reduction processes. The evaluation of these metrics demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in retaining the structural information essential for insightful analysis. This approach not only facilitates the visual exploration of economic activity relationships, but also increases the efficacy of downstream tasks, including clustering, classification, integration with other classifications, and others. Through experimental validation, the utility of our proposed framework in preserving hierarchical structures within the NACE classification is showcased, thereby providing a valuable tool for researchers and policymakers to understand and leverage any hierarchical data.</description>

      <title>What Does ChatGPT Make of Historical Stock Returns? Extrapolation and Miscalibration in LLM Stock Return Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine how large language models (LLMs) interpret historical stock returns and compare their forecasts with estimates from a crowd-sourced platform for ranking stocks. While stock returns exhibit short-term reversals, LLM forecasts over-extrapolate, placing excessive weight on recent performance similar to humans. LLM forecasts appear optimistic relative to historical and future realized returns. When prompted for 80% confidence interval predictions, LLM responses are better calibrated than survey evidence but are pessimistic about outliers, leading to skewed forecast distributions. The findings suggest LLMs manifest common behavioral biases when forecasting expected returns but are better at gauging risks than humans.</description>
