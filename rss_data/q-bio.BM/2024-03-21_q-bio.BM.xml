      <title>DecompOpt: Controllable and Decomposed Diffusion Models for Structure-based Molecular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, 3D generative models have shown promising performances in structure-based drug design by learning to generate ligands given target binding sites. However, only modeling the target-ligand distribution can hardly fulfill one of the main goals in drug discovery -- designing novel ligands with desired properties, e.g., high binding affinity, easily synthesizable, etc. This challenge becomes particularly pronounced when the target-ligand pairs used for training do not align with these desired properties. Moreover, most existing methods aim at solving \textit{de novo} design task, while many generative scenarios requiring flexible controllability, such as R-group optimization and scaffold hopping, have received little attention. In this work, we propose DecompOpt, a structure-based molecular optimization method based on a controllable and decomposed diffusion model. DecompOpt presents a new generation paradigm which combines optimization with conditional diffusion models to achieve desired properties while adhering to the molecular grammar. Additionally, DecompOpt offers a unified framework covering both \textit{de novo} design and controllable generation. To achieve so, ligands are decomposed into substructures which allows fine-grained control and local optimization. Experiments show that DecompOpt can efficiently generate molecules with improved properties than strong de novo baselines, and demonstrate great potential in controllable generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Bridging Text and Molecule: A Survey on Multimodal Frameworks for Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated immense potential in scientific research. Within molecular science, it is revolutionizing the traditional computer-aided paradigm, ushering in a new era of deep learning. With recent progress in multimodal learning and natural language processing, an emerging trend has targeted at building multimodal frameworks to jointly model molecules with textual domain knowledge. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey on multimodal frameworks for molecules research. Specifically,we begin with the development of molecular deep learning and point out the necessity to involve textual modality. Next, we focus on recent advances in text-molecule alignment methods, categorizing current models into two groups based on their architectures and listing relevant pre-training tasks. Furthermore, we delves into the utilization of large language models and prompting techniques for molecular tasks and present significant applications in drug discovery. Finally, we discuss the limitations in this field and highlight several promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Protein Conformation Generation via Force-Guided SE(3) Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conformational landscape of proteins is crucial to understanding their functionality in complex biological processes. Traditional physics-based computational methods, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, suffer from rare event sampling and long equilibration time problems, hindering their applications in general protein systems. Recently, deep generative modeling techniques, especially diffusion models, have been employed to generate novel protein conformations. However, existing score-based diffusion methods cannot properly incorporate important physical prior knowledge to guide the generation process, causing large deviations in the sampled protein conformations from the equilibrium distribution. In this paper, to overcome these limitations, we propose a force-guided SE(3) diffusion model, ConfDiff, for protein conformation generation. By incorporating a force-guided network with a mixture of data-based score models, ConfDiff can can generate protein conformations with rich diversity while preserving high fidelity. Experiments on a variety of protein conformation prediction tasks, including 12 fast-folding proteins and the Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI), demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of systems with varying number of particles: from Liouville equations to general master equations for open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A varying number of particles is the most relevant characteristic of systems of interest in nature and technology; ranging from the exchange of energy and matter with the surrounding environment to the change of particle numbers through internal dynamics such as reactions. The physico-mathematical modeling of these systems is extremely challenging, with the major difficulty being the time dependence of the number of degrees of freedom and the additional constraint that the increment or reduction of the number and species of particles must not violate basic physical laws. Theoretical models, in such a case, represent the key tool for the design of computational strategies for numerical studies that deliver trustful results. In this manuscript, we discuss complementary physico-mathematical approaches of varying numbers of particles inspired by different specific numerical goals and provide a generalized equation that embeds all of them.</description>
