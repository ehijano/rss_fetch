      <title>An integrated electro-optically tunable multi-channel interference cavity laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrated a continuously tunable laser system by butt coupling a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) chip with a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) based multi-channel interference (MCI) cavity chip. This hybrid integrated lasers allows for fine-tuning of the laser wavelength from 1538 nm to 1560 nm with a resolution of 0.014 nm and a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) exceeding 30 dB. The MCI cavity chip is fabricated using the photolithography assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE) technique. The developed laser has an output power of approximately 10 {\mu}W, which can be further amplified to 70 mW using a commercial erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) without significant broadening of the laser linewidth.</description>

      <title>Multimer states in multilevel waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically the interplay of spontaneous emission and interactions for the multiple-excited quasistationary eigenstates in a finite periodic array of multilevel atoms coupled to the waveguide. We develop an analytical approach to calculate such eigenstates based on the subradiant dimer basis. Our calculations reveal the peculiar multimerization effect driven by the anharmonicity of the atomic potential: while a general eigenstate is an entangled one, there exist eigenstates that are products of dimers, trimers, or tetramers, depending on the size of the system and the fill factor. At half-filling, these product states acquire a periodic structure with all-to-all connections inside each multimer and become the most subradiant ones.</description>

      <title>Solitons in higher-order topological insulator created by unit cell twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that higher-order topological insulators can be created from usual square structure by twisting waveguides in each unit cell around the axis passing through the center of the unit cell, even without changing intracell distance between waveguides. When applied to usual square array, this approach produces two-dimensional generalization of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) structure supporting topological corner modes with propagation constants belonging to two forbidden spectral gaps opening only for twist angles from certain interval. In contrast to usual SSH arrays, where higher-order topology is typically introduced by diagonal waveguide shifts and only one type of corner states exists, our SSH-like structure in topological phase supports two co-existing types of in-phase and out-of-phase corner modes appearing in two different topological gaps that open in the spectrum. Therefore, twisting of the unit cell qualitatively changes topological properties of the system, offering a new degree of freedom in creation of higher-order topological phases. In material with focusing cubic nonlinearity two coexisting types of topological corner solitons emerge from these modes, whose existence and stability properties are studied here. Despite different internal structure, both such modes can be simultaneously dynamically stable in the appreciable part of the topological gap.</description>

      <title>Structured Detection for Simultaneous Super-Resolution and Optical Sectioning in Laser Scanning Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and sensitive detector arrays enable image scanning microscopy (ISM), overcoming the trade-off between spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) typical of confocal microscopy. However, current ISM approaches cannot provide optical sectioning and fail with thick samples, unless the size of the detector is limited. Thus, another trade-off between optical sectioning and SNR persists. Here, we propose a method without drawbacks that combines uncompromised super-resolution, high SNR, and optical sectioning. Furthermore, our approach enables super-sampling of images, relaxing Nyquist's criterion by a factor of two. Based on the observation that imaging with a detector array inherently embeds axial information about the sample, we designed a straightforward reconstruction algorithm that inverts the physical model of ISM. We present the comprehensive theoretical framework and validate our method with synthetic and experimental images of biological samples captured using a custom setup equipped with a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach exciting fluorescence emission both in the linear and non-linear regime. Moreover, we generalize the algorithm for fluorescence lifetime imaging, fully exploiting the single-photon timing ability of the SPAD array detector. Our method outperforms conventional approaches to ISM and can be extended to any LSM technique.</description>

      <title>Impact of E-plane Misalignment on THz Diagonal Horn Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in developing terahertz front-ends is achieving high coupling efficiency between the waveguide feed horn and the optical beam. In this paper, we have quantified the alignment requirements for the widely used E-plane split diagonal horn antenna through theoretical analysis, electromagnetic simulation, and experimental validation within the 325-500 GHz frequency range. The results from our analytical models, simulations, and measurements are consistent and shows good agreement. They reveal that even minor geometric asymmetries can cause significant increases in fractional power radiated to the cross-polar component due to amplitude and phase imbalances in the TE10 and TE01 modes. Furthermore, a misalignment of approximately 8% of the wavelength was observed to result in a 3-dB degradation in the optical coupling to a Gaussian beam (Gaussicity) in middle of the waveguide band. These findings highlight the critical importance of precise alignment and feed horn machining for the successful implementation of terahertz front-end systems.</description>

      <title>Manipulation and control of temporal cavity solitons with trapping potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal cavity solitons (CSs) are stable, localized particle-like objects in the form of optical pulses that circulate indefinitely in coherently driven nonlinear resonators. In the spectral domain, they form highly coherent frequency combs. Owing to their remarkable stability, they are attracting attention for applications in sensing, metrology, or optical signal synthesis. In this work, we report on the dynamics of CSs interacting with a trapping potential. We demonstrate that this interaction provides a powerful means to control their properties such as position, speed, and central frequency. Our theoretical analysis predicts fundamental limitations on the spectral shift of CSs relative to the driving frequency. Specifically, it reveals that within a broad range of detunings, frequency-shifted CSs encounter destabilization through a Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, we find that with periodic potentials, the Kelly sidebands emitted by trapped solitons undergo Bloch oscillations. In our experiments, we use an intracavity phase modulator to create the equivalent of an external real potential. We observe stable blue- and red- shifted solitons up to a limit close to our theoretical predictions. We then show theoretically and experimentally that this unprecedented level of control over the CS spectrum can be leveraged to cancel the Raman-induced self-frequency shift and even to stabilize CSs beyond the limitation imposed by stimulated Raman scattering. Our results provide valuable insights for applications requiring robust and potentially rapid tunable control over the cavity soliton properties.</description>

      <title>Fundamental constants from photon-photon scattering in three-beam collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct measurement of the elastic scattering of real photons on an electromagnetic field would allow the fundamental low-energy constants of quantum electrodynamics (QED) to be experimentally determined. We show that scenarios involving the collision of three laser beams have several advantages over conventional two-beam scenarios. The kinematics of a three-beam collision allows for a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the detection region, without the need for polarimetry and separates out contributions from different orders of photon scattering. A planar configuration of colliding a photon beam from an x-ray free electron laser with two optical beams is studied in detail. We show that measurements of elastic photon scattering and vacuum birefringence are possible with currently available technology.</description>

      <title>Waveshape of THz radiation produced by two-color laser-induced air plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial and spectral distributions of terahertz (THz) pulses emitted by two-color air plasmas are theoretically investigated for focused laser pulses and in the filamentation regime. We derive a so-called ''augmented'' conical emission model, which, similarly to the one originally proposed by You et al.\ [Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.\ {\bf 109}, 183902 (2012)], involves phase matching between laser harmonics along the plasma channel, the plasma density and length, and the emitted frequency as key parameters. Our augmented model, however, treats envelope effects and accounts for transverse variations of both plasma- and Kerr-driven potential THz emitters. We highlight the importance of the characteristic spatio-spectral distributions of these two conversion mechanisms in the expression of the angular radiated power. The results of our model are successfully compared with data provided by a comprehensive, fully space and time-resolved unidirectional solver. Importantly, these numerical simulations clear up the effective plasma length along which THz emission develops, compared with the dephasing length along which the laser fundamental and second harmonic become out-of-phase. The impact of common optical aberrations, such as sphericity, astigmatism, and coma, on the THz generation is also investigated. Aberrations are shown to generally decrease the laser-to-THz conversion efficiency and potentially induce spatial asymmetries and narrowing in the THz spectra.</description>

Abstract: Optical frequency combs are lightwaves composed of a large number of equidistant spectral lines. They are important for metrology, spectroscopy, communications and fundamental science. Frequency combs are most often generated by exciting dissipative solitons in lasers or in passive resonators, both of which suffer from significant limitations. Here, we show that the advantages of each platform can be combined. We introduce a novel kind of soliton, called active cavity soliton, hosted in coherently driven lasers pumped below the lasing threshold. We use an active fibre resonator and measure high peak power solitons on a low power background, in excellent agreement with simulations of a generalized Lugiato-Lefever equation. Moreover, we find that amplified spontaneous emission has negligible impact on the soliton's stability. Our results open up novel avenues for frequency comb formation by showing that coherent driving and incoherent pumping can be efficiently combined to generate a high-power ultra-stable pulse train.</description>

      <title>Narrow-linewidth exciton-polariton laser</title>

Abstract: Exciton-polariton laser is a promising source of coherent light for low-energy applications due to its low-threshold operation. However, a detailed experimental study of its spectral purity, which directly affects its coherence properties is still missing. Here}, we present a high-resolution spectroscopic investigation of the energy and linewidth of an exciton-polariton laser in the single-mode regime, which derives its coherent emission from an optically pumped and confined exciton-polariton condensate. We report an ultra-narrow linewidth of 56~MHz or 0.24~$\mu$eV, corresponding to a coherence time of 5.7~ns. The narrow linewidth is consistently achieved by using an exciton-polariton condensate with a high photonic content confined in an optically induced trap. Contrary to previous studies, we show that the excitonic reservoir created by the pump and responsible for creating the trap does not strongly affect the emission linewidth as long as the condensate is trapped and the pump power is well above the condensation (lasing) threshold. \red{The long coherence time of the exciton-polariton system uncovered here opens up opportunities for manipulating its macroscopic quantum state, which is essential for applications in classical and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Spatio-spectral optical fission in time-varying subwavelength layers</title>

Abstract: Transparent conducting oxides are highly doped semiconductors that exhibit favourable characteristics when compared to metals, including reduced material losses, tuneable electronic and optical properties, and enhanced damage thresholds. Recently, the photonic community has renewed its attention towards these materials, recognizing their remarkable nonlinear optical properties in the near-infrared spectrum, a feature previously overlooked despite their long-standing application in photovoltaics and touchscreens. The exceptionally large and ultra-fast change of the refractive index, which can be optically induced in these compounds, extends beyond the boundaries of conventional perturbative analysis and makes this class of materials the closest approximation to a time-varying system, and a unique playground for studying a variety of novel phenomena within the domain of photon acceleration. Here we report the spatio-spectral fission of an ultra-fast pulse trespassing a thin film of aluminium zinc oxide with a non-stationary refractive index. By applying phase conservation to this time-varying layer, our model can account for both space and time refraction and explain in quantitative terms, the spatial separation of both the spectrum and energy. Our findings represent an example of extreme nonlinear phenomena on subwavelength propagation distances and shed light on the nature of several nonlinear effects recently reported not accounting for the full optical field distribution. Our work also provides new important insights into transparent conducting oxides transient optical properties which are critical for the ongoing research in photonic time crystals, on-chip generation of nonclassical states of light, integrated optical neural networks as well as ultra-fast beam steering and frequency division multiplexing</description>

      <title>Eikonal phase retrieval: Unleashing the fourth generation sources potential for enhanced propagation based tomography on biological samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of synchrotrons towards higher brilliance beams has increased the possible sample-to-detector propagation distances for which the source confusion circle does not lead to geometrical blurring. This makes it possible to push near-field propagation driven phase contrast enhancement to the limit, revealing low contrast features which would otherwise remain hidden under an excessive noise. Until today this possibility was hindered, in many objects of scientific interest, by the simultaneous presence of strong phase gradient regions and low contrast features. The strong gradients, when enhanced with the now possible long propagation distances, induce such strong phase effects that the linearisation assumptions of current state-of-the-art single-distance phase retrieval filters are broken, and the resulting image quality is jeopardized. Here, we introduce a new iterative phase-retrieval algorithm and compare it with the Paganin phase-retrieval algorithm, in both the monochromatic and polychromatic cases, obtaining superior image quality. In the polychromatic case the comparison was done with an extrapolated Paganin algorithm obtained by reintroducing, into our phase retrieval algorithm, the linearization approximations underlying the Paganin forward model. Our work provides an innovative algorithm which efficiently performs the phase retrieval task over the entire near-field range, producing images of exceptional quality for mixed attenuation objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atoms are not two-level systems, and their rich internal structure often leads to complex phenomena in the presence of light. Here, we analyze off-resonant light scattering including the full hyperfine and magnetic structure. We find a set of frequency detunings where the induced atomic dipole is the same irrespective of the Zeeman state, and where two-photon transitions that alter the atomic state turn off. For alkali atoms and alkaline-earth ions, if the hyperfine splitting is dominated by the magnetic dipole moment contribution, these detunings approximately coincide. Therefore, at a given ``magical'' detuning, all Zeeman states in a hyperfine manifold behave almost identically, and can be traced out to good approximation. This feature prevents state decoherence due to light scattering, which impacts quantum optics experiments and quantum information applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate parametric decay instability (PDI) of circularly polarized Alfv\'en wave into daughter acoustic wave and backward Alfv\'en wave in magnetically-dominated plasma, in which the magnetization parameter $\sigma$ (energy density ratio of background magnetic field to matter) exceeds unity. We analyze relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), focusing on wave frequencies sufficiently lower than the plasma and cyclotron frequencies. We derive analytical formulae for the dispersion relation and growth rate of the instability as a function of the magnetization $\sigma$, wave amplitude $\eta$, and plasma temperature $\theta$. We find that PDI persists even in high magnetization $\sigma$, albeit with a decreased growth rate up to $\sigma\to\infty$. Our formulae are useful for estimating the decay of Alfv\'en wave into acoustic wave and heat in high magnetization $\sigma$ plasma, which is a ubiquitous phenomenon such as in pulsars, magnetars, and fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Nanomechanical Resonators: Sensitivity, Response Time, and Practical Considerations in Photothermal Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanomechanical photothermal sensing has significantly advanced single-molecule/particle microscopy and spectroscopy, and infrared detection through the use of nanomechanical resonators that detect shifts in resonant frequency due to photothermal heating. However, the relationship between resonator design, photothermal sensitivity, and response time remains unclear. This paper compares three resonator types - strings, drumheads, and trampolines - to explore this relationship. Through theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and finite element method simulations, we find that strings offer the highest sensitivity (with a noise equivalent power of 280 fW/Hz$^{1/2}$ for strings made of silicon nitride), while drumheads exhibit the fastest thermal response. The study reveals that photothermal sensitivity correlates with the average temperature rise and not the peak temperature. Finally, the impact of photothermal back-action is discussed, which can be a major source of frequency instability. This work clarifies the performance differences and limits among resonator designs and guides the development of advanced nanomechanical photothermal sensors, benefiting a wide range of applications.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a quantum-based quantitative phase microscopy technique using a phase gradient approach that is inherently background resistant and does not rely on interferometry or scanning. Here, a transparent sample is illuminated by both photons of a position-momentum entangled pair with one photon setup for position measurement in the near-field (NF) of the sample and its partner for momentum measurement in the far-field (FF). By virtue of the spatial correlation property inherent to the entanglement, both the position and momentum information of the photons can thus be obtained simultaneously. The phase profile of the sample is then deduced through a phase gradient measurement obtained by measuring the centroid shift of the photons' in the FF momentum plane for each NF position. We show that the technique, while achieving an imaging resolution of 2.76\,$\mu$m, is phase accurate to at least $\lambda/30$ and phase sensitive to $\lambda/100$ at a wavelength of 810\,nm. In addition, through the temporal correlation between the photon pairs, our technique shows resilience to strong dynamic background lights, which can prove difficult to account for in classical phase imaging techniques. We believe this work marks a significant advancement in the capabilities of quantum phase microscopy and quantum imaging in general, it showcases imaging and phase resolutions approaching those attainable with classical phase microscopes. This advancement brings quantum imaging closer to practical real-world applications, heralding new possibilities in the field.</description>
