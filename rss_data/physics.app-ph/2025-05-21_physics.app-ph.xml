      <title>Propagation and Attenuation Characteristics of Ground Vibrations: Beijing High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) Experiments and Intelligent Law Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation and attenuation characteristics of ground vibrations are of significant importance for assessing the interference of environmental factors, such as vehicles, on precision instruments. To investigate the impact of ground vibrations on the Beijing High Energy Photon Source (HEPS). This study conducted swept-frequency excitation tests at the HEPS site using an electrodynamic vibrator operating within the 1-100 Hz frequency range. Based on the experimental data, a hybrid iterative fitting method combining machine learning and formulaic intelligent generation is proposed, utilizing the Bornitz formula as the foundation. Through a data-driven approach, the propagation and attenuation laws of ground vibrations are formulated. The computational error of the formula is estimated using probabilistic analysis, and. And the physical rationality of the formula is elucidated. Finally, by comparing the proposed method with empirical formulas from previous studies and black-box machine learning models, it is demonstrated that the method introduced in this research offers substantial advantages in terms of accuracy and interpretability. This method holds universal value for the discovery of the propagation and attenuation laws of ground vibrations.</description>

      <title>An Electrically Injected and Solid State Surface Acoustic Wave Phonon Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) enable a wide array of technologies including RF filters, chemical and biological sensors, acousto-optic devices, acoustic control of microfluidic flow in lab-on-a-chip systems, and quantum phononics. While numerous methods exist for generating SAWs, they each have intrinsic limitations that inhibit performance, operation at high frequencies, and use in systems constrained in size, weight, and power. Here, for the first time, we present a completely solid-state, single-chip SAW phonon laser that is comprised of a lithium niobate SAW resonator with an internal, DC electrically injected and broadband semiconductor gain medium with $&lt;$0.15 mm$^2$ footprint. Below the threshold bias of 36 V, the device behaves as a resonant amplifier, and above it exhibits self-sustained coherent oscillation, linewidth narrowing, and high output powers. A continuous on-chip acoustic output power of up to -6.1 dBm is generated at 1 GHz with a resolution-limited linewidth of $&lt;$77 Hz and a carrier phase noise of -57 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset. Through detailed modeling, we show pathways for improving these devices' performance including mHz linewidths, sub -100 dBc/Hz phase noise at 1 kHz, high power efficiency, footprints less than 550 um$^2$ at 10 GHz, and SAW generation approaching the hundreds of GHz regime. This demonstration provides a fundamentally new approach to SAW generation, paving the way toward ultra-high-frequency SAW sources on a chip and highly miniaturized and efficient SAW-based systems that can be operated without an external RF source.</description>

      <title>High-performance solidly mounted bidimensional mode resonators (S2MRs) operating around 16 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on Solidly-Mounted Bidimensional Mode Resonators (S2MRs) utilizing 30% Scandium-doped Aluminum Nitride on Silicon Carbide, operating near 16 GHz. Experimental results show mechanical quality factors up to 380, electromechanical coupling coefficients of 4%, and an overall Figure of Merit (FOM=Q *kt2) exceeding 15. Additionally, Q Bode calculation is reported along with an analysis of the piezoelectric energy confinement coefficient showing the impact of thickness-to-wavelength ratio on the acoustic wave confinement. Finally, the devices demonstrate power handling capabilities greater than 20 dBm while achieving close impedance matching to 50 Ohm. These features make them strong candidates for commercial, military, and harsh-environment applications like satellite communications (SATCOM) and Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA).</description>

      <title>Universal Convergence Metric for Time-Resolved Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a model-independent, dimensionless metric for predicting optimal measurement duration in time-resolved Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) using early-time data. Built on a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) framework, the method reconstructs scattering profiles with quantified uncertainty, even from sparse or noisy measurements. Demonstrated on the EQSANS instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source, the approach generalizes to general SANS instruments with a two-dimensional detector. A key result is the discovery of a dimensionless convergence metric revealing a universal power-law scaling in profile evolution across soft matter systems. When time is normalized by a system-specific characteristic time $t^{\star}$, the variation in inferred profiles collapses onto a single curve with an exponent between $-2$ and $-1$. This trend emerges within the first ten time steps, enabling early prediction of measurement sufficiency. The method supports real-time experimental optimization and is especially valuable for maximizing efficiency in low-flux environments such as compact accelerator-based neutron sources.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Design of Isotropic and High-Stiffness TPMS-based Amorphousness-Induced Architected Material (TAAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For their excellent stiffness-to-weight characteristics, triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) are widely adopted in architected materials. However, their geometric regularity often leads to elastic anisotropy, limiting their effectiveness under complex loading. To address this, we propose TPMS-based amorphousness-induced architected materials (TAAMs), which incorporate controllable geometric disorder as a tunable design variable. This concept of designable amorphousness broadens the geometric design space, enabling the simultaneous optimization of stiffness and isotropy. A data-driven framework integrating computational homogenization with multi-objective Bayesian optimization is employed to discover high-performance TAAMs. Selected designs were fabricated using fused deposition modeling and validated through uniaxial compression tests, showing strong agreement with numerical predictions. Compared to conventional TPMS, TAAMs exhibit significantly improved elastic isotropy while maintaining high stiffness across various relative densities. This approach offers a robust and scalable pathway for developing architected materials tailored to applications requiring isotropic performance, such as biomedical implants, protective systems, and aerospace components.</description>

      <title>Single-photon detection enabled by negative differential conductivity in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting individual light quanta is essential for quantum information, space exploration, advanced machine vision, and fundamental science. Here, we introduce a novel single photon detection mechanism using highly photosensitive non-equilibrium electron phases in moir\'e materials. Using tunable bands in bilayer graphene/hexagonal-boron nitride superlattices, we engineer negative differential conductance and a sensitive bistable state capable of detecting single photons. Operating in this regime, we demonstrate single-photon counting at mid-infrared (11.3 microns) and visible wavelengths (675 nanometres) and temperatures up to 25 K. This detector offers new prospects for broadband, high-temperature quantum technologies with CMOS compatibility and seamless integration into photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Our analysis suggests the mechanism underlying our device operation originates from negative differential velocity, and represents an important milestone in the field of high-bias transport in two-dimensional moir\'e quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Sequence Modeling for Fast Simulation and Design Exploration of 2D Memristive Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling hysteretic switching dynamics in memristive devices is computationally demanding due to coupled ionic and electronic transport processes. This challenge is particularly relevant for emerging two-dimensional (2D) devices, which feature high-dimensional design spaces that remain largely unexplored. We introduce a physics-guided modeling framework that integrates high-fidelity finite-volume (FV) charge transport simulations with a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network (ANN) to predict dynamic current-voltage behavior. Trained on physically grounded simulation data, the ANN surrogate achieves more than four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the FV model, while maintaining direct access to physically meaningful input parameters and high accuracy with typical normalized errors &lt;1%. This enables iterative tasks that were previously computationally prohibitive, including inverse modeling from experimental data, design space exploration via metric mapping and sensitivity analysis, as well as constrained multi-objective design optimization. Importantly, the framework preserves physical interpretability via access to detailed spatial dynamics, including carrier densities, vacancy distributions, and electrostatic potentials, through a direct link to the underlying FV model. Our approach establishes a scalable framework for efficient exploration, interpretation, and model-driven design of emerging 2D memristive and neuromorphic devices.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals devices for surface-sensitive experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-operando characterization of van der Waals (vdW) devices using surface-sensitive methods provides critical insights into phase transitions and correlated electronic states. Yet, integrating vdW materials in functional devices while maintaining pristine surfaces is a key challenge for combined transport and surface-sensitive experiments. Conventional lithographic techniques introduce surface contamination, limiting the applicability of state-of-the-art spectroscopic probes. We present a stencil lithography-based approach for fabricating vdW devices, producing micron-scale electrical contacts, and exfoliation in ultra-high vacuum. The resist-free patterning method utilizes a shadow mask to define electrical contacts and yields thin flakes down to the single-layer regime via gold-assisted exfoliation. As a demonstration, we fabricate devices from 1$T-$TaS$_2$ flakes, achieving reliable contacts for application of electrical pulses and resistance measurements, as well as clean surfaces allowing for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The approach provides a platform for studying the electronic properties of vdW systems with surface-sensitive probes in well-defined device geometries.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuation-induced forces, primarily represented by quantum and critical Casimir effects, play a pivotal role at the nanoscale. This review explores the theoretical and experimental landscapes of these forces, offering a comprehensive analysis of their similarities and distinctions. We emphasize the effects of material properties, geometry, and temperature in shaping these forces and their roles in various nanoscale systems, both colloidal and solid-state. We devote special attention to the Casimir torque, the influence of magnetism on the Casimir force, and the use of Casimir effects for the generation of optical resonators. Through this comparative study, we elucidate the underlying physics of these phenomena, fostering insights that advance applications in nanomechanics, optomechanics, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we provide a practical guide on protection of superconducting quantum circuits from broadband electromagnetic and infrared-radiation noise by using cryogenic shielding and filtering of microwave lines. Recently, superconducting multi-qubit processors demonstrated quantum supremacy and quantum error correction below the surface code threshold. However, the decoherence-induced loss of quantum information still remains a challenge for more than 100 qubit quantum computing. Here, we review the key aspects of superconducting quantum circuits protection from stray electromagnetic fields and infrared radiation, namely, multilayer shielding design, materials, filtering of the fridge lines and attenuation, cryogenic setup configurations, and methods for shielding efficiency evaluation developed over the last 10 years. In summary, we make recommendations for creation of an efficient and compact shielding system as well as microwave filtering for a large-scale superconducting quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microstructured materials, such as architected metamaterials and phononic crystals, exhibit complex wave propagation phenomena due to their internal structure. While full-scale numerical simulations can capture these effects, they are computationally demanding, especially in time-domain analyses. To overcome this limitation, effective continuum models have been developed to approximate the macroscopic behavior of these materials while retaining key microscale effects. In this work we investigate the time-domain dynamic response of microstructured materials and focus on their effective micromorphic counterparts. We compare direct numerical simulations of discrete microstructures with predictions from micromorphic models to assess their accuracy in capturing transient wave phenomena. Our findings provide new insights into the applicability and limitations of micromorphic models in time-dependent analyses, contributing to the development of improved predictive tools for metamaterial design and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity of boron arsenide above 2100 watts per meter per Kelvin at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boron arsenide (BAs) single crystals had been previously reported to have thermal conductivity of 1500 W/mK at room temperature. Now we achieved thermal conductivity above 2100 W/mK at room temperature in BAs crystals due to much lower concentration of impurities Si, C, and O grown from purified arsenic. We also observed a T-1.8 dependence of the thermal conductivity, suggesting a more significant contribution from four-phonon scatterings than suggested by previous theory. We found that our experimental result can be fit with a modified theoretical calculation by tuning down the three-phonon scattering for phonons in the 4-8 THz range, although current phonon transport theory cannot provide a physical explanation. Such an advance will not only attract more effort on growing BAs single crystals and studying their practical applications but also stimulate theoretical work to predict more materials with possibly even higher thermal conductivities.</description>

      <title>Interplay between altermagnetic order and crystal symmetry probed using magnetotransport in epitaxial altermagnet MnTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of magnetic materials characterized by fully compensated spins arranged in alternating local structures, allowing for spin-split bands similar to those found in ferromagnets without net magnetism. Recently, MnTe has emerged as a prototypical altermagnetic material exhibiting spin-polarized electronic bands and anomalous transport phenomena. Although recent work has explored the magnetic and structural properties of MnTe, detailed experimental investigations into the relationship between altermagnetic order and crystal symmetry are lacking. Here, we report the relationship between altermagnetic order and crystal symmetry by investigating magnetotransport properties of MnTe epitaxial altermagnetic thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We observe a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect and show the control of Hall response with the altermagnetic order using the magnetic field and the crystallographic angle dependence. Detailed measurements establish that both the longitudinal and transverse electronic responses depend on the relative orientation of the applied current and N\'eel vector as well as on the crystal orientation and altermagnetic order. These results provide new insights into the interplay between crystal symmetry and altermagnetism for future device applications.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of k-Gaps in Dynamically Modulated Phononic Time Crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet time crystals, characterized by momentum gaps (k-gaps), have sparked intense interest across various branches of physics due to their intriguing dynamics and promising applications. Despite growing theoretical efforts, the realization and observation of phononic time crystals, especially for airborne sound, remain significant experimental challenges. In this work, we demonstrate a phononic time crystal by integrating discrete resonant meta-atoms into a one-dimensional acoustic waveguide, effectively creating a homogeneous, time-varying metamaterial. By dynamically modulating the effective compressibility, we experimentally observe exponential acoustic wave amplification, offering clear evidence of k-gap formation. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of our platform by inducing momentum band folding and double k-gap phenomena via quasi-periodic temporal modulation. This flexible and reconfigurable approach not only enables the design of tailor-made resonant responses but also opens new avenues for realizing higher-dimensional phononic time crystals and exploring nontrivial topological dynamics in time-modulated media.</description>

      <title>Models for Spatially Resolved Conductivity of Rectangular Interconnects with Integrated Effect of Surface And Grain Boundary Scattering</title>

Abstract: Surface scattering and grain boundary scattering are two prominent mechanisms dictating the conductivity of interconnects and are traditionally modeled using the Fuchs-Sondheimer (FS) and Mayadas-Shatzkes (MS) theories, respectively. In addition to these approaches, modern interconnect structures need to capture the space-dependence of conductivity, for which a spatially resolved FS (SRFS) model was previously proposed to account for surface scattering based on Boltzmann transport equations (BTE). In this paper, we build upon the SRFS model to integrate grain-boundary scattering leading to a physics-based SRFS-MS model for the conductivity of rectangular interconnects. The effect of surface and grain scattering in our model is not merely added (as in several previous works) but is appropriately integrated following the original MS theory. Hence, the SRFS-MS model accounts for the interplay between surface scattering and grain boundary scattering in dictating the spatial dependence of conductivity. We also incorporate temperature (T) dependence into the SRFS-MS model. Further, we propose a circuit compatible conductivity model (SRFS-MS-C3), which captures the space-dependence and integration of surface and grain boundary scattering utilizing an analytical function and a few (three or four) invocations of the physical SRFS-MS model. We validate the SRFS-MS-C3 model across a wide range of physical parameters, demonstrating excellent agreement with the physical SRFS-MS model, with an error margin of less than 0.7%. The proposed SRFS-MS and SRFS-MS-C3 models explicitly relate the spatially resolved conductivity to physical parameters such as electron mean free path ($\lambda_0$), specularity of surface scattering (p), grain boundary reflectance coefficient (R), interconnect cross-section geometry and temperature (T).</description>

      <title>Roughness-Limited Performance in Ultra-Low-Loss Lithium Niobate Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving low optical loss is critical for scaling complex photonic systems. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) offers strong electro-optic and nonlinear properties in a compact platform, making it ideal for quantum and nonlinear optics. While $Q$ factors above $10^7$ have been achieved, they remain below the intrinsic material limit. We present a systematic study of scattering losses due to roughness in TFLN racetrack cavities, isolating contributions from sidewall and interface roughness. Quality factors up to $27 \times 10^6$ are demonstrated in waveguides with widths of $2.2\lambda$ ($\sim3.5\,\mu$m), where interface roughness dominates, and up to $1.2 \times 10^7$ in narrower waveguides $0.8\lambda$ wide ($\sim1.2\,\mu$m), where sidewall roughness is the primary limitation. Our modeling framework, based on 3D wave simulations informed by AFM-measured roughness, is material-independent and broadly applicable across integrated photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Oxyfluoride glasses obtained through incorporation of CaF$_2$ into photovoltaic cover glass melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.</description>
