      <title>Bias from small-scale leakage in Pulsar Timing Array maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array experiments are rapidly approaching the era of gravitational wave background anisotropy detection. The timing residuals of each pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across all angular scales. However, due to the limited number of monitored pulsars, current analyses are only able to reconstruct the angular structure of the background at large scales. We show analytically that this mismatch between the integrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a previously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map reconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale leakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at scales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into large-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred angular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of scales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry of the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of different regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise. As the quality of pulsar timing array experiments improves, a robust understanding of small-scale leakage will become paramount for reliable detection and characterization of the gravitational wave background. Thus, the theoretical formalism developed here will be essential to estimate the magnitude of this systematic uncertainty in anisotropy searches.</description>

      <title>Astronomical Optical Interferometry from the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lunar surface is a compelling location for large, distributed optical facilities, with significant advantages over orbital facilities for high spatial resolution astrophysics. The serious development of mission concepts is timely because of the confluence of multiple compelling factors. Lunar access technology is maturing rapidly, in the form of both US-based crewed and uncrewed landers, as well as international efforts. Associated with this has been a definitive maturation of astronomical optical interferometry technologies at Earth-based facilities over the past three decades, enabling exquisitely sharp views on the universe previously unattainable, though limited at present by the Earth's atmosphere. Importantly, the increasing knowledge and experience base about lunar surface operations indicates it is not just suitable, but highly attractive for lunar telescope arrays.</description>

      <title>Ephemeris and Almanac Design for Lunar Navigation Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents almanac and ephemeris message representation for lunar navigation satellites supporting the Lunar Augmented Navigation System (LANS). The proposed method combines osculating orbital elements, Chebyshev polynomials, and Fourier series to efficiently represent lunar satellite trajectories subject to complex perturbations from lunar gravity and third-body effects. For the ephemeris, a hybrid Chebyshev--Fourier formulation improves fitting accuracy over long arcs while maintaining message compactness under the data-size constraint of the LunaNet Interoperability Specification. For the almanac, a compact low-order polynomial and Fourier model is introduced to capture mid-term orbital variations over a 15-day fitting arc. The approach is validated for multiple orbit regimes, including 30-hour, 24-hour, and 12-hour elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs) and a 6-hour polar orbit. Results show that the proposed framework achieves sub-meter position and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity fitting errors within the 900-bit limit for 6-hour ephemeris arcs, and almanac fitting accuracy sufficient for reliable satellite-visibility identification in warm-start operations.</description>

      <title>Pre-flight Background Estimates for COSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a Compton telescope designed to survey the 0.2 - 5 MeV sky, consisting of a compact array of cross-strip germanium detectors. It is planned to be launched in 2027 into an equatorial low-Earth (530 km) orbit with a prime mission duration of 2 years. The observation of MeV gamma rays is dominated by background, mostly from extragalactic and atmospheric photon but also from the activation of the detector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background simulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. In this work we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background for the first 3 months in orbit, and we extrapolate the results to 2 years in orbit, in order to determine the build-up of the activation due to long-lived isotopes. We determine the rates of events induced by the background that are reconstructed as Compton events in the simulated COSI data. We find that the extragalactic background photons dominate at low energies (&lt;660 keV), while delayed activation from cosmic-ray primaries (proton/alpha) and albedo photons dominate at higher energies. As part of this work, a comparison at low latitude (&lt;1 deg) between recent measurement of the SAA by the High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-01) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01) and the AP9/AE9 model has been made, showing an overestimation of the flux by a factor 9 by the model. The systematic uncertainties associated with these components are quantified. This work marks a major step forward in estimating and understanding the expected background rates for the COSI satellite mission.</description>

      <title>Torque cancellation effect of Intensity noise for Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of sub-Hz gravitational waves is of significant importance for astrophysics. It enables the observation of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, the issuance of early alerts for gravitational-wave events, and the exploration of the stochastic gravitational-wave background. The Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS) is a proposed gravitational-wave detector based on a Sagnac speed-meter topology that uses torsion bars as test masses. Its prototype design aims to achieve a strain sensitivity of $3 \times 10^{-18}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1~Hz and thus enable the detection of $\mathcal{O}(10^4),M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole mergers at 100~Mpc with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. We show that the torsion-bar-based speed meter can suppress noise originating from laser intensity fluctuations by canceling the net torque on the bar and by using a balanced homodyne readout. We further present, for the first time, an analytic intensity-noise model for a gravitational-wave detector employing a torsion-bar Sagnac speed-meter configuration. Using this model, we evaluate the expected performance of a 2.5~m arm-length CHRONOS prototype. The projected laser-intensity noise is $2.9 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1~Hz, which is sufficiently low to allow the detection of binary intermediate-mass black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Optical design and sensitivity optimization of Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the optical design and sensitivity modeling of the 2.5 m Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), a triangular Sagnac speed-meter interferometer incorporating power- and signal-recycling techniques. Using ABCD-matrix analysis and Finesse3 simulations, we show that stable eigenmodes are obtained with optimized mirror curvatures and focal placements, achieving mode-matching efficiencies above 99.5 %. The resulting configuration reaches a quantum-noise-limited strain sensitivity of $h \simeq 3\times10^{-18},\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ at 1 Hz, with a ring-cavity finesse $\mathcal{F}\simeq3.1\times10^{4}$ and round-trip Gouy phase $\psi_{\mathrm{rt}}\approx153^{\circ}$. The power-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_p=-85^{\circ}$) dominates the low-frequency quantum noise, while the signal-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_s=0^{\circ}$) mainly introduces a uniform quadrature rotation. The optimal homodyne angle ($\zeta_{\mathrm{opt}}\simeq46^{\circ}$) balances shot-noise and radiation-pressure effects to give the best sensitivity near 1 Hz. Assuming end-mirror reflectivity $R_{\mathrm{ETM}}=99.9999\%$ under cryogenic operation at 10 K, CHRONOS can achieve quantum-noise-limited performance on a laboratory scale and serve as a testbed for future long-baseline, cryogenic interferometers probing sub-hertz gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The Proper Motion of Draco II with HST using Multiple Reference Frames and Methodologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present proper motion (PM) measurements for Draco II, an ultra-faint dwarf satellite of the Milky Way. These PMs are measured using two epochs of Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) imaging separated by a 7 year time baseline. Measuring PMs of low-luminosity systems is difficult due to the low number of member stars, requiring a precise inertial reference frame. We construct reference frames using three different sets of external sources: 1) stars with Gaia DR3 data, 2) stationary background galaxies, and 3) a combination of the two. We show that all three reference frames give consistent PM results. We find that for this sparse, low-luminosity regime including background galaxies into the reference frame improves our measurement by up to $\sim2\times$ versus using only Gaia astrometric data. Using 301 background galaxies as a reference frame, we find that Draco II's systemic PM is $(\mu_{\alpha}^*, \mu_{\delta}) = (1.043\pm0.029, 0.879\pm0.028)$ mas/yr, which is the most precise measurement of the three we present in this paper.</description>

      <title>Micro-Doppler signatures and object characterisation of space debris with radio telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel multi-static radar technique for space debris characterisation using micro-Doppler signatures, developed within the Southern Hemisphere Asteroid Radar Programme (SHARP). The method employs C-band continuous waveforms transmitted from NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) Canberra station, with reflected signals captured by distributed ground-based telescopes converted from astronomical to radar operations. From March 2021 to September 2025, we conducted systematic observations of 20 distinct rocket bodies at various orbital altitudes and object sizes. Micro-Doppler analysis of axial rotation signatures enabled extraction of rotation periods, object dimensions, surface characteristics, and mass distribution parameters with enhanced accuracy in orbital refinement. We implemented advanced imaging reconstruction techniques to generate morphology data of the targets. Results demonstrate successful determination of debris rotation periods with second-level precision, dimensional estimates within 10\% accuracy compared to known specifications, and improved orbital parameter determination reducing position uncertainties by up to 30\%. The technique provides a cost-effective approach for space situational awareness, leveraging existing astronomical infrastructure to enhance Australia's sovereign capabilities in tracking both near-Earth objects and space debris. This multi-static configuration offers significant advantages over traditional monostatic radar systems for geostationary and highly elliptical orbit debris monitoring.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the lantern: coherent, spectro-polarimetric characterisation of a multimode converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25330v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While photonic lanterns efficiently and uniquely map a set of input modes to single-mode outputs (or vice versa), the optical mode transfer matrix of any particular fabricated device cannot be constrained at the design stage due to manufacturing imperfections. Accurate knowledge of the mapping enables complex sensing or beam control applications that leverage multimode conversion. In this work, we present a characterisation system to directly measure the electric field from a photonic lantern using digital off-axis holography, following its evolution over a 73 nm range near 1550 nm and in two orthogonal, linear polarisations. We provide the first multi-wavelength, polarisation decomposed characterisation of the principal modes of a photonic lantern. Performance of our testbed is validated on a single-mode fibre then harnessed to characterise a 19-port, multicore fibre fed photonic lantern. We uncover the typical wavelength scale at which the modal mapping evolves and measure the relative dispersion in the device, finding significant differences with idealised simulations. In addition to detailing the system, we also share the empirical mode transfer matrices, enabling future work in astrophotonic design, computational imaging, device fabrication feedback loops and beam shaping.</description>

      <title>The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs : Understanding the wavelength dependence of radial velocity measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Current exoplanet surveys are focused on detecting small exoplanets orbiting in the liquid-water habitable zones of their host stars. Despite the recent significant advancements in instrumental developments, the current limitation in detecting these exoplanets is the intrinsic variability of the host star itself. Aims. Our aim is to use the full CARMENES guaranteed time observations (GTO) data set spanning more than 8 years of observations of over 350 stars to investigate the wavelength dependence of high-precision radial velocities (RV), as stellar activity features should exhibit a wavelength dependence while the RV variation due to an orbiting planet will be wavelength independent. Methods. We use the chromatic index (CRX) to quantify the slope of the measured RVs as a function of logarithmic wavelength. We investigate the dependence of the CRX in the full CARMENES GTO sample on 24 stellar activity indices in the visible and near-infrared channels of the CARMENES spectrograph and each star's stellar parameters. We also present an updated convective turnover time scaling for the calculation of the stellar Rossby number for M dwarfs. Results. Our results show that approximately 17\% of GTO stars show a strong or a moderate correlation between CRX and RV. We can improve the measured RVs by a factor of up to nearly 4 in rms by subtracting the RV predicted by the CRX-RV correlation from the measured RVs. Mid M dwarfs with moderate rotational velocities, moderate CRX-gradients and quasi-stable activity features have the best rms improvement factors. Conclusions. We conclude that the CRX is a powerful diagnostic in mitigation of stellar activity and the search for low mass rocky planets.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlating Astrometric and Timing Residuals to Constrain Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cross-correlation between astrometric and timing-residual observables for distant sources, such as pulsars and galaxies, and equivalent observables for nearby solar system bodies. Using the unified spin-weighted formalism introduced in [1], we derive the angular correlation functions-generalised Hellings-Downs curves-that describe the response of these mixed observables to a stochastic, unpolarised gravitational-wave background (SGWB). We compute the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity for such measurements, focusing on cross-correlations between pulsar timing array (PTA) redshift signals and astrometric or distortion (shimmering) effects induced in solar system objects such as asteroids. Although the current astrometric precision of asteroid tracking does not yet provide competitive constraints relative to PTA-only surveys, the method offers a complementary probe with enhanced sensitivity at higher frequencies. Future wide-field surveys capable of sub-milliarcsecond precision could make this approach a viable tool for detecting or constraining the SGWB. A key advantage of the technique is its reduced susceptibility to correlated systematics across different measurement domains, providing an independent cross-check of PTA detections and a potential observational bridge between PTA and LISA frequency bands.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Data Analysis Methods for the CUORE Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE) experiment set the most stringent limit on the neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay half-life of $^{130}$Te with 2 ton yr TeO$_2$ analyzed exposure. In addition to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, the CUORE detector -- a ton-scale array of nearly 1000 cryogenic calorimeters operating at $\sim$10 mK -- is capable of searching for other rare decays and interactions over a broad energy range. For our searches, we leverage the available information of each calorimeter by performing its optimization, data acquisition, and analysis independently. We describe the analysis tools and methods developed for CUORE and their application to build high-quality datasets for numerous physics searches. In particular, we describe in detail our evaluation of the energy-dependent detector response and signal efficiency used in the most recent search for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay.</description>

      <title>Beam Maps of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Measured with a Drone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present beam measurements of the CHIME telescope using a radio calibration source deployed on a drone payload. During test flights, the pulsing calibration source and the telescope were synchronized to GPS time, enabling in-situ background subtraction for the full $N^{2}$ visibility matrix for one CHIME cylindrical reflector. We use the autocorrelation products to estimate the primary beam width and centroid location, and compare these quantities to solar transit measurements and holographic measurements where they overlap on the sky. We find that the drone, solar, and holography data have similar beam parameter evolution across frequency and both spatial coordinates. This paper presents the first drone-based beam measurement of a large cylindrical radio interferometer. Furthermore, the unique analysis and instrumentation described in this paper lays the foundation for near-field measurements of experiments like CHIME.</description>

      <title>gwsnr: A python package for efficient signal-to-noise calculation of gravitational-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave astrophysics requires accurate evaluation of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the Probability of Detection (Pdet) for applications such as population simulations and hierarchical Bayesian inference with selection effects. Traditional approaches for computing SNR are often computationally demanding and inefficient for large-scale analyses. The gwsnr Python package addresses this challenge by providing efficient and flexible tools for calculating the optimal SNR. It features a user-friendly interface and employs techniques such as a partial-scaling interpolation method for non-precessing binaries, a multiprocessing inner-product routine for frequency-domain waveforms that include spin precession and subdominant modes, among others. High computational performance is achieved through NumPy vectorization and Just-in-Time compilation with Numba, with optional GPU acceleration using JAX and MLX. By combining efficiency, scalability, and ease of use, gwsnr enables large-scale simulations of detectable compact binary mergers and facilitates robust modeling of selection effects through Pdet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drone-based beam measurements are a promising avenue to tackle the critical challenge of calibration for 21 cm cosmology telescopes. In this paper, we introduce a new drone-based calibration system for 400-800 MHz radio observatories, describing its instrumentation and first deployment. We discuss measurements of the TONE array, a CHIME/FRB outrigger pathfinder, and present results, including full 2D high spatial resolution beam maps in both co- and cross-polarization, as well as comparisons to simulations. The polarized beam maps cover a 70 degree by 70 degree grid, capturing the first two sidelobes and measuring the TONE main beam and first sidelobe with 7-9% statistical errors. We investigate polarization angle alignment with frequency, finding significant polarization leakage in the TONE antennas at frequencies above 600 MHz, and a polarization axis rotation with frequency. We describe statistical and systematic errors, as well as measurements of radio frequency interference from the drone and equipment. Our drone system is the first to incorporate a broad-band switched calibration source in the drone payload, enabling background subtraction and direct measurements of the RFI emitted by the drone. The results presented are the first drone-based 2D measurements of cross-polar beam structure and of polarization alignment of an array. The high frequency and spatial resolution achieved with this system have revealed the rich structure of the beam of each antenna, and enabled comparisons between individual dishes and to electromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>The making of robust and highly performing imaging spectropolarimeters for large solar telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the requirements, concepts, simulations, implementation, and calibration of two dual Fabry-Perot based imaging spectropolarimeters, CRISP and CHROMIS, at the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope, and CRISP2 that is under construction. These instruments use a combination of a high-resolution and a low-resolution etalon together with an order-sorting prefilter to define the bandpass. The overall design is made robust and stable by tailoring the low-resolution etalon reflectivity to accommodate expected cavity errors from both etalons, and by using a compact optical design that eliminates the need for folding mirrors. By using a telecentric design based on lenses rather than mirrors, image degradation by the FPI system is negligible, as shown in a previous publication, and the throughput of the system is maximised. Initial alignment, and maintaining that alignment over time, is greatly simplified. The telecentric design allows full calibration and/or modelling of essential system parameters to be carried out without interfering with the optical setup. We also discuss briefly the polarimeters developed for CRISP and CHROMIS. The high performance of CRISP and CHROMIS has been demonstrated in an earlier publication through measurements of the granulation contrast and comparisons with similar measurements simultaneously made through broadband continuum filters. Here, we focus on the aspects of the design that are central to enabling high performance and robustness, but also discuss the calibration and processing of the data, and use a few examples of processed data to demonstrate the achievable image and data quality. We put forward a proposal for a similar conceptual design for the European Solar Telescope and conclude by discussing potential problems of the proposed approach to designs of this type. Some aspects of these FPI systems may be of interest also outside the solar community.</description>

      <title>SpecCLIP: Aligning and Translating Spectroscopic Measurements for Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Picometer Sensitive Prototype of the Optical Truss Interferometer for LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical truss interferometer (OTI) is a contingent subsystem proposed for the LISA telescopes to aid in the verification of a $1 \frac{\mathrm{pm}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$ optical path length stability. Each telescope would be equipped with three pairs of compact fiber-coupled units, each forming an optical cavity with a baseline proportional to the telescope length at different points around the aperture. Employing a Pound-Drever-Hall approach to maintain a modulated laser field on resonance with each cavity, the dimensional stability of the telescope can be measured and verified. We have designed and developed prototype OTI units to demonstrate the capability of measuring stable structures, such as the LISA telescope, with a $1 \frac{\mathrm{pm}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$ sensitivity using a set of freely mountable fiber-injected cavities. Aside from its initial motivation for the telescope, the OTI can also be readily integrated with other systems to aid in ground testing experiments. In this paper, we outline our experimental setup, measurement results, and analyses of the noise limitations.</description>

      <title>A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Lunar Corner-Cube Retroreflectors: A Wave-Optics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs) are critical for advanced lunar laser ranging (LLR) because they enable sub-millimeter-scale measurements of the Earth-Moon distance -- a level of precision essential for rigorous tests of relativistic gravitation and for advancing our understanding of lunar geophysics. In this work, we develop a comprehensive two-dimensional Fourier-optics model for single CCRs with apertures ranging from 80-110 mm. Our model incorporates realistic thermal-mechanical wavefront errors, detailed diffraction effects, and velocity aberration offsets. Our analysis reveals a strong coupling between aperture size and aberration angular offset: while larger CCRs deliver high on-axis flux under near-ideal conditions, their narrow diffraction lobes suffer significant flux loss at moderate aberration offsets, thereby favoring smaller apertures with broader main lobes. Furthermore, comparisons between solid fused-silica and hollow silicon-carbide (SiC) CCRs show that hollow designs not only achieve competitive or superior photon return -- particularly at 1064 nm, where phase errors are relatively reduced -- but also offer nearly an order-of-magnitude mass reduction for the same aperture sizes. These results establish a robust quantitative framework for optimizing CCR designs to perform at the sub-millimeter level under realistic lunar conditions and underscore the advantages of precision hollow SiC CCRs for next-generation LLR operations.</description>
