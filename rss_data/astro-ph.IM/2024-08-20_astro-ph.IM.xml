      <title>Analysis of the Effect of Tilted Corner Cube Reflector Arrays on Lunar Laser Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper primarily investigates the effect of the tilt of corner cube reflector (CCR) arrays on lunar laser ranging (LLR). A mathematical model was established to study the random errors caused by the tilt of the CCR arrays. The study found that, ideally, when the laser ranging pulse width is 10 picoseconds or less, it is possible to distinguish from which specific corner cubes within the CCR array each peak in the echo signal originates. Consequently, partial data from the echo can be extracted for signal processing, significantly reducing random errors and improving the single-shot precision of LLR. The distance obtained by extracting part of the echo can be reduced to the center position of the array, thereby providing multiple higher-precision ranging results from each measurement. This not only improves the precision of LLR but also increases the data volume. A simulation experiment based on the 1.2 m laser ranging system at Yunnan Observatories was conducted. By extracting one peak for signal processing, the single-shot precision improved from 32.24 mm to 2.52 mm, validating the theoretical analysis results. Finally, an experimental laser ranging system based on a 53 cm binocular telescope system was established for ground experiments. The experimental results indicated that the echo signal could identify the tilt state of the CCR array. By extracting the peak returned by the central CCR for signal processing, the ranging precision was greatly improved. Through theoretical analyses, simulation experiments, and ground experiments, a solution to reduce the random errors caused by the tilt of the CCR array was provided. This offers an approach to enhance the single-shot precision of future LLR and provides a reference for upgrading ground-based equipment at future laser ranging stations.</description>

      <title>The Electrical Design of a Membrane Antenna for Lunar-based Low-frequency Radio Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting primordial fluctuations from the cosmic dark ages requires extremely large low-frequency radio telescope arrays deployed on the far side of the Moon. The antenna of such an array must be lightweight, easily storable and transportable, deployable on a large scale, durable, and capable of good electrical performance. A membrane antenna is an excellent candidate to meet these criteria. We study the design of a low-frequency membrane antenna for a lunar-based low-frequency (&lt;30 MHz) radio telescope constructed from polyimide film widely used in aerospace applications, owing to its excellent dielectric properties and high stability as a substrate material. We first design and optimize an antenna in free space through dipole deformation and coupling principles, then simulate an antenna on the lunar surface with a simple lunar soil model, yielding an efficiency greater than 90% in the range of 12-19 MHz and greater than 10% in the range of 5-35 MHz. The antenna inherits the omni-directional radiation pattern of a simple dipole antenna in the 5-30 MHz frequency band, giving a large field of view and allowing detection of the 21 cm global signal when used alone. A demonstration prototype is constructed, and its measured electrical property is found to be consistent with simulated results using |S11| measurements. This membrane antenna can potentially fulfill the requirements of a lunar low-frequency array, establishing a solid technical foundation for future large-scale arrays for exploring the cosmic dark ages.</description>

      <title>A Spatial Uniformity Check of Gaia DR3 Photometry and BP/RP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia DR3 photometry and BP/RP spectra have been widely used as reference in photometric calibrations. In this work, we check the spatial uniformity of Gaia DR3 photometry and BP/RP spectra by comparing the BP, RP and G bands photometry with the synthetic ones from the BP/RP spectra. The discrepancies have a small dispersion of 1.07, 0.55 and 1.02 mmag for the BP, RP, and G bands, respectively. However, the discrepancies exhibit obvious spatial patterns, which are clearly associated with the Gaia's scanning law. The patterns observed in the BP and G bands are similar, with discrepancies between photometry and spectra being more pronounced in these bands compared to the RP band. A further independent test with the Dark Energy Survey DR2 photometry reveals that the spatial patterns are more likely attributed to the Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra, particularly in the BP band. On one hand, our results confirm the high spatial uniformity of Gaia data at the mmag level. On the other hand, our results suggest that the spatial uniformity of Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra is not as good as that of Gaia DR3 photometry, and could be further improved in the future.</description>

      <title>Improved background modeling for dark matter search with COSINE-100</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: COSINE-100 aims to conclusively test the claimed dark matter annual modulation signal detected by DAMA/LIBRA collaboration. DAMA/LIBRA has released updated analysis results by lowering the energy threshold to 0.75 keV through various upgrades. They have consistently claimed to have observed the annual modulation. In COSINE-100, it is crucial to lower the energy threshold for a direct comparison with DAMA/LIBRA, which also enhances the sensitivity of the search for low-mass dark matter, enabling COSINE-100 to explore this area. Therefore, it is essential to have a precise and quantitative understanding of the background spectrum across all energy ranges. This study expands the background modeling from 0.7 to 4000 keV using 2.82 years of COSINE-100 data. The modeling has been improved to describe the background spectrum across all energy ranges accurately. Assessments of the background spectrum are presented, considering the nonproportionality of NaI(Tl) crystals at both low and high energies and the characteristic X-rays produced by the interaction of external backgrounds with materials such as copper. Additionally, constraints on the fit parameters obtained from the alpha spectrum modeling fit are integrated into this model. These improvements are detailed in the paper.</description>

      <title>A Classifier-Based Approach to Multi-Class Anomaly Detection Applied to Astronomical Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating anomaly detection is an open problem in many scientific fields, particularly in time-domain astronomy, where modern telescopes generate millions of alerts per night. Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for astronomical time-series rely either on hand-crafted features or on features generated through unsupervised representation learning, coupled with standard anomaly detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the latent space of a neural network classifier for anomaly detection. We then propose a new method called Multi-Class Isolation Forests (MCIF), which trains separate isolation forests for each class to derive an anomaly score for an object based on its latent space representation. This approach significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest when distinct clusters exist in the latent space. Using a simulated dataset emulating the Zwicky Transient Facility (54 anomalies and 12,040 common), our anomaly detection pipeline discovered $46\pm3$ anomalies ($\sim 85\%$ recall) after following up the top 2,000 ($\sim 15\%$) ranked objects. Furthermore, our classifier-based approach outperforms or approaches the performance of other state-of-the-art anomaly detection pipelines. Our novel method demonstrates that existing and new classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time anomaly detection. The code used in this work, including a Python package, is publicly available, https://github.com/Rithwik-G/AstroMCAD.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of hybrid foreground removal on CHIME data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main challenge of 21 cm cosmology experiments is astrophysical foregrounds which are difficult to separate from the signal due to telescope systematics. An earlier study has shown that foreground residuals induced by antenna gain errors can be estimated and subtracted using the hybrid foreground residual subtraction (HyFoReS) technique which relies on cross-correlating linearly filtered data. In this paper, we apply a similar technique to the CHIME stacking analysis to subtract beam-induced foreground contamination. Using a linear high-pass delay filter for foreground suppression, the CHIME collaboration reported a $11.1\sigma$ detection in the 21 cm signal stacked on eBOSS quasar locations, despite foreground residual contamination mostly due to the instrument chromatic transfer function. We cross-correlate the foreground-dominated data at low delay with the contaminated signal at high delay to estimate residual foregrounds and subtract them from the signal. We find foreground residual subtraction can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the stacked 21 cm signal by $ 10 - 20\%$ after the delay foreground filter, although some of the improvement can also be achieved with an alternative flagging technique. We have shown that it is possible to use HyFoReS to reduce beam-induced foreground contamination, benefiting the analysis of the HI auto power spectrum with CHIME and enabling the recovery of large scale modes.</description>

      <title>Pursuing Truth: Improving Retrievals on Mid-Infrared Exo-Earth Spectra with Physically Motivated Water Abundance Profiles and Cloud Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric retrievals are widely used to constrain exoplanet properties from observed spectra. We investigate how the common nonphysical retrieval assumptions of vertically constant molecule abundances and cloud-free atmospheres affect our characterization of an exo-Earth (an Earth-twin orbiting a Sun-like star). Specifically, we use a state-of-the-art retrieval framework to explore how assumptions for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ profile and clouds affect retrievals. In a first step, we validate different retrieval models on a low-noise simulated 1D mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of Earth. Thereafter, we study how these assumptions affect the characterization of Earth with the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We run retrievals on LIFE mock observations based on real disk-integrated MIR Earth spectra. The performance of different retrieval models is benchmarked against ground truths derived from remote sensing data. We show that assumptions for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ abundance and clouds directly affect our characterization. Overall, retrievals that use physically motivated models for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ profile and clouds perform better on the empirical Earth data. For observations of Earth with LIFE, they yield accurate estimates for the radius, pressure-temperature structure, and the abundances of $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{H_2O}$, and $\mathrm{O_3}$. Further, at $R=100$, a reliable and bias-free detection of the biosignature $\mathrm{CH_4}$ becomes feasible. We conclude that the community must use a diverse range of models for temperate exoplanet atmospheres to build an understanding of how different retrieval assumptions can affect the interpretation of exoplanet spectra. This will enable the characterization of distant habitable worlds and the search for life with future space-based instruments.</description>

      <title>First Discovery and Confirmation of PN Candidates Found from AI and Deep Learning Techniques Applied to VPHAS+ Survey Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. We have developed deep learning (DL) and AI-based tools to search extant narrow-band wide-field H$\alpha$ surveys of the Galactic Plane for elusive planetary nebulae (PNe) which are hidden in dense star fields towards the Galactic center. They are faint, low-surface brightness, usually resolved sources, which are not discovered by previous automatic searches that depend on photometric data for point-like sources. These sources are very challenging to find by traditional visual inspection in such crowded fields and many have been missed. We have successfully adopted a novel 'Swin-Transformer' AI algorithm, which we described in detail in the preceding Techniques paper (Paper I). Aims. Here, we present preliminary results from our first spectroscopic follow-up run for 31 top-quality PN candidates found by the algorithm from the high-resolution H$\alpha$ survey VPHAS+. This survey has not yet undergone extensive manual, systematic searching. Methods. Our candidate PNe were observed with the SpUpNIC spectrograph on the 1.9 m telescope at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in June 2023. We performed standard IRAF spectroscopic reduction and then followed our normal HASH PN identification and classification procedures. Results. Our reduced spectra confirmed that these candidates include 22 true, likely, and possible PNe (70.97\%), 3 emission-line galaxies, 2 emission-line stars, 2 late-type star contaminants, and 2 other H$\alpha$ sources including a newly identified detached fragment of SNR RCW 84. We present the imaging and spectral data of these candidates and a preliminary analysis of their properties. These data provide strong input to help evaluate and refine the behavior of the AI algorithm when searching for PNe in wide-field H$\alpha$ surveys.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the nanohertz gravitational wave background using a $t$-process power spectral density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), which induce correlated changes in millisecond pulsars' timing residuals. PTA collaborations around the world have recently announced evidence of a nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB), which may be produced by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The GWB is often modeled as following a power-law power spectral density (PSD); however, a GWB produced by a cosmological population of SMBHBs is expected to have a more complex power spectrum due to the discrete nature of the sources. In this paper, we investigate using a $t$-process PSD to model the GWB, which allows us to fit for both the underlying power-law amplitude and spectral index as well as deviations from that power law, which may be produced by individual nearby binaries. We create simulated data sets based on the properties of the NANOGrav 15-year data set, and we demonstrate that the $t$-process PSD can accurately recover the PSD when deviations from a power-law are present. With longer timed datasets and more pulsars, we expect the sensitivity of our PTAs to improve, which will allow us to precisely measure the PSD of the GWB and study the sources producing it.</description>

      <title>Fringing analysis and forward modeling of Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) combines high contrast imaging with high resolution spectroscopy (R$\sim$35,000 in K band) to study directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarfs in unprecedented detail. KPIC aims to spectrally characterize substellar companions through measurements of planetary radial velocities, spins, and atmospheric composition. Currently, the dominant source of systematic noise for KPIC is fringing, or oscillations in the spectrum as a function of wavelength. The fringing signal can dominate residuals by up to 10% of the continuum for high S/N exposures, preventing accurate wavelength calibration, retrieval of atmospheric parameters, and detection of planets with flux ratios less than 1% of the host star. To combat contamination from fringing, we first identify its three unique sources and adopt a physically informed model of Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavities to apply to post-processed data. We find this strategy can effectively model the fringing in observations of A0V/F0V stars, reducing the residual systematics caused by fringing by a factor of 2. Next, we wedge two of the transmissive optics internal to KPIC to eliminate two sources of fringing and confirm the third source as the entrance window to the spectrograph. Finally, we apply our previous model of the Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity to new data taken with the wedged optics to reduce the amplitude of the residuals by a factor of 10.</description>

      <title>GaiaNIR: Note on processing and photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some ideas for onboard processing and photometry with an astrometry satellite are presented, especially designed for GaiaNIR which may be launched about 2045 as a successor of Gaia. - Increased sensitivity, reduced image overlap, and simpler PSF calibration in GaiaNIR will result if the proposed initial processing of data from the detectors is implemented, because the across-scan smearing will become insignificant. - Filter photometry is required for high angular resolution as needed for astrometric and astrophysical reasons. Low-dispersion spectra are questioned because they fail at high star density. This will be a much greater problem with GaiaNIR than it is with Gaia because of the larger number of stars expected. It was the aim to collect in this note all arguments about GaiaNIR photometry which can be stated with words only, in correspondence with readers. The remaining work to be done for the definition of photometric equipment on the satellite requires further quantitative assessments and comparison of various options. Finally, 1) an advantage of filters is that the photometric observations can also be used for astrometry, 2) the XP spectra in Gaia will give very good astrophysical data for about 400 million single stars with G &lt;~ 18.5 mag, but filters would have been better for all fainter and for all multiple stars, and 3) it is presently not clear which advantages for astrophysics low-dispersion spectra in the NIR might have over filters.</description>

      <title>Identifying Halos in Cosmological Simulations with Continuous Wavelet Analysis: The 2D Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00920</link>

Abstract: Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across spatial and scale domains simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method to identify halos and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin with the generation of four pseudo-2D datasets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. We then calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional friends-of-friends (FOF) method shows that our CWT-identified halos, while contain slightly fewer particles, have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. Our identification scheme operates with a linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, suggesting its suitability for analyzing significantly larger datasets in the future.</description>

      <title>The Active Optics System on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory: Optimal Control of Degeneracy Among the Large Number of Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a unique facility for survey astronomy that will soon be commissioned and begin operations. Crucial to many of its scientific goals is the achievement of sustained high image quality, limited only by the seeing at the site. This will be maintained through an Active Optics System (AOS) that controls optical element misalignments and corrects mirror figure error to minimize aberrations caused by both thermal and gravitational distortions. However, the large number of adjustment degrees of freedom available on the Rubin Observatory introduces a range of degeneracies, including many that are \textit{noise-induced} due to imperfect measurement of the wavefront errors. We present a structured methodology for identifying these degeneracies through an analysis of image noise level. We also present a novel scaling strategy based on Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) that mitigates the degeneracy, and optimally distributes the adjustment over the available degrees of freedom. Our approach ensures the attainment of optimal image quality, while avoiding excursions around the noise-induced subspace of degeneracies, marking a significant improvement over the previous techniques adopted for Rubin, which were based on an Optimal Integral Controller (OIC). This new approach is likely to also yield significant benefits for all telescopes that incorporate large numbers of degrees of freedom of adjustment.</description>

      <title>Optimal Demodulation Domain for Microwave SQUID Multiplexers in Presence of Readout System Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Microwave SQUID Multiplexer ({\mu}MUX) is the device of choice for the readout of a large number of Low-Temperature Detectors in a wide variety of experiments within the fields of astronomy and particle physics. While it offers large multiplexing factors, the system noise performance is highly dependent on the cold and warm-readout electronic systems used to read it out, as well as the demodulation domain and parameters chosen. In order to understand the impact of the readout systems in the overall detection system noise performance, first we extended the available {\mu}MUX simulation frameworks including additive and multiplicative noise sources in the probing tones (i.e. phase and amplitude noise), along with the capability of demodulating the scientific data, either in resonator's phase or scattering amplitude. Then, considering the additive noise as a dominant noise source, the optimum readout parameters to achieve minimum system noise were found for both open-loop and flux-ramp demodulation schemes in the aforementioned domains. Later, we evaluated the system noise sensitivity to multiplicative noise sources under the optimum readout parameters. Finally, as a case study, we evaluated the optimal demodulation domain and expected system noise level for a typical Software-Defined Radio (SDR) readout system. This work leads to an improved system performance prediction and noise engineering based on the available readout electronics and selected demodulation domain.</description>
