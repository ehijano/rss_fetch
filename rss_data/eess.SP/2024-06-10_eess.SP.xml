      <title>Harnessing Multimodal Sensing for Multi-user Beamforming in mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor-aided beamforming reduces the overheads associated with beam training in millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) communication systems. Most prior work, though, neglects the challenges associated with establishing multi-user (MU) communication links in mmWave MIMO systems. In this paper, we propose a new framework for sensor-aided beam training in MU mmWave MIMO system. We leverage the beamspace representation of the channel that contains only the angles-of-departure (AoDs) of the channel's significant multipath components. We show that a deep neural network (DNN)-based multimodal sensor fusion framework can estimate the beamspace representation of the channel using sensor data. To aid the DNN training, we introduce a novel supervised soft-contrastive loss (SSCL) function that leverages the inherent similarity between channels to extract similar features from the sensor data for similar channels. Finally, we design an MU beamforming strategy that uses the estimated beamspaces of the channels to select analog precoders for all users in a way that prevents transmission to multiple users over the same directions. Compared to the baseline, our approach achieves more than 4$\times$ improvement in the median sum-spectral efficiency (SE) at 42 dBm equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) with 4 active users. This demonstrates that sensor data can provide more channel information than previously explored, with significant implications for machine learning (ML)-based communication and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning-Augmented Stand-off Radar Scheme for Rapidly Detecting Tree Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree defect detection is crucial for the structural health screening of trees. Existing nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques for tree defect detection require time-consuming and labor-intensive measurement campaigns. This discourages their application for the routine structural health screening of whole populations of managed urban trees. To address this issue, this study proposes a deep-learning augmented stand-off radar scheme for contactless scanning of tree trunks and rapid detection of tree defects. In this scheme, the antenna is moved along a straight trajectory at a distance from the tree trunk to obtain the trunk's B-scan. The obtained raw B-scan is then processed by a signal-processing framework specifically developed for revealing the scattering signatures of defects in B-scan, which achieves a 30 dB and 22 dB increase in the signal-to-clutter and noise ratio of the measurement data of tree trunk samples and living trees, respectively. Finally, the processed B-scan is input into a multilevel feature fusion neural network particularly designed for extracting the signature of the defect in the processed B-scan in real time. The developed scheme's applications to the detection of defects in real fresh-cut tree trunks show that the stand-off radar scheme can detect tree defects with 96% accuracy. This stand-off radar scheme is the first contactless NDT technique for tree defect detection while operated on a straight trajectory and potentially can be integrated into the routine tree inspection workflow which is part of urban tree management.</description>

      <title>From Analog to Digital: Multi-Order Digital Joint Coding-Modulation for Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies in joint source-channel coding (JSCC) have fostered a fresh paradigm in end-to-end semantic communication. Despite notable performance achievements, present initiatives in building semantic communication systems primarily hinge on the transmission of continuous channel symbols, thus presenting challenges in compatibility with established digital systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address this challenge by developing a multi-order digital joint coding-modulation (MDJCM) scheme for semantic communications. Initially, we construct a digital semantic communication system by integrating a multi-order modulation/demodulation module into a nonlinear transform source-channel coding (NTSCC) framework. Recognizing the non-differentiable nature of modulation/demodulation, we propose a novel substitution training strategy. Herein, we treat modulation/demodulation as a constrained quantization process and introduce scaling operations alongside manually crafted noise to approximate this process. As a result, employing this approximation in training semantic communication systems can be deployed in practical modulation/demodulation scenarios with superior performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the equivalence by analyzing the involved probability distribution. Moreover, to further upgrade the performance, we develop a hierarchical dimension-reduction strategy to provide a gradual information extraction process. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing digital and non-digital JSCC techniques.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Estimation for Extremely Large-Scale Terahertz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future Terahertz communications exhibit significant potential in accommodating ultra-high-rate services. Employing extremely large-scale array antennas is a key approach to realize this potential, as they can harness substantial beamforming gains to overcome the severe path loss and leverage the electromagnetic advantages in the near field. This paper proposes novel estimation methods designed to enhance efficiency in Terahertz widely-spaced multi-subarray (WSMS) systems. Initially, we introduce three sparse channel representation methods: polar-domain representation (PD-R), multi-angular-domain representation (MAD-R), and two-dimensional polar-angular-domain representation (2D-PAD-R). Each method is meticulously developed for near-field WSMS channels, capitalizing on their sparsity characteristics. Building on this, we propose four estimation frameworks using the sparse recovery theory: polar-domain estimation (PD-E), multi-angular-domain estimation (MAD-E), two-stage polar-angular-domain estimation (TS-PAD-E), and two-dimensional polar-angular-domain estimation (2D-PAD-E). Particularly, 2D-PAD-E, integrating a 2D dictionary process, and TS-PAD-E, with its sequential approach to angle and distance estimation, stand out as particularly effective for near-field angle-distance estimation, enabling decoupled calculation of these parameters. Overall, these frameworks provide versatile and efficient solutions for WSMS channel estimation, balancing low complexity with high-performance outcomes. Additionally, they represent a fresh perspective on near-field signal processing.</description>

      <title>A Pixel-based Reconfigurable Antenna Design for Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid Antenna Systems (FASs) have recently been proposed for enhancing the performance of wireless communication. Previous antenna designs to meet the requirements of FAS have been based on mechanically movable or liquid antennas and therefore have limited reconfiguration speeds. In this paper, we propose a design for a pixel-based reconfigurable antenna (PRA) that meets the requirements of FAS and the required switching speed. It can provide 12 FAS ports across 1/2 wavelength and consists of an E-slot patch antenna and an upper reconfigurable pixel layer with 6 RF switches. Simulation and experimental results from a prototype operating at 2.5 GHz demonstrate that the design can meet the requirements of FAS including port correlation with matched impedance.</description>

      <title>Automatic modulation classification for MIMO system based on the mutual information feature extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is an essential technology that is widely applied into various communications scenarios. In recent years, many Machine Learning and Deep-Learning methods have been introduced into AMC, and a lot of them apply different approaches to eliminate interference in complex Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) signals and improve classification performance. However, in practical communication systems, the perfect elimination of MIMO signal interference is impossible, and therefore classification performance suffers. In this paper, we propose a new AMC algorithm for MIMO system based on mutual information (MI) features extraction, which does not require a large amount of training data and the elimination of MIMO signal interference. In this approach, features based on mutual information are extracted using In-Phase and Quadrature (IQ) constellation diagrams of MIMO signals, which have not been explored previously. Our method can be effective since mutual information considers the interdependencies among variables and measures how much information about one variable reduces uncertainty about another, providing a valuable perspective for extracting higher-level and interesting features from the data. The effectiveness of our method is evaluated on several model and real-world datasets, and its applicability is proven.</description>

      <title>Fractal OAM Generation and Detection Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried electromagnetic waves have the potential to improve spectrum efficiency in optical and radio-frequency communications due to the orthogonal wavefronts of different OAM modes. However, OAM beams are vortically hollow and divergent, which significantly decreases the capacity of OAM transmissions. In addition, unaligned transceivers in OAM transmissions can result in a high bit error rate (BER). The Talbot effect is a self-imaging phenomenon that can be used to generate optical or radio-frequency OAM beams with periodic repeating structures at multiples of a certain distance along the propagation direction. These periodic structures make it unnecessary for the transceiver antennas to be perfectly aligned and can also alleviate the hollow divergence of OAM beams. In this paper, we propose Talbot-effect-based fractal OAM generation and detection schemes using a uniform circular array (UCA) to significantly improve capacity and BER performance in unaligned OAM transmissions. We first provide a brief overview of fractal OAM. Then, we propose the fractal OAM beam generation and detection schemes. Numerical analysis and simulations verify the effectiveness of our proposed fractal OAM generation scheme and also demonstrate improved capacity and BER performance compared to normal OAM transmissions. We also analyze how the receive UCA radius and the distance between the UCAs impact the capacity and BER performances.</description>

      <title>Joint Reflection and Power Splitting Optimization for RIS-assisted OAM-SWIPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) can enhance the spectrum and power efficiencies of wireless communications networks. Line-of-sight (LOS) transmission is a typical SWIPT scenario. However, the strong channel correlation limits the spectrum and energy efficiencies of SWIPT in the LOS channel. Due to the orthogonal wavefronts, orbital angular momentum (OAM) waves can facilitate the SWIPT in LOS channels. With the assistance of the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), both the energy efficiency and capacity can be further improved for the OAM-SWIPT systems. In this paper, we model the RIS-assisted OAM-SWIPT transmission and derive the optimal reflection coefficients and power splitting ratio for it. We first give the system and channel models. Then, we propose the transmission scheme. Based on the transmission scheme, we formulate the capacity and energy harvesting (EH) trade-off problem. We solve the problem by developing an alternating optimization algorithm. Simulations validate the capacity and EH enhancements brought by the RIS for OAM-SWIPT.</description>

      <title>OAM-SWIPT for IoE-Driven 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), which achieves both wireless energy transfer (WET) and information transfer, is an attractive technique for future Internet of Everything (IoE) in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communications. With SWIPT, battery-less IoE devices can be powered while communicating with other devices. Line-of-sight (LOS) RF transmission and near-field inductive coupling based transmission are typical SWIPT scenarios, which are both LOS channels and without enough degree of freedom for high spectrum efficiency as well as high energy efficiency. Due to the orthogonal wavefronts, orbital angular momentum (OAM) can facilitate the SWIPT in LOS channels. In this article, we introduce the OAM-based SWIPT as well as discuss some basic advantages and challenges for it. After introducing the OAM-based SWIPT for IoE, we first propose an OAM-based SWIPT system model with the OAM-modes assisted dynamic power splitting (DPS). Then, four basic advantages regarding the OAM-based SWIPT are reviewed with some numerical analyses for further demonstrating the advantages. Next, four challenges regarding integrating OAM into SWIPT and possible solutions are discussed. OAM technology provides multiple orthogonal streams to increase both spectrum and energy efficiencies for SWIPT, thus creating many opportunities for future WET and SWIPT researches.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Performance Analysis of OAM-NFC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its low energy consumption and simplicity, near field communication (NFC) has been extensively used in various short-range transmission scenarios, for example, proximity payment and NFC entrance guard. However, the low data rate of NFC limits its application in high rate demanded scenarios, such as high-resolution fingerprint identification and streaming media transmission as well as the future promising high rate indoor communications among pads, phones, and laptops. In this paper, we model and analyze the performance of the orbital angular momentum based NFC (OAM-NFC) system, which can significantly increase the capacity of NFC. We first give the OAM system model. With coils circularly equipped at the transmitter and receiver, OAM-NFC signals can be transmitted, received, and detected. Then, we develop the OAM-NFC generation and detection schemes for NFC multiplexing transmission. We also analyze the OAM-NFC channel capacity and compare it with those of single-input-single-output (SISO) as well as multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) NFC. Simulation results validate the feasibility and capacity enhancement of our proposed OAM-NFC system. How different variables, such as the transceiver misalignment, the numbers of transceiver coils, and transceiver distance, impact the OAM-NFC capacity are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Wireless Networks via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs): Overview of the ETSI ISG RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are a novel form of ultra-low power devices that are capable to increase the communication data rates as well as the cell coverage in a cost- and energy-efficient way. This is attributed to their programmable operation that enables them to dynamically manipulate the wireless propagation environment, a feature that has lately inspired numerous research investigations and applications. To pave the way to the formal standardization of RISs, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) launched the Industry Specification Group (ISG) on the RIS technology in September 2021. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the status of the work conducted by the ETSI ISG RIS, covering typical deployment scenarios of reconfigurable metasurfaces, use cases and operating applications, requirements, emerging hardware architectures and operating modes, as well as the latest insights regarding future directions of RISs and the resulting smart wireless environments.</description>

      <title>Distributed Combinatorial Optimization of Downlink User Assignment in mmWave Cell-free Massive MIMO Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) cell-free massive MIMO (CF mMIMO) is a promising solution for future wireless communications. However, its optimization is non-trivial due to the challenging channel characteristics. We show that mmWave CF mMIMO optimization is largely an assignment problem between access points (APs) and users due to the high path loss of mmWave channels, the limited output power of the amplifier, and the almost orthogonal channels between users given a large number of AP antennas. The combinatorial nature of the assignment problem, the requirement for scalability, and the distributed implementation of CF mMIMO make this problem difficult. In this work, we propose an unsupervised machine learning (ML) enabled solution. In particular, a graph neural network (GNN) customized for scalability and distributed implementation is introduced. Moreover, the customized GNN architecture is hierarchically permutation-equivariant (HPE), i.e., if the APs or users of an AP are permuted, the output assignment is automatically permuted in the same way. To address the combinatorial problem, we relax it to a continuous problem, and introduce an information entropy-inspired penalty term. The training objective is then formulated using the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM). The test results show that the realized sum-rate outperforms that of the generalized serial dictatorship (GSD) algorithm and is very close to the upper bound in a small network scenario, while the upper bound is impossible to obtain in a large network scenario.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Assisted OAM Wireless Communications With Misaligned Transceiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vortex electromagnetic wave carried by multiple orthogonal orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes in the same frequency band can be applied to the field of wireless communications, which greatly increases the spectrum efficiency. The uniform circular array (UCA) is the classical structure to generate and receive vortex electromagnetic waves with multiple OAM-modes. However, when the transmit and receive UCAs are misaligned, there will be interference among the OAM-modes and the signal cannot be recovered at the receiver. In order to solve this problem, we propose movable antenna (MA) assisted OAM wireless communications scheme. We estimate the rotation angle between transmit and receive UCAs and feed it back to the transmitter. Then, the MA at the transmitter adjusts the rotation angle to achieve alignment of the UCA at both the receiver and transmitter. Simulation results show that our scheme can significantly improve the spectrum efficiency.</description>

      <title>Achieving High Capacity Transmission With N-Dimensional Quasi-Fractal UCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vortex electromagnetic wave carried by multiple orthogonal orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes in the same frequency band can be applied to the field of wireless communications, which greatly increases the spectrum efficiency. The uniform circular array (UCA) is widely used to generate and receive vortex electromagnetic waves with multiple OAM-modes. However, the maximum number of orthogonal OAM-modes based on UCA is usually limited to the number of array-elements of the UCA antenna, leaving how to utilize more OAM-modes to achieve higher channel capacity with a fixed number of arrayelements as an intriguing question. In this paper, we propose an N-dimensional quasi-fractal UCA (ND QF-UCA) antenna structure in different fractal geometry layouts to break through the limits of array-elements number on OAM-modes number. We develop the N-dimensional OAM modulation (NOM) and demodulation (NOD) schemes for OAM multiplexing transmission with the OAM-modes number exceeding the array-elements number, which is beyond the traditional concept of multiple antenna based wireless communications. Then, we investigate different dimensional multiplexing transmission schemes based on the corresponding QF-UCA antenna structure with various array-element layouts and evaluate the optimal layout type and dimension to obtain the highest channel capacity with a fixed number of array-elements. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes can obtain a higher spectrum efficiency, surpassing those of alternative array-element layouts of QF-UCA and the traditional multiple antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Beamforming Feedback Information-Based Wi-Fi Sensing by Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing leveraging plain-text beamforming feedback information (BFI) in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems attracts increasing attention. However, due to the implicit relationship between BFI and the channel state information (CSI), quantifying the sensing capability of BFI poses a challenge in building efficient BFI-based sensing algorithms. In this letter, we first derive a mathematical model of BFI, characterizing its relationship with CSI explicitly, and then develop a closed-form expression of BFI for 2x2 MIMO systems. To enhance the efficiency of BFI-based sensing by selecting only the most informative features, we quantify the sensing capacity of BFI using the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) and then propose an efficient CRB-based BFI feature selection algorithm. Simulation results verify that BFI and CSI exhibit comparable sensing capabilities and that the proposed algorithm halves the number of features, reducing 20% more parameters than baseline methods, at the cost of only slightly increasing positioning errors.</description>

      <title>Two Power Allocation and Beamforming Strategies for Active IRS-aided Wireless Network via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper models an active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) -assisted wireless communication network, which has the ability to adjust power between BS and IRS. We aim to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of user by jointly designing power allocation (PA) factor, active IRS phase shift matrix, and beamforming vector of BS, subject to a total power constraint. To tackle this non-convex problem, we solve this problem by alternately optimizing these variables. Firstly, the PA factor is designed via polynomial regression method. Next, BS beamforming vector and IRS phase shift matrix are obtained by Dinkelbach's transform and successive convex approximation methods. To reduce the high computational complexity of the above proposed algorithm, we maximize achievable rate (AR) and use closed-form fractional programming method to transform the original problem into an equivalent form. Then, we address this problem by iteratively optimizing auxiliary variables, BS and IRS beamformings. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively improve the AR performance compared to fixed PA strategies, aided by passive IRS, and without IRS.</description>

      <title>Near or far: On determining the appropriate channel estimation strategy in cross-field communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output and high-frequency large bandwidth systems is likely in the next-generation wireless communication systems. In such systems, the user moves between near- and far-field regions, and consequently, the channel estimation will need to be carried out in the cross-field scenario. Channel estimation strategies have been proposed for both near- and far-fields, but in the cross-field problem, the first step is to determine whether the near- or far-field is applicable so that an appropriate channel estimation strategy can be employed. In this work, we propose using a hidden Markov model over an ensemble of region estimates to enhance the accuracy of selecting the actual region. The region indicators are calculated using the pair-wise power differences between received signals across the subarrays within an array-of-subarrays architecture. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves a high success rate in determining the appropriate channel estimation strategy.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Resource Allocation in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Hybrid Networks via Multi-Player Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a resource allocation problem where several Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices send data to a base station (BS) with or without the help of the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted cellular network. The objective is to maximize the sum rate of all IoT devices by finding the optimal RIS and spreading factor (SF) for each device. Since these IoT devices lack prior information on the RISs or the channel state information (CSI), a distributed resource allocation framework with low complexity and learning features is required to achieve this goal. Therefore, we model this problem as a two-stage multi-player multi-armed bandit (MPMAB) framework to learn the optimal RIS and SF sequentially. Then, we put forth an exploration and exploitation boosting (E2Boost) algorithm to solve this two-stage MPMAB problem by combining the $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm, Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm, and non-cooperation game method. We derive an upper regret bound for the proposed algorithm, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(\log^{1+\delta}_2 T)$, increasing logarithmically with the time horizon $T$. Numerical results show that the E2Boost algorithm has the best performance among the existing methods and exhibits a fast convergence rate. More importantly, the proposed algorithm is not sensitive to the number of combinations of the RISs and SFs thanks to the two-stage allocation mechanism, which can benefit high-density networks.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication for Anti-Jamming with OAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum share and open nature of wireless channels enable integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) susceptible to hostile jamming attacks. Due to the intrinsic orthogonality and rich azimuth angle information of orbital angular momentum (OAM), vortex electromagnetic waves with helical phase fronts have shown great potential to achieve high-resolution imaging and strong anti-jamming capability of wireless communication. Focusing on significantly enhancing the anti-jamming results of ISAC systems with limited bandwidth under hostile jamming, in this paper we propose a novel ISAC for anti-jamming with OAM scheme, where the OAM legitimate transmitter can simultaneously sense the position of jammers with dynamic behavior and send data to multiple OAM legitimate users. Specifically, the OAM modes for sensing and communications are respectively hopped according to pre-set index modulation information to suppress jamming. To acquire the position of the jammer, we develop the enhanced multiple-signal-classification-based three-dimension position estimation scheme with continuous sensing in both frequency and angular domains, where the OAM transmitter is designed with the concentric uniform-circular-array mono-static method, to significantly increase the azimuthal resolution. Then, based on the acquired jamming channel state information, we develop the joint transmit-receive beamforming and power allocation scheme, where the transmit and receive beamforming matrices are dynamically adjusted to mitigate the mixed interference containing inter-mode interference, inter-user interference, and jamming, thus maximizing the achievable sum rates (ASRs) of all users. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can significantly increase the ASR under broadband jamming attacks and achieve high detection accuracy of targets .</description>

      <title>Double-RIS-Assisted Orbital Angular Momentum Near-Field Secure Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To satisfy the various demands of growing devices and services, emerging high-frequency-based technologies promote near-field wireless communications. Therefore, near-field physical layer security has attracted much attention to facilitate the wireless information security against illegitimate eavesdropping. However, highly correlated channels between legitimate transceivers and eavesdroppers of existing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) based near-field secure technologies along with the low degrees of freedom significantly limit the enhancement of security results in wireless communications. To significantly increase the secrecy rates of near-field wireless communications, in this paper we propose the double-reconfigurable-intelligent-surface (RIS) assisted orbital angular momentum (OAM) secure scheme, where RISs with few reflecting elements are easily deployed to reconstruct the direct links blocked by obstacles between the legitimate transceivers, mitigate the inter-mode interference caused by the misalignment of legitimate transceivers, and adjust the OAM beams direction to interfere with eavesdroppers. Meanwhile, due to the unique orthogonality among OAM modes, the OAM-based joint index modulation and artificial noise scheme is proposed to weaken the information acquisition by eavesdroppers while increasing the achievable rate with the low cost of legitimate communications. To maximize the secrecy rate of our proposed scheme, we develop the Riemannian manifold conjugate gradient (RMCG)-based alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to jointly optimize the transmit power allocation of OAM modes and phase shifts of double RISs. Numerical results show that our proposed double-RIS-assisted OAM near-field secure scheme outperforms the existing works in terms of the secrecy rate and the eavesdropper's bit error rate.</description>

      <title>Spatial Correlation Modeling and RS-LS Estimation of Near-Field Channels with Uniform Planar Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs) can offer massive spatial multiplexing gains in the radiative near-field region in beyond 5G systems. While near-field channel modeling for uniform linear arrays has been extensively explored in the literature, uniform planar arrays-despite their advantageous form factor-have been somewhat neglected due to their more complex nature. Spatial correlation is crucial for non-line-of-sight channel modeling. Unlike far-field scenarios, the spatial correlation properties of near-field channels have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we start from the fundamentals and develop a near-field spatial correlation model for arbitrary spatial scattering functions. Furthermore, we derive the lower dimensional subspace where the channel vectors can exist. It is based on prior knowledge of the three-dimensional coverage region where scattering clusters exists and we derive a tractable one-dimensional integral expression. This subspace is subsequently employed in a reduced-subspace least squares (RS-LS) estimation method for near-field channels, thereby enhancing performance over the traditional least squares estimator without the need for having full spatial correlation matrix knowledge.</description>

      <title>Imageless Contraband Detection Using a Millimeter-Wave Dynamic Antenna Array via Spatial Fourier Domain Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an imageless method of concealed contraband detection using a real-time 75 GHz rotationally dynamic antenna array. The array measures information in the two-dimensional Fourier domain and captures a set of samples that is sufficient for detecting concealed objects yet insufficient for generating full image, thereby preserving the privacy of screened subjects. The small set of Fourier samples contains sharp spatial frequency features in the Fourier domain which correspond to sharp edges of man-made objects such as handguns. We evaluate a set of classification methods: threshold-based, K-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine using radial basis function; all operating on arithmetic features directly extracted from the sampled Fourier-domain responses measured by a dynamically rotating millimeter-wave active interferometer. Noise transmitters are used to produce thermal-like radiation from scenes, enabling direct Fourier-domain sampling, while the rotational dynamics circularly sample the two-dimensional Fourier domain, capturing the sharp-edge induced responses. We experimentally demonstrate the detection of concealed metallic gun-shape object beneath clothing on a real person in a laboratory environment and achieved an accuracy and F1-score both at 0.986. The presented technique not only prevents image formation due to efficient Fourier-domain space sub-sampling but also requires only 211 ms from measurement to decision.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning for Uplink Interference Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MUL) is introduced as a means to achieve interference cancellation within artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled wireless systems. It is observed that interference cancellation with MUL demonstrates $30\%$ improvement in a classification task accuracy in the presence of a corrupted AI model. Accordingly, the necessity for instantaneous channel state information for existing interference source is eliminated and a corrupted latent space with interference noise is cleansed with MUL algorithm, achieving this without the necessity for either retraining or dataset cleansing. A Membership Interference Attack (MIA) served as a benchmark for assessing the efficacy of MUL in mitigating interference within a neural network model. The advantage of the MUL algorithm was determined by evaluating both the probability of interference and the quantity of samples requiring retraining. In a simple signal-to-noise ratio classification task, the comprehensive improvement across various test cases in terms of accuracy demonstrates that MUL exhibits extensive capabilities and limitations, particularly in native AI applications.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS and Turbo Signal Processing for Joint Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zak-OTFS input/output (I/O) relation is predictable and non-fading when the delay and Doppler periods are greater than the effective channel delay and Doppler spreads, a condition which we refer to as the crystallization condition. The filter taps can simply be read off from the response to a single Zak-OTFS pilot pulsone, and the I/O relation can be reconstructed for a sampled system that operates under finite duration and bandwidth constraints. In previous work we had measured BER performance of a baseline system where we used separate Zak-OTFS subframes for sensing and data transmission. In this Letter we demonstrate how to use turbo signal processing to match BER performance of this baseline system when we integrate sensing and communication within the same Zak-OTFS subframe. The turbo decoder alternates between channel sensing using a noise-like waveform (spread pulsone) and recovery of data transmitted using point pulsones.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to mitigate the distance reduction attack in Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) ranging, this paper proposes a secure ranging scheme based on a random time-hopping mechanism without redundant signaling overhead. Additionally, a secure ranging strategy is designed for backward compatibility with existing standards such as IEEE 802.15.4a/z, combined with an attack detection scheme. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy are demonstrated through both simulation and experimental results in the case of the Ghost Peak attack, as demonstrated by Patrick Leu et al. The random time-hopping mechanism is verified to be capable of reducing the success rate of distance reduction attacks to less than 0.01%, thereby significantly enhancing the security of UWB ranging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a recently proposed approach to graph signal processing based on graphons. We show how the graphon-based approach to GSP applies to graphs sampled from a stochastic block model. We obtain a basis for the graphon Fourier transform on such samples directly from the link probability matrix and the block sizes of the model. This formulation allows us to bound the sensitivity of the Fourier transform to small changes in block sizes. We then focus on the case where the probability matrix corresponds to a (weighted) Cayley graph. If block sizes are equal, a nice Fourier basis can be derived from the underlying group. We explore how, in the case where block sizes are not equal, some or all nice properties of the group basis can be maintained. We complement the theoretical results with simulations.</description>

Abstract: This letter explores the development and implementation of a novel thin film 1-by-4 reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) designed for future communication and sensing scenarios. Utilizing cost-effective inkjet printing methods and additive manufacturing, our approach significantly simplifies the RIS construction process and reduces production costs. The RIS, fabricated on a flexible and lightweight polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, integrates antennas, switching circuitry, and a microcontroller unit (MCU). This setup enables individual and simultaneous control of each RIS element, manipulating the captured carrier signal by steering its dominant harmonics toward multiple desired directions. Measurement results of the beam steering show the manufactured RIS has the potential to enable RIS-aided communication and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Feature Characterization for Profile Surface Texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional field parameters for surface measurement use all data points, while feature characterization focuses on subsets extracted by watershed segmentation. This approach enables the extraction of specific features that are potentially responsible for the function of the surface or are a direct reflection of the manufacturing process, allowing for a more accurate assessment of both aspects. Feature characterization with the underlying watershed segmentation for areal surface topographies has been standardized for over a decade and is well established in industry and research. In contrast, feature characterization for surface profiles has been standardized recently, and the corresponding standard for watershed segmentation is planned to be published in the near future. Since the standards do not provide guidelines for implementation, this paper presents an unambiguous algorithm of the watershed segmentation and the feature characterization for surface profiles. This framework provides the basis for future work, mainly investigating the relationship between feature parameters based on feature characterization and the function of the surface or manufacturing process. For this purpose, recommendations for the configuration and extensions of the toolbox can also be developed, which could find their way into the ISO standards.</description>

      <title>Tackling Delayed CSI in a Distributed Multi-Satellite MIMO Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the integration of satellites with ground-based communication networks. Specifically, we analyze downlink data transmission from a constellation of satellites to terrestrial users and address the issue of delayed channel state information (CSI). The satellites cooperate in data transmission within a cluster to create a unified, distributed massive multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) system. The CSI used for this process is inherently outdated, particularly due to the delay from the most distant satellite in the cluster. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a precoding strategy that leverages the long-term characteristics of CSI uncertainty to compensate for the undesirable impact of these unavoidable delays. Our proposed method is computationally efficient and particularly effective in lower frequency bands. As such, it holds significant promise for facilitating the integration of satellite and terrestrial communication, especially within frequency bands of up to 1 GHz.</description>

      <title>Early Acceptance Matching Game for User-Centric Clustering in Scalable Cell-free MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical setup is the primary approach adopted in cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks, in which all access points (APs) jointly serve every user equipment (UE). This approach is not scalable in terms of computational complexity and fronthaul signaling becoming impractical in large networks. This work adopts a user-centric approach, a scalable alternative in which only a set of preferred APs jointly serve a UE. Forming the optimal cluster of APs for each UE is a challenging task, especially, when it needs to be dynamically adjusted to meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the UE. This complexity is even exacerbated when considering the constrained fronthaul capacity of the UE and the AP. We solve this problem with a novel many-to-many matching game. More specifically, we devise an early acceptance matching algorithm, which immediately admits or rejects UEs based on their requests and available radio resources. The proposed solution significantly reduces the fronthaul signaling while satisfying the maximum of UEs in terms of requested QoS compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Fight Scene Detection for Movie Highlight Generation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper of a research based project, using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, we provide a novel Fight Scene Detection (FSD) model which can be used for Movie Highlight Generation Systems (MHGS) based on deep learning and Neural Networks . Movies usually have Fight Scenes to keep the audience amazed. For trailer generation, or any other application of Highlight generation, it is very tidious to first identify all such scenes manually and then compile them to generate a highlight serving the purpose. Our proposed FSD system utilises temporal characteristics of the movie scenes and thus is capable to automatically identify fight scenes. Thereby helping in the effective production of captivating movie highlights. We observe that the proposed solution features 93.5% accuracy and is higher than 2D CNN with Hough Forests which being 92% accurate and is significantly higher than 3D CNN which features an accuracy of 65%.</description>

      <title>Relational Proxy Loss for Audio-Text based Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on user convenience, leading to increased interest in text-based keyword enrollment systems for keyword spotting (KWS). Since the system utilizes text input during the enrollment phase and audio input during actual usage, we call this task audio-text based KWS. To enable this task, both acoustic and text encoders are typically trained using deep metric learning loss functions, such as triplet- and proxy-based losses. This study aims to improve existing methods by leveraging the structural relations within acoustic embeddings and within text embeddings. Unlike previous studies that only compare acoustic and text embeddings on a point-to-point basis, our approach focuses on the relational structures within the embedding space by introducing the concept of Relational Proxy Loss (RPL). By incorporating RPL, we demonstrated improved performance on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus.</description>

      <title>Uplink resource allocation optimization for user-centric cell-free MIMO networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the problem of optimizing resource allocation in the uplink for a user-centric, cell-free, multi-input multi-output network. We start by modeling and developing resource allocation algorithms for two standard network operation modes. The centralized mode provides high data rates but suffers multiple issues, including scalability. On the other hand, the distributed mode has the opposite problem: relatively low rates, but is scalable. To address these challenges, we combine the strength of the two standard modes, creating a new semi-distributed operation mode. To avoid the need for information exchange between access points, we introduce a new quality of service metric to decentralize the resource allocation algorithms. Our results show that we can eliminate the need for information exchange with a relatively small penalty on data rates.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Noise Robustness for Flow-Matching-Based Zero-Shot TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems, capable of synthesizing any speaker's voice from a short audio prompt, have made rapid advancements. However, the quality of the generated speech significantly deteriorates when the audio prompt contains noise, and limited research has been conducted to address this issue. In this paper, we explored various strategies to enhance the quality of audio generated from noisy audio prompts within the context of flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS. Our investigation includes comprehensive training strategies: unsupervised pre-training with masked speech denoising, multi-speaker detection and DNSMOS-based data filtering on the pre-training data, and fine-tuning with random noise mixing. The results of our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in intelligibility, speaker similarity, and overall audio quality compared to the approach of applying speech enhancement to the audio prompt.</description>

      <title>Rapid Optimization of Superposition Codes for Multi-Hop NOMA MANETs via Deep Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various communication technologies are expected to utilize mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). By combining MANETs with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communications, one can support scalable, spectrally efficient, and flexible network topologies. To achieve these benefits of NOMA MANETs, one should determine the transmission protocol, particularly the superposition code. However, the latter involves lengthy optimization that has to be repeated when the topology changes. In this work, we propose an algorithm for rapidly optimizing superposition codes in multi-hop NOMA MANETs. To achieve reliable tunning with few iterations, we adopt the emerging deep unfolding methodology, leveraging data to boost reliable settings. Our superposition coding optimization algorithm utilizes a small number of projected gradient steps while learning its per-user hyperparameters to maximize the minimal rate over past channels in an unsupervised manner. The learned optimizer is designed for both settings with full channel state information, as well as when the channel coefficients are to be estimated from pilots. We show that the combination of principled optimization and machine learning yields a scalable optimizer, that once trained, can be applied to different topologies. We cope with the non-convex nature of the optimization problem by applying parallel-learned optimization with different starting points as a form of ensemble learning. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the rapid setting of high-rate superposition codes for various channels.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Memorize Sensor Datasets! Implications on Human Activity Recognition Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astonishing success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has spurred their use in many application domains beyond text analysis, including wearable sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR). In such scenarios, often sensor data are directly fed into an LLM along with text instructions for the model to perform activity classification. Seemingly remarkable results have been reported for such LLM-based HAR systems when they are evaluated on standard benchmarks from the field. Yet, we argue, care has to be taken when evaluating LLM-based HAR systems in such a traditional way. Most contemporary LLMs are trained on virtually the entire (accessible) internet -- potentially including standard HAR datasets. With that, it is not unlikely that LLMs actually had access to the test data used in such benchmark experiments.The resulting contamination of training data would render these experimental evaluations meaningless. In this paper we investigate whether LLMs indeed have had access to standard HAR datasets during training. We apply memorization tests to LLMs, which involves instructing the models to extend given snippets of data. When comparing the LLM-generated output to the original data we found a non-negligible amount of matches which suggests that the LLM under investigation seems to indeed have seen wearable sensor data from the benchmark datasets during training. For the Daphnet dataset in particular, GPT-4 is able to reproduce blocks of sensor readings. We report on our investigations and discuss potential implications on HAR research, especially with regards to reporting results on experimental evaluation</description>

      <title>Revisiting Multi-User Downlink in IEEE 802.11ax: A Designers Guide to MU-MIMO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Downlink (DL) Multi-User (MU) Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) is a key technology that allows multiple concurrent data transmissions from an Access Point (AP) to a selected sub-set of clients for higher network efficiency in IEEE 802.11ax. However, DL MU-MIMO feature is typically turned off as the default setting in AP vendors' products, that is, turning on the DL MU-MIMO may not help increase the network efficiency, which is counter-intuitive. In this article, we provide a sufficiently deep understanding of the interplay between the various underlying factors, i.e., CSI overhead and spatial correlation, which result in negative results when turning on the DL MU-MIMO. Furthermore, we provide a fundamental guideline as a function of operational scenarios to address the fundamental question "when the DL MU-MIMO should be turned on/off".</description>

      <title>Soundscape Captioning using Sound Affective Quality Network and Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We live in a rich and varied acoustic world, which is experienced by individuals or communities as a soundscape. Computational auditory scene analysis, disentangling acoustic scenes by detecting and classifying events, focuses on objective attributes of sounds, such as their category and temporal characteristics, ignoring the effect of sounds on people and failing to explore the relationship between sounds and the emotions they evoke within a context. To fill this gap and to automate soundscape analysis, which traditionally relies on labour-intensive subjective ratings and surveys, we propose the soundscape captioning (SoundSCap) task. SoundSCap generates context-aware soundscape descriptions by capturing the acoustic scene, event information, and the corresponding human affective qualities. To this end, we propose an automatic soundscape captioner (SoundSCaper) composed of an acoustic model, SoundAQnet, and a general large language model (LLM). SoundAQnet simultaneously models multi-scale information about acoustic scenes, events, and perceived affective qualities, while LLM generates soundscape captions by parsing the information captured by SoundAQnet to a common language. The soundscape caption's quality is assessed by a jury of 16 audio/soundscape experts. The average score (out of 5) of SoundSCaper-generated captions is lower than the score of captions generated by two soundscape experts by 0.21 and 0.25, respectively, on the evaluation set and the model-unknown mixed external dataset with varying lengths and acoustic properties, but the differences are not statistically significant. Overall, SoundSCaper-generated captions show promising performance compared to captions annotated by soundscape experts. The models' code, LLM scripts, human assessment data and instructions, and expert evaluation statistics are all publicly available.</description>

      <title>Computational and Statistical Guarantees for Tensor-on-Tensor Regression with Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a tensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression model has been proposed to generalize tensor recovery, encompassing scenarios like scalar-on-tensor regression and tensor-on-vector regression. However, the exponential growth in tensor complexity poses challenges for storage and computation in ToT regression. To overcome this hurdle, tensor decompositions have been introduced, with the tensor train (TT)-based ToT model proving efficient in practice due to reduced memory requirements, enhanced computational efficiency, and decreased sampling complexity. Despite these practical benefits, a disparity exists between theoretical analysis and real-world performance. In this paper, we delve into the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the TT-based ToT regression model. Assuming the regression operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we conduct an error analysis for the solution to a constrained least-squares optimization problem. This analysis includes upper error bound and minimax lower bound, revealing that such error bounds polynomially depend on the order $N+M$. To efficiently find solutions meeting such error bounds, we propose two optimization algorithms: the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm (employing gradient descent with TT-singular value decomposition (TT-SVD)) and the factorization approach using the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) algorithm. When RIP is satisfied, spectral initialization facilitates proper initialization, and we establish the linear convergence rate of both IHT and RGD.</description>

Abstract: 6DMA (six-dimensional movable antenna) is a new and revolutionizing technology that fully exploits the wireless channel spatial variation at the transmitter/receiver by flexibly adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of distributed antennas/antenna surfaces (arrays). In this article, we provide an overview of 6DMA for unveiling its great potential in wireless networks, including its motivation and competitive advantages over existing technologies, system/channel modeling, and practical implementation. In particular, we present a variety of 6DMA-enabled performance enhancement in terms of array gain, spatial multiplexing, interference suppression, and geometric gain. Furthermore, we illustrate the main applications of 6DMA in wireless communication and sensing, and elaborate their design challenges as well as promising solutions. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the significant capacity improvement of 6DMA-aided communication in wireless network.</description>

Abstract: Non-autoregressive GAN-based neural vocoders are widely used due to their fast inference speed and high perceptual quality. However, they often suffer from audible artifacts such as tonal artifacts in their generated results. Therefore, we propose JenGAN, a new training strategy that involves stacking shifted low-pass filters to ensure the shift-equivariant property. This method helps prevent aliasing and reduce artifacts while preserving the model structure used during inference. In our experimental evaluation, JenGAN consistently enhances the performance of vocoder models, yielding significantly superior scores across the majority of evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>A Lora-Based and Maintenance-Free Cattle Monitoring System for Alpine Pastures and Remote Locations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) is boosting the proliferation of sensors and smart devices in industry and daily life. Continuous monitoring IoT systems are also finding applications in agriculture, particularly in the realm of smart farming. The adoption of wearable sensors to record the activity of livestock has garnered increasing interest. Such a device enables farmers to locate, monitor, and constantly assess the health status of their cattle more efficiently and effectively, even in challenging terrain and remote locations. This work presents a maintenance-free and robust smart sensing system that is capable of tracking cattle in remote locations and collecting activity parameters, such as the individual's grazing- and resting time. To support the paradigm of smart farming, the cattle tracker is capable of monitoring the cow's activity by analyzing data from an accelerometer, magnetometer, temperature sensor, and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) module, providing them over Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) to a backend server. By consuming 511.9 J per day with all subsystems enabled and a data transmission every 15 minutes, the custom-designed sensor node achieves a battery lifetime of 4 months. When exploiting the integrated solar energy harvesting subsystem, this can be even increased by 40% to up to 6 months. The final sensing system's robust operation is proven in a trial run with two cows on a pasture for over three days. Evaluations of the experimental results clearly show behavior patterns, which confirms the practicability of the proposed solution.</description>

Abstract: Assume that an interferer behaves according to a parametric model but one does not know the value of the model parameters. Sensing enables to improve the model knowledge and therefore perform a better link adaptation. However, we consider a half-duplex scenario where, at each time slot, the communication system should decide between sensing and communication. We thus propose to investigate the optimal policy to maximize the expected sum rate given a finite-time communication. % the following question therefore arises: At a given time slot, should one sense or communicate? We first show that this problem can be modelled in the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. We then demonstrate that the optimal open-loop and closed-loop policies can be found significantly faster than the standard backward-induction algorithm.</description>

      <title>Sample Rate Independent Recurrent Neural Networks for Audio Effects Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning approaches to modelling guitar amplifiers and effects pedals have been widely investigated and have become standard practice in some consumer products. In particular, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a popular choice for modelling non-linear devices such as vacuum tube amplifiers and distortion circuitry. One limitation of such models is that they are trained on audio at a specific sample rate and therefore give unreliable results when operating at another rate. Here, we investigate several methods of modifying RNN structures to make them approximately sample rate independent, with a focus on oversampling. In the case of integer oversampling, we demonstrate that a previously proposed delay-based approach provides high fidelity sample rate conversion whilst additionally reducing aliasing. For non-integer sample rate adjustment, we propose two novel methods and show that one of these, based on cubic Lagrange interpolation of a delay-line, provides a significant improvement over existing methods. To our knowledge, this work provides the first in-depth study into this problem.</description>

Abstract: Accurately predicting heart activity and other biological signals is crucial for diagnosis and monitoring. Given that speech is an outcome of multiple physiological systems, a significant body of work studied the acoustic correlates of heart activity. Recently, self-supervised models have excelled in speech-related tasks compared to traditional acoustic methods. However, the robustness of data-driven representations in predicting heart activity remained unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that self-supervised speech models outperform acoustic features in predicting heart activity parameters. We also emphasize the impact of individual variability on model generalizability. These findings underscore the value of data-driven representations in such tasks and the need for more speech-based physiological data to mitigate speaker-related challenges.</description>

      <title>Phase Retrieval for Radar Waveform Design</title>

Abstract: The ability of a radar to discriminate in both range and Doppler velocity is completely characterized by the ambiguity function (AF) of its transmit waveform. Mathematically, it is obtained by correlating the waveform with its Doppler-shifted and delayed replicas. We consider the inverse problem of designing a radar transmit waveform that satisfies the specified AF magnitude. This process may be viewed as a signal reconstruction with some variation of phase retrieval methods. We provide a trust-region algorithm that minimizes a smoothed non-convex least-squares objective function to iteratively recover the underlying signal-of-interest for either time- or band-limited support. The method first approximates the signal using an iterative spectral algorithm and then refines the attained initialization based on a sequence of gradient iterations. Our theoretical analysis shows that unique signal reconstruction is possible using signal samples no more than thrice the number of signal frequencies or time samples. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method recovers both time- and band-limited signals from sparsely and randomly sampled, noisy, and noiseless AFs.</description>

      <title>A Unified Multi-Task Semantic Communication System for Multimodal Data</title>

Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communications have achieved significant performance gains. However, the employed deep neural networks in semantic communications have to be updated when the task is changed or multiple models need to be stored for performing different tasks. To address this issue, we develop a unified deep learning-enabled semantic communication system (U-DeepSC), where a unified end-to-end framework can serve many different tasks with multiple modalities of data. As the number of required features varies from task to task, we propose a vector-wise dynamic scheme that can adjust the number of transmitted symbols for different tasks. Moreover, our dynamic scheme can also adaptively adjust the number of transmitted features under different channel conditions to optimize the transmission efficiency. Particularly, we devise a lightweight feature selection module (FSM) to evaluate the importance of feature vectors, which can hierarchically drop redundant feature vectors and significantly accelerate the inference. To reduce the transmission overhead, we then design a unified codebook for feature representation to serve multiple tasks, where only the indices of these task-specific features in the codebook are transmitted. According to the simulation results, the proposed U-DeepSC achieves comparable performance to the task-oriented semantic communication system designed for a specific task but with significant reduction in both transmission overhead and model size.</description>

      <title>IFF: A Super-resolution Algorithm for Multiple Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing one-dimensional point sources from their Fourier measurements in a bounded interval $[-\Omega, \Omega]$. This problem is known to be challenging in the regime where the spacing of the sources is below the Rayleigh length $\frac{\pi}{\Omega}$. In this paper, we propose a super-resolution algorithm, called Iterative Focusing-localization and Filtering (IFF), to resolve closely spaced point sources from their multiple measurements that are obtained by using multiple unknown illumination patterns. The new proposed algorithm has a distinct feature in that it reconstructs the point sources one by one in an iterative manner and hence requires no prior information about the source numbers. The new feature also allows for a subsampling strategy that can circumvent the computation of singular-value decomposition for large matrices as in the usual subspace methods. A theoretical analysis of the methods behind the algorithm is also provided. The derived results imply a phase transition phenomenon in the reconstruction of source locations which is confirmed in numerical experiments. Numerical results show that the algorithm can achieve a stable reconstruction for point sources with a minimum separation distance that is close to the theoretical limit. The algorithm can be generalized to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>JUMP: Joint communication and sensing with Unsynchronized transceivers Made Practical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07766v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wideband millimeter-wave communication systems can be extended to provide radar-like sensing capabilities on top of data communication, in a cost-effective manner. However, the development of joint communication and sensing technology is hindered by practical challenges, such as occlusions to the line-of-sight path and clock asynchrony between devices. The latter introduces time-varying timing and frequency offsets that prevent the estimation of sensing parameters and, in turn, the use of standard signal processing solutions. Existing approaches cannot be applied to commonly used phased-array receivers, as they build on stringent assumptions about the multipath environment, and are computationally complex. We present JUMP, the first system enabling practical bistatic and asynchronous joint communication and sensing, while achieving accurate target tracking and micro-Doppler extraction in realistic conditions. Our system compensates for the timing offset by exploiting the channel correlation across subsequent packets. Further, it tracks multipath reflections and eliminates frequency offsets by observing the phase of a dynamically-selected static reference path. JUMP has been implemented on a 60 GHz experimental platform, performing extensive evaluations of human motion sensing, including non-line-of-sight scenarios. In our results, JUMP attains comparable tracking performance to a full-duplex monostatic system and similar micro-Doppler quality with respect to a phase-locked bistatic receiver.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study on Fault Detection and Root Cause Analysis of Indium Tin Oxide Electrodes by Processing S-parameter Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of optoelectronics, indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes play a crucial role in various applications, such as displays, sensors, and solar cells. Effective fault diagnosis and root cause analysis of the ITO electrodes are essential to ensure the performance and reliability of the devices. However, traditional visual inspection is challenging with transparent ITO electrodes, and existing fault diagnosis methods have limitations in determining the root causes of the defects, often requiring destructive evaluations and secondary material characterization techniques. In this study, a fault diagnosis method with root cause analysis is proposed using scattering parameter (S-parameter) patterns, offering early detection, high diagnostic accuracy, and noise robustness. A comprehensive S-parameter pattern database is obtained according to various defect states of the ITO electrodes. Deep learning (DL) approaches, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and transformer, are then used to simultaneously analyze the cause and severity of defects. Notably, it is demonstrated that the diagnostic performance under additive noise levels can be significantly enhanced by combining different channels of the S-parameters as input to the learning algorithms, as confirmed through the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) dimension reduction visualization of the S-parameter patterns.</description>

      <title>Cuff-less Arterial Blood Pressure Waveform Synthesis from Single-site PPG using Transformer &amp; Frequency-domain Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and evaluate two novel purpose-built deep learning (DL) models for synthesis of the arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveform in a cuff-less manner, using a single-site photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. We train and evaluate our DL models on the data of 209 subjects from the public UCI dataset on cuff-less blood pressure (CLBP) estimation. Our transformer model consists of an encoder-decoder pair that incorporates positional encoding, multi-head attention, layer normalization, and dropout techniques for ABP waveform synthesis. Secondly, under our frequency-domain (FD) learning approach, we first obtain the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of the PPG and ABP signals, and then learn a linear/non-linear (L/NL) regression between them. The transformer model (FD L/NL model) synthesizes the ABP waveform with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.01 (4.23). Further, the synthesis of ABP waveform also allows us to estimate the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values. To this end, the transformer model reports an MAE of 3.77 mmHg and 2.69 mmHg, for SBP and DBP, respectively. On the other hand, the FD L/NL method reports an MAE of 4.37 mmHg and 3.91 mmHg, for SBP and DBP, respectively. Both methods fulfill the AAMI criterion. As for the BHS criterion, our transformer model (FD L/NL regression model) achieves grade A (grade B).</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Receive Beamforming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates signal estimation in wireless transmission (i.e., receive beamforming) from the perspective of statistical machine learning, where the transmit signals may be from an integrated sensing and communication system; that is, 1) signals may be not only discrete constellation points but also arbitrary complex values; 2) signals may be spatially correlated. Particular attention is paid to handling various uncertainties such as the uncertainty of the transmit signal covariance, the uncertainty of the channel matrix, the uncertainty of the channel noise covariance, the existence of channel impulse noises, and the limited sample size of pilots. To proceed, a distributionally robust machine learning framework that is insensitive to the above uncertainties is proposed, which reveals that channel estimation is not a necessary operation. For optimal linear estimation, the proposed framework includes several existing beamformers as special cases such as diagonal loading and eigenvalue thresholding. For optimal nonlinear estimation, estimators are limited in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and neural network function spaces, and corresponding uncertainty-aware solutions (e.g., kernelized diagonal loading) are derived. In addition, we prove that the ridge and kernel ridge regression methods in machine learning are distributionally robust against diagonal perturbation in feature covariance.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation and Beamforming for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a new advance and generalization of the RIS technique. BD-RIS breaks through the isolation between RIS elements by creatively introducing inter-element connections, thereby enabling smarter wave manipulation and enlarging coverage. However, exploring proper channel estimation schemes suitable for BD-RIS aided communication systems still remains an open problem. In this paper, we study channel estimation and beamforming design for BD-RIS aided multi-antenna systems. We first describe the channel estimation strategy based on the least square (LS) method, derive the mean square error (MSE) of the LS estimation, and formulate the joint pilot sequence and BD-RIS design problem with unique constraints induced by BD-RIS architectures. Specifically, we propose an efficient pilot sequence and BD-RIS design which theoretically guarantees to achieve the minimum MSE. With the estimated channel, we then consider two BD-RIS scenarios and propose beamforming design algorithms. Finally, we provide simulation results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation scheme and beamforming design algorithms. We also show that more interelement connections in BD-RIS improves the performance while increasing the training overhead for channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Batch and Recursive Least Squares for Matrix Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, batch least squares (BLS) and recursive least squares (RLS) are used for identification of a vector of parameters that form a linear model. In some situations, however, it is of interest to identify parameters in a matrix structure. In this case, a common approach is to transform the problem into standard vector form using the vectorization (vec) operator and the Kronecker product, known as vec-permutation. However, the use of the Kronecker product introduces extraneous zero terms in the regressor, resulting in unnecessary additional computational and space requirements. This work derives matrix BLS and RLS formulations which, under mild assumptions, minimize the same cost as the vec-permutation approach. This new approach requires less computational complexity and space complexity than vec-permutation in both BLS and RLS identification. It is also shown that persistent excitation guarantees convergence to the true matrix parameters. This method can used to improve computation time in the online identification of multiple-input, multiple-output systems for indirect adaptive model predictive control.</description>

      <title>Downlink Power Control based UE-Sided Initial Access for Tactical 5G NR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication technologies play a crucial role in battlefields. They are an inalienable part of any tactical response, whether at the battlefront or inland. Such scenarios require that the communication technologies be versatile, scalable, cost-effective, and stealthy. While multiple studies and past products have tried to address these requirements, none of them have been able to solve all the four challenges simultaneously. Hence, in this paper, we propose a tactical solution that is based on the versatile, scalable, and cost effective 5G NR system. Our focus is on the initial-access phase which is subject to a high probability of detection by an eavesdropper. To address this issue, we propose some modifications to how the UE performs initial access that lower the probability of detection while not affecting standards compliance and not requiring any modifications to the user equipment (UE) chipset implementation. Further, we demonstrate that with a simple downlink power control algorithm, we reduce the probability of detection at an eavesdropper. The result is a 5G NR based initial-access method that improves stealthiness when compared with a vanilla 5G NR implementation.</description>

      <title>On the Physical Layer Security of Visible Light Communications Empowered by Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visible light is a proper spectrum for secure wireless communications because of its high directivity and impermeability in indoor scenarios. However, if an eavesdropper is located very close to a legitimate receiver, secure communications become highly risky. In this paper, to further increase the level of security of visible light communication (VLC) and increase its resilience against to malicious attacks, we propose to capitalize on the recently synthesized gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with chiroptical properties for circularly polarized light resulting the phase retardation that interacts with the linear polarizer angle. GNP plates made by judiciously stacking many GNPs perform as physical secret keys. Transmitters send both the intended symbol and artificial noise to exploit the channel variation effect by the GNP plates, which is highly effective when an eavesdropper is closely located to the legitimate receiver. A new VLC channel model is first developed by representing the effect of GNP plates and linear polarizers in the circular polarization domain. Based on the new channel model, the angles of linear polarizers at the transmitters and legitimate receiver are optimized considering the effect of GNP plates to increase the secrecy rate in wiretapping scenarios. Simulations verify that when the transmitters are equipped with GNP plates, even if the eavesdropper is located right next to the legitimate receiver, insightful results on the physical layer security metrics are gained as follows: 1) the secrecy rate is significantly improved and 2) the symbol error rate gap between the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper becomes much larger due to the chiroptical properties of GNP plates.</description>

      <title>A New Class of Path-Following Method for Time-Varying Optimization with Optimal Parametric Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a formulation of nonlinear constrained optimization problems.
  We reformulate it as a time-varying optimization using continuous-time parametric functions
  and derive a dynamical system for tracking the optimal solution.
  We then re-parameterize the dynamical system to express it based on a linear combination of the parametric functions.
  Calculus of variations is applied to optimize the parametric functions, 
  so that the optimality distance of the solution is minimized. 
  Accordingly, an iterative dynamic algorithm, named as OP-TVO,
  is devised to find the solution with an efficient convergence rate.
  We benchmark the performance of the proposed algorithm with the prediction-correction method (PCM)
  from the optimality and computational complexity point-of-views.
  The results show that OP-TVO can compete with PCM
  for the optimization problem of interest,
  which indicates it can be a promising approach to replace PCM for some time-varying optimization problems.
  Furthermore, this work provides a novel paradigm for solving parametric dynamical system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust approach for a visual parallel tracking and mapping (PTAM) system that excels in challenging environments. Our proposed method combines the strengths of heterogeneous multi-modal visual sensors, including stereo event-based and frame-based sensors, in a unified reference frame through a novel spatio-temporal synchronization of stereo visual frames and stereo event streams. We employ deep learning-based feature extraction and description for estimation to enhance robustness further. We also introduce an end-to-end parallel tracking and mapping optimization layer complemented by a simple loop-closure algorithm for efficient SLAM behavior. Through comprehensive experiments on both small-scale and large-scale real-world sequences of VECtor and TUM-VIE benchmarks, our proposed method (DH-PTAM) demonstrates superior performance in terms of robustness and accuracy in adverse conditions, especially in large-scale HDR scenarios. Our implementation's research-based Python API is publicly available on GitHub for further research and development: https://github.com/AbanobSoliman/DH-PTAM.</description>

      <title>Beat Pilot Tone (BPT): Simultaneous MR Imaging and RF Motion Sensing at Arbitrary Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To introduce a simple system exploitation with the potential to turn MRI scanners into general-purpose RF motion monitoring systems.
  Methods: Inspired by Pilot Tone (PT), this work proposes Beat Pilot Tone (BPT), in which two or more RF tones at arbitrary frequencies are transmitted continuously during the scan. These tones create motion-modulated standing wave patterns that are sensed by the receiver coil array, incidentally mixed by intermodulation in the receiver chain, and digitized simultaneously with the MRI data. BPT can operate at almost any frequency as long as the intermodulation products lie within the bandwidth of the receivers. BPT's mechanism is explained in electromagnetic simulations and validated experimentally.
  Results: Phantom and volunteer experiments over a range of transmit frequencies suggest that BPT may offer frequency-dependent sensitivity to motion. Using a semi-flexible body receiver array, BPT appears to sense cardiac-induced body vibrations at microwave frequencies (1.2 GHz and greater). At lower frequencies, it exhibits a similar cardiac signal shape to PT, likely due to blood volume changes.
  Other volunteer experiments with respiratory, bulk, and head motion show that BPT can achieve greater sensitivity to motion than PT and greater separability between motion types. Basic multiple-input multiple-output (4x22 MIMO) operation with simultaneous PT and BPT in head motion is demonstrated using two transmit antennas and a 22-channel head-neck coil.
  Conclusion: BPT may offer a rich source of motion information that is frequency-dependent, simultaneous, and complementary to PT and the MRI exam.</description>

      <title>Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelation are used in communications and remote sensing for synchronization and ranging. The autocorrelation demerit factor of a sequence is the sum of the squared magnitudes of its autocorrelation values at every nonzero shift when we normalize the sequence to have unit Euclidean length. The merit factor, introduced by Golay, is the reciprocal of the demerit factor. We consider the uniform probability measure on the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of the demerit factors of these sequences. Sarwate and Jedwab have respectively calculated the mean and variance of this distribution. We develop new combinatorial techniques to calculate the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor for binary sequences of length $\ell$. These techniques prove that for $p\geq 2$ and $\ell \geq 4$, all the central moments are strictly positive. For any given $p$, one may use the technique to obtain an exact formula for the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor as a function of the length $\ell$. Jedwab's formula for variance is confirmed by our technique with a short calculation, and we go beyond previous results by also deriving an exact formula for the skewness. A computer-assisted application of our method also obtains exact formulas for the kurtosis, which we report here, as well as the fifth central moment.</description>

      <title>The Perception-Robustness Tradeoff in Deterministic Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09253v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of deterministic methods for solving inverse problems in imaging. These methods are commonly designed to achieve two goals: (1) attaining high perceptual quality, and (2) generating reconstructions that are consistent with the measurements. We provide a rigorous proof that the better a predictor satisfies these two requirements, the larger its Lipschitz constant must be, regardless of the nature of the degradation involved. In particular, to approach perfect perceptual quality and perfect consistency, the Lipschitz constant of the model must grow to infinity. This implies that such methods are necessarily more susceptible to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate our theory on single image super-resolution algorithms, addressing both noisy and noiseless settings. We also show how this undesired behavior can be leveraged to explore the posterior distribution, thereby allowing the deterministic model to imitate stochastic methods.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient STAR-RIS Enhanced UAV-Enabled MEC Networks with Bi-Directional Task Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-user mobile edge computing (MEC) scheme facilitated by the simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Unlike existing MEC approaches, the proposed scheme enables bidirectional offloading, allowing users to concurrently offload tasks to the MEC servers located at the ground base station (BS) and UAV with STAR-RIS support. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem aiming at maximizing the energy efficiency of the system while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) constraints by jointly optimizing the resource allocation, user scheduling, passive beamforming of the STAR-RIS, and the UAV trajectory. A block coordinate descent (BCD) iterative algorithm designed with the Dinkelbach's algorithm and the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is proposed to effectively handle the formulated non-convex optimization problem with significant coupling among variables. Simulation results indicate that the proposed STAR-RIS enhanced UAV-enabled MEC scheme possesses significant advantages in enhancing the system energy efficiency over other baseline schemes including the conventional RIS-aided scheme.</description>

      <title>Quantized Approximately Orthogonal Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Orthogonal Recurrent Neural Networks (ORNNs) have gained popularity due to their ability to manage tasks involving long-term dependencies, such as the copy-task, and their linear complexity. However, existing ORNNs utilize full precision weights and activations, which prevents their deployment on compact devices.In this paper, we explore the quantization of the weight matrices in ORNNs, leading to Quantized approximately Orthogonal RNNs (QORNNs). The construction of such networks remained an open problem, acknowledged for its inherent instability. We propose and investigate two strategies to learn QORNN  by combining  quantization-aware training (QAT) and orthogonal projections. We also study  post-training quantization of the activations for pure integer computation of the recurrent loop. The most efficient models achieve results similar to state-of-the-art full-precision ORNN, LSTM and FastRNN on a variety of standard benchmarks, even with 4-bits quantization.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Problems with Model Mismatch using Untrained Neural Networks within Model-based Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based deep learning methods such as loop unrolling (LU) and deep equilibrium model}(DEQ) extensions offer outstanding performance in solving inverse problems (IP). These methods unroll the optimization iterations into a sequence of neural networks that in effect learn a regularization function from data. While these architectures are currently state-of-the-art in numerous applications, their success heavily relies on the accuracy of the forward model. This assumption can be limiting in many physical applications due to model simplifications or uncertainties in the apparatus. To address forward model mismatch, we introduce an untrained forward model residual block within the model-based architecture to match the data consistency in the measurement domain for each instance. We propose two variants in well-known model-based architectures (LU and DEQ) and prove convergence under mild conditions. Our approach offers a unified solution that is less parameter-sensitive, requires no additional data, and enables simultaneous fitting of the forward model and reconstruction in a single pass, benefiting both linear and nonlinear inverse problems. The experiments show significant quality improvement in removing artifacts and preserving details across three distinct applications, encompassing both linear and nonlinear inverse problems. Moreover, we highlight reconstruction effectiveness in intermediate steps and showcase robustness to random initialization of the residual block and a higher number of iterations during evaluation.

      <title>Synthetic training set generation using text-to-audio models for environmental sound classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past few years, text-to-audio models have emerged as a significant advancement in automatic audio generation. Although they represent impressive technological progress, the effectiveness of their use in the development of audio applications remains uncertain. This paper aims to investigate these aspects, specifically focusing on the task of classification of environmental sounds. This study analyzes the performance of two different environmental classification systems when data generated from text-to-audio models is used for training. Two cases are considered: a) when the training dataset is augmented by data coming from two different text-to-audio models; and b) when the training dataset consists solely of synthetic audio generated. In both cases, the performance of the classification task is tested on real data. Results indicate that text-to-audio models are effective for dataset augmentation, whereas the performance of the models drops when relying on only generated audio.</description>

      <title>A transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets with application to signal recovery from the second moment and cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-algebraic priors are ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning. Prevalent examples include a) linear models where the signal lies in a low-dimensional subspace; b) sparse models where the signal can be represented by only a few coefficients under a suitable basis; and c) a large family of neural network generative models. In this paper, we prove a transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets in orthogonal or unitary representations of groups: with a suitable dimension bound, a generic translate of any semi-algebraic set is transverse to the orbits of the group action. This, in turn, implies that if a signal lies in a low-dimensional semi-algebraic set, then it can be recovered uniquely from measurements that separate orbits.
  As an application, we consider the implications of the transversality theorem to the problem of recovering signals that are translated by random group actions from their second moment. As a special case, we discuss cryo-EM: a leading technology to constitute the spatial structure of biological molecules, which serves as our prime motivation. In particular, we derive explicit bounds for recovering a molecular structure from the second moment under a semi-algebraic prior and deduce information-theoretic implications. We also obtain information-theoretic bounds for three additional applications: factoring Gram matrices, multi-reference alignment, and phase retrieval. Finally, we deduce bounds for designing permutation invariant separators in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Channel Reciprocity Based Attack Detection for Securing UWB Ranging by Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of ranging threats represented by Ghost Peak attack have raised concerns regarding the security performance of Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) systems with the finalization of the IEEE 802.15.4z standard. Based on channel reciprocity, this paper proposes a low complexity attack detection scheme that compares Channel Impulse Response (CIR) features of both ranging sides utilizing an autoencoder with the capability of data compression and feature extraction. Taking Ghost Peak attack as an example, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness, feasibility and generalizability of the proposed attack detection scheme through simulation and experimental validation. The proposed scheme achieves an attack detection success rate of over 99% and can be implemented in current systems at low cost.</description>

      <title>Singing Voice Graph Modeling for SingFake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting singing voice deepfakes, or SingFake, involves determining the authenticity and copyright of a singing voice. Existing models for speech deepfake detection have struggled to adapt to unseen attacks in this unique singing voice domain of human vocalization. To bridge the gap, we present a groundbreaking SingGraph model. The model synergizes the capabilities of the MERT acoustic music understanding model for pitch and rhythm analysis with the wav2vec2.0 model for linguistic analysis of lyrics. Additionally, we advocate for using RawBoost and beat matching techniques grounded in music domain knowledge for singing voice augmentation, thereby enhancing SingFake detection performance. Our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results within the SingFake dataset, surpassing the previous SOTA model across three distinct scenarios: it improves EER relatively for seen singers by 13.2%, for unseen singers by 24.3%, and unseen singers using different codecs by 37.1%.</description>

      <title>Compressible Dynamics in Deep Overparameterized Low-Rank Learning &amp; Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While overparameterization in machine learning models offers great benefits in terms of optimization and generalization, it also leads to increased computational requirements as model sizes grow. In this work, we show that by leveraging the inherent low-dimensional structures of data and compressible dynamics within the model parameters, we can reap the benefits of overparameterization without the computational burdens. In practice, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for deep low-rank matrix completion as well as fine-tuning language models. Our approach is grounded in theoretical findings for deep overparameterized low-rank matrix recovery, where we show that the learning dynamics of each weight matrix are confined to an invariant low-dimensional subspace. Consequently, we can construct and train compact, highly compressed factorizations possessing the same benefits as their overparameterized counterparts. In the context of deep matrix completion, our technique substantially improves training efficiency while retaining the advantages of overparameterization. For language model fine-tuning, we propose a method called "Deep LoRA", which improves the existing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique, leading to reduced overfitting and a simplified hyperparameter setup, while maintaining comparable efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of Deep LoRA on natural language tasks, particularly when fine-tuning with limited data.
