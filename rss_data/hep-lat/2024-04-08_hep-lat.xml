      <title>Investigating two-dimensional adjoint QCD on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our investigations of SU($N$) adjoint QCD in two dimensions with one Majorana fermion on the lattice. We determine the relevant parameter range for the simulations with Wilson fermions and present results for Polyakov loop, chiral condensate, and string tension. In the theory with massive fermions, all observables we checked show qualitative agreement between numerical lattice data and theory, while the massless limit is more subtle since chiral and non-invertible symmetry of the continuum theory are explicitly broken by lattice regularization. In thermal compactification, we observe $N$ perturbative vacua for the holonomy potential at high-$T$ with instanton events connecting them, and a unique vacuum at low-$T$. At finite-$N$, this is a cross-over and it turns to a phase transition at large-$N$ thermodynamic limit. In circle compactification with periodic boundary conditions, we observe a unique center-symmetric minimum at any radius. In continuum, the instantons in the thermal case carry zero modes (for even $N$) and indeed, in the lattice simulations, we observe that chiral condensate is dominated by instanton centers, where zero modes are localized. We present lattice results on the issue of confinement vs. screening in the theory and comment on the roles of chiral symmetry and non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Flavor and Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parisi-Sourlas approach to supersymmetry implies that, in spacetime dimensions greater than 1, there is a constraint on the minimal number of flavors, in order for a field theory to define a closed system. In particular, this number is greater than 1. This does not preclude that supersymmetry can be broken, however, and the known ways of breaking supersymmetry can be taken into account from this point of view, by using the so-called Nicolai map. This procedure is well-defined for abelian gauge theories and corresponds to the construction of the so-called trivializing maps for non-abelian gauge theories, that is, still, work in progress.</description>

      <title>Vacuum correlations of the stress-energy-momentum tensor with constituent quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two point correlation function of the stress-energy-momentum tensor describes the propagation of a space-time "micro-earthquake" in the vacuum. In the framework of the path integral formulation of field theory in curved space-time, we derive the Ward-Takashi identity for two-point Green's function of the stress-energy-momentum tensor for a general case of a non-conformal theory. The identity constrains the longitudinal part of the correlator, with the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy-momentum, non-zero in a non-conformal theory. The obtained formula is demonstrated on the free massive Dirac fermion theory, treated at the one-loop level. This example befits a class of phenomenological chiral quarks models which have been used successfully in numerous applications in the soft non-perturbative regime of strong interactions. We discuss the constraints following from the Ward-Takahashi identity for the correlation functions in these models. We also show how the temporal representation of the two-point correlators, which is an object amenable to lattice QCD, displays an expected exponential fall-off.</description>

      <title>AdS/CFT Correspondence in Hyperbolic Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence1-3, also known as the gravity/gauge duality, posits a dual relationship between the quantum gravity in an AdS spacetime and the CFT defined on its lower-dimensional boundary. This correspondence not only offers profound insights into the enigmatic nature of quantum gravity but also shows mighty power in addressing strongly-correlated systems. However, despite its importance in contemporary physics, the AdS/CFT correspondence remains a conjecture, and further experimental investigation is highly sought after. Here, we present the first experimental exploration of this conjecture by testing its core corollary: the leading-order effects of a strongly-coupled CFT can be exactly described by a weakly-coupled classical field in a higher-dimensional AdS spacetime. Through measuring the bulk entanglement entropy (BEE) and boundary-boundary correlation function (BBCF) of scalar fields in both conventional type-I and previously overlooked type-II hyperbolic lattices, serving as the discretized regularizations of spatial geometries of pure AdS2+1 spacetime and AdS2+1 black hole, respectively, we experimentally confirm that BEE exhibits a logarithmic scaling with the subsystem size, following the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula, while BBCF showcases an exponential law dependence on the boundary separation, the scaling dimension of which conforms to the Klebanov-Witten (KW) relation, both of which align remarkably well with the established CFT outcomes. This heuristic experimental effort opens a new avenue for in-depth investigations on the gravity/gauge duality and extensive exploration of quantum-gravity-inspired phenomena in classical systems.</description>

      <title>Simplified algorithm for the Worldvolume HMC and the Generalized-thimble HMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10663v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo method (WV-HMC method) [arXiv:2012.08468] is a reliable and versatile algorithm towards solving the sign problem. Similarly to the tempered Lefschetz thimble method, this method removes the ergodicity problem inherent in algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. In addition to this advantage, the WV-HMC method significantly reduces the computational cost because one needs not compute the Jacobian of deformation in generating configurations. A crucial step in this method is the RATTLE algorithm, where the Newton method is used at each molecular dynamics step to project a transported configuration onto a submanifold (worldvolume) in the complex space. In this paper, we simplify the RATTLE algorithm by employing a simplified Newton method (the fixed-point method) along with iterative solvers for orthogonal decompositions of vectors, and show that this algorithm further reduces the computational cost. We also apply this algorithm to the HMC algorithm for the generalized thimble method (GT-HMC method). We perform a numerical test for the convergence of the simplified RATTLE algorithm, and show that the convergence depends on the system size only weakly. The application of this simplified algorithm to various models will be reported in subsequent papers.</description>

      <title>Lattice investigations of the chimera baryon spectrum in the Sp(4) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results of lattice numerical studies of the Sp(4) gauge theory coupled to fermions (hyperquarks) transforming in the fundamental and two-index antisymmetric representations of the gauge group. This strongly-coupled theory is the minimal candidate for the ultraviolet completion of composite Higgs models that facilitate the mechanism of partial compositeness for generating the top-quark mass. We measure the spectrum of the low-lying, half-integer spin, bound states composed of two fundamental and one antisymmetric hyperquarks, dubbed chimera baryons, in the quenched approximation. In this first systematic, non-perturbative study, we focus on the three lightest parity-even chimera-baryon states, in analogy with QCD, denoted as $\Lambda_{\rm CB}$, $\Sigma_{\rm CB}$ (both with spin 1/2), and $\Sigma_{\rm CB}^\ast$(with spin 3/2). The spin-1/2 such states are candidates of the top partners. The extrapolation of our results to the continuum and massless-hyperquark limit is performed using formulae inspired by QCD heavy-baryon Wilson chiral perturbation theory. Within the range of hyperquark masses in our simulations, we find that $\Sigma_{\mathrm{CB}}$ is not heavier than $\Lambda_{\mathrm{CB}}$.</description>

      <title>Lattice realization of the axial $U(1)$ noninvertible symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01331v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory with compact $U(1)$ variables, we construct the symmetry operator, i.e.\ the topological defect, for the axial $U(1)$ noninvertible symmetry. This requires a lattice formulation of chiral gauge theory with an anomalous matter content and we employ the lattice formulation on the basis of the Ginsparg--Wilson relation. The invariance of the symmetry operator under the gauge transformation of the gauge field on the defect is realized, imitating the prescription by Karasik in continuum theory, by integrating the lattice Chern--Simons term on the defect over \emph{smooth\/} lattice gauge transformations. The projection operator for allowed magnetic fluxes on the defect then emerges with lattice regularization. The resulting symmetry operator is manifestly invariant under lattice gauge transformations. In an appendix, we give another way of constructing the symmetry operator on the basis of a 3D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological quantum field theory, the level-$N$ BF theory on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Real Time Quarkonium Transport Coefficients in Open Quantum Systems from Euclidean QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent open quantum system studies showed that quarkonium time evolution inside the quark-gluon plasma is determined by transport coefficients that are defined in terms of a gauge invariant correlator of two chromoelectric field operators connected by an adjoint Wilson line. We study the Euclidean version of the correlator for quarkonium evolution and discuss the extraction of the transport coefficients from this Euclidean correlator, highlighting its difference from other problems that also require reconstructing a spectral function, such as the calculation of the heavy quark diffusion coefficient. Along the way, we explain why the transport coefficient $\gamma_{\rm adj}$ differs from $\gamma_{\rm fund}$ at finite temperature at $\mathcal{O}(g^4)$, in spite of the fact that their corresponding spectral functions differ only by a temperature-independent term at the same order. We then discuss how to evaluate the Euclidean correlator via lattice QCD methods, with a focus on reducing the uncertainty caused by infrared renormalons in determining the renormalization factor nonperturbatively.</description>
