      <title>Discrete Painlev\'e equations from pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$ with branching generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the novel approach to discrete Painlev\'e equations initiated in our previous work [2]. A classification scheme for discrete Painlev\'e equations proposed by Sakai interprets them as birational isomorphisms between generalized Halphen surfaces (surfaces obtained from $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$ by blowing up at eight points). Sakai's classification is thus based on the classification of generalized Halphen surfaces. In our scheme, the family of generalized Halphen surfaces is replaced by a pencil of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$. A discrete Painlev\'e equation is viewed as an autonomous transformation of $\mathbb P^3$ that preserves the pencil and maps each quadric of the pencil to a different one. Thus, our scheme is based on the classification of pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$. Compared to our previous work, here we consider a technically more demanding case where the characteristic polynomial $\Delta(\lambda)$ of the pencil of quadrics is not a complete square. As a consequence, traversing the pencil via a 3D Painlev\'e map corresponds to a translation on the universal cover of the Riemann surface of $\sqrt{\Delta(\lambda)}$, rather than to a M\"obius transformation of the pencil parameter $\lambda$ as in [2].</description>

      <title>Bound excited states of Fr\"ohlich polarons in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional Fr\"ohlich model describing the motion of a single electron interacting with optical phonons is a paradigmatic model of quantum many-body physics. We predict the existence of an arbitrarily large number of bound excited states in the strong coupling limit and calculate their excitation energies. Numerical simulations of a discretized model demonstrate the complete amelioration of the projector Monte Carlo sign problem by walker annihilation in an infinite Hilbert space. They reveal the threshold for the occurrence of the first bound excited states at a value of $\alpha \approx 1.73$ for the dimensionless coupling constant. This puts the threshold into the regime of intermediate interaction strength. We calculate the spectral weight and the number density of the dressing cloud in the discretized model.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the D'Alembertian by the Poincar\'e Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many physical models are described by partial differential equations and the most important mathematical structure of the equations is governed by the corresponding linear partial differential operators. Those linear partial differential operators are sometimes determined by the symmetry under the group of motion. In this paper, the d'Alembertian is shown to be characterized as the only linear partial differential operator of the second order that is invariant under the Poincar\'e group and dilations in the Minkowski space-time $\mathbb R\times\mathbb R^n$. The method of proof depends on the analysis of the invariance of the corresponding polynomial in space-time under the time reflections and space rotations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the theory of spinor fields written in polar form and we re-express it in terms of the so-called $1\!+\!1\!+\!2$ covariant splitting: after this is done for the basic kinematic variables, we proceed to decompose the dynamical equations, both for the case of the Dirac differential field equations and for the case of the energy density tensor. As an explicit example of a real physical application we deal with the hydrogen atom. Comments are addressed in the end.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning on Multi-Dimensional Data: A Novel Approach to Neural Network-Based Surrogate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12241v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of efficient surrogates for partial differential equations (PDEs) is a critical step towards scalable modeling of complex, multiscale systems-of-systems. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained popularity as the basis for such surrogate models due to their success in capturing high-dimensional input-output mappings and the negligible cost of a forward pass. However, the high cost of generating training data -- typically via classical numerical solvers -- raises the question of whether these models are worth pursuing over more straightforward alternatives with well-established theoretical foundations, such as Monte Carlo methods. To reduce the cost of data generation, we propose training a CNN surrogate model on a mixture of numerical solutions to both the $d$-dimensional problem and its ($d-1$)-dimensional approximation, taking advantage of the efficiency savings guaranteed by the curse of dimensionality. We demonstrate our approach on a multiphase flow test problem, using transfer learning to train a dense fully-convolutional encoder-decoder CNN on the two classes of data. Numerical results from a sample uncertainty quantification task demonstrate that our surrogate model outperforms Monte Carlo with several times the data generation budget.</description>

      <title>Hadrons in group expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various approximate symmetries exist in nature. For example, the flavor $SU(4)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange/charm$ quarks is severely broken, the flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange$ quarks is moderately broken, and the isospin $SU(2)$ symmetry involving the $up/down$ quarks is slightly broken. These broken symmetries are primarily governed by the strong interaction, making them an ideal platform for investigating the general behavior of approximate symmetries. To explore the application of the flavor $SU(4)$ group to ground-state baryons, we systematically calculate the transition matrices associated with various flavor $SU(4)$ representations as well as the matrices that describe their connections. These matrices are then employed to analyze the mass spectrum of ground-state baryons. Our results indicate that these states can be described as mixtures of various flavor representations, such as $\Sigma_c/\Xi_c^\prime/\Omega_c \sim \mathbf{20_M} \oplus \mathbf{20_S}\oplus \mathbf{\bar{4}_A}~[SU(4)]$, $\Xi_c/\Xi_c^\prime \sim \mathbf{\bar 3_A} \oplus \mathbf{6_S}~[SU(3)]$, $\Lambda^0/\Sigma^0 \sim \mathbf{1_A} \oplus \mathbf{3_S}~[SU(2)]$, where the subscripts $\mathbf{S}$, $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{M}$ denote the symmetric, antisymmetric, and mixed flavor wave functions, respectively. Our results also indicate that the flavor symmetries, as they break, necessitate the mixing of these flavor representations according to specific rules.</description>

      <title>2D Entanglement from a Single Motzkin Spaghetto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While highly entangled ground states of gapless local Hamiltonians have been known to exist in one dimension, their 2D counterparts were only recently found, with rather sophisticated interactions involving at least 4 neighboring degrees of freedom. In this letter, a 2D lattice system interacting only between two nearest neighboring sites is proposed, which has a unique ground state with volume scaling of entanglement entropy. The system undergoes an entanglement phase transition with enhanced entanglement entropy at the critical point compared to the previous construction from coupling orthogonal arrays of one-dimensional chains, but the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase decays faster. A tensor network representation is composed of tensors with lower rank, and has a similar global geometry.</description>

      <title>Universal Bound on the Eigenvalues of 2-Positive Trace-Preserving Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on the trace of any 2-positive, trace-preserving map in terms of its smallest eigenvalue. We show that this spectral bound is tight, and that 2-positivity is necessary for this inequality to hold in general. Moreover, we use this to infer a similar bound for generators of one-parameter semigroups of 2-positive trace-preserving maps. With this approach we generalize known results for completely positive trace-preserving dynamics while providing a significantly simpler proof that is entirely algebraic.</description>

      <title>On the Discontinuous Breaking of Replica Symmetry and Shattering in Mean-Field Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in mean-field spin glasses, a discontinuous breaking of replica symmetry at the critical inverse temperature $\beta_c$ implies the existence of an intermediate shattered phase. This confirms a prediction from physics regarding the nature of random first order phase transitions. On the other hand, we give an example of a spherical spin glass which exhibits shattering, yet the transition is continuous at $\beta_c$.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetries in twisted eleven-dimensional supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In supersymmetric theories, protected quantities can be reorganized into holomorphic-topological theories by twisting. Recently, it was observed by \cite{JKY} that residual super-Poincar\'e symmetries in certain twisted theories can receive higher corrections, turning them into $L_\infty$ algebras with non-strict actions on the twisted fields. In this note, we show that the same phenomenon occurs for the two admissible twists of eleven-dimensional supergravity. Along the way, we discuss in detail the connection between components of physical and twisted fields.</description>

      <title>Period matrices and homological quasi-trees on discrete Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study discrete period matrices associated with graphs cellularly embedded on closed surfaces, resembling classical period matrices of Riemann surfaces. Defined via integrals of discrete harmonic 1-forms, these period matrices are known to encode discrete conformal structure in the sense of circle patterns. We obtain a combinatorial interpretation of the discrete period matrix, where its minors correspond to weighted sums over certain spanning subgraphs, which we call homological quasi-trees. Furthermore, we relate the period matrix to the determinant of the Laplacian for a flat complex line bundle. We derive a combinatorial analogue of the Weil-Petersson potential on Teichm\"uller space, expressed as a weighted sum over homological quasi-trees. Finally, we prove that the collection of homological quasi-trees form a delta-matroid. The discrete period matrix plays a role similar to that of the response matrix in circular planar networks, thereby addressing a question posed by Richard Kenyon.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Probabilistic Dirichlet-to-Neumann Maps on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps enable the coupling of multiphysics simulations across computational subdomains by ensuring continuity of state variables and fluxes at artificial interfaces. We present a novel method for learning Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on graphs using Gaussian processes, specifically for problems where the data obey a conservation constraint from an underlying partial differential equation. Our approach combines discrete exterior calculus and nonlinear optimal recovery to infer relationships between vertex and edge values. This framework yields data-driven predictions with uncertainty quantification across the entire graph, even when observations are limited to a subset of vertices and edges. By optimizing over the reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm while applying a maximum likelihood estimation penalty on kernel complexity, our method ensures that the resulting surrogate strictly enforces conservation laws without overfitting. We demonstrate our method on two representative applications: subsurface fracture networks and arterial blood flow. Our results show that the method maintains high accuracy and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates even under severe data scarcity, highlighting its potential for scientific applications where limited data and reliable uncertainty quantification are critical.</description>

      <title>Identification of gapless phases by squaring a twist operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general necessary condition for a spin chain with SO(3) spin-rotation symmetry to be gapped. Specifically, we prove that the ground state(s) of an SO(3)-symmetric gapped spin chain must be spin singlet(s), and the expectation value of the square of a twist operator asymptotically approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit, where finite-size corrections are inversely proportional to the square root of the system size. This theorem provides (i) supporting evidence for various conjectured gapped phases, and (ii) a sufficient criterion for identifying gapless spin chains. We verify our theorem by numerical simulations for a variety of spin models and show that it offers a novel efficient way to identify gapless phases in spin chains with spin-rotation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Spin refinement of moduli spaces of residueless meromorphic differentials and the BKP hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider strata of curves carrying a residueless meromorphic differential inducing a spin structure on the curve. The cohomology classes of the closures of these strata, weighted by the parity of the spin structures, form a partial cohomological field theory (CohFT) of infinite rank. After applying the DR hierarchy construction to this partial CohFT and reducing to differentials with two zeros and arbitrarily many poles, we show that the resulting system of evolutionary PDEs coincides with the BKP hierarchy up to a coordinate transformation. This is a spin refinement of an analogous result from arXiv:2110.01419. Our proof relies on a new result regarding the reconstruction of the BKP hierarchy from a limited amount of information in the Lax formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability to quantitatively distinguish quantum states is of great importance for a variety of tasks, and has recently played an important role in the study of quantum reduced dynamics and their characterization in terms of memory effects. A crucial property of quantum distinguishability quantifiers considered in the latter framework is the contractivity under the action of completely positive trace-preserving maps. We show that this requirement warrants that the pairs on which these quantifiers attain their maximal value are pairs of orthogonal, and in this sense classical, states.</description>

Abstract: Integrating microbial activity into underground hydrogen storage models is crucial for simulating long-term reservoir behavior. In this work, we present a coupled framework that incorporates bio-geochemical reactions and compositional flow models within the Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST). Microbial growth and decay are modeled using a double Monod formulation, with populations influenced by hydrogen and carbon dioxide availability. First, a refined Equation of State (EoS) is employed to accurately capture hydrogen dissolution, thereby improving phase behavior and modeling of microbial activity. The model is then discretized using a cell-centered finite-volume method with implicit Euler time discretization. A fully coupled fully implicit strategy is considered. Our implementation builds upon MRST's compositional module by incorporating the S{\o}reide-Whitson EoS, microbial reaction kinetics, and specific effects such as bio-clogging and molecular diffusion. Through a series of 1D, 2D and 3D simulations, we analyze the effects of microbial-induced bio-geochemical transformations on underground hydrogen storage in porous media.These results highlight that accounting for bio-geochemical effects can substantially impact hydrogen loss, purity, and overall storage performance.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=1$ Jackiw -Teitelboim supergravity beyond the Schwarzian regime</title>

Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic symmetry structure of two--dimensional dilaton gravity in its $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric extension based on the $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ Lie superalgebra. Within the BF theoretical framework, we analyze affine and superconformal boundary conditions for each case and systematically derive the associated asymptotic symmetry algebras. While the classical theory recovers the Virasoro algebra or its affine enhancement, the supersymmetric extension yields a classical $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal algebra, subject to dynamical symmetry breaking mechanisms induced by the dilaton supermultiplet. We find that the boundary behavior of the dilaton not only leads to a reduction of the full affine $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)_k$ symmetry down to $\tt{O} \tt{S} p(1|2)$, but also introduces an abelian extension through commuting modes. These results reveal a novel interplay between symmetry breaking and symmetry extension in low-dimensional supergravity. Our construction generalizes previous analyses of $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ dilaton gravity to the supersymmetric domain and offers a consistent foundation for investigating boundary dynamics beyond the Schwarzian regime.</description>

      <title>Generalized cones admitting a curvature-dimension condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study (generalized) cones over metric spaces, both in Riemannian and Lorentzian signature. In particular, we establish synthetic lower Ricci curvature bounds \`a la Lott-Villani-Sturm and Ohta in the metric measure case, and \`a la Cavalletti-Mondino in Lorentzian signature. Here, a generalized cone is a warped product of a one-dimensional base space, which will be positive or negative definite, over a fiber that is a metric space. We prove that Riemannian or Lorentzian generalized cones over $\mathsf{CD}$-spaces satisfy the (timelike) measure contraction property $\mathsf{(T)MCP}$ - a weaker version of a (timelike) curvature-dimension condition $\mathsf{(T)CD}$. Conversely, if the generalized cone is a $\mathsf{(T)CD}$-space, then the fiber is a $\mathsf{CD}$-space with the appropriate bounds on Ricci curvature and dimension. In proving these results we develop a novel and powerful two-dimensional localization technique, which we expect to be interesting in its own right and useful in other circumstances. We conclude by giving several applications including synthetic singularity and splitting theorems for generalized cones. The final application is that we propose a new definition for lower curvature bounds for metric and metric measure spaces via lower curvature bounds for generalized cones over the given space.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum phase estimation with $q$-deformed nonideal nonclassical light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum phase estimation in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer using q-deformed photon states, including q-coherent and q-cat states, which model realistic deviations from ideal light sources. By deriving closed-form photon count likelihoods via the Jordan-Schwinger mapping, we compute the quantum and classical Fisher information and perform Bayesian inference on simulated detector data. Our results show that photon counting remains an optimal measurement strategy even for deformed states, with classical and quantum Fisher information in exact agreement. Furthermore, the phase sensitivity improves with increasing q-deformation, indicating enhanced metrological performance driven by nonclassical photon statistics. These findings highlight the utility of q-deformed states in quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Derivation of the Wave Kinetic Equation for $\beta$-FPUT System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave kinetic theory has been suggested as a way to understand the longtime statistical behavior of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) system, with the aim of determining the thermalization time scale. The latter has been a major problem since the model was introduced in the 1950s. In this thesis we establish the wave kinetic equation for a reduced evolution equation obtained from the $\beta$-FPUT system by removing the non-resonant terms. We work in the kinetic limit $N\to \infty$ and $\beta\to 0$ under the scaling laws $\beta=N^{-\gamma}$ with $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$. The result holds up to the sub-kinetic time scale $T=N^{-\epsilon}\min\bigl(N,N^{5\gamma/4}\bigr)=N^{-\epsilon}T_{\mathrm{kin}}^{5/8}$ for $\epsilon\ll 1$, where $T_{\mathrm{kin}}$ represents the kinetic (thermalization) timescale. The novelties of this work include the treatment of non-polynomial dispersion relations, and the introduction of a robust phase renormalization argument to cancel dangerous divergent interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the BCOV theory of deformations of complex structures as a pull-back to the super moduli space of the worldline of a spinning particle. In this approach the appearance of a non-local kinetic term in the target space action has the same origin as the mismatch of pictures in the Ramond sector of super string field theory and is resolved by the same type of auxiliary fields in shifted pictures. The BV-extension is manifest in this description. A compensator for the holomorphic 3-form can be included by resorting to a description in the large Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Electrodynamics via the Characteristic Method: Relativistic and Carrollian Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric-magnetic duality plays a pivotal role in understanding the structure of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). The Gaillard-Zumino (GZ) criterion provides a powerful constraint for identifying self-dual theories. In this work, we systematically explore solutions to the GZ self-duality condition by applying the method of characteristics, a robust tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. Our approach enables the construction of new classes of Lagrangians that respect duality symmetry, both in the relativistic and Carrollian frameworks. In the relativistic setting, we not only recover well-known examples such as Born-Infeld and ModMax theories, but also identify novel models. We then generalize the GZ formalism to the Carrollian case and construct several classes of Carrollian self-dual non-linear electrodynamic models. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the characteristic flow exhibits an attractor behavior, in the sense that different seed theories that may not be self-dual can generate the same descendant self-dual Lagrangian. These findings broaden the landscape of self-dual theories and open new directions for exploring duality in ultra-relativistic regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a free quantum particle in one dimension whose mass profile exhibits jump discontinuities. The corresponding Hamiltonian is realised as a self-adjoint extension of the kinetic energy operator formulated in divergence form, with the extension encoded in the boundary conditions at the mass discontinuity points. For a family of scale-free boundary conditions, we analyse the associated spectral problem. We find that the eigenfunctions exhibit a highly sensitive and erratic dependence on the energy, leading to irregular spectral behaviour. Notably, the system supports infinitely many distinct semiclassical limits, each labeled by a point on a spectral curve embedded in the two-torus. These results demonstrate a rich interplay between discontinuous coefficients, boundary data, and spectral asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Module Categories of the Generic Virasoro VOA and Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12969v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the equivalence between two ribbon tensor categories. On the one hand, we consider the category of modules of the Virasoro vertex operator algebra with generic central charge (generic Virasoro VOA) generated by those simple modules lying in the first row of the Kac table. On the other hand, we take the category of finite-dimensional type I modules of the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q (\mathfrak{sl}_{2})$ with $q$ determined by the central charge. This is a continuation of our previous work in which we examined intertwining operators for the generic Virasoro VOA in detail. Our strategy to show the categorical equivalence is to take those results as input and directly compare the structures of tensor categories. Therefore, we are to execute the most elementary proof of categorical equivalence. We also study the category of $C_{1}$-cofinite modules of the generic Virasoro VOA. We show that it is ribbon equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional type I modules of $\mathcal{U}_q (\mathfrak{sl}_{2})\otimes \mathcal{U}_{\tilde{q}}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2})$, where $q$ and $\tilde{q}$ are again related to the central charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05610v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How large is the Bessel potential, $G_{\alpha,\mu}f$, compared to the Riesz potential, $I_\alpha f$? In this paper, we show that if $I_\alpha f\in L^p$ with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and $p&gt;1$, then the following interpolation bound holds:
  \[\Vert G_{\alpha,\mu}f\Vert_p\leq C(\omega(I_\alpha f,1/\mu)_p)^\alpha\cdot\Vert I_\alpha f\Vert^{1-\alpha}_p.\] Here $\omega(f,t)_p$ is the $L^p$ modulus of continuity. However, if $\alpha=p=1$, we obtain the ``$L\log L$" type result \[\Vert G_{1,\mu}f\Vert_1\leq B\omega(I_1f,1/\mu)_1|\log\omega(I_1f,1/\mu)_1|.\] These and other estimates are obtained by studying the quotient of the two operators, $E_{\alpha,\mu}:=\frac{(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}}{(\mu^2-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}}$. This operator is of independent interest due to its connection to approximation theory.</description>

      <title>The q-Schwarzian and Liouville gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new holographic duality between q-Schwarzian quantum mechanics and Liouville gravity. The q-Schwarzian is a one parameter deformation of the Schwarzian, which is dual to JT gravity and describes the low energy sector of SYK. We show that the q-Schwarzian in turn is dual to sinh dilaton gravity. This one parameter deformation of JT gravity can be rewritten as Liouville gravity. We match the thermodynamics and classical two point function between q-Schwarzian and Liouville gravity. We further prove the duality on the quantum level by rewriting sinh dilaton gravity as a topological gauge theory, and showing that the latter equals the q-Schwarzian. As the q-Schwarzian can be quantized exactly, this duality can be viewed as an exact solution of sinh dilaton gravity on the disk topology. For real q, this q-Schwarzian corresponds to double-scaled SYK and is dual to a sine dilaton gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Hermitian and symmetric random band matrices on the $d$-dimensional lattice $(\mathbb{Z}/L\mathbb{Z})^d$ with bandwidth $W$, focusing on local eigenvalue statistics at the spectral edge in the limit $W\to\infty$. Our analysis reveals a critical dimension $d_c=6$ and identifies the critical bandwidth scaling as $W_c=L^{(1-d/6)_+}$. In the Hermitian case, we establish the Anderson transition for all dimensions $d&lt;4$, and GUE edge universality when $d\geq 4$ under the condition $W\geq L^{1/3+\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. In the symmetric case, we also establish parallel but more subtle transition phenomena after tadpole diagram renormalization. These findings extend Sodin's pioneering work [Ann. Math. 172, 2010], which was limited to the one-dimensional case and did not address the critical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic properties of a stochastic model for the induction equations of the magnetic field in a three dimensional periodic domain. The turbulent velocity field driving the electromotive force on the magnetic field is modeled by a noise white in time. For this model we rigorously take a scaling limit leading to a deterministic model. While in case of isotropic turbulence this produces an additional dissipation in the limit model which influences also the decay rate of the Magnetic field in the stochastic model, the case of turbulence devoloped in a preferential direction allows us to find a dynamo effect.</description>

      <title>eGAD! double descent is explained by Generalized Aliasing Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08294v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central problem in data science is to use potentially noisy samples of an unknown function to predict values for unseen inputs. In classical statistics, predictive error is understood as a trade-off between the bias and the variance that balances model simplicity with its ability to fit complex functions. However, over-parameterized models exhibit counterintuitive behaviors, such as "double descent" in which models of increasing complexity exhibit decreasing generalization error. Others may exhibit more complicated patterns of predictive error with multiple peaks and valleys. Neither double descent nor multiple descent phenomena are well explained by the bias-variance decomposition.
  We introduce a novel decomposition that we call the generalized aliasing decomposition (GAD) to explain the relationship between predictive performance and model complexity. The GAD decomposes the predictive error into three parts: 1) model insufficiency, which dominates when the number of parameters is much smaller than the number of data points, 2) data insufficiency, which dominates when the number of parameters is much greater than the number of data points, and 3) generalized aliasing, which dominates between these two extremes.
  We demonstrate the applicability of the GAD to diverse applications, including random feature models from machine learning, Fourier transforms from signal processing, solution methods for differential equations, and predictive formation enthalpy in materials discovery. Because key components of the GAD can be explicitly calculated from the relationship between model class and samples without seeing any data labels, it can answer questions related to experimental design and model selection before collecting data or performing experiments. We further demonstrate this approach on several examples and discuss implications for predictive modeling and data science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06581v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the existence of large deviation principles of random walk in strongly mixing environments. The quenched and annealed rate functions have the same zero set whose shape is either a singleton point or a line segment, with an illustrative example communicated and given by F. Rassoul-Agha. Whenever the level of disorder is controlled, the two rate functions are shown to conform on compact sets at the boundary and in the interior both under strongly mixing conditions.</description>

      <title>Effective (Floquet) Lindblad generators from spectral unwinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mathematical description of the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system can often be given in terms of a completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) map, also known as quantum channel. In a seminal work by Wolf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent generator of Lindblad form, is generally an NP-hard problem. The difficulty is related to the fact that one has to search through all possible branches of the operator logarithm of the map, in order to identify, if any of the resulting effective generators is of Lindblad form. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective generator of Lindblad form. This significantly reduces the complexity of the search for an effective generator of Lindblad form in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Axiomatization of R\'enyi Entropy on Quantum Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase-space versions of quantum mechanics -- from Wigner's original distribution to modern discrete-qudit constructions -- represent some states with negative quasi-probabilities. Conventional Shannon and R\'enyi entropies become complex-valued in this setting and lose their operational meaning. Building on the axiomatic treatments of R\'enyi (1961) and Dar\'oczy (1963), we develop a conservative extension that applies to signed, finite phase spaces and discover a single admissible entropy family, which we call signed R\'enyi entropy. The obvious signed Shannon candidate is ruled out because it violates extensivity. We prove four results that bolster the usefulness of the new measure. (i) It serves as a witness of negative probability. (ii) For every even integer order it is Schur-concave, delivering the intuitive property that more mixing increases entropy. (iii) The same parametric family obeys a quantum H-theorem, namely, that under de-phasing dynamics entropy cannot decrease. (iv) The order-two entropy is conserved under discrete Moyal-bracket dynamics, mirroring conservation of von Neumann entropy under unitary evolution on Hilbert space. We also comment on interpreting the R\'enyi order parameter as inverse temperature. Overall, we believe that our investigation provides good evidence that our axiomatically derived signed R\'enyi entropy may be a useful addition to existing entropy measures used in quantum information, foundations, and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>An Immersed Interface Method for Incompressible Flows and Geometries with Sharp Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16466v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The immersed interface method (IIM) for models of fluid flow and fluid-structure interaction imposes jump conditions that capture stress discontinuities generated by forces that are concentrated along immersed boundaries. Most prior work using the IIM for fluid dynamic applications has focused on smooth interfaces, but boundaries with sharp features such as corners and edges can appear in practical analyses, particularly on engineered structures. The present study builds on our work to integrate finite element-type representations of interface geometries with the IIM. Initial realizations of this approach used a continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element discretization for the boundary, but as we show herein, these approaches generate large errors near sharp geometrical features. To overcome this difficulty, this study introduces an IIM approach using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) representation of the jump conditions. Numerical examples explore the impacts of different interface representations on accuracy for both smooth and sharp boundaries, particularly flows interacting with fixed interface configurations. We demonstrate that using a DG approach provides accuracy that is comparable to the CG method for smooth cases. Further, we identify a time step size restriction for the CG representation that is directly related to the sharpness of the geometry. In contrast, time step size restrictions imposed by DG representations are demonstrated to be insensitive to the presence of sharp features.</description>

      <title>Exploring superconformal Yang-Mills theories through matrix Bessel kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A broad class of observables in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal Yang-Mills theories can be exactly computed for arbitrary 't Hooft coupling as Fredholm determinants of integrable Bessel operators. These observables admit a unifying description through a one-parameter generating function, which possesses a determinant representation involving a matrix generalization of the Bessel operator. We analyze this generating function over a wide range of parameter values and finite 't Hooft coupling. We demonstrate that it has a well-behaved weak-coupling expansion with a finite radius of convergence. In contrast, the strong-coupling expansion exhibits factorially growing coefficients, necessitating the inclusion of non-perturbative corrections that are exponentially suppressed at strong coupling. We compute these non-perturbative corrections and observe a striking resemblance between the resulting trans-series expansion of the generating function and the partition function of a strongly coupled theory expanded in powers of a mass gap.</description>

      <title>Presymplectic BV-AKSZ for $N=1$, $D=4$ Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach to supersymmetric systems. In particular, we construct such a formulation for the $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity by taking as a target space the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of the super-Poincar\'e algebra which, as we demonstrate, admits an invariant presymplectic structure of degree $3$. This data encodes a full-scale Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the system, including a concise form of the BV master action. The important feature of (presymplectic) AKSZ models is that, at least at the level of equations of motion, they can be equivalently reformulated in the spacetime obtained by adding or eliminating contractible dimensions. For instance, the presymplectic AKSZ formulation of gravity can be lifted to the respective ``group manifold'', endowing it with the structure of a principle bundle and the Cartan connection therein, at least locally. In particular, the so-called rheonomy conditions emerge as a part of the presymplectic AKSZ equations of motion. The analogous considerations apply to supergravity and its uplift to superspace. We also study general presymplectic BV-AKSZ models related by adding or removing contractible spacetime dimensions in order to systematically relate the spacetime and superspace formulations of the same system within the AKSZ-like framework. These relations are then illustrated using the supersymmetric particle as a toy model.</description>

      <title>Semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and partial majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider families of tight upper bounds on the difference $S(\rho)-S(\sigma)$ with the rank/energy constraint imposed on the state $\rho$ which are valid provided that the state $\rho$ partially majorizes the state $\sigma$ and is close to the state $\sigma$ w.r.t. the trace norm.
  The upper bounds within these families depend on the parameter $m$ of partial majorization. The upper bounds corresponding to $m=0$ coincide with the (unconditional) optimal semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy with the rank/energy constraint obtained in [Lett.Math.Phys.,113,121,35] and [arXiv:2410.02686]. State-dependent improvements of these semicontinuity bounds are proposed and analysed numerically.
  The notion of $\varepsilon$-sufficient majorization dimension of the set of states with bounded energy is introduced and analysed.
  Classical versions of the above results formulated in terms of probability distributions and the Shannon entropy are also considered.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy and gravitational coupling from moving geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of moving Cartan geometries described by quotients of Lie groups and Lie algebras with spacetime dependant structure constants and construct associated deformed topological gauge action functionals for Lorentzian (including dS and AdS) and Lorentz$\times$Weyl moving geometries. The actions feature a generalization of the Nieh-Yan topological term for a varying coupling constant. We compute the equations of motion of the gauge $+$ matter actions and show that they dictate at each spacetime point the geometry, leading to both a dynamical source of dark energy and a dynamical gravitational coupling, described by combinations of scalars built from spacetime curvature, torsion and the matter content of the theory. The action becomes asymptotically topological when the gauge action contribution to dark energy vanishes.</description>

      <title>On local fields invariant under the action of topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look into the problem of constructing and classifying pairs consisting of a local operator and a topological defect which commutes or anticommutes with it. We discuss the bulk and boundary versions of the problem. In the latter one considers a conformal boundary condition, a boundary operator on it and a junction with a topological defect. In the case of the charge conjugation modular invariant commuting configurations in each problem can be obtained when a certain restriction on the fusion rules in realised. We study the corresponding fusion rule problems in detail. While in the bulk case it reduces to realising the $a\times b = c$ fusion rule which was studied in arXiv:2012.14689 [hep-th], in the boundary it leads to a new type of problem. We obtain a full solution to this problem for the $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ WZW theory, thus constructing a class of commuting boundary operators and junctions in that theory, and suggest an approach to general WZW theories.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Mattis ordering theorem of electronic energy levels in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lieb-Mattis theorem orders the lowest-energy states of total spin $s$ of a system of $P$ interacting fermions. We generalize these predictions to fermionic mixtures of $P$ particles with more than $N=2$ spinor components/species in the thermodynamic limit $P\to\infty$. The lowest-energy state inside each permutation symmetry sector $h$, arising in the $P$-fold tensor product decomposition, is well approximated by a U$(N)$ coherent (quasi-classical, variational) state, specially in the limit $P\to\infty$. In particular, the ground state of the system belongs the most symmetric (dominant Young tableau $h_0$) configuration. We exemplify our construction with the $N=3$ level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, with a previous motivation on pairing correlations and U$(N)$-invariant quantum Hall ferromagnets. In the limit $P\to\infty$, each lowest-energy state within each permutation symmetry sector $h$ undergoes a quantum phase transition for a critical value $\lambda_c(h)$ of the exchange coupling constant $\lambda$, depending on $h$. This generalizes standard quantum phase transitions and their phase diagrams corresponding to the ground state belonging to the most symmetric sector $h_0$.</description>

      <title>Boundary terms in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the derivation of the Einstein field equations via Hamilton's principle, the inclusion of a boundary term is essential to render the variational problem well-posed, as it addresses variations that do not vanish at the boundary of the spacetime manifold. Typically, this term is chosen as the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. In this work, we propose an alternative treatment of the boundary term within a cosmological framework by employing the Lagrange multiplier method. This approach enforces the vanishing of the boundary term throughout the evolution of the Universe, leading to the prediction of a fluid component that decays as the sixth power of the scale factor. This type of fluid has been studied in the context of the early universe under the name of stiff matter, and it can be related to a scalar field known as kination.</description>

      <title>What is a double star-product?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double Poisson brackets, introduced by M. Van den Bergh in 2004, are noncommutative analogs of the usual Poisson brackets in the sense of the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle: they induce Poisson structures on the space of $N$-dimensional representations $\operatorname{Rep}_N(A)$ of an associative algebra $A$ for any $N$. The problem of deformation quantization of double Poisson brackets was raised by D. Calaque in 2010, and had remained open since then.
  In this paper, we address this problem by answering the question in the title. We present a structure on $A$ that induces a star-product under the representation functor and, therefore, according to the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle, can be viewed as an analog of star-products in noncommutative geometry. We also provide an explicit example for $A=\Bbbk\langle x_1,\ldots,x_d\rangle$ and prove a double formality theorem in this case. Along the way, we invert the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle by introducing a notion of double algebra over an arbitrary operad.</description>
