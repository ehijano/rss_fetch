      <title>Chemistry across dust and gas gaps in protoplanetary disks: modelling the co-spatial molecular rings in the HD 100546 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution observations show that typically both the dust and the gas in nearby extended protoplanetary disks are structured, possibly related to radial and azimuthal variations in the disk density and/or chemistry. The aim of this work is to identify the expected location and intensity of rings seen in molecular line emission of HCN, CN, C$_2$H, NO, [CI], and HCO$^+$ in gapped disks while exploring a range of physical conditions across the gap. In particular, we model HD 100546 disk where molecular rings are co-spatial with the dust rings at $\sim$20 and $\sim$200 au, in contrast to most other gapped disks. The fiducial model of a gapped disk with a 15 au gas cavity, a 20 au dust cavity, and a shallow (a factor of $\lesssim10$) gas and deep dust gap at 40-175 au provides a good fit to the continuum, CO isotopologues, HCN, and HCO$^+$ in the HD 100546 disk. However, the predictions for [CI], CN, C$_2$H and NO do not match the intensity nor the morphology of the observations. An exploration of the parameter space shows that in general the molecular emission rings are only co-spatial with the dust rings if the gas gap between the dust rings is depleted by at least four orders of magnitude in gas or if the C/O ratio of the gas is varying as a function of radius. For shallower gaps the decrease in the UV field roughly balances the effect of a higher gas density for UV tracers such as CN, C$_2$H, and NO. Therefore, these radicals are not good tracers of the gas gap depth. The C/O ratio primarily effects the intensity of the lines without changing the morphology much. The co-spatial rings observed in the HD 100546 disk could be indicative of a radially varying C/O ratio in the HD 100546 disk with a C/O above 1 in a narrow region across the dust rings, together with a shallow gas gap that is depleted by a factor of $\sim$10 in gas, and a reduced background UV field.</description>

      <title>Wide Binary Orbits are Preferentially Aligned with the Orbits of Small Planets, but Probably Not Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the relative orientations of the orbits of exoplanets and wide-orbiting binary companions (semimajor axis greater than 100 AU) can shed light on how planets form and evolve in binary systems. Previous observations by multiple groups discovered a possible alignment between the orbits of visual binaries and the exoplanets that reside in them. In this study, using data from \textit{Gaia} DR3 and TESS, we confirm the existence of an alignment between the orbits of small planets $(R&lt;6 R_\oplus)$ and binary systems with semimajor axes below 700 AU ($p=10^{-6}$). However, we find no statistical evidence for alignment between planet and binary orbits for binary semimajor axes greater than 700 AU, and no evidence for alignment of large, closely-orbiting planets (mostly hot Jupiters) and binaries at any separation. The lack of orbital alignment between our large planet sample and their binary companions appears significantly different from our small planet sample, even taking into account selection effects. Therefore, we conclude that any alignment between wide-binaries and our sample of large planets (predominantly hot Jupiters) is probably not as strong as what we observe for small planets in binaries with semimajor axes less than 700 AU. The difference in the alignment distribution of hot Jupiters and smaller planets may be attributed to the unique evolutionary mechanisms occuring in systems that form hot Jupiters, including potentially destabilizing secular resonances that onset as the protoplanetary disk dissipates and high-eccentricity migration occurring after the disk is gone.</description>

      <title>Early Results from the HUMDRUM Survey: A Small, Earth-mass Planet Orbits TOI-1450A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M dwarf stars provide us with an ideal opportunity to study nearby small planets. The HUMDRUM (HUnting for M Dwarf Rocky planets Using MAROON-X) survey uses the MAROON-X spectrograph, which is ideally suited to studying these stars, to measure precise masses of a volume-limited ($&lt;\,30$ pc) sample of transiting M dwarf planets. TOI-1450 is a nearby (22.5 pc) binary system containing a M3 dwarf with a roughly 3000 K companion. Its primary star, TOI-1450A, was identified by $TESS$ to have a 2.04d transit signal, and is included in the HUMDRUM sample. In this paper, we present MAROON-X radial velocities which confirm the planetary nature of this signal and measure its mass at a nearly 10% precision. The 2.04d planet, TOI-1450Ab, has $R_b\,=\,1.13\,\pm\,0.04\,R_\oplus$ and $M_b\,=\,1.26\,\pm\,0.13\,M_\oplus$. It is the second-lowest-mass transiting planet with a high-precision RV mass measurement. With this mass and radius, the planet's mean density is compatible with an Earth-like composition. Given its short orbital period and slightly sub-Earth density, it may be amenable to $JWST$ follow-up to test whether the planet has retained an atmosphere despite extreme heating from the nearby star. We also discover a non-transiting planet in the system with a period of 5.07 days and a $M\mathrm{sin}i_c\,=\,1.53\,\pm\,0.18\,M_\oplus$. We also find a 2.01d signal present in the systems's $TESS$ photometry that likely corresponds to the rotation period of TOI-1450A's binary companion, TOI-1450B. TOI-1450A, meanwhile, appears to have a rotation period of approximately 40 days, which is in-line with our expectations for a mid-M dwarf.</description>

      <title>A New Monte-Carlo Model for the Space Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Monte Carlo (MC) method to simulate the evolution of the low-earth orbit environment, enhancing the MIT Orbital Capacity Analysis Tool (MOCAT). In recent decades, numerous space environment models have been developed by government agencies and research groups to understand and predict the dynamics of space debris. Our MC approach advances this by simulating the trajectories of space objects and modeling their interactions, such as collisions and explosions. This aids in analyzing the trends of space-object and debris populations. A key innovation of our method is the computational efficiency in orbit propagation, which is crucial for handling potentially large numbers of objects over centuries. We present validation results against the IADC (Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee) study and explore various scenarios, including ones without future launches and those involving the launch of proposed megaconstellations with over 80,000 active payloads. With the improvement in computational efficiencies provided by this work, we can run these new scenarios that predict millions of trackable objects over a 200-year period. The previous state-of-the-art was 400,000 objects over the same period of time. Notably, while fewer megaconstellations are planned for altitudes above 800 km, even minimal failures in post-mission disposal or collision avoidance maneuvers can significantly impact orbital debris accumulation.</description>

      <title>Characterization of carbon dioxide on Ganymede and Europa supported by experiments: Effects of temperature, porosity, and mixing with water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surfaces of icy moons are primarily composed of water ice that can be mixed with other compounds, such as carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide (CO$_2)$ stretching fundamental band observed on Europa and Ganymede appears to be a combination of several bands that are shifting location from one moon to another. We investigate the cause of the observed shift in the CO$_2$ stretching absorption band experimentally. We also explore the spectral behaviour of CO$_2$ ice by varying the temperature and concentration.} %H$_2$O:CO$_2$ deposition ratios. We analyzed pure CO$_2$ ice and ice mixtures deposited at 10 K under ultra-high vacuum conditions using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. Laboratory ice spectra were compared to JWST observation of Europa's and Ganymede's leading hemispheres. The simulated IR spectra were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) methods, exploring the effect of porosity in CO$_2$ ice. Pure CO$_2$ and CO$_2$-water ice show distinct spectral changes and desorption behaviours at different temperatures, revealing intricate CO$_2$ and H$_2$O interactions. The number of discernible peaks increases from two in pure CO$_2$ to three in CO$_2$-water mixtures.</description>

      <title>Stellar wind impact on early atmospheres around unmagnetized Earth-like planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar rotation at early ages plays a crucial role in the survival of primordial atmospheres around Earth-mass exoplanets. Earth-like planets orbiting fast-rotating stars may undergo complete photoevaporation within the first few hundred Myr driven by the enhanced stellar XUV radiation, while planets orbiting slow-rotating stars are expected to experience difficulty to lose their primordial envelopes. Besides the action of stellar radiation, stellar winds induce additional erosion on these primordial atmospheres, altering their morphology, extent, and causing supplementary atmospheric losses. In this paper, we study the impact of activity-dependent stellar winds on primordial atmospheres to evaluate the extent at which the action of these winds can be significant in the whole planetary evolution at early evolutionary stages. We performed 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the interaction of photoevaporating atmospheres around unmagnetized Earth-mass planets in the time-span between 50 and 500 Myr, analyzing the joint evolution of stellar winds and atmospheres for both fast- and slow-rotating stars. Our results reveal substantial changes in the evolution of primordial atmospheres when influenced by fast-rotating stars, with a significant reduction in extent at early ages. In contrast, atmospheres embedded in the stellar winds from slow-rotating stars remain largely unaltered. The interaction of the magnetized stellar winds with the ionized upper atmospheres of these planets allows to evaluate the formation and evolution of different MHD structures, such as double-bow shocks and induced magnetospheres. This work will shed light to the first evolutionary stages of Earth-like exoplanets, that are of crucial relevance in terms of planet habitability.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Work Function on Dust Charging and Dynamics on the Airless Celestial Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charged dust on the surface of airless celestial bodies, such as the moon and asteroids, is a threat to space missions. Further research on the charged dust will contribute to the success of space missions. In this paper, we study the charging and dynamics of dust particles with different work functions. By integrating the photoelectron energy distribution function over four illuminated areas with different work functions, we evaluated the photoelectron concentration in these four areas. At each area, using the photoelectron concentration, we solve the dust charging and dynamics equations with two different gravitational acceleration values. The results reveal that the dust with a larger work function can reach higher equilibrium states. These states include dominant photoelectron-related charging currents, charge numbers, and levitation heights. We suggest that the equilibrium states all hold a clear inverse relationship with the work functions of dust particles when the solar zenith angle varies from 0 to 90 degrees, displaying consistent trends under different gravitational accelerations. We also find that dust particles seem unable to stably levitate at a critical solar zenith angle. The value of this critical SZA follows the same rule subjected to the work function.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Three-dimensional Simulation of Surface Charging on Rotating Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface charging phenomenon of asteroids, mainly resulting from solar wind plasma and solar radiation, has been studied extensively. However, the influence of asteroid's rotation on surface charging has yet to be fully understood. Here neural network is established to replace numerical integration, improving the efficiency of dynamic three-dimensional simulation. We implement simulation of rotating asteroids and surrounding plasma environment under different conditions, including quiet solar wind and solar storms, various minerals on asteroid's surface also be considered. Results show that under typical solar wind, the maximum and minimum potential of asteroids will gradually decrease with their increasing periods, especially when solar wind is obliquely incident. For asteroid has period longer than one week, this decreasing trend will become extremely slow. During solar storm passing, solar wind plasma changes sharply, the susceptibility of asteroid's surface potential to rotation is greatly pronounced. Minerals on surface also count, plagioclase is the most sensitive mineral among those we explored, while ilmenite seems indifferent to changes in rotation periods. Understanding the surface charging of asteroid under various rotation periods or angles, is crucial for further research into solar wind plasma and asteroid's surface dust motion, providing a reference for safe landing exploration of asteroids.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigations of diacetylene ice photochemistry in Titan's atmospheric conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large fraction of the organic species produced photochemically in the atmosphere of Titan can condense to form ice particles in the stratosphere and in the troposphere. According to various studies, diacetylene (C$_4$H$_2$) condenses below 100 km where it can be exposed to ultraviolet radiation. We studied experimentally the photochemistry of diacetylene ice (C$_4$H$_2$) to evaluate its potential role in the lower altitude photochemistry of Titan's atmospheric ices. Methods. C$_4$H$_2$ ice films were irradiated with near-ultraviolet (near-UV) photons ( {\lambda} &gt; 300 nm) with different UV sources to assess the impact of the wavelengths of photons on the photochemistry of C$_4$H$_2$. The evolution of the ice's composition was monitored using spectroscopic techniques. Our results reveal that diacetylene ice is reactive through singlet-triplet absorption, similar to the photochemistry of other organic ices of Titan (such as dicyanoacetylene C$_4$N$_2$ ice) that we investigated previously. Several chemical processes occurred during the photolysis: the hydrogenation of C$_4$H$_2$ to form other C$_4$ hydrocarbons (vinylacetylene C$_4$H$_4$ to butane C$_4$H$_{10}$); the formation of larger and highly polymerizable hydrocarbons, such as triacetylene (C$_6$H$_2$); and the formation of an organic polymer that is stable at room temperature. The nondetection of diacetylene ice in Titan's atmosphere or surface could be rationalized based on our experimental results that C$_4$H$_2$ is photochemically highly reactive in the solid phase when exposed to near-UV radiation that reaches Titan's lower altitudes and surface. C$_4$H$_2$ may be one of the key molecules promoting the chemistry in the ices and aerosols of Titan's haze layers, especially in the case of co-condensation with other organic volatiles, with which it could initiate more complex solid-phase chemistry.</description>

      <title>The SNR of idealised radial velocity signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most basic quantities relevant to planning observations and assessing detection bias is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Remarkably, the SNR of an idealised radial velocity (RV) signal has not been previously derived beyond scaling behaviours and ignoring orbital eccentricity. In this work, we derive the RV SNR for three relevant cases to observers. First, we consider a single mass orbiting a star, revealing the expected result that $\mathrm{SNR}\propto K \sqrt{T}$, where $T$ is the observing window, but an additional dependency on eccentricity and argument of periastron. We show that the RV method is biased towards companions with their semi-major axes aligned to the observer, which is physically intuitive, but also less obviously that the marginalised bias to eccentricity is negligible until one reaches very high eccentricities. Second, we derive the SNR necessary to discriminate eccentric companions from 2:1 resonance circular orbits, although our result is only valid for eccentricities $e\lesssim0.3$. We find that the discriminatory SNR is $(9/8) e^2 (1-e^2)^{-1/2}$ times that of the eccentric planet solution's SNR, and is thus typically an order-of-magnitude less. Finally, we have obtained a semi-empirical expression for the SNR of the idealised Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, revealing the bias with respect to spin-orbit alignment angle. Our formula is valid to within 10% accuracy in 95.45% of the training samples used (for $b\leq0.8$), but larger deviations occur when comparing to different RM models.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey I: Chemical and isotopic characterisation of the late L-dwarf DENIS J0255-4700 with CRIRES$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the distinct formation and evolution of exoplanets and brown dwarfs may affect the chemical and isotopic content of their atmospheres. Recent work has indeed shown differences in the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotope ratio, provisionally attributed to the top-down formation of brown dwarfs and the core accretion pathway of super-Jupiters. The ESO SupJup Survey aims to disentangle the formation pathways of isolated brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions using chemical and isotopic tracers. The survey uses high-resolution spectroscopy with the recently upgraded VLT/CRIRES$^+$ spectrograph, covering a total of 49 targets. Here, we present the first results: an atmospheric characterisation of DENIS J0255-4700, an isolated brown dwarf near the L-T transition. We analyse its K-band spectrum using a retrieval framework where the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS is coupled to PyMultiNest. Gaussian Processes are employed to model inter-pixel correlations and we adopt an updated parameterisation of the PT-profile. Abundances of CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, and NH$_3$ are retrieved for this fast-rotating L-dwarf. The ExoMol H$_2$O line list provides a significantly better fit than that of HITEMP. A free-chemistry retrieval is strongly favoured over equilibrium chemistry, caused by an under-abundance of CH$_4$. The free-chemistry retrieval constrains a super-solar C/O-ratio of $\sim0.68$ and a solar metallicity. We find tentative evidence ($\sim3\sigma$) for the presence of $^{13}$CO, with a constraint on the isotope ratio of $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C}=184^{+61}_{-40}$ and a lower limit of $\gtrsim97$, suggesting a depletion of $^{13}$C compared to the interstellar medium ($\sim68$). High-resolution, high signal-to-noise K-band spectra provide an excellent means to constrain the chemistry and isotopic content of sub-stellar objects, as is the main objective of the ESO SupJup Survey.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar variability strongly impacts the search for low-mass exoplanets with radial velocity techniques. Two types of planet-free time series can be used to quantify this impact: models and direct solar observations after a subtraction of the Solar System planetary contribution. Comparing these approaches is necessary for simulations. Our objective is to validate the amplitude of the convective blueshift in plages used in our previous works, particularly in blind tests, with HARPS-N solar data. We applied our model to the structures observed at the time of observations and compared the radial velocity time series. To complete our diagnosis, we studied the observed radial velocities separately for each diffraction order derived from the individual cross-correlation functions, as well as our line-by-line radial velocities. We find that our previous model had been underestimating the amplitude of the convective blueshift inhibition by a factor of about 2. A direct estimation of the convective blueshift in the spectra explains the difference with previous estimations obtained with MDI/SOHO Dopplergrams, based on the properties of the Ni line. We identified several instrumental systematics: the presence of a 2 m/s peak-to-peak signal with a period of about 200 days in radial velocity and bisector, which could be due to periodic detector warm-ups, a systematic dependence of the long-term trend on wavelength possibly related to the variability of the continuum over time, and/or an offset in radial velocity after the interruption of several months in Oct. 2017. A large amplitude in the convective blueshift inhibition of (360 m/s) must be used when building synthetic times series for blind tests. The presence of instrumental systematics should also be taken into account when using sophisticated methods based on line properties to mitigate stellar activity when searching for very weak signals.</description>

Abstract: Exoplanets have been detected around stars at various stages of their lives, ranging from young stars emerging from formation, to latter stages of evolution, including white dwarfs and neutron stars. Post main sequence stellar evolution can result in dramatic, and occasionally traumatic, alterations to the planetary system architecture, such as tidal disruption of planets and engulfment by the host star. The $\rho$ CrB system is a particularly interesting case of advanced main sequence evolution, due to the relative late age and brightness of the host star, its similarity to solar properties, and the harboring of four known planets. Here, we use stellar evolution models to estimate the expected trajectory of the $\rho$ CrB stellar properties, especially over the coming 1.0-1.5 billion years as it evolves off the main sequence. We show that the inner three planets (e, b, and c) are engulfed during the red giant phase and asymptotic giant branch, likely destroying those planets via either evaporation or tidal disruption at the fluid body Roche limit. The outer planet, planet d, is briefly engulfed by the star several times toward the end of the asymptotic giant branch, but the stellar mass loss and subsequent changing planetary orbit may allow the survival of the planet into the white dwarf phase of the stellar evolution. We discuss the implications of this outcome for similar systems, and describe the consequences for planets that may lie within the Habitable Zone of the system.</description>

      <title>nuance: Efficient detection of planets transiting active stars</title>

Abstract: The detection of planetary transits in the light curves of active stars, featuring correlated noise in the form of stellar variability, remains a challenge. Depending on the noise characteristics, we show that the traditional technique that consists of detrending a light curve before searching for transits alters their signal-to-noise ratio, and hinders our capability to discover exoplanets transiting rapidly-rotating active stars. We present nuance, an algorithm to search for transits in light curves while simultaneously accounting for the presence of correlated noise, such as stellar variability and instrumental signals. We assess the performance of nuance on simulated light curves as well as on the TESS light curves of 438 rapidly-rotating M dwarfs. For each dataset, we compare our method to 5 commonly-used detrending techniques followed by a search with the Box-Least-Square algorithm. Overall, we demonstrate that nuance is the most performant method in 93% of cases, leading to both the highest number of true positives and the lowest number of false positive detections. Although simultaneously searching for transits while modeling correlated noise is expected to be computationally expensive, we make our algorithm tractable and available as the JAX-powered Python package nuance, allowing its use on distributed environments and GPU devices. Finally, we explore the prospects offered by the nuance formalism, and its use to advance our knowledge of planetary systems around active stars, both using space-based surveys and sparse ground-based observations.</description>
