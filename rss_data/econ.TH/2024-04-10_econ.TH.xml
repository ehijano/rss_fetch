      <title>Robust Advertisement Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the robust pricing problem of an advertising platform that charges a producer for disclosing hard evidence of product quality to a consumer before trading. Multiple equilibria arise since consumer beliefs and producer's contingent advertisement purchases are interdependent. To tackle strategic uncertainty, the platform offers each producer's quality type a menu of disclosure-probability-and-price plans to maximize its revenue guaranteed across all equilibria. The optimal menus offer a continuum of plans with strictly increasing marginal prices for higher disclosure probabilities. Full disclosure is implemented in the unique equilibrium. All partial-disclosure plans, though off-path, preclude bad equilibrium play. This solution admits a tractable price function that suggests volume-based pricing can outperform click-based pricing when strategic uncertainty is accounted for. Moreover, the platform prioritizes attracting higher types into service and offers them higher rents despite symmetric information between the platform and the producer.</description>

      <title>The Machiavellian frontier of top trading cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.14456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the housing market problem introduced by Shapley and Scarf (1974). We probe the Machiavellian frontier of the well-known top trading cycles (TTC) rule by weakening strategy-proofness and providing new characterizations for this rule. Specifically, our contribution lies in three aspects. First, we weaken the concept of strategy-proofness and introduce a new incentive notion called truncation-invariance, where the truthful preference-reporting assignment cannot be altered by any agent through misreporting a truncation of the true preference at the assignment produced by the true preference unilaterally. Second, we characterize the TTC rule by the following three groups of axioms: individual rationality, pair-efficiency, truncation-invariance; individual rationality, Pareto efficiency, truncation-invariance; individual rationality, endowments-swapping-proofness, truncation-invariance.1 The new characterizations refine several previous results.2 Third, we show through examples that the characterization results of Takamiya (2001) and Miyagawa (2002) can no longer be obtained if strategy-proofness is replaced with truncation-invariance.</description>

      <title>Fair integer programming under dichotomous and cardinal preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One cannot make truly fair decisions using integer linear programs unless one controls the selection probabilities of the (possibly many) optimal solutions. For this purpose, we propose a unified framework when binary decision variables represent agents with dichotomous preferences, who only care about whether they are selected in the final solution. We develop several general-purpose algorithms to fairly select optimal solutions, for example, by maximizing the Nash product or the minimum selection probability, or by using a random ordering of the agents as a selection criterion (Random Serial Dictatorship). We also discuss in detail how to extend the proposed methods when agents have cardinal preferences. As such, we embed the black-box procedure of solving an integer linear program into a framework that is explainable from start to finish. Lastly, we evaluate the proposed methods on two specific applications, namely kidney exchange (dichotomous preferences), and the scheduling problem of minimizing total tardiness on a single machine (cardinal preferences). We find that while the methods maximizing the Nash product or the minimum selection probability outperform the other methods on the evaluated welfare criteria, methods such as Random Serial Dictatorship perform reasonably well in computation times that are similar to those of finding a single optimal solution.</description>
