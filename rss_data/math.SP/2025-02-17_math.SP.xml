      <title>Spectral Instability of Random Fredholm Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $A \colon D(A) \subset \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}$ is an unbounded Fredholm operator of index $0$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ with a dense domain $D(A)$, then its spectrum is either discrete or the entire complex plane. This spectral dichotomy plays a central role in the study of \textit{magic angles} in twisted bilayer graphene.
  This paper proves that if such operators (with certain additional assumptions) are perturbed by certain random trace-class operators, their spectrum is discrete with high probability.</description>

      <title>Sharp energy decay rates for the damped wave equation on the torus via non-polynomial derivative bound conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the damped wave equation on the torus, when some geodesics never meet the positive set of the damping, energy decay rates are known to depend on derivative bounds and growth properties of the damping near the boundary of its support, as well as the geometry of the support of the damping. In this paper we obtain, sometimes sharp, energy decay rates for damping which satisfy more general non-polynomial derivative bounds and growth properties. We also show how these rates can depend on the geometry of the support of the damping. We prove general results and apply them to examples of damping growing exponentially slowly, polynomial-logarithmically, or logarithmically. The decay rates found for these examples interpolate between known sharp rates for purely polynomial damping. The proof relies on estimating the solution at very fine, non-poynomial, semiclassical scales to obtain resolvent estimates, which are then converted to energy decay rates via semigroup theory.</description>

      <title>Large topology asymptotics for spectrally extremal minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{B}^3$ and $\mathbb{S}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work with Kusner, we developed a method, based on the equivariant optimization of Laplace and Steklov eigenvalues, for producing minimal surfaces of prescribed topology in low-dimensional balls and spheres. We used the method to construct many new minimal embeddings in $\mathbb{S}^3$ with area below $8\pi$, and many new free boundary minimal embeddings in $\mathbb{B}^3$ with area below $2\pi$. In this paper, we study the geometry of these surfaces in more detail, with an emphasis on studying sharp area estimates and varifold limits in the large Euler characteristic regime. This allows us to confirm some well-known conjectures regarding the space of low-area minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3$ in this class of examples and the special role played by Lawson's $\xi_{\gamma,1}$ surfaces. We also confirm analogous statements in $\mathbb{B}^3$ and identify a family of free boundary minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{B}^3$ most closely resembling $\xi_{\gamma,1}$.</description>

      <title>Operator level soft edge to bulk transition in $\beta$-ensembles via canonical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic Airy and sine operators, which are respectively a random Sturm-Liouville operator and a random Dirac operator, characterize the soft edge and bulk scaling limits of $\beta$-ensembles. Dirac and Sturm-Liouville operators are distinct operator classes which can both be represented as canonical systems, which gives a unified framework for defining important properties, such as their spectral data. Seeing both as canonical systems, we prove that in a suitable high-energy scaling limit, the Airy operator converges to the sine operator. We prove this convergence in the vague topology of canonical systems' coefficient matrices, and deduce the convergence of the associated Weyl-Titchmarsh functions and spectral measures. Our proof relies on a coupling between the Brownian paths that drive the two operators, under which the convergence holds in probability. This extends the corresponding result at the level of the eigenvalue point processes, proven by Valk\'o and Vir\'ag (2009) by comparison to the Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble.</description>

      <title>Inaudibility of naturally reductive property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use a characterization of naturally reductive 2-step nilponent Lie groups via Ambrose-Singer's homogeneous structures to prove that one cannot determine if a closed Riemannian manifold is naturally reductive using the information encoded in the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. To do that, we consider a new isospectral pair of 2-step nilmanifolds of dimension 9 such that one of them is naturally reductive and the other is not.</description>

      <title>Computing the spectrum and pseudospectrum of infinite-volume operators from local patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the spectrum of normal discrete short-range infinite-volume operators can be approximated with two-sided error control using only data from finite-sized local patches. As a corollary, we prove the computability of the spectrum of such infinite-volume operators with the additional property of finite local complexity and provide an explicit algorithm. Such operators appear in many applications, e.g. as discretizations of differential operators on unbounded domains or as so-called tight-binding Hamiltonians in solid state physics. For a large class of such operators, our result allows for the first time to establish computationally also the absence of spectrum, i.e. the existence and the size of spectral gaps. We extend our results to the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum of non-normal operators, proving that also the pseudospectrum of such operators is computable.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-like Schr\"odinger Operators at Low Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08355v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Schr\"odinger operator on an asymptotically Euclidean manifold $X$ of dimension at least two, and suppose that the potential is of attractive Coulomb-like type. Using Vasy's second 2nd-microlocal approach, "the Lagrangian approach," we analyze -- uniformly, all the way down to $E=0$ -- the output of the limiting resolvent $R(E\pm i 0) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} R(E\pm i \epsilon)$. The Coulomb potential causes the output of the low-energy resolvent to possess oscillatory asymptotics which differ substantially from the sorts of asymptotics observed in the short-range case by Guillarmou, Hassell, Sikora, and (more recently) Hintz and Vasy. Specifically, the compound asymptotics at low energy and large spatial scales are more delicate, and the resolvent output is smooth all the way down to $E=0$. In fact, we will construct a compactification of $(0,1]_E\times X$ on which the resolvent output is given by a specified (and relatively complicated) function that oscillates as $r\to\infty$ times something polyhomogeneous. As a corollary, we get complete and compatible asymptotic expansions for solutions to the scattering problem as functions of both position and energy, with a transitional regime.</description>

      <title>CR Paneitz operator on non-embeddable CR manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CR Paneitz operator is closely related to some important problems in CR geometry. In this paper, we consider this operator on a non-embeddable CR manifold. This operator is essentially self-adjoint and its spectrum is discrete except zero. Moreover, the eigenspace corresponding to each non-zero eigenvalue is a finite dimensional subspace of the space of smooth functions. Furthermore, we show that the CR Paneitz operator on the Rossi sphere, an example of non-embeddable CR manifolds, has infinitely many negative eigenvalues, which is significantly different from the embeddable case.</description>
