      <title>Stochastic Modeling of Fish Schooling Dynamics: Decomposition into Collective and Individual Movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movement of fish in schools can be effectively modeled using stochastic frameworks, particularly through descriptions based on random walk dynamics. In this study, we analyze fish motion by decomposing it into two components: the movement of the school's center of mass and the relative motion of individual fish with respect to this center. We demonstrate that the center of mass follows an active random walk subjected to hard wall interactions and driven by white noise, while individual fish move independently within an effective field generated by the group. Their trajectories can be described as active random walks within a potential shaped by the spatial distribution of the school, influenced by multiplicative noise. Our findings enhance the understanding of collective animal behavior and offer valuable insights into the stochastic modeling of fish movement.</description>

      <title>Hidden frustration in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdCd3P3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a study of the magnetic ground state and crystal electric field (CEF) scheme in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdCd$_3$P$_3$. Combined neutron scattering, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements demonstrate that the Nd$^{3+}$ moments occupying the triangular lattice in this material harbor hidden signs of frustration not detected in typical Curie-Weiss-based parameterization of the frustration index ($f=\Theta_{CW} / T_N$). This is evidenced by a zero-field splitting of the Kramers' ground state and first excited state doublets at temperatures far in excess of $T_N$ as well as signatures of low-energy fluctuations for $T&gt;&gt;T_N$. A suppression of the zero-field ordered moment relative to its field saturation value is observed, and the impacts of this magnetic frustration as well as the coexisting bond frustration in the CdP honeycomb network on the physical properties of NdCd$_3$P$_3$ are discussed.</description>

      <title>Circuit structure-preserving error mitigation for High-Fidelity Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing methods to accurately characterize and mitigate the impact of noise is crucial for enhancing the fidelity of quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we present a circuit structure-preserving error mitigation framework for parameterized quantum circuits. A key advantage of our approach lies in its ability to retain the original circuit architecture while effectively characterizing and mitigating gate errors, enabling robust and high-fidelity simulations. This makes it particularly well suited for small-scale circuits that require repeated execution at large sampling rates. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we perform variational quantum simulations of a non-Hermitian ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising chain on IBM Quantum processors. The mitigated result shows excellent agreement with exact theoretical predictions across a range of noise levels. Our strategy offers a practical solution for addressing gate-induced errors and significantly broadens the scope of feasible quantum simulations on current quantum hardware.</description>
