      <title>Lax comma categories: cartesian closedness, extensivity, topologicity, and descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of lax comma categories over a base category $X$, focusing on topologicity, extensivity, cartesian closedness, and descent. We establish that the forgetful functor from $\mathsf{Cat}//X$ to $\mathsf{Cat}$ is topological if and only if $X$ is large-complete. Moreover, we provide conditions for $\mathsf{Cat}//X$ to be complete, cocomplete, extensive and cartesian closed. We analyze descent in $\mathsf{Cat}//X$ and identify necessary conditions for effective descent morphisms. Our findings contribute to the literature on lax comma categories and provide a foundation for further research in 2-dimensional Janelidze's Galois theory.</description>

      <title>Naive homotopy theories in cartesian closed categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An elementary notion of homotopy can be introduced between arrows in a cartesian closed category $E$. The input is a finite-product-preserving endofunctor $\Pi_0$ with a natural transformation $p$ from the identity which is surjective on global elements. As expected, the output is a new category $E_p$ with objects the same objects as $E$.
  Further assumptions on $E$ provide a finer description of $E_p$ that relates it to the classical homotopy theory where $\Pi_0$ could be interpreted as the ``path-connected components'' functor on convenient categories of topological spaces. In particular, if $E$ is a 2-value topos the supports of which split and is furthermore assumed to be precohesive over a boolean base, then the passage from $E$ to $E_p$ is naturally described in terms of explicit homotopies -- as is the internal notion of contractible space.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of the cyclic nerve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a systematic study of the Hochschild homology, i.e. (the geometric realization of) the cyclic nerve, of $(\infty,1)$-categories (and more generally of category-objects in an $\infty$-category), as a version of factorization homology. In order to do this, we codify $(\infty,1)$-categories in terms of quiver representations in them. By examining a universal instance of such Hochschild homology, we explicitly identify its natural symmetries, and construct a non-stable version of the cyclotomic trace map. Along the way we give a unified account of the cyclic, paracyclic, and epicyclic categories. We also prove that this gives a combinatorial description of the $n=1$ case of factorization homology as presented in [AFR18], which parametrizes $(\infty,1)$-categories by solidly 1-framed stratified spaces.</description>

      <title>Dimension quotients as boundary limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a functor from the category of free presentations of a group to the category of all groups we define the boundary limit as an image of the natural map from limit to colimit. We show that the fourth dimension quotient of a group can be naturally described as the boundary limit of a simply-defined functor.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of modal logic has witnessed tremendous development following the introduction of Kripke semantics. However, recent developments in programming languages and type theory have led to a second way of studying modalities, namely through their categorical semantics. We show how the two correspond.</description>

      <title>Homology and homotopy for arbitrary categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03735v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the prime motivation for topology was Homotopy theory, which captures the general idea of a continuous transformation between two entities, which may be spaces or maps. In later decades, an algebraic formulation of topology was discovered with the development of Homology theory. Some of the deepest results in topology are about the connections between Homotopy and Homology. These results are proved using intricate constructions. This paper re-proves these connections via an axiomatic approach that provides a common ground for homotopy and homology in arbitrary categories. One of the main contributions is a re-interpretation of convexity as an extrinsic rather than intrinsic property. All the axioms and results are applicable for the familiar context of topological spaces. We also provide a recipe for making the axioms come to fruition in arbitrary categories. This creates a complete framework for an algebraic characterization of various categories such as Dynamical systems, Open games, and Fractals, which also preserves a notion of Homotopy.</description>

      <title>Higher categories of push-pull spans, I: Construction and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first part of a project aimed at formalizing Rozansky-Witten models in the functorial field theory framework. Motivated by work of Calaque-Haugseng-Scheimbauer, we construct a family of symmetric monoidal $(\infty,3)$-categories parametrized by an $\infty$-category with finite limits and a functor into symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories, such that the functor admits pushforwards. This $(\infty,3)$-category contains correspondences in the base $\infty$-category equipped with local systems, which compose via a push-pull formula. We apply this general construction to provide an approximation to the $3$-category of Rozansky-Witten models whose existence was conjectured by Kapustin-Rozansky-Saulina; this approximation behaves like a "commutative" version of the conjectured $3$-category and is related to work of Stefanich on higher quasicoherent sheaves.</description>

      <title>Galois descent for motivic theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give necessary conditions for a category fibred in pseudo-abelian additive categories over the classifying topos of a profinite group to be a stack; these conditions are sufficient when the coefficients are $\mathbf{Q}$-linear. This applies to pure motives over a field in the sense of Grothendieck, Deligne-Milne and Andr\'e, to mixed motives in the sense of Nori and to several motivic categories considered in arXiv:1506.08386 [math.AG]. We also give a simple proof of the exactness of a sequence of motivic Galois groups under a Galois extension of the base field, which applies to all the above (Tannakian) situations. Finally, we clarify the construction of the categories of Chow-Lefschetz motives given in arXiv:2302.08327 [math.AG] and simplify the computation of their motivic Galois group in the numerical case.</description>
