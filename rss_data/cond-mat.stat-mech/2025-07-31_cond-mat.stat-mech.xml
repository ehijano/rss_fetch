      <title>Self-propulsion symmetries determine entropy production of active particles with hidden states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy production distinguishes equilibrium from non-equilibrium. Calculating the entropy production rate (EPR) is challenging in systems where some degrees of freedom cannot be observed. Here we introduce a perturbative framework to calculate the ``partial EPR'' of a canonical hidden-state system, a generic self-propelled active particle with hidden self-propulsion. We find that the parity symmetry, P, and (time-)reversibility, T, of the hidden variable determine partial entropy production. Non-trivial entropy production appears at least at sixth order in the self-propulsion velocity. We apply our framework to two processes which break P- and T-symmetries respectively: an asymmetric telegraph process and diffusion with stochastic resetting.</description>

      <title>Configurational density of states of finite classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, using a microcanonical framework, we provide an explicit inversion formula that allows the calculation of the configurational density of states from the total density of states without resorting to the inversion of the Laplace transform. From this formula, several results can be obtained for the thermodynamics of classical systems composed of a few degrees of freedom, while at the same time recovering the well-known behavior in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Configurational density of states of power-law potentials and the virial theorem in steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief note, the configurational density of states of a system of particles interacting via power-law pair potentials is computed exactly. The result is consistent with a constant microcanonical heat capacity. The well-known form of the virial theorem for this class of systems is recovered using only the obtained configurational density of states, and shown to be valid beyond the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, in general steady states.</description>

      <title>Decorated Clusters and Geometrical Frustration in Cluster Spin Glass: A Random Graph Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory to investigate how geometrically frustrated clusters that become decorated affect the Cluster Spin Glass phase. The cluster structure is assumed to be a tetrahedron composed of Ising spins with z-anisotropy placed at its vertices that interact antiferromagnetically. We consider the probability $1-p_J$ of finding an impurity at a vertex of the tetrahedron that interacts ferromagnetically with the remaining elements inside the tetrahedron. An intercluster disorder is added as a random Gaussian interaction. The order parameters are obtained using the sparse random graph technique, which introduces the connectivity of the network of clusters as a controllable parameter in the theory. We examine changes that occur in the Cluster Spin Glass phase as a function of $p_J$ and $c$, in addition to the antiferromagnetic intracluster couplings $J_1$. For intermediate values of $p_J$, unexpected results appear. Even when some clusters contain a ferromagnetic impurity, there will still be robust geometric frustration effects in the cluster network. However, the $p_J$ threshold for this to occur depends on connectivity. Conversely, below this threshold, reduced GF effects favor the reappearance of the CSG phase. Furthermore, the Curie-Weiss temperature $\Theta_W$ has a gradual change of signal, indicating that the effects of the impurities extend to the paramagnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Fermion Sign Problem from the Structure of Lee-Yang Zeros. I. The Form of Partition Function for Indistinguishable Particles and Its Zeros at 0~K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To simulate indistinguishable particles, recent studies of path-integral molecular dynamics formulated their partition function $Z$ as a recurrence relation involving a variable $\xi$, with $\xi=1$(-1) for bosons (fermions). Inspired by Lee-Yang phase transition theory, we extend $\xi$ into the complex plane and reformulate $Z$ as a polynomial in $\xi$. By analyzing the distribution of the partition function zeros, we gain insights into the analytical properties of indistinguishable particles, particularly regarding the fermion sign problem (FSP). We found that at 0~K, the partition function zeros for $N$-particles are located at $\xi=-1$, $-1/2$, $-1/3$, $\cdots$, $-1/(N-1)$. This distribution disrupts the analytic continuation of thermodynamic quantities, expressed as functions of $\xi$ and typically performed along $\xi=1\to-1$, whenever the paths intersect these zeros. Moreover, we highlight the zero at $\xi = -1$, which induces an extra term in the free energy of the fermionic systems compared to ones at other $\xi=e^{i\theta}$ values. If a path connects this zero to a bosonic system with identical potential energies, it brings a transition resembling a phase transition. These findings provide a fresh perspective on the successes and challenges of emerging FSP studies based on analytic continuation techniques.</description>

      <title>What is the topological dual of the XXZ spin Chain?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a dual symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Hamiltonian for the $U(1)$ symmetric anisotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain-a model that has traditionally been used to study spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases, with an intervening extended Luttinger liquid phase. By performing a non-local unitary transformation, we explicitly construct a local fermionic Hamiltonian that exhibits two nontrivial topological phases separated by an extended Luttinger liquid regime. We demonstrate the topological nature of these phases by analyzing the entanglement structure, deriving a non-local string order parameter, and constructing an exact zero mode operator that connects states in different fermionic parity sectors.</description>

      <title>Rheological modeling with GENERIC and with the Onsager principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compare three frameworks for modeling flows of complex fluids: (i) local conservations of mass, momentum and energy, (ii) GENERIC, and (iii) Onsager principle. The first is based on the mass, momentum, and energy conservation implied by mechanics, the second on the observed approach of externally unforced fluids to equilibrium states at which their behavior is well described by equilibrium thermodynamics, and the third on the minimal resistance to external influences. The comparison is illustrated on isothermal and incompressible polymeric fluids.</description>

      <title>What the Boltzmann money game teaches us about statistical mechanics (and maybe economics)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note explains why a large class of fair, or reversible "money games", i.e., stochastic models of wealth redistribution among agents, lead to steady states described by canonical and microcanonical distributions. The games considered include, for example, ones where more than two agents can be simultaneously involved in money transfers (similarly to many-body collisions in chemical kinetics) and where amounts transferred between agents are random. At the same time, money games that break time reversal symmetry can also lead to the canonical/microcanonical distributions, as illustrated by an explicit example.</description>

      <title>Opinion formation in Wikipedia Ising networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study properties of opinion formation
  on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article
  is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of
  one article to another generating a directed network
  of a given language edition with millions of nodes.
  Ising spins are placed at each node
  and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote
  of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only
  a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down
  while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no
  effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by
  an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized
  steady-state phase.
  This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations
  induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process.
  The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides
  opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of
  this Ising Network
  Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between
  political leaders, world countries and social concepts.
  This approach is also generalized to the competition between
  three groups of
  different opinions described by three colors, for example
  Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China
  within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025.
  We argue that this approach provides a generic description of
  opinion formation in various complex networks.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Quantum Many-Body Scar Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel non-equilibrium phase -- the quantum many-body scar (QMBS) phase -- that emerges in non-Hermitian many-body dynamics when scarred wavefunctions are selectively stabilized via non-Hermitian driving. Projective measurements, or non-Hermitian counterparts, preferentially reinforce QMBS, counteracting the entropy growth that drives thermalization. As a result, atypical, high-energy scarred wavefunctions that are negligible in the long-time dynamics of closed systems become non-equilibrium steady states. We establish the existence of the QMBS phase and its sharp, first-order phase transition from an ergodic thermal phase, through both analytical arguments and numerical simulations of three representative models: a random quantum circuit model, the $SU(q)$ spin model, and the paradigmatic spin-1 XY model.</description>

      <title>Active spin model for cell assemblies on 1D substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental use of micropatterned quasi-1D substrates has emerged as an useful experimental tool to study the nature of cell-cell interactions and gain insight on collective behaviour of cell colonies. Inspired by these experiments, we propose an active spin model to investigate the emergent properties of the cell assemblies. The lattice gas model incorporates the interplay of self-propulsion, polarity directional switching, intra-cellular attraction, and contact Inhibition Locomotion (CIL). In the absence of vacancies, which corresponds to a confluent cell packing on the substrate, the model reduces to an equilibrium spin model which can be solved exactly. In the presence of vacancies, the clustering is controlled by a dimensionless Peclet Number, Q - the ratio of magnitude of self-propulsion rate and directional switching rate of particles. In the absence of CIL interactions, we invoke a mapping to Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn(KLS) model to determine an exact analytical form of the cluster size distribution in the limit Q &lt;&lt; 1. In the limit of Q &gt;&gt; 1, the cluster size distribution exhibits an universal scaling behaviour (in an approximate sense), such that the distribution function can be expressed as a scaled function of Q, particle density and CIL interaction strength. We characterize the phase behaviour of the system in terms of contour plots of average cluster size. The average cluster size exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on CIL interaction strength, attractive interaction strength, and self-propulsion.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative memory model inspired by the theory of amorphous solids, where binary neural states are replaced by unit vectors $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ on the sphere $S^2$. The generalized Hebbian learning rule creates a block-structured weight matrix through outer products of stored pattern vectors, analogous to the Hessian matrix structure in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that this model exhibits quantifiable structural properties characteristic of disordered materials: energy landscapes with deep minima for stored patterns versus random configurations (energy gaps $\sim 7$ units), strongly anisotropic correlations encoded in the weight matrix (anisotropy ratios $\sim 10^2$), and order-disorder transitions controlled by the pattern density $\gamma = P/(N \cdot d)$. The enhanced memory capacity ($\gamma_c \approx 0.55$ for a fully-connected network) compared to binary networks ($\gamma_c \approx 0.138$) and the emergence of orientational correlations establish connections between associative memory mechanisms and amorphous solid physics, particularly in systems with continuous orientational degrees of freedom. We also unveil the scaling with the coordination number $Z$ of the memory capacity: $\gamma_c \sim (Z-6)$ from the isostatic point $Z_c =6$ of the 3D elastic network, which closely mirrors the scaling of the shear modulus $G \sim (Z-6)$ in 3D central-force spring networks.</description>

      <title>Non-classicality at equilibrium and efficient predictions under non-commuting charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system can conserve non-commuting observables, but the consequences of this phenomenon on relaxation are still not fully understood. We investigate this problem by leveraging an observable-dependent approach to equilibration and thermalization in isolated quantum systems. We extend such approach to scenarios with non-commuting charges, and show that it can accurately estimate the equilibrium distribution of coarse observables without access to the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Our predictions do not require weak coupling and are not restricted to local observables, thus providing an advantage over the non-Abelian thermal state. Within this approach, weak values and quasiprobability distributions emerge naturally and play a crucial role in characterizing the equilibrium distributions of observables. We show and numerically confirm that, due to charges' non-commutativity, these weak values can be anomalous even at equilibrium, which has been proven to be a proxy for non-classicality. Our work thus uncovers a novel connection between the relaxation of observables under non-commuting charges, weak values, and Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distributions.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions dependence of the phase transition in the quantum Newman-Moore model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the triangular plaquette model (TPM, also known as the Newman-Moore model) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field on a lattice with periodic boundaries in both spatial dimensions. We consider specifically the approach to the ground state phase transition of this quantum TPM (QTPM, or quantum Newman-Moore model) as a function of the system size and type of boundary conditions. Using cellular automata methods, we obtain a full characterization of the minimum energy configurations of the TPM for arbitrary tori sizes. For the QTPM, we use these cycle patterns to obtain the symmetries of the model, which we argue determine its quantum phase transition: we find it to be a first-order phase transition, with the addition of spontaneous symmetry breaking for system sizes which have degenerate classical ground states. For sizes accessible to numerics, we also find that this classification is consistent with exact diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Cellular automata in $d$ dimensions and ground states of spin models in $(d+1)$ dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08059v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the trajectories of $d$-dimensional cellular automata (CA) can be used to determine the ground states of $(d+1)$-dimensional classical spin models, and we characterise their quantum phase transition, when in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. For each of the 256 one-dimensional elementary CA we explicitly construct the simplest local two-dimensional classical spin model associated to the given CA, and we also describe this method for $d&gt;1$ through selected examples. We illustrate our general observations with detailed studies of: (i) the $d=1$ CA Rule 150 and its $d=2$ four-body plaquette spin model, (ii) the $d=2$ CA whose associated model is the $d=3$ square-pyramid plaquette model, and (iii) two counter-propagating $d=1$ Rule 60 CA that correspond to the two-dimensional Baxter-Wu spin model. For the quantum spin models, we show that the connection to CAs implies a sensitivity on the approach to the thermodynamic limit via finite size scaling for their quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Biologically relevant finite-size effects in a driven lattice gas with particle pausing and dynamical defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we present a comprehensive study of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with pausing particles (pTASEP), a model initially introduced to describe RNAP dynamics during transcription. We extend previous mean-field approaches and demonstrate that the pTASEP is equivalent to the exclusion process with dynamical defects (ddTASEP), thus broadening the scope of our investigation to a larger class of problems related to transcription and translation. We extend the mean-field theory to the open boundary case, revealing the system's phase diagram and critical values of entry and exit rates. However, we identify a significant discrepancy between theory and simulations in a region of the parameter space, indicating severe finite-size effects. To address this, we develop a single-cluster approximation that captures the relationship between current and lattice size, providing a more accurate representation of the system's dynamics. Finally, we extend our approach to open boundary conditions, demonstrating its applicability in different scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of considering finite-size effects, often overlooked in the literature, when modelling biological processes such as transcription and translation.</description>

      <title>The quantum Newman-Moore model in a longitudinal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09235v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.</description>

      <title>Exact solvability of an Ising-type model, and exact solvability of the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</description>

      <title>Universal exotic dynamics in critical mesoscopic systems: Simulating the square root of Avogadro's number of spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly demonstrate the universality of critical dynamics through unprecedented large-scale GPU-based simulations of two out-of-equilibrium processes, comparing the behavior of spin-$1/2$ Ising and spin-$1$ Blume-Capel models on a square lattice. In the first protocol, a completely disordered system is instantaneously brought into contact with a thermal bath at the critical temperature, allowing it to evolve until the coherence length exceeds $10^{3}$ lattice spacings. Finite-size effects are negligible due to the mesoscopic scale of the lattice sizes studied, with linear dimensions up to $L=2^{22}$ and $2^{19}$ for the Ising and Blume-Capel models, respectively. Our numerical data, and the subsequent analysis, demonstrate a strong dynamic universality between the two models and provide the most precise estimate to date of the dynamic critical exponent for this universality class, $z = 2.1676(1)$. In the second protocol, we corroborate the role of the universal ratio of dynamic and static length scales in achieving an exponential acceleration in the approach to equilibrium just \emph{above} the critical temperature, through a time-dependent variation of the thermal bath temperature. The results presented in this work leverage our CUDA-based numerical code, breaking the world record for the simulation speed of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>First-passage properties of the jump process with a drift. Two exactly solvable cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the first-passage properties of a jump process with a constant drift, focusing on two key observables: the first-passage time $\tau$ and the number of jumps $n$ before the first-passage event. By mapping the problem onto an effective discrete-time random walk, we derive an exact expression for the Laplace transform of the joint distribution of $\tau$ and $n$ using the generalized Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. This result is then used to analyze the first-passage properties for two exactly solvable cases: (i) both the inter-jump intervals and jump amplitudes are exponentially distributed, and (ii) the inter-jump intervals are exponentially distributed while all jumps have the same fixed amplitude. We show the existence of two distinct regimes governed by the strength of the drift: (i) a survival regime, where the process remains positive indefinitely with finite probability; (ii) an absorption regime, where the first-passage eventually occurs; and (iii) a critical point at the boundary between these two phases. We characterize the asymptotic behavior of survival probabilities in each regime: they decay exponentially to a constant in the survival regime, vanish exponentially fast in the absorption regime, and exhibit power-law decay at the critical point. Furthermore, in the absorption regime, we derive large deviation forms for the marginal distributions of $\tau$ and n. The analytical predictions are validated through extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Nonequilibrium Stochastic Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.</description>

      <title>Time Glasses: Symmetry Broken Chaotic Phase with a Finite Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the time glass, a non-periodic analogue of the discrete time crystal that arises in periodically driven dissipative quantum many-body systems. This phase is defined by two key features: (i) spatial long-range order arising from the spontaneous breaking of an internal symmetry, and (ii) temporally chaotic oscillations of the order parameter, whose lifetime diverges with system size. In other words, a time glass is a state of matter in which all components evolve in a synchronized yet chaotic manner. To characterize the time glass phase, we focus on the spectral gap of the one-cycle (Floquet) Liouvillian, which determines the decay rate of the slowest relaxation mode. Numerical studies of periodically driven dissipative Ising models show that, in the time glass phase, the Liouvillian gap remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, in contrast to time crystals where the gap closes exponentially with system size. We further demonstrate that the Liouvillian gap converges to the decay rate of the order-parameter autocorrelation derived from the classical (mean-field) dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. This result establishes a direct correspondence between microscopic spectral features and emergent macroscopic dynamics in driven dissipative quantum systems. At first glance, the existence of a nonzero Liouvillian gap appears incompatible with the presence of indefinitely persistent chaotic oscillations. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that the quantum R\'enyi divergence between a localized coherent initial state and the highly delocalized steady state grows unboundedly with system size. This divergence allows long-lived transients to persist even in the presence of a finite Liouvillian gap.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

      <title>Random non-Hermitian Hamiltonian framework for symmetry breaking dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose random non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to model the generic stochastic nonlinear dynamics of a quantum state in Hilbert space. Our approach features an underlying linearity in the dynamical equations, ensuring the applicability of techniques used for solving linear systems. Additionally, it offers the advantage of easily incorporating statistical symmetry, a generalization of explicit symmetry to stochastic processes. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to describe real-time dynamics, starting from an initial symmetry-preserving state and evolving into a randomly distributed, symmetry-breaking final state. Our model serves as a quantum framework for the transition process, from disordered states to ordered ones, where symmetry is spontaneously broken.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function collapse, based on a random nonHermitian action where the fermion density operator is coupled to a universal colored noise. Upon quantization, the wave function obeys a nonlinear stochastic differential equation that respects statistical Lorentz symmetry. The localization mechanism is driven by the colored noise, derived from the d'Alembert equation using generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3-dimensional spacetime. We analytically determine the noise-induced localization length, which decreases as the size of the observable universe increases.</description>

      <title>False signatures of non-ergodic behavior in disordered quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.</description>

      <title>Shallow quantum circuit for generating O(1)-entangled approximate state designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science. In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. These resources can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega(\log (t/\epsilon))$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, entanglement, magic, and coherence do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states by transforming $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit, $O(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon))$, is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing. As a concrete example, we propose classical shadow tomography using an estimator with superpositions between only two states, which improves the runtime of a state certification task by requiring only $O(1)$ measurements and queries.</description>
