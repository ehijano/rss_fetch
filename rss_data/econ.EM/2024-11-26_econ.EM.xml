      <title>Utilization and Profitability of Tractor Services for Maize Farming in Ejura-Sekyedumase Municipality, Ghana</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maize farming is a major livelihood activity for many farmers in Ghana. Unfortunately, farmers usually do not obtain the expected returns on their investment due to reliance on rudimentary, labor-intensive, and inefficient methods of production. Using cross-sectional data from 359 maize farmers, this study investigates the profitability and determinants of the use of tractor services for maize production in Ejura-Sekyedumase, Ashanti Region of Ghana. Results from descriptive and profitability analyses reveal that tractor services such as ploughing and shelling are widely used, but their profitability varies significantly among farmers. Key factors influencing profitability include farm size, fertilizer quantity applied, and farmer experience. Results from a multivariate probit analysis also showed that farming experience, fertilizer quantity, and profit per acre have a positive influence on tractor service use for shelling, while household size, farm size, and FBO have a negative influence. Farming experience, fertilizer quantity, and profit per acre positively influence tractor service use for ploughing, while farm size has a negative influence. A t-test result reveals a statistically significant difference in profit between farmers who use tractor services and those who do not. Specifically, farmers who utilize tractor services on their maize farm had a return to cost of 9 percent more than those who do not (p-value &lt; 0.05). The Kendall's result showed a moderate agreement among the maize farmers (first ranked being financial issues) in their ability to access/utilize tractor services on their farm.</description>

      <title>Homeopathic Modernization and the Middle Science Trap: conceptual context of ergonomics, econometrics and logic of some national scientific case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article analyses the structural and institutional barriers hindering the development of scientific systems in transition economies, such as Kazakhstan. The main focus is on the concept of the "middle science trap," which is characterized by steady growth in quantitative indicators (publications, grants) but a lack of qualitative advancement. Excessive bureaucracy, weak integration into the international scientific community, and ineffective science management are key factors limiting development. This paper proposes an approach of "homeopathic modernization," which focuses on minimal yet strategically significant changes aimed at reducing bureaucratic barriers and enhancing the effectiveness of the scientific ecosystem. A comparative analysis of international experience (China, India, and the European Union) is provided, demonstrating how targeted reforms in the scientific sector can lead to significant results. Social and cultural aspects, including the influence of mentality and institutional structure, are also examined, and practical recommendations for reforming the scientific system in Kazakhstan and Central Asia are offered. The conclusions of the article could be useful for developing national science modernization programs, particularly in countries with high levels of bureaucracy and conservatism.</description>

      <title>A Supervised Machine Learning Approach for Assessing Grant Peer Review Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer review in grant evaluation informs funding decisions, but the contents of peer review reports are rarely analyzed. In this work, we develop a thoroughly tested pipeline to analyze the texts of grant peer review reports using methods from applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. We start by developing twelve categories reflecting content of grant peer review reports that are of interest to research funders. This is followed by multiple human annotators' iterative annotation of these categories in a novel text corpus of grant peer review reports submitted to the Swiss National Science Foundation. After validating the human annotation, we use the annotated texts to fine-tune pre-trained transformer models to classify these categories at scale, while conducting several robustness and validation checks. Our results show that many categories can be reliably identified by human annotators and machine learning approaches. However, the choice of text classification approach considerably influences the classification performance. We also find a high correspondence between out-of-sample classification performance and human annotators' perceived difficulty in identifying categories. Our results and publicly available fine-tuned transformer models will allow researchers and research funders and anybody interested in peer review to examine and report on the contents of these reports in a structured manner. Ultimately, we hope our approach can contribute to ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of grant peer review.</description>

      <title>Canonical Correlation Analysis: review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over a century canonical correlations, variables, and related concepts have been studied across various fields, with contributions dating back to Jordan [1875] and Hotelling [1936]. This text surveys the evolution of canonical correlation analysis, a fundamental statistical tool, beginning with its foundational theorems and progressing to recent developments and open research problems. Along the way we introduce and review methods, notions, and fundamental concepts from linear algebra, random matrix theory, and high-dimensional statistics, placing particular emphasis on rigorous mathematical treatment.
  The survey is intended for technically proficient graduate students and other researchers with an interest in this area. The content is organized into five chapters, supplemented by six sets of exercises found in Chapter 6. These exercises introduce additional material, reinforce key concepts, and serve to bridge ideas across chapters. We recommend the following sequence: first, solve Problem Set 0, then proceed with Chapter 1, solve Problem Set 1, and so on through the text.</description>

      <title>What events matter for exchange rate volatility ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper expands on stochastic volatility models by proposing a data-driven method to select the macroeconomic events most likely to impact volatility. The paper identifies and quantifies the effects of macroeconomic events across multiple countries on exchange rate volatility using high-frequency currency returns, while accounting for persistent stochastic volatility effects and seasonal components capturing time-of-day patterns. Given the hundreds of macroeconomic announcements and their lags, we rely on sparsity-based methods to select relevant events for the model. We contribute to the exchange rate literature in four ways: First, we identify the macroeconomic events that drive currency volatility, estimate their effects and connect them to macroeconomic fundamentals. Second, we find a link between intraday seasonality, trading volume, and the opening hours of major markets across the globe. We provide a simple labor-based explanation for this observed pattern. Third, we show that including macroeconomic events and seasonal components is crucial for forecasting exchange rate volatility. Fourth, our proposed model yields the lowest volatility and highest Sharpe ratio in portfolio allocations when compared to standard SV and GARCH models.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Optimal Treatment Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.01047v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic decisions are pivotal to economic policy making. We show how existing evidence from randomized control trials can be utilized to guide personalized decisions in challenging dynamic environments with budget and capacity constraints. Recent advances in reinforcement learning now enable the solution of many complex, real-world problems for the first time. We allow for restricted classes of policy functions and prove that their regret decays at rate n^(-0.5), the same as in the static case. Applying our methods to job training, we find that by exploiting the problem's dynamic structure, we achieve significantly higher welfare compared to static approaches.</description>

      <title>Changes-in-Changes for Ordered Choice Models: Too Many "False Zeros"?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Difference-in-Differences model for discrete, ordered outcomes, building upon elements from a continuous Changes-in-Changes model. We focus on outcomes derived from self-reported survey data eliciting socially undesirable, illegal, or stigmatized behaviors like tax evasion or substance abuse, where too many "false zeros", or more broadly, underreporting are likely. We start by providing a characterization for parallel trends within a general threshold-crossing model. We then propose a partial and point identification framework for different distributional treatment effects when the outcome is subject to underreporting. Applying our methodology, we investigate the impact of recreational marijuana legalization for adults in several U.S. states on the short-term consumption behavior of 8th-grade high-school students. The results indicate small, but significant increases in consumption probabilities at each level. These effects are further amplified upon accounting for misreporting.</description>

      <title>Wild inference for wild SVARs with application to heteroscedasticity-based IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural vector autoregressions are used to compute impulse response functions (IRF) for persistent data. Existing multiple-parameter inference requires cumbersome pretesting for unit roots, cointegration, and trends with subsequent stationarization. To avoid pretesting, we propose a novel \emph{dependent wild bootstrap} procedure for simultaneous inference on IRF using local projections (LP) estimated in levels in possibly \emph{nonstationary} and \emph{heteroscedastic} SVARs. The bootstrap also allows efficient smoothing of LP estimates.
  We study IRF to US monetary policy identified using FOMC meetings count as an instrument for heteroscedasticity of monetary shocks. We validate our method using DSGE model simulations and alternative SVAR methods.</description>
