      <title>Permutation of Tensor-Train Cores for Computing Moments on Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks, particularly the tensor train (TT) format, have emerged as powerful tools for high-dimensional computations in physics and computer science. In solving coupled differential equations, such as those arising from stochastic differential equations (SDEs) via duality relations, ordering the TT cores significantly influences numerical accuracy. In this study, we first systematically investigate how different orderings of the TT cores affect the accuracy of computed moments using the duality relation in stochastic processes. Through numerical experiments on a two-body interaction model, we demonstrate that specific orderings of the TT cores yield lower relative errors, particularly when they align with the underlying interaction structure of the system. Motivated by these findings, we then propose a novel quantitative measure, $score$, which is defined based on an ordering of the TT cores and an SDE parameter set. While the score is independent of the accuracy of moments to compute by definition, we assess its effectiveness by evaluating the accuracy of computed moments. Our results indicate that orderings that minimize the score tend to yield higher accuracy. This study provides insights into optimizing orderings of the TT cores, which is essential for efficient and reliable high-dimensional simulations of stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware electronic density-functional distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for the estimation of uncertainties in density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations for atomistic systems. The method is based on the construction of an uncertainty-aware functional distribution (UAFD) in a space spanned by a few different exchange-correlation functionals and is illustrated at the level of generalized-gradient-approximation functionals. The UAFD provides reliable estimates of errors -- compared to experiments or higher-quality calculations -- in calculations performed self-consistently with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. The scheme furthermore allows for a decomposition of the error into a systematic bias and a reduced error. The approach is applied to four different properties: molecular atomization energies, cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli of solids. The probability distribution can be tailored to optimize the prediction of a single property or for several properties simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Policy heterogeneity improves collective olfactory search in 3-D turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of policy heterogeneity in enhancing the olfactory search capabilities of cooperative agent swarms operating in complex, real-world turbulent environments. Using odor fields from direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations, we demonstrate that heterogeneous groups, with exploratory and exploitative agents, consistently outperform homogeneous swarms where the exploration-exploitation tradeoff is managed at the individual level. Our results reveal that policy diversity enables the group to reach the odor source more efficiently by mitigating the detrimental effects of spatial correlations in the signal. These findings provide new insights into collective search behavior in biological systems and offer promising strategies for the design of robust, bioinspired search algorithms in engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks as a tool for epileptic seizures forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10184v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evidence indicates that intracranial EEG connectivity, as estimated from daily resting state recordings from epileptic patients, may be capable of identifying preictal states. In this study, we employed hyperbolic embedding of brain networks to capture non-trivial patterns that discriminate between connectivity networks from days with (preictal) and without (interictal) seizure. A statistical model was constructed by combining hyperbolic geometry and machine learning tools, which allowed for the estimation of the probability of an upcoming seizure. The results demonstrated that representing brain networks in a hyperbolic space enabled an accurate discrimination (85%) between interictal (no-seizure) and preictal (seizure within the next 24 hours) states. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent prediction performances, with an overall accuracy of 87% and an F1-score of 89% (mean Brier score and Brier skill score of 0.12 and 0.37, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicate that representations of brain connectivity in a latent geometry space can reveal a daily and reliable signature of the upcoming seizure(s), thus providing a promising biomarker for seizure forecasting.</description>

      <title>Towards Monte Carlo based Full Spectrum Modeling of Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This monograph presents advancements in Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS), a critical tool for emergency response to radiological incidents such as severe nuclear accidents or nuclear weapon detonations. Current AGRS calibration and data evaluation methods struggle to accurately quantify many radioactive materials expected in radiological emergencies, limiting the risk assessment and, hence, the effectiveness of emergency response actions. To address these limitations, this work introduces a full spectrum numerical modeling approach that features three key innovations: high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations that combine an advanced scintillation physics model with detailed geometric representations of the aircraft and detector system; a surrogate model that replicates the Monte Carlo simulations with significantly reduced computation time; and a data evaluation methodology that leverages the surrogate model within a Bayesian inversion framework, enabling the quantification of arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. The methodology presented here, rigorously validated through laboratory and field measurements, achieves not only a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over traditional methods but also substantially expands the operational capabilities of AGRS systems for both emergency response scenarios and geophysical surveys. These innovations lay the groundwork for establishing a new global standard for AGRS, ultimately supporting better-informed protective actions and reducing health risks during radiological emergencies.</description>

      <title>Towards energy-insensitive and robust neutron/gamma classification: a learning-based frequency-domain parametric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron/gamma discrimination has been intensively researched in recent years, due to its unique scientific value and widespread applications. With the advancement of detection materials and algorithms, nowadays we can achieve fairly good discrimination. However, further improvements rely on better utilization of detector raw signals, especially energy-independent pulse characteristics. We begin by discussing why figure-of-merit (FoM) is not a comprehensive criterion for high-precision neutron/gamma discriminators, and proposing a new evaluation method based on adversarial sampling. Inspired by frequency-domain analysis in existing literature, parametric linear/nonlinear models with minimum complexity are created, upon the discrete spectrum, with tunable parameters just as neural networks. We train the models on an open-source neutron/gamma dataset (CLYC crystals with silicon photomultipliers) preprocessed by charge normalization to discover and exploit energy-independent features. The performance is evaluated on different sampling rates and noise levels, in comparison with the frequency classification index and conventional methods. The frequency-domain parametric models show higher accuracy and better adaptability to variations of data integrity than other discriminators. The proposed method is also promising for online inference on economical hardware and portable devices.</description>
