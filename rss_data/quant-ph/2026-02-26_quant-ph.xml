      <title>A Physics-Informed Neuro-Fuzzy Framework for Quantum Error Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum processors scale beyond 100 qubits, distinguishing software bugs from stochastic hardware noise becomes a critical diagnostic challenge. We present a neuro-fuzzy framework that addresses this attribution problem by combining Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) with physics-grounded feature engineering. We introduce the Bhattacharyya Veto, a hard physical constraint grounded in the Data Processing Inequality that prevents the classifier from attributing topologically impossible output distributions to noise. Validated on IBM's 156-qubit Heron r2 processor (ibm_fez) across 105 circuits spanning 17 algorithm families, the framework achieves 89.5% effective accuracy (+/- 5.9% CI). The system implements a safe failure mode, flagging 14.3% of ambiguous cases for manual review rather than forcing low-confidence predictions. We resolve key ambiguities -- such as distinguishing correct Grover amplification from bug-induced collapse -- and identify fundamental limits of single-basis diagnostics, including a Z-basis blind spot where phase-flip errors remain statistically invisible. This work establishes a robust, interpretable diagnostic layer that prevents error mitigation techniques from being applied to logically flawed circuits.</description>

      <title>Random Acceleration Noise on Stern-Gerlach Interferometry in a Harmonic Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze decoherence in a one-loop Stern--Gerlach--type matter-wave interferometer for a massive nanoparticle embedded with a nitrogen vacancy (NV)-centred nanodiamond evolving under an effective harmonic-oscillator dynamics in a magnetic-field gradient. We assume that the Stern-Gerlach interferometer is subjected to a random acceleration noise external to the system. This could be along the direction of the superposition at an angle which can be varied. We quantify dephasing from two noise channels: fluctuations in the external acceleration $a(t)$ magnitude and direction as specified by the tilt angle $\theta_0(t)$ between the superposition axis and the acceleration. At the level of the action, we treat these two external noise as stochastic inputs, and compute the resulting stochastic arm-phase difference, and obtain the dephasing rate $\Gamma$ using the Wiener--Khinchin theorem. For a white noise and a coherence target $\Gamma \tau\leq 1$ and by assuming that we finish the one-loop interferometer within $\tau=2\pi/\omega_0\simeq 0.015~\mathrm{s}$, for a reasonable choice of the magnetic field gradient, $\eta_0=6\times 10^{3}~\mathrm{T\,m^{-1}}$ and mass of the nanodiamond, $m=10^{-15}~\mathrm{kg}$) to create a superposition size of $\Delta x\sim 1$nm. We find $\sqrt{\mathcal{S}_{aa}}\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-11})~\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ even if we take the external acceleration, $a=0~{\rm ms^{-2}}$ and $\theta_0=0^\circ$ (along the dirction of the superposition), and $\sqrt{\mathcal{S}_{\theta\theta}}\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-10})~\mathrm{rad\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ for $a=g= 9.81~\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$ and $\theta_0=0^\circ$ (superposition direction is perpendicular to the Earth's gravity). We have also found an operating regime where the acceleration noise can be minimized by either varying $\theta_0$ or $a$ for a fixed set of other experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Teleportation transition of surface codes on a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological surface code is a leading candidate for harnessing long-range entanglement to protect logical quantum information against errors, and teleportation of logical states is desirable for robust quantum information processing. Nevertheless, scaling up the surface code in quantum teleportation poses a formidable challenge to experiment. Here on a superconducting quantum processor with 125 qubits, we demonstrate the robust teleportation of topological rotated surface code prepared by a linear-depth unitary circuit, with code distances up to 7. We obtain the teleportation phase diagram by tuning the local entangling gates uniformly across a finite threshold. Furthermore, we show that the entangling threshold can be boosted by coherent qubit rotations that inject magic resources beyond the Clifford regime, restoring the duality symmetry of the topological phase, which serves as a guiding principle to minimize the entanglement resource. Our results shed light on simulating and leveraging topological quantum matter on quantum devices, and pave the way to the ultimate goal of distributed fault tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Optical repumping and atom number balancing in a two-color MOT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a novel repumping transition for $^{88}$Sr atoms trapped in a 'blue' magneto-optical trap. We show that, while the repumping efficiency is about three orders of magnitude smaller than for traditional schemes, it is sufficient for recycling all atoms, provided the repumping laser beams are arranged to form a 'green' magneto- optical trap (MOT) helping to cool and confine the atoms and preventing their loss. Our main findings are: (i) that the green MOT configuration is able to trap 10 times more atoms in the blue MOT than using the green transition merely as a repump, and (ii) that the atom numbers in the two-color MOT can be balanced through experimental control parameters. The interest of this scheme lies in its capability of reaching low temperature and its suitability for continuous atomic beam generation.</description>

      <title>The Inverse Born Rule Fallacy: On the Informational Limits of Phase-Locked Amplitude Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Quantum Finance, amplitude encoding is often motivated by its logarithmic storage capacity arXiv:1307.0411. This paradigm typically relies on the mapping $\psi = \sqrt{P}$, treating the quantum state as a derivative of a classical probability distribution $P$. By restricting the data manifold to the positive real orthant $\mathcal{S}^+$, the accessible Hilbert space is effectively abelianized, rendering the representation ``phase-deaf''. We rigorously establish that while $P$ is a projection of $|\psi|^2$, the simple square-root mapping fails to recover the non-commutative structure necessary for genuine quantum advantage in classification tasks. Furthermore, we clarify why applying basis changes (like Hadamard gates) to these states fails to replicate the computational power of active phase-kickback mechanisms. Finally, we advocate for Dynamical Hamiltonian Encoding (based on QIFT), where data generates non-commutative evolution rather than serving as a static, phase-locked vector.</description>

      <title>Assessing quantum coherence in quantum annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demonstrating genuine many-body quantum coherence in large-scale quantum processors remains a central challenge for near-term quantum technologies. Recent experiments on D-Wave quantum annealers have investigated quenches of Ising chains and observed defect densities that show Kibble-Zurek scaling, consistent with coherent quantum dynamics. However, identical scaling can arise from classical or thermal processes. Here we propose the use of many-body coherent oscillations (MBCO) as a diagnostic for the identification of system-wide coherence in analog quantum simulators. Solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, we show that quenches of a staggered one-dimensional Ising chain across a quantum critical point produce oscillatory signatures in defect observables. We implement this model on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer. Using fast-anneal protocols, we find that, although defect densities follow Kibble-Zurek scaling, the expected oscillatory behavior is absent. We demonstrate that static disorder associated with individual qubits is not likely responsible for the absence of MBCO. Modest modifications to annealing schedules can dramatically enhance oscillation visibility. This work gives a general roadmap for the search for quantum coherence in noisy, large-scale quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Natural Qubit Algebra: clarification of the Clifford boundary and new non-embeddability theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Natural Qubit Algebra (NQA), a compact real operator calculus for qubit systems based on a $2\times2$ block alphabet $\{I,X,Z,W\}\subset\mathrm{Mat}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and tensor-word representations. The resulting multiplication law induces a canonical $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^{2m}$-grading with a bicharacter that controls commutation signs, placing the framework naturally within the theory of color-graded and Clifford-type algebras.
  Within this language, we provide: (i) an explicit real Clifford normal form for two-qubit operators via the identification $\mathrm{Mat}(4,\mathbb{R})\cong\mathrm{Cl}(2,2;\mathbb{R})$; (ii) a purely algebraic reformulation of the Bell--CHSH scenario, where the quantum violation is expressed as a spectral non-embeddability of a noncommutative spinor algebra into any commutative Kolmogorov algebra; and (iii) compact factored representations of the Bernstein--Vazirani and Grover phase oracles, showing that both Clifford and non-Clifford examples can admit similarly structured symbolic descriptions.
  We clarify that Grover's iterate remains outside the Clifford group due to its continuous spectral rotation, consistent with the Gottesman--Knill theorem, while retaining a compact tensor-block form in NQA. The framework isolates spectral, algebraic, and syntactic aspects of operator structure, providing a graded operator language compatible with standard quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Markovian Embeddings of Non-Markovian Open System Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding non-Markovian open quantum dynamics into an enlarged Markovian space offers a powerful route to nonperturbative simulations, where the dynamics of the extended space can be governed by multiple distinct Markovian equations. We show that these distinct embeddings arise from different unravelings of Gaussian bath self-energies, generating a family of deterministic, time-local equations for the extended system. Using the Brownian-oscillator spectral density as an illustrative example, we clarify the relationships among existing approaches, including the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) and the Lindblad--pseudomode formalism, and demonstrate how this framework enables numerically stable and efficient simulations. This work provides both a transparent theoretical foundation for embedding techniques and a flexible platform for developing new methods to simulate non-Markovian quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological phase dynamics described by overtone-synthesized classical and quantum Adler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adler equation is a well-known one-dimensional model describing phase locking and synchronization. Motivated by recent experiments using optomechanical oscillators, we extend the model to include overtone-synthesized sinusoidal coupling with adiabatic temporal modulation. This extension gives rise to unique topological features such as winding-number quantization, discontinuous phase-slip transitions, and hysteretic and non-reciprocal phase dynamics. We further extend the analysis to the quantum regime, where we find a counterintuitive result: the breakdown of winding-number quantization. This arises from the superposition of different winding-number states in a closed-space Thouless pump. Moreover, hysteretic dynamics, once eliminated in quantum adiabatic approximation, is recovered in non-adiabatic calculations, as the superposition of two Floquet states with different PT eigenvalues becomes the quantum counterpart of phase trajectory.</description>

Abstract: We study the fully entangled fraction of quantum states based on the Bloch representation of density matrices. Analytical upper bounds on the fully entangled fraction are obtained for arbitrary $d\otimes d$ bipartite systems. The fully entangled fractions for classes of $d\otimes d$ quantum states are analytically derived. Detailed examples are given to illustrate the advantages of our results.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-Inhomogeneity Competition in Discrete-Time Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between nonlinearity and inhomogeneities in discrete-time quantum walks on one-dimensional lattices. Nonlinear effects are introduced through a Kerr-like, intensity-dependent local phase, while spatial and temporal inhomogeneities are implemented via random variations of the quantum gate operations. By analyzing typical quantities, such as the return probability and the participation function, we identify distinct quantum walking regimes as the nonlinear parameter $\chi$ and the quantum gate parameter $\theta$ are varied. Spatial inhomogeneities weaken nonlinear self-trapping and constrict the region of robust localization. In this process, partially localized regimes emerge, characterized by the coexistence of a confined core and dispersive wave-packet components. In contrast, temporal inhomogeneities act as time-dependent perturbations that continuously disrupt the phase coherence required for self-trapped excitation, thereby enhancing dispersive emission and promoting delocalization. By using $\chi$ versus $\theta$ diagrams, we display a comprehensive characterization of how inhomogeneities modify the stability and extent of prevailing dynamical regimes, elucidating the competition between nonlinearity and inhomogeneities in discrete-time quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Passive Synchronization of Nonlocal Franson Interferometry for Fiber-Based Quantum Networks Using Co-propagating Classical Clock Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a robust, high-visibility nonlocal Franson interferometry for fiber-based quantum networks by co-propagating a classical Radio-over-Fiber clock signal with energy-time entangled photon pairs in the same fiber. Utilizing cross-band allocation (O-band for classical, L-band for quantum signals), the spontaneous Raman scattering noise photons are effectively suppressed. At the same time, their environmental delay fluctuations remain highly correlated for common-mode noise cancellation, achieving a passive synchronization with picoseconds precision. Over 50 km of single-mode fiber, this co-propagation enables nonlocal quantum interference with a visibility of (88.35\pm3.62)%, without relying on external dedicated timing infrastructure. This work provides a practical, scalable synchronization solution for metropolitan-scale entanglement-based quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Universal Sample Complexity Bounds in Quantum Learning Theory via Fisher Information matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the sample complexity (equivalently, the number of measurements) required in quantum learning theory within a general parametric framework, is fundamentally governed by the inverse Fisher information matrix. More specifically, we derive upper and lower bounds on the number of samples required to estimate the parameters of a quantum system within a prescribed small additive error and with high success probability under maximum likelihood estimation. The upper bound is governed by the supremum of the largest diagonal entry of the inverse Fisher information matrix, while the lower bound is characterized by any diagonal element evaluated at arbitrary parameter values. We then apply the general bounds to Pauli channel learning and to the estimation of Pauli expectation values in the asymptotic small-error regime, and recover the previously established sample complexity through considerably streamlined derivations. Furthermore, we identify the structural origin of exponential sample complexity in Pauli channel learning without entanglement and in Pauli expectation value estimation without quantum memory. We then extend the analysis to an error criterion based on the Euclidean distance between the true parameter values and their estimators. We derive the corresponding upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity, which are likewise characterized by the inverse Fisher information matrix. As an application, we consider Pauli expectation estimation with entangled probes. Finally, we highlight two fundamental contributions to quantum learning theory. First, we establish a systematic framework that determines the task-independent sample complexity under maximum-likelihood estimation. Second, we show that, in the small-error regime, learning sample complexity is governed by the inverse Fisher information matrix.</description>

      <title>Optimized ancillary drive for fast Rydberg entangling gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaching fast and robust two-qubit gates with low infidelities has been an outstanding challenge for the long-term goal of useful quantum computers. Typically, optimizing the pulse shapes can minimize the gate infidelity and improve its robustness to certain types of errors; yet it remains incapable of speeding up the gate execution time which is fundamentally restricted by the attainable Rabi frequency in a realistic setup. In this work, we develop a fast implementation of two-qubit CZ gates using optimized ancillary drive to enhance the two-photon Rabi frequency between the ground and Rydberg states.This ancillary drive can work in an error-robustness framework without increasing the original gate infidelity in the absence of the drive. Considering the experimentally feasible parameters for $^{87}$Rb atoms, we demonstrate that the execution time required for such CZ gates can be shortened by more than 30$\%$ as compared to standard two-photon protocols arising the gate fidelity above 0.9954 by taking account of all relevant error sources. Our results reduce the high-power laser requirement and unlock the potential toward fast, high-fidelity quantum operations for large-scale quantum computation with neutral atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will provide a complete derivation of the decoherence rate for a magnetic nanoparticle in quantum superposition in the presence of the fluctuating electromagnetic field in a thermal background by using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in the long-wavelength limit. The long-wavelength limit assumes that the superposition size is much smaller than the wavelength of the electromagentic filed fluctuations. We will extend this computation to two diamagnetic nanoparticles kept in quantum superposition adjacent to each other. We will also show how the drag force on a single nanoparticle arises from external electromagnetic-field fluctuations, and compare our results with those for the nanoparticle's dielectric properties.</description>

      <title>Efficient time-series prediction on NISQ devices via time-delayed quantum extreme learning machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proposed a time-delayed quantum extreme learning machine (TD-QELM) for efficient time-series prediction on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. By encoding multiple past inputs simultaneously, TD-QELM achieves shallow circuit depth independent of sequence length, thereby, mitigating noise accumulation and reducing computational complexity. Experiments using the NARMA benchmark on both noiseless simulations and IBM's 127-qubit processor demonstrate that TD-QELM consistently outperforms conventional quantum reservoir computing in prediction accuracy and noise robustness. These results highlight TD-QELM as a practical and scalable framework for time-series learning on current NISQ hardware.</description>

      <title>Passive Environment-Assisted Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum information systems mature, efficient and coherent transfer of quantum information through noisy channels becomes increasingly important. We examine how passive environment-assisted quantum communication enhances direct quantum information transfer efficiency. A bosonic pure-loss channel, modeled as transmission through a beam splitter with a vacuum input state at the dark port, has zero quantum capacity when transmissivity is below 50%. Quantum communication through the channel can be enhanced by passive environment assistance, achieved via the selection of an appropriate input state for the ancilla port. Although ideal Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states enable perfect quantum information transmission at arbitrarily small transmissivity, they are challenging to realize experimentally. We therefore explore more experimentally accessible non-Gaussian ancilla states, such as Fock, cat, and squeezed cat states, and numerically determine the optimal encoding and decoding strategies. We also construct analytical schemes that yield high-fidelity transmission and good information rates.</description>

      <title>Performance Comparison of QAOA Mixers for Ternary Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm proposed for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and is regarded as a promising approach to combinatorial optimization problems, with potential applications in the financial sector. In this study, we apply QAOA to the portfolio optimization problem, which is one of the central challenges in financial engineering. A portfolio consists of a combination of multiple assets, and the portfolio optimization problem aims to determine the optimal asset allocation by balancing expected return and risk. In the context of quantum optimization, portfolio optimization is often formulated using discrete variables. Unlike conventional binary formulations, we consider a ternary portfolio optimization problem that accounts for three states-holding, not holding, and short selling-and compare its performance using different mixer operators. Specifically, we implement QAOA with the standard mixer and several XY Mixers (XY Ring, XY Parity Ring, XY Full, and QAMPA), and conducted simulations using real data based on the German stock index (DAX 30) for portfolios consisting of 5 and 8 assets. Furthermore, we introduce noise based on a depolarizing channel to investigate the behavior of the algorithm in realistic environments. The results show that while XY Mixers exhibit superiority in noiseless settings, their advantage degrades in noisy environments, and the optimal choice of mixer depends on both the number of QAOA depths and the noise strength.</description>

      <title>Entanglement recovery by reversing the effect of noise in quantum repeater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to directly recover the degree of entanglement distributed by entanglement swapping in the presence of noise. Our approach introduces a reversing operation that probabilistically undoes the effect of amplitude damping or photon loss on a single entangled pair, enabling heralded recovery of entanglement. We demonstrate that entanglement can be substantially recovered even under strong noise, including parameter regimes where the distributed entanglement would otherwise vanish due to entanglement sudden death. We analyze the effectiveness of the protocol in two representative repeater models, i.e.,~two-way and one-way architectures and identify the optimal reversing strategy. Due to its heralded and single-copy nature, our protocol is readily compatible with other entanglement recovery techniques such as entanglement purification and distillation. Our work provides a practical and experimentally feasible way toward robust entanglement distribution in current and near-term quantum repeater architectures.</description>

      <title>Tuning Wave-Particle Duality of Quantum Light by Generalized Photon Subtraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave--particle duality is a hallmark of quantum mechanics. For bosonic systems, there exists a continuum of intermediate states bridging wave-like Schr\"odinger cat states and particle-like Fock states. Such states have recently been recognized as valuable resources for enhancing fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) with propagating light. Here we experimentally demonstrate tunable generation of these intermediate states by employing generalized photon subtraction (GPS). By detecting up to three photons from squeezed-light sources with a photon-number-resolving detector, we continuously control the balance between wave- and particle-like features. This approach allows us to construct a spectral family of quantum states with high generation rates, optimized according to the required fault-tolerance threshold. Our results establish GPS as a versatile toolbox for tailoring non-Gaussian resources, opening a pathway to efficient Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) qubit generation and addressing a central bottleneck in optical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Secret Key Rate Limits in Coexisting Classical-Quantum Optical Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical-quantum coexistence enables cost-effective transmission of data and quantum signals over the same fiber-optic channel. Nevertheless, weak quantum-key distribution (QKD) signals are susceptible to non-linear interference generated from the classical traffic, primarily spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS) and four-wave-mixing (FWM), as well as to unfiltered noise. In QKD protocols, increased channel loss and excess noise both reduce the secret key rates (SKRs), as illustrated in this work for the two-state BB84 and Gaussian-modulated coherent-states (GMCS) protocols. In this study, we derive closed-form expressions for evaluating the accumulated interference power from coexisting classical signals in a quantum frequency channel. Our model enables effective design of classical-quantum systems in single-mode fibers (SMFs), capturing the evolution of interference arising from the relevant physical phenomena. We utilize the model to examine frequency allocation in multiband transmission systems, demonstrating that, contrary to common practice of allocating QKD channels in the O-band, increased SKR is achieved by placing quantum channels in the upper E-/lower S-band across the relevant scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate an infinite hierarchy of continuous-variable separability criteria in terms of quasiprobability distributions and their derivatives evaluated at individual points in phase space. Our approach is equivalent to the Peres--Horodecki criterion and sheds light on how distillable entanglement manifests in the phase-space picture. We demonstrate that already the lowest-order variant constitutes a powerful method for detecting the elusive non-Gaussian entanglement of relevant state families. Further, we devise a simple measurement scheme that relies solely on passive linear transformations and coherent ancillas. By strategically probing specific phase-space regions, our method offers clear advantages over existing techniques that rely on access to the full phase-space distributions.</description>

      <title>Landscape-Similarity-Guided Optimization in QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across diverse synthetic and real-world interaction graphs, the variational landscapes of reduced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) instances obtained via variable freezing exhibit a robust universality. Leveraging this structure, we introduce Doubly Optimized QAOA (DO-QAOA), which lowers runtime and quantum measurement overhead while maintaining a competitive approximation ratio gap (ARG). Adapting the replica-overlap framework of spin-glass physics, we define a landscape-overlap order parameter $q$ to quantify geometric correlations between energy landscapes, revealing a sharp landscape-similarity transition as graph connectivity is tuned. Notwithstanding this transition, the dominant convex features of nearly all conditioned sub-instances remain aligned across both phases. Exploiting this persistence, DO-QAOA collapses the nominal $2^m$ reduced instances generated by freezing $m$ qubits into $K = O(1)$ effective landscape classes, eliminating the exponential proliferation in $m$. By leveraging landscape structure, DO-QAOA provides a scalable route to hybrid quantum-classical optimization under realistic hardware constraints, with potential applicability across variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Imperfect Graphs from Unitary Matrices -- I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix representations of quantum operators are computationally complete but often obscure the structural topology of information flow within a quantum circuit \cite{nielsen2000}. In this paper, we introduce a generalized graph-theoretic framework for analyzing quantum operators by mapping unitary matrices to directed graphs; we term these structures \emph{Imperfect Graphs} or more formally as \emph{Topological Structure of Superpositions}(TSS) as a tool to devise better Quantum Algorithms. In this framework, we represent computational basis states as vertices. A directed edge exists between two vertices if and only if there is a non-zero amplitude transition between them, effectively mapping the support of the unitary operator. In this paper we deliberately discard probability amplitudes and phase information to isolate the connectivity and reachability properties of the operator. We demonstrate how TSS intuitively helps describe gates such as the Hadamard, Pauli-(X,Y,Z) gates, etc \cite{nielsen2000}. This framework provides a novel perspective for viewing quantum circuits as discrete dynamical systems \cite{childs2009,aharonov2001}

      <description>arXiv:2602.21839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is a typical maximally entangled state which is pursued in both fundamental research and emerging quantum technologies. Preparing large-scale GHZ states in lattice spin systems is particularly appealing for quantum advantages, but conventional schemes face great challenges in scalability. Here we propose a universal and scalable scheme to generate large-scale GHZ-like states, which share similar entanglement and metrological properties with standard GHZ states, in lattice spin systems through global Floquet engineering. Our scheme requires only global operations and shows great advantage for large particle number. It is applicable to systems with arbitrary interaction ranges, offering a practical pathway for large-scale implementation of many-body entangled states in various systems.</description>

      <title>Deep squeezing or cooling the fluctuations of a parametric resonator using feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we analyze ways to achieve deep subthreshold parametric squeezing or cooling of a single degree-of-freedom parametric resonator enhanced by a lock-in amplifier feedback loop. Due to the feedback, the dynamics of the parametric resonator becomes more complex and a Hopf bifurcation at the instability threshold can occur. Initially, we calculate the phase-dependent gain of parametric amplification with feedback of an added ac signal. In one approach, we obtain the amplification gain approximately using two independent approaches: the averaging method and the harmonic balance method. We also obtain this gain more exactly using Floquet theory and Green's functions methods. The Hopf bifurcation was predicted by the harmonic balance method and by Floquet theory, but not by the averaging method. In our analysis of fluctuations, we Fourier analyze the response of the parametric resonator with feedback to an added white noise. We were able to calculate, in addition to the noise spectral density, the squeezing of fluctuations in this resonator with feedback. Very strong squeezing or cooling can occur. Deamplification and cooling occur near the Hopf bifurcation, whereas squeezing occurs near a saddle-node bifurcation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While non-Hermitian Hamiltonians enable exotic dynamical phenomena, implementing their nonunitary time evolution on near-term quantum devices remains challenging. We propose a hardware-friendly protocol that simulates non-Hermitian dynamics without continuous monitoring. Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) evolution via classical Gaussian white-noise averaging and to subsequently cancel the quantum-jump contribution at the level of the measured observable using stochastic quantum error mitigation (QEM). The scheme requires no ancillas or controlled time-evolution, while the mitigation layer uses only single-qubit operations. We validate the method through numerical simulations of a model with asymmetric hopping, interaction, and disorder. Our work provides a programmable and ancilla-free framework investigating exotic dynamics that are not completely-positive and trace-preserving using QEM.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the action of conventional trapped-ion entangling gates in qudit space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qudits, or multi-level quantum information carriers, present a promising path for scaling quantum computers. However, their use introduces increased complexity in quantum logic, necessitating careful control of relative phases between different qudit levels. In trapped-ion systems, entangling operations accumulate phases on specific levels that are no longer global, unlike in qubit architectures. Furthermore, the structure of multi-level gates becomes increasingly intricate with higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces. This work explores the theory of these additional entangling and non-entangling phases, accumulated in M\o lmer--S\o rensen and Light-shift gates. We propose methods to actively compensate for these phases, enhance gate robustness against parameter fluctuations, and simplify native gates for more efficient circuit decomposition. Our results pave the way toward the practical and scalable implementation of qudit-based quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the prodiabatic elimination, a powerful approximation technique that systematically extends the adiabatic elimination of fast degrees of freedom in light-matter coupled systems. Through a controlled expansion of operators, the prodiabatic elimination incorporates higher-order corrections and consistently includes noise contributions, leading to a significantly improved performance compared to standard adiabatic elimination. Importantly, it retains the simplicity and computational efficiency of the adiabatic elimination, making it convenient for practical applications. We demonstrate the approach on two setups: a driven dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model and a three-level system in a two-mode cavity that performs stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). These examples establish the prodiabatic elimination as a robust and broadly applicable tool for analyzing open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Noise-adaptive hybrid quantum convolutional neural networks based on depth-stratified feature extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical quantum classifiers, such as quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), represent recent progress toward designing effective and feasible architectures for quantum classification. However, their performance on near-term quantum hardware remains highly sensitive to noise accumulation across circuit depth, calling for strategies beyond circuit-architecture design alone. We propose a noise-adaptive hybrid QCNN that improves classification under noise by exploiting depth-stratified intermediate measurements. Instead of discarding qubits removed during pooling operations, we measure them and use the resulting outcomes as classical features that are jointly processed by a classical neural network. This hybrid hierarchical design enables noise-adaptive inference by integrating quantum intermediate measurements with classical post-processing. Systematic experiments across multiple circuit sizes and noise settings, including hardware-calibrated noise models derived from IBM Quantum backend data, demonstrate more stable convergence, reduced loss variability, and consistently higher classification accuracy compared with standard QCNNs. Moreover, we observe that this performance advantage significantly amplifies as the circuit size increases, confirming that the hybrid architecture mitigates the scaling limitations of standard architectures. Notably, the multi-basis measurement variant attains performance close to the noiseless limit even under realistic noise. While demonstrated for QCNNs, the proposed depth-stratified feature extraction applies more broadly to hierarchical quantum classifiers that progressively discard qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality in open quantum systems from the purification perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems host mixed-state phases that go beyond the symmetry-protected topological and spontaneous symmetry-breaking paradigms established for closed, pure-state systems. Developing a unified and physically transparent classification of such phases remains a central challenge. In this work, we introduce a purification-based framework that systematically characterizes all mixed-state phases in one-dimensional systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry. By introducing an ancillary $\kappa$ chain and employing decorated domain-wall constructions, we derive eight purified fixed-point Hamiltonians labeled by topological indices $(\mu_{\sigma\tau},\mu_{\tau\kappa},\mu_{\kappa\sigma}) \in \{\pm1\}^3$. Tracing out the ancilla recovers the full structure of mixed-state phases, including symmetric, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking, average symmetry-protected topological phases, and their nontrivial combinations. Interpolations between the eight fixed points naturally define a three-dimensional phase diagram with a cube geometry. The edges correspond to elementary transitions associated with single topological indices, while the faces host intermediate phases arising from competing domain-wall decorations. Along the edges, we identify a class of critical behavior that connects distinct strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking patterns associated with distinct strong subgroups, highlighting a mechanism unique to mixed-state settings. Large-scale tensor-network simulations reveal a rich phase structure, including pyramid-shaped symmetry-breaking regions and a fully symmetry-broken phase at the cube center. Overall, our purification approach provides a geometrically transparent and physically complete classification of mixed-state phases, unified with a single $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\kappa}$ model.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography for non-iid sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state and process tomography are typically analyzed under the assumption that devices emit independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) states or channels. In realistic experiments, however, noise, drift, feedback, or adversarial behavior violate this assumption. We show that projected least-squares tomography remains statistically optimal even under fully adaptive state and channel preparation. Specifically, we prove that the sample complexity for reconstructing the time-averaged state or channel matches the optimal i.i.d. scaling for non-adaptive, single-copy measurements. For rank-$r$ states, the sample complexity is $\mathcal{O}(d r^2/\epsilon^2)$ to achieve accuracy $\epsilon$ in trace distance, while for process tomography it is $\mathcal{O}(d^6/\epsilon^2)$ to achieve accuracy $\epsilon$ in diamond distance. Thus, dropping the i.i.d. assumption does not increase the fundamental sample complexity of quantum tomography, but only changes the interpretation of the reconstructed object.</description>

      <title>Learning Quantum Data Distribution via Chaotic Quantum Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models for quantum data pose significant challenges but hold immense potential in fields such as chemoinformatics and quantum physics. Quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models (QuDDPMs) enable efficient learning of quantum data distributions by progressively scrambling and denoising quantum states; however, existing implementations typically rely on circuit-based random unitary dynamics that can be costly to realize and sensitive to control imperfections, particularly on analog quantum hardware. We propose the chaotic quantum diffusion model, a framework that generates projected ensembles via chaotic Hamiltonian time evolution, providing a flexible and hardware-compatible diffusion mechanism. Requiring only global, time-independent control, our approach substantially reduces implementation overhead across diverse analog quantum platforms while achieving accuracy comparable to QuDDPMs. This method improves trainability and robustness, broadening the applicability of quantum generative modeling.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of quantum mechanics from stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic--quantum correspondence reinterprets quantum dynamics as arising from an underlying stochastic process on a configuration space. We generalize the correspondence by lifting an arbitrary stochastic kernel $\Gamma$ in finite dimension to a map $\phi$ on $B(\mathcal H)$, formulating the associated lift-compatibility relation, and giving an explicit dictionary between $\Gamma$ and CPTP (Kraus) maps. We isolate Chapman--Kolmogorov divisibility of the lifted family as the decisive additional constraint: when a CK-consistent CPTP family exists, the lift admits a Lindblad master equation form. In this picture, off-diagonal (phase) degrees of freedom act as a compressed carrier of history dependence not fixed by transition kernels alone; conversely, the apparent emergence of quantum phase information from a phase-blind stochastic description is explained as a memory effect. Finally, we state and prove a divisibility criterion for the underlying stochastic kernels, expressed as a condition involving divisibility of the lifted map together with a diagonality requirement on the density operator.</description>

      <title>Self-stabilized high-dimensional quantum key distribution on a metropolitan free-space link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication technologies capable of operating reliably across heterogeneous optical channels are essential for scalable metropolitan quantum networks. Here we demonstrate high-dimensional time-bin-encoded quantum key distribution over a hybrid metropolitan link comprising 1.7 km free-space transmission and 685 m of optical fiber. Operating at a clock rate of 500 MHz in the C-band, we implement both 2- and 4-dimensional protocols, and obtain estimated secure finite-key rates of (95 +- 28) kbit/s for 4D at (25.0 +- 2.0) dB loss and (59 +- 27) kbit/s for 2D at (23.5 +- 2.3) dB loss. Crucially, we achieve continuous operation over 48 h in a fully self-referenced architecture: initial synchronization, interferometric phase stabilization, and long-term drift compensation are performed exclusively using the detected quantum signals, without auxiliary optical reference channels. Our results thus establish a practical and versatile platform for hybrid free-space-to-fiber quantum communication and show that the encoding dimensionality can be adapted to the optimal operating regime of realistic metropolitan channels, providing a pathway toward efficient, autonomous and deployable quantum network nodes.</description>

      <title>Loss Mechanisms in High-coherence Multimode Mechanical Resonators Coupled to Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuit quantum acoustodynamics (cQAD) devices have a wide range of applications in quantum science, all of which depend crucially on the quantum coherence of the mechanical subsystem. In this context, high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators (HBARs) are particularly promising, since they have shown very high quality factors with negligible dephasing. However, the introduction of piezoelectric films, which are necessary for coupling to a superconducting circuit, can lead to additional loss channels, such as surface scattering and two-level systems (TLS). Here, we study the acoustic dissipation of HBAR resonators in cQAD systems and find that the defect density of the piezoelectric material and its interface with the bulk are limiting factors for the coherence. We measure acoustic modes with phonon lifetimes up to 400 $\mu$s and lifetime-limited coherence times approaching one millisecond in the quantum regime. When coupled to a superconducting qubit, this leads to a hybrid system with a large quantum coherence cooperativity of $C_{T_2}=1.1\times10^5$. These results represent a new milestone for the performance of cQAD devices and offer concrete paths forward for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Trade-offs in Gauss's law error correction for lattice gauge theory quantum simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauss's law-based quantum error correction (GLQEC) offers a promising approach to reducing qubit overhead in lattice gauge theory simulations by leveraging built-in symmetries. For applications of GLQEC to 1+1D lattice quantum electrodynamics (QED), we identify two significant trade-offs. First, we prove via dimension-counting arguments that GLQEC requires periodic electric fields, thereby constraining the design space for lattice QED simulations. Second, we numerically compare GLQEC with a universal quantum error correction (UQEC) code, specifically the $d=3$ bitflip repetition code, and find that while GLQEC can achieve lower logical error rates in single-round error correction, it exhibits faster decoherence to the steady-state mixed ensemble under multiple rounds. The mixing speed penalty is manifest in observables of interest for both memory experiments and Hamiltonian evolution. We identify a mixing speed threshold, $p_{th}=0.277(2)$, above which using GLQEC exhibits even faster decoherence than without error correction. Our results highlight fundamental limitations of symmetry-based error correction schemes and inform corresponding constraints on formulations of lattice gauge theories compatible with error-robust quantum simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Exponential speedup in measurement property learning with post-measurement states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning properties of quantum states and channels is known to benefit from resources such as entangled operations, auxiliary qubits, and adaptivity, whereas the resource structure of measurement learning, namely, learning properties of quantum measurement operators, remains poorly understood. In this work, we identify a measurement learning task for which access limited to classical measurement outcomes leads to an exponential lower bound on the query complexity, established via a distinguishing task between a genuine quantum projective measurement and a purely classical random number generator. Remarkably, this hardness persists even when arbitrary entangled operations, auxiliary systems, and fully adaptive strategies are allowed, indicating that conventional resources for state and channel learning are ineffective in this task. In contrast, when access to the post-measurement quantum state is available, the same task can be solved with constant query complexity using a simple measuring-twice protocol, without requiring resources that are useful for state and channel learning. Our results reveal post-measurement states as a qualitatively new and decisive resource for measurement learning, suggesting potential implications for the design of practical quantum certification protocols.</description>

      <title>Energy efficient optical tracking for space quantum communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power consumption is a critical constraint for CubeSat based quantum communication, where tracking systems often dominate the onboard power budget. We demonstrate an energy-efficient approach that enables reliable satellite tracking at substantially reduced beacon power by treating tracking as a weak-signal estimation task. Using a closed-loop system with fine steering mirrors and higher-order Kalman filters on ground, we can maintain stable tracking at a transmitted power equivalent to 34 mW over a -60 dB satellite to ground optical channel. Our results show that the resulting penalties on QKD bit error rates and signal-to-noise ratios are negligible, allowing for more efficient power allocation to quantum payloads in CubeSat missions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Shot Fidelity: Chernoff-Based Throughput Optimization in Superconducting Qubit Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-shot fidelity is the standard benchmark for superconducting qubit readout, but it does not directly minimize the total wall-clock time required to certify a quantum state. We formulate an information-theoretic description of dispersive readout that treats the measurement record as a stochastic communication channel and compute the classical Chernoff information governing the multi-shot error exponent using a trajectory model that incorporates T1 relaxation with full cavity memory. We find a consistent separation between the integration time that maximizes single-shot fidelity and the time that minimizes total certification time. For representative transmon parameters and hardware overheads, the throughput-optimal integration window is longer than the fidelity-optimal one, yielding certification speedups of approximately 9-11%, with the gain saturating near 1.13x in the high-readout-power and high-overhead regime. Comparing the extracted classical information to the Gaussian Chernoff limit defines an information-extraction efficiency metric and shows that typical dispersive schemes are limited to about 45% capture at short integration times by detection efficiency, decreasing to approximately 12% at the throughput-optimal integration time of approximately 1.22 us due to T1-induced trajectory smearing. This formulation connects readout calibration directly to the operational objective of minimizing certification time in high-throughput superconducting processors.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Consensus with Quantum Sybil Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sybil resistance is a key requirement of decentralized consensus protocols. It is achieved by introducing a scarce resource (such as computational power, monetary stake, disk space, etc.), which prevents participants from costlessly creating multiple fake identities and hijacking the protocol. Quantum states are generically uncloneable, which suggests that they may serve naturally as an unconditionally scarce resource. In particular, uncloneability underlies quantum position based-cryptography, which is unachievable classically. We design a consensus protocol that combines classical hybrid consensus protocols with quantum position verification as the Sybil resistance mechanism, providing security in the standard model, and achieving improved energy efficiency compared to hybrid protocols based on Proof-of-Work. Our protocol inherits the benefits of other hybrid protocols, namely the faster confirmation times compared to pure Proof-of-Work protocols, and resilience against the compounding wealth issue that plagues protocols based on Proof-of-Stake Sybil resistance. We additionally propose a spam prevention mechanism for our protocol in the Random Oracle model.</description>

      <title>Controlled jump in the Clifford hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a simple and systematic route to higher levels of the qubit Clifford hierarchy by coherently controlling Clifford operations. Our approach is based on Pauli periodicity, defined for a Clifford unitary $U$ as the smallest integer $m\ge 1$ such that $U^{2^{m}}$ is a Pauli operator up to phase. We prove a sharp controlled-jump rule showing that the controlled gate $CU$ lies strictly in level $m+2$ of the hierarchy, and equivalently that $CU$ lies in level $k$ if $U^{2^{k-2}}$ is Pauli while no smaller positive power of $U$ is Pauli. We further quantify the resources required to realize large level jumps in the Clifford hierarchy by proving an essentially tight upper bound on Pauli periodicity as a function of the number of qubits, which implies that accessing high hierarchy levels through controlled Cliffords requires a number of target qubits that grows exponentially with the desired level. We complement this limitation with explicit infinite families of Pauli-periodic Cliffords whose controlled versions achieve asymptotically optimal jumps. As an application, we propose a protocol for preparing logical catalyst states that enable logical $Z^{1/2^k}$ phase gates via phase kickback from a single jumped Clifford.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in open cavity optomechanics and Liouvillian versus Hamiltonian exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points, where two or more eigenstates of a non-Hermitian system coalesce, are now of interest across many fields of physics, from the perspective of open-system dynamics, sensing, nonreciprocal transport, and topological phase transitions. In this work, we investigate exceptional points in cavity optomechanics, a platform of interest to diverse communities working on gravitational-wave detection, macroscopic quantum mechanics, quantum transduction, etc. Specifically, we clarify the role of quantum jumps in making a clear distinction between Liouvillian and Hamiltonian exceptional points in optomechanical systems. While the Liouvillian exceptional point arises from the unconditional Lindblad dynamics and is independent of the phonon-bath temperature, the Hamiltonian exceptional point emerges from the conditional no-jump evolution and acquires a thermal shift due to an enhanced conditional damping. Employing the thermofield formalism, we derive a unified spectral framework that interpolates between these regimes via an analytical hybrid-Liouvillian description. Remarkably, in the weak-quantum-jump regime, the exceptional point is perturbed only at the second order, highlighting the robustness of the Hamiltonian exceptional point under small hybrid perturbations. Our work reveals a continuous family of hybrid exceptional points, clarifies the operational and physical differences between the conditional and unconditional dissipative dynamics in optomechanical systems, and provides a probe for thermal baths.</description>

      <title>Computing with many encoded logical qubits beyond break-even</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-rate quantum error correcting (QEC) codes encode many logical qubits in a given number of physical qubits, making them promising candidates for quantum computation. Implementing high-rate codes at a scale that both frustrates classical computing and improves performance by encoding requires both high fidelity gates and long-range qubit connectivity -- both of which are offered by trapped-ion quantum computers. Here, we demonstrate computations that outperform their unencoded counterparts in the high-rate $[[ k+2,\, k,\, 2 ]]$ iceberg quantum error detecting (QED) and $[[ (k_2 + 2)(k_1 + 2),\, k_2k_1,\, 4 ]]$ two-level concatenated iceberg QEC codes, using the 98-qubit Quantinuum Helios trapped-ion quantum processor. Utilizing new gadgets for encoded operations, we realize this "beyond break-even" performance with reasonable postselection rates across a range of fault-tolerant (FT) and partially-fault-tolerant (pFT) component and application benchmarks with between $48$ and $94$ logical qubits. These benchmarks include FT state preparation and measurement, QEC cycle benchmarking, logical gate benchmarking, GHZ state preparation, and a pFT quantum simulation of the three-dimensional $XY$ model of quantum magnetism. Additionally, we illustrate that postselection rates can be suppressed by increasing the code distance via concatenation. Our results represent state-of-the-art logical component and state fidelities and provide evidence that high-rate QED/QEC codes are viable on contemporary quantum computers for near-term beyond-classical-scale computation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We approach the Max-3-Cut problem through the lens of maximizing complex-valued quadratic forms and demonstrate that low-rank structure in the objective matrix can be exploited, leading to alternative algorithms to classical semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations and heuristic techniques. We propose an algorithm for maximizing these quadratic forms over a domain of size $K$ that enumerates and evaluates a set of $O\left(n^{2r-1}\right)$ candidate solutions, where $n$ is the dimension of the matrix and $r$ represents the rank of an approximation of the objective. We prove that this candidate set is guaranteed to include the exact maximizer when $K=3$ (corresponding to Max-3-Cut) and the objective is low-rank, and provide approximation guarantees when the objective is a perturbation of a low-rank matrix. This construction results in a family of novel, inherently parallelizable and theoretically-motivated algorithms for Max-3-Cut. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to existing algorithms across a wide range of graphs, while being highly scalable.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Random Matrix Theory of Molecular Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use ab initio electronic-structure methods to investigate random-matrix theory (RMT) universality in molecular electronic structure. Using single-reference electronic structure methods, including Hartree-Fock, configuration-interaction singles (CIS), density functional theory, and linear-response time-dependent density-functional theory, we compute single-particle orbital energies and many-electron excitations of several representative molecules (benzene, alanine, 1-phenylethylamine, methyloxirane, and helicene chains). For generic low-symmetry geometries, the unfolded spectra of these ab initio Hamiltonians exhibit Wigner-Dyson level statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). For extended helicene chains we explicitly restrict to bound valence excitations below the ionization threshold and still observe GOE statistics, indicating that the RMT universality is present for physical states of direct relevance to real molecules. We further explore the electric and magnetic field dependence of the molecular electronic spectra. The variance of electric polarizability (level curvature K) is predicted to be non-analytic in the magnetic field which serves as an infrared cutoff, &lt;K^2&gt; proportional to log(1/|B|). We observe a transition to the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) by increasing the magnetic fields, although it occurs only at magnetic fields far beyond experimentally accessible scales. Our results indicate that random matrix universality provides a general framework for organizing ab initio predictions of interacting electron spectra in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Higher Berry Phase via Boundary Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher Berry phase has recently been proposed to study the topology of the space of gapped many-body quantum systems. In this work, we develop a boundary-scattering approach to detect higher Berry phases in one-dimensional gapped free-fermion systems. By coupling a gapless lead to the gapped system, we demonstrate that the higher Berry invariant can be obtained by studying the higher winding number of the boundary reflection matrix. The resulting topological invariant is robust against perturbations such as disorder. Our approach establishes a connection between higher Berry invariants and transport properties, thereby providing a potentially experimentally accessible probe of parametrized topological phases.</description>

      <title>Coherent Quantum Evaluation of Collider Amplitudes for Effective Field Theory Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements at electron-positron colliders provide stringent tests of the Standard Model and powerful probes of possible higher-dimensional interactions. We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework for computing leading-order helicity amplitudes for $e^+e^-\to \ell^+\ell^-$ scattering on gate-based quantum hardware and using the resulting cross sections to constrain both Standard Model couplings and effective field theory operators. In our approach, external kinematics are encoded into single-qubit Weyl spinors, and full helicity amplitudes are reconstructed by coherently combining diagrammatic contributions within a single quantum circuit. Classical post-processing yields physical amplitudes and differential cross sections that can be directly compared with collider data. As a proof of concept, we compute unpolarised angular distributions and perform binned likelihood fits to precision electron-positron measurements. The extracted bounds are statistically consistent with Standard Model expectations, demonstrating that quantum-assisted amplitude evaluation can interface directly with phenomenological analyses and experimental data. This work establishes a concrete pathway toward applying quantum computing to precision collider physics and effective field theory studies.</description>

      <title>Using near-flat-band electrons for read-out of molecular spin qubit entangled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While molecular spin qubits (MSQs) are a promising platform for quantum computing, read-out has been largely limited to electron paramagnetic resonance which is often slow and requires a global system drive. Moreover, because one prerequisite for the Elzerman and Pauli spin blockade readout mechanisms typical of semiconductor spin qubits is tunneling of electrons between sites, these read-out modalities are unavailable in MSQs. Here, we theoretically demonstrate electrical read-out of entangled MSQs via driven many-electron spin unpolarized currents. In particular, using a time-dependent density matrix renormalization group approach we simulate a maximally entangled MSQ pair between two electronic leads. Driving itinerant electrons between the two leads, we find that the conductance is greater when the MSQs are in the entangled singlet state as compared to the entangled triplet state. This contrast in conductance is enhanced when the electronic density of states at the Fermi energy is large and for narrow bandwidth. Our results are readily applicable to molecules supramolecularly functionalizing semiconductors with relatively flat bands such as single-wall carbon nanotubes under a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Phonon decoherence produced by two-level tunneling states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon modes within pristine crystalline resonators now routinely reach the quantum ground state. Such systems are attractive for quantum information science applications, as advanced fabrication and processing can enable relatively long quantum coherence times, and precision control can be realized through optical, electrical, or qubit coupling. In many state-of-the-art systems, the phonon lifetime is limited by disorder. In particular, native oxides or damaged `dead layers' at surfaces can host two-level tunneling states that lead to a particularly problematic form of dissipation that increases at lower temperatures. As mechanical losses are driven down in systems such as micro-fabricated bulk acoustic wave resonators, tunneling states are expected to emerge as the dominant mechanism for phonon decoherence. A quantitative description of these mesoscopic systems therefore requires a framework that captures interactions between a selected phonon mode and a large ensemble of TLS. Here, we derive a quantum master equation for this coupled system, permitting the phonon decoherence produced by two-level tunneling states to be calculated. As an example, we estimate the lifetime of a variety of quantum states within quartz micro-resonators hosting a thin surface layer of tunneling states. We find that the phonon coherence time is maximized at low temperatures, in spite of increased mechanical dissipation, and that phonon-TLS coupling can be reduced for modes with strain nodes at the surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum-mechanical description is presented for the three-body physics of shielded dipolar molecules, including a prediction of observable Efimov physics. Despite the anisotropic and long-range nature of the interaction, shielding enables a regime in which universality emerges already at the two-body level and extends to the three-body sector, where Efimov physics emerges. On the negative side of the scattering-length resonance, computed trimer binding energies display the characteristic scaling expected for Efimov resonances. Finally, the sudden approximation can be used to create trimer bound states, starting from positive energy trap states as a way to create or detect these molecular trimers. Moreover, the three-body parameter expressed in dipolar units is found to be universal.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Discovery of Intermediate Phase Order in the Frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg Model via Prometheus Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice exhibits a debated intermediate phase between N\'eel antiferromagnetic and stripe ordered regimes, with competing theories proposing plaquette valence bond, nematic, and quantum spin liquid ground states. We apply the Prometheus variational autoencoder framework -- previously validated on classical (2D, 3D Ising) and quantum (disordered transverse field Ising) phase transitions -- to systematically explore the $J_1$-$J_2$ phase diagram via unsupervised analysis of exact diagonalization ground states for a $4 \times 4$ lattice. Through dense parameter scans of $J_2/J_1 \in [0.3, 0.7]$ with step size 0.01 and comprehensive latent space analysis, we investigate the nature of the intermediate regime using unsupervised order parameter discovery and critical point detection via multiple independent methods. This work demonstrates the application of rigorously validated machine learning methods to open questions in frustrated quantum magnetism, where traditional order parameter identification is challenged by competing interactions and limited accessible system sizes.</description>

      <title>Coupling nitrogen vacancy centers in silicon carbide to nanophotonic resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is a promising platform for scalable quantum technologies owing to its well-established, wafer-scale industrial processing. SiC also hosts a variety of optically active color centres including the nitrogen vacancy defect that has a spin-triplet ground state. However, strong phonon coupling in the infrared range limits photon extraction from these defects. Here, we use nanophotonic structures, specifically micro-pillar and micro-disk resonators, to enhance optical collection and spin-readout. The micro-pillar geometry yields a 4-fold increase in photon collection, accompanied by a 2.4-fold reduction in spectral noise in optically detected magnetic resonance measurements. Consequently, the magnetic field sensitivity is improved by 24%. The large mode volume of the micro-disk supports resonances spanning 1150-1250 nm, enabling broadband coupling to nitrogen vacancy emission lines. Our results demonstrate that fabrication of scalable photonic structures efficiently improves performance of silicon carbide color centers for integrated quantum light generation and sensing.</description>

      <title>On some mathematical problems for open quantum systems with varying particle number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the effective Hamiltonian $H - \mu N$ for open quantum systems with varying particle number from first principles within the framework of non-relativistic quantum statistical mechanics. We prove that under physically motivated assumptions regarding the size of the system and the range of the interaction, this form of the Hamiltonian is unique up to a constant. Our argument relies firstly on establishing a rigorous version of the surface-to-volume ratio approximation, which is routinely used in an empirical form in statistical mechanics, and secondly on showing that the Hilbert space for systems with varying particle number must be isomorphic to Fock space. Together, these findings provide a rigorous mathematical justification for the standard grand canonical formalism employed in statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Lowering the temperature of two-dimensional fermionic tensor networks with cluster expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representing the time-evolution operator as a tensor network constitutes a key ingredient in several algorithms for studying quantum lattice systems at finite temperature or in a non-equilibrium setting. For a Hamiltonian composed of strictly short-ranged interactions, the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition is the main technique for obtaining such a representation. In [B.~Vanhecke, L.~Vanderstraeten and F.~Verstraete, Physical Review A, L020402 (2021)], an alternative strategy, the cluster expansion, was introduced. This approach naturally preserves internal and lattice symmetries and can more easily be extended to higher-order representations or longer-ranged interactions. We extend the cluster expansion to two-dimensional fermionic systems, and employ it to construct projected entangled-pair operator (PEPO) approximations of Gibbs states. We also discuss and benchmark different truncation schemes for multiplying layers of PEPOs together. Applying the resulting framework to a two-dimensional spinless fermion model with attractive interactions, we resolve a clear phase boundary at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Time in gravitational subregions and in closed universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What are gauge-invariant local observables in a subregion in quantum gravity? How does one even define such a subregion non-perturbatively? We study these questions in JT gravity. One can define a subregion by specifying the value of the dilaton at the boundary of the region. We study conformal matter correlators in such a subregion. There is a gravitational constraint associated with York time evolution within the causal diamond of the subregion. This constraint can be leveraged to construct gauge-invariant observables in quantum gravity, using a crossed product construction. The extrinsic curvature of Cauchy slices acts as the physical clock. This is a simple example of how gauge-invariant observables can be obtained by dressing to features of a spacetime (or other fields), without the need for introducing an external observer. The entropy associated with this algebra of observables is not an area, or any boundary term. We show that gravitational constraints only give boundary formulas for entropy when gauging isometric diffeomorphisms. York time flow is merely a conformal isometry, not an actual isometry, and thus leads to bulk contributions to entropy. We repeat our construction for Milne-type closed Big-Bang universes, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We propose efficient algorithms for classically simulating Gaussian unitaries and measurements applied to non-Gaussian initial states. The constructions are based on decomposing the non-Gaussian states into linear combinations of Gaussian states. We use an extension of the covariance matrix formalism to efficiently track relative phases in the superpositions of Gaussian states. We get an exact simulation algorithm, which costs quadratically with the number of Gaussian states required to represent the initial state, and an approximate simulation algorithm, which costs linearly with the $l_1$ norm of the coefficients associated with the superposition. We define measures of non-Gaussianity quantifying this simulation cost, which we call the Gaussian rank and the Gaussian extent. From the perspective of quantum resource theories, we investigate the properties of this type of non-Gaussianity measure and compute optimal decompositions for states relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement among a large number of qubits is a crucial resource for many quantum algorithms. Such many-body states have been efficiently generated by entangling a chain of itinerant photonic qubits in the optical or microwave domain. However, it has remained challenging to fully characterize the generated many-body states by experimentally reconstructing their exponentially large density matrices. Here, we develop an efficient tomography method based on the matrix-product-operator formalism and demonstrate it on a cluster state of up to 35 microwave photonic qubits by reconstructing its $2^{35} \times 2^{35}$ density matrix. The full characterization enables us to detect the performance degradation of our photon source which occurs only when generating a large cluster state. This tomography method is generally applicable to various physical realizations of entangled qubits and provides an efficient benchmarking method for guiding the development of high-fidelity sources of entangled photons.</description>

Abstract: Attention-based neural networks such as transformers have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing, genomics, and vision. Here, we demonstrate the use of transformers for quantum feedback control through both a supervised and reinforcement learning approach. In particular, due to the transformer's ability to capture long-range temporal correlations and training efficiency, we show that it can surpass some of the limitations of previous control approaches, e.g.~those based on recurrent neural networks trained using a similar approach or policy based reinforcement learning. We numerically show, for the example of state stabilization of a two-level system, that our bespoke transformer architecture can achieve near unit fidelity to a target state in a short time even in the presence of inefficient measurement and Hamiltonian perturbations that were not included in the training set as well as the control of non-Markovian systems. We also demonstrate that our transformer can perform energy minimization of non-integrable many-body quantum systems when trained for reinforcement learning tasks. Our approach can be used for quantum error correction, fast control of quantum states in the presence of colored noise, as well as real-time tuning, and characterization of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>It's Quick to be Square: Fast Quadratisation for Quantum Toolchains</title>

Abstract: Many of the envisioned use-cases for quantum computers involve optimisation processes. While there are many algorithmic primitives to perform the required calculations, all eventually lead to quantum gates operating on quantum bits, with an order as determined by the structure of the objective function and the properties of target hardware. When the structure of the problem representation is not aligned with structure and boundary conditions of the executing hardware, various overheads degrading the computation may arise, possibly negating any possible quantum advantage.
  Therefore, automatic transformations of problem representations play an important role in quantum computing when descriptions (semi-)targeted at humans must be cast into forms that can be ``executed'' on quantum computers. Mathematically equivalent formulations are known to result in substantially different non-functional properties depending on hardware, algorithm and detail properties of the problem. Given the current state of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, these effects are considerably more pronounced than in classical computing. Likewise, efficiency of the transformation itself is relevant because possible quantum advantage may easily be eradicated by the overhead of transforming between representations. In this paper, we consider a specific class of higher-level representations, that is, PUBOs, and devise novel automatic transformation mechanisms into widely used QUBOs that substantially improve efficiency and versatility over the state of the art. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of industry-relevant problem formulations and their conversion into a quantum-specific representation, identifying significant obstacles in scaling behaviour and demonstrating how these can be circumvented.</description>

      <title>QCS-ADME: Quantum Circuit Search for Drug Property Prediction with Imbalanced Data and Regression Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The biomedical field is beginning to explore the use of quantum machine learning (QML) for tasks traditionally handled by classical machine learning, especially in predicting ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties, which are essential in drug evaluation. However, ADME tasks pose unique challenges for existing quantum computing systems (QCS) frameworks, as they involve both classification with unbalanced dataset and regression problems. These dual requirements make it necessary to adapt and refine current QCS frameworks to effectively address the complexities of ADME predictions. We propose a novel training-free scoring mechanism to evaluate QML circuit performance on imbalanced classification and regression tasks. Our mechanism demonstrates significant correlation between scoring metrics and test performance on imbalanced classification tasks. Additionally, we develop methods to quantify continuous similarity relationships between quantum states, enabling performance prediction for regression tasks. This represents a novel training-free approach to searching and evaluating QCS circuits specifically for regression applications. Validation on representative ADME tasks-eight imbalanced classification and four regression-demonstrates moderate correlation between our scoring metrics and circuit performance, significantly outperforming baseline scoring methods that show negligible correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibrium quantum systems are often described by a gas of weakly-interacting normal modes. Bringing such systems far from equilibrium, however, can drastically enhance mode-to-mode interactions. Understanding the resulting liquid is a fundamental question for quantum statistical mechanics, and a practical question for engineering driven quantum devices. To tackle this question, we probe the nonequilibrium kinetics of one-dimensional plasmons in a long chain of Josephson junctions. We introduce multimode spectroscopy to controllably study the departure from equilibrium, witnessing the evolution from pairwise coupling between plasma modes at weak driving to dramatic, high-order, cascaded couplings at strong driving. Scaling to many-mode drives, we stimulate interactions between hundreds of modes, resulting in near-continuum internal dynamics. Imaging the resulting nonequilibrium plasmon populations, we then resolve the non-local redistribution of energy in the response to a weak perturbation -- an explicit verification of the emergence of a strongly interacting, non-equilibrium liquid of plasmons.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum Information Scrambling with the Operator Entanglement Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal features of chaotic quantum dynamics underlie our understanding of thermalization in closed quantum systems and the complexity of quantum computations. Reversible automaton circuits, comprised of classical logic gates, have emerged as a tractable means to study such dynamics. Despite generating no entanglement in the computational basis, these circuits nevertheless capture many features expected from fully quantum evolutions. In this work, we demonstrate that the differences between automaton dynamics and fully quantum dynamics are revealed by the operator entanglement spectrum, much like the entanglement spectrum of a quantum state distinguishes between the dynamics of states under Clifford and Haar random circuits. While the operator entanglement spectrum under random unitary dynamics is governed by the eigenvalue statistics of random Gaussian matrices, we show evidence that under random automaton dynamics it is described by the statistics of Bernoulli random matrices, whose entries are random variables taking values $0$ or $1$. We study the crossover between automaton and generic unitary operator dynamics as the automaton circuit is doped with gates that introduce superpositions, namely Hadamard or $R_x = e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}X}$ gates. We find that a constant number of superposition-generating gates is sufficient to drive the operator dynamics to the random-circuit universality class, similar to earlier results on Clifford circuits doped with $T$ gates. This establishes the operator entanglement spectrum as a useful tool for probing the chaoticity and universality class of quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22083v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state energy for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &amp; $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in almost all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By defining projective error models we study the mathematical structure of Clifford codes and stabilizer codes using tools from projective representation theory. Furthermore, we introduce a new class of codes which we have called weak stabilizer codes and we determine some relationships between these three classes of codes. We show that the obstruction for a stabilizer code to be non-trivial is given by a class in group cohomology, and we are able to determine similar obstructions for weak stabilizer codes to be non-trivial. In the case where the projective error model corresponds to a nice error basis we give a complete characterization of when a Clifford code is a weak stabilizer code in terms of the size of the group of logical operators and the size of the group of stabilizers of the code. Lastly, we produce two infinite families of Clifford codes that are not stabilizer codes, as well as a method of combining these examples into more examples of non-stabilizer Clifford codes.</description>

      <title>Universality of stochastic control of quantum chaos with measurement and feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate universal features of measurement-and-feedback control of quantum chaotic dynamics by examining the quantum Arnold cat map, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos. Inspired by probabilistic control of classical chaos, our protocol stochastically alternates between intrinsic instability and engineered control operations that steer trajectories toward a target point. Simulation of exact quantum dynamics and a semiclassical truncated Wigner approximation reveal universal properties of the cat map's control transition. To further characterize this universality, we introduce the inverted harmonic oscillator as an analytically tractable effective model of instability. By integrating numerical simulations, a semiclassical Fokker-Planck description, and a direct spectral analysis of the stochastic quantum channel, we identify quantum signatures absent in classical limits. The close agreement between quantum simulation, truncated Wigner approximation, and inverted oscillator analysis shows that universal features of the transition are set by uncertainty-limited quantum fluctuations and are insensitive to genuine quantum interference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient verification of multipartite quantum states is crucial to many applications in quantum information processing. By virtue of Schmidt decomposition and mutually unbiased bases, here we propose a universal protocol to verify arbitrary multipartite pure quantum states using adaptive local projective measurements. Moreover, we establish a universal upper bound on the sample complexity that is independent of the local dimensions. Numerical calculations further indicate that Haar-random pure states can be verified with a constant sample cost, irrespective of the qudit number and local dimensions, even in the adversarial scenario in which the source cannot be trusted. As alternatives, we provide several simpler variants that can achieve similar high efficiencies without using Schmidt decomposition. The simplest variant consists of only two distinct tests.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Resource for Exponential Advantage in Quantum Channel Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resources enable us to achieve an exponential advantage in learning the properties of unknown physical systems by employing quantum memory. While entanglement with quantum memory is recognized as a necessary qualitative resource, its quantitative role remains less understood. In this work, we distinguish between two fundamental resources provided by quantum memory -- entanglement and ancilla qubits -- and analyze their separate contributions to the sampling complexity of quantum learning. Focusing on the task of Pauli channel learning, a prototypical example of quantum channel learning, remarkably, we prove that vanishingly small entanglement in the input state already suffices to accomplish the learning task with only a polynomial number of channel queries in the number of qubits. In contrast, we show that without a sufficient number of ancilla qubits, even learning partial information about the channel demands an exponentially large sample complexity. Thus, our findings reveal that while a large amount of entanglement is not necessary, the dimension of the quantum memory is a crucial resource. Hence, by identifying how the two resources contribute differently, our work offers deeper insight into the nature of the quantum learning advantage.</description>

      <title>Stability of Continuous Time Quantum Walks in Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW) across cycle, complete, star, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, small-world, and scale-free topologies under energy-based intrinsic decoherence, node-based Haken-Strobl noise, and edge-based quantum stochastic walk (QSW) decoherence. Defining stability as the preservation of quantum properties, we characterize it using node probabilities, $\ell_1$-norm of coherence, fidelity, quantum-classical distance, and von Neumann entropy. Our results show that intrinsic decoherence preserves coherence longest while QSW causes rapid decay. Stability rankings vary and depend on the decoherence types, network structure, and properties of node where the walker is initialized specifically in heterogeneous networks. Dense connected network like complete and heterogenous networks, for instance, star, and scale-free are stable under Haken-Strobl noise but become uniquely fragile under QSW when initialized on high degree nodes. However, these same networks, due to their inherent localization, exhibit lower coherence in the noiseless regime, highlighting a fundamental trade-off between localization and coherence. Furthermore, the centrality of the initialization node has a pronounced impact on relaxation time and stability measures, underscoring the critical role of local topological features in quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Quantum Markov Chains And Discretizations Of p-Adic Schr\"odinger Equations: Comparisons And Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) are a fundamental tool in the development of quantum algorithms. Recently, it was shown that discretizations of p-adic Schr\"odinger equations give rise to continuous-time quantum Markov chains (CTQMCs); this type of Markov chain includes the CTQWs constructed using adjacency matrices of graphs as a particular case. In this paper, we study a large class of p-adic Schr\"odinger equations and the associated CTQMCs by comparing them with p-adic heat equations and the associated continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). The comparison is done by a mathematical study of the mentioned equations, which requires, for instance, solving the initial value problems attached to the mentioned equations, and through numerical simulations. We conducted multiple simulations, including numerical approximations of the limiting distribution. Our simulations show that the limiting distribution of quantum Markov chains is greater than the stationary probability of their classical counterparts, for a large class of CTQMCs.</description>

Abstract: This work develops a geometric framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes from weighted projective and orbifold structures, integrating algebraic geometry, divisor theory, and the CSS stabilizer formalism. Beginning with weighted projective spaces and their associated height and defect structures, the study builds classical AG-codes via evaluation on divisors adapted to orbifold singularities. These classical codes are lifted to quantum codes using self-orthogonality conditions and homological constructions, yielding a class of Quantum Weighted Algebraic Geometric (QWAG) codes.
  A central contribution is the formulation of a refined Singleton-type bound motivated by orbifold defect terms and effective genus corrections. While the classical quantum Singleton bound is recovered in the smooth case, the orbifold setting suggests additional geometric contributions that may adjust the theoretical distance bound. The refined bound is presented with partial justification under specific geometric hypotheses and framed as a conjectural extension in full generality.
  The monograph further provides explicit constructions, computational implementations in Sage/Python, and illustrative examples demonstrating how weighted geometry influences code parameters. This work establishes a structured bridge between orbifold geometry and quantum coding theory, outlining both concrete constructions and open problems for further mathematical development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notorious sign problem severely limits the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, as statistical errors grow exponentially with system size and inverse temperature. A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.</description>

      <title>Utility-Scale Quantum State Preparation: Classical Training using Pauli Path Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Pauli Path simulation to variationally obtain parametrized circuits for preparing ground states of various quantum many-body Hamiltonians. These include the quantum Ising model in one dimension, in two dimensions on square and heavy-hex lattices, and the Kitaev honeycomb model, all at system sizes of one hundred qubits or more -- sizes at which generic quantum circuits are beyond the reach of exact state-vector simulation -- thereby reaching utility scale. We benchmark the Pauli Path simulation results against exact ground-state energies when available, and against density-matrix renormalization group calculations otherwise, finding strong agreement. To further assess the quality of the variational states, we evaluate the magnetization in the x and z directions for the quantum Ising models and compute the topological entanglement entropy for the Kitaev honeycomb model. Finally, we prepare approximate ground states of the Kitaev honeycomb model with 48 qubits, in both the gapped and gapless regimes, on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum computer using parametrized circuits obtained from Pauli Path simulation. We achieve a relative energy error of approximately $5\%$ without error mitigation and demonstrate the braiding of Abelian anyons on the quantum device beyond fixed-point models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an alternative methodology for computing potentials matrix elements within the Lagrange-mesh method in momentum space. The proposed approach extends the range of treatable potentials to include previously inaccessible cases, such as the Coulomb and linear interactions. It enables, in particular, an efficient and accurate treatment of the Cornell potential, which plays an important role in potential models for hadronic physics. The method is validated across a variety of systems, with special attention given to the representation of both momentum and position probability densities.</description>

      <title>Realistic Threat Models for Fiber and Free-Space Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future global quantum communication networks, or quantum Internet, will realize high-rate secure communication and entanglement distribution for large-scale users over long distances. Continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a powerful setting for secure quantum communications, thanks to the use of room-temperature off-the-shelf optical devices and the potential to reach high rates. However, the achievable performance of CV-QKD protocols is fundamentally limited by the fact that they appear to be fragile to both loss and noise. In this study, we provide a general framework for analyzing the composable finite-size security of CV-QKD with Gaussian-modulated coherent-state protocol (GMCS) under various levels of trust for the loss and noise experienced by the users of the protocol. Our work is comprehensive of several practical scenarios, encompassing both active and passive eavesdropping configurations, with both wired (i.e., fiber-based) and wireless (i.e., free-space and satellite-based) quantum communication channels. Our numerical results evaluate the robustness of the GMCS protocol under varying levels of trust and demonstrate that it is difficult for a practical protocol to remain robust against untrusted loss at the transmitter. In the wireless case, we analyze a scenario with a sun-synchronous satellite, showing that its key distribution rate, even with the worst level of trust, can outperform a ground chain of ideal quantum repeaters. Our results indicate that, when it comes to engineering and optimizing quantum-safe networks, it is essential to mitigate the shortcomings caused by critical trade-offs between rate performance, trust level, system noise, and communication distance.</description>

Abstract: Ladder-type two-photon excitation of an atom from a ground state $|g\rangle$, to an intermediate excited state $|e\rangle$, and, finally, to a Rydberg state $|r\rangle$, has a variety of uses from quantum information to sensing. A common scheme for detecting this transition optically is through electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). However, in inverted wavelength schemes, where the ground-to-excited transition wavelength is shorter than the excited-to-Rydberg transition wavelength, the strength of the EIT feature on the lower-leg beam is strongly reduced in a Doppler-broadened medium. Here, we report on an alternative two-photon spectroscopic feature, which we term the two-photon Autler-Townes resonance, observed on the upper-leg beam. Compared to the EIT signal, this feature's superior signal-to-noise ratio allows one to resolve Rydberg resonances with principal quantum number as high as $n=80$. We also show that such a feature can be utilized to generate an error signal for stabilizing the frequency of the upper-leg beam.</description>

Abstract: We consider the discrimination of quantum sequences under maximum-confidence measurements and show that the optimal discrimination of a quantum sequence ensemble can always be factorized into that of each individual ensemble. In other words, the optimal quantum sequence discrimination under maximum-confidence measurements can be achieved just by performing a maximum-confidence discrimination independently at each step of the quantum sequence. We also show that the maximum confidence of identifying a quantum sequence is to achieve the maximum confidence of identifying each state comprising the quantum sequence. We further provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal quantum state discrimination under maximum-confidence measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of large spins in static and rotating magnetic fields: Entanglement resonances and kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the quantum dynamics of both a single large spin and a pair of spins in the presence of static and rotating magnetic fields, which can be important for qudit-based quantum technologies. Notably, we find resonant, periodic oscillations between two maximally stretched states, irrespective of how large the spin is. Additionally, we observe periodic transitions between sublevels with magnetic quantum numbers of opposite signs. The dynamics also exhibit a periodic transfer of the spin to the maximally stretched state, starting from the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian. For a pair of spins, we derive various resonance conditions and further analyze the entanglement generated by dipole-dipole interactions. In the case of two spin-1/2 particles, the entanglement dynamics reveal resonances and kinks in the maximum entanglement, and their criteria can be obtained from the energy spectrum. Strikingly, we show that the kink can be exploited to engineer the entanglement dynamics. Finally, we briefly discuss the regime of weak dipolar interactions, which are relevant for dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the scheme of attosecond quantum interferometry (AQI), the quantum optical version of classical attosecond interferometry, which allows to measure quantum optical properties on the attosecond time-scale. We develop how the scheme of AQI can be used for engineering the phase-space and photon statistics properties of the emitted harmonics, using the relative phase of a two-color driving field as a control, and further enables to manipulate the field correlations as well as their entanglement characteristics. In addition, this scheme allows us to learn properties of the phase-space distribution of the harmonic quantum state, by means of measuring an attosecond quantum tomography trace. This serves as a new type of protocol for in situ attosecond measurements of quantum optical observables. With this, we achieve to further connect all-optical attosecond measurement schemes with quantum optics, allowing for a rich manifold of observations.</description>

      <title>Quantum error mitigation using energy sampling and extrapolation enhanced Clifford data regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian Geometric Quantum Energy Pump</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump realized by a transitionless geometric quantum drive--a time-dependent Hamiltonian supplemented by a counterdiabatic term generated by a prescribed trajectory on a smooth control manifold--that coherently transports states within a degenerate subspace. When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class. We outline an implementation with artificial atoms, which are realizable on various platforms including trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, and semiconductor quantum dots. The resulting energy pump can serve as a quantum transducer or charger, and as a metrological tool for measuring phase coherences in quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A basic postulate of modern compositional approaches to generalised physical theories is the generalised Born rule, in which probabilities are postulated to be computable from the composition of states and effects. In this paper we consider whether this postulate, and the strength of the identification between scalars and probabilities, can be argued from basic principles. To this end, we first consider the most naive possible process- theoretic interpretation of textbook quantum theory, in which physical processes (unitaries) along with states and effects (kets and bras) and a probability function from states and effects satisfying just some basic compatibility axioms are identified. We then show that any process theory equipped with such structure is equivalent to an alternative process theory in which the generalised Born rule holds. We proceed to consider introduction of noise into any such theory, and observe that the result of doing so is a strengthening of the identification between scalars and probabilities; from bare monoid homomorphisms to semiring isomorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to estimate nonstabilizerness in quantum circuits, measured by the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimations are highly beneficial in practical applications. We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both unstructured random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model. Moreover, the graph representation of quantum circuits naturally integrates hardware-specific information. Simulations on noisy quantum hardware highlight the potential of the proposed GNN to predict the SRE measured on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing ground-state interaction strength of neutral atoms via Floquet stroboscopic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral atom systems are promising platforms for quantum simulation and computation, owing to their long coherence times. However, their intrinsically weak ground-state interactions pose a major limitation to the advancement of scalable quantum simulation and computation. To address this challenge, we propose an approach to enhancing the ground-state interaction strength of neutral atoms via Floquet modulation of a Rydberg atomic ensemble. Each Floquet period consists of ground-state coupling followed by a pulse driving the transition from the ground state to the Rydberg state. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that after a defined evolution time, neutral atoms within Rydberg ensembles can collectively form a $W$ state in the ground-state manifold. Even when the Rydberg interaction strength is far below the blockade regime, the fidelity remains remarkably high. Finally, we analyze the application of this scheme in the preparation of single-photon sources. In general, our proposed mechanism offers an efficient and highly controllable method for quantum state preparation within the Rydberg atomic ensembles, significantly enhancing the accuracy and stability of quantum state engineering while providing a well-controlled quantum environment for single-photon generation.</description>

      <title>Comparing quantum channels using Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps: A physically meaningful approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum technologies, quantum channels are essential elements for the transmission of quantum states. The action of a quantum channel usually introduces noise in the quantum state and thereby reduces the information contained in it. Concatenating a quantum channel with another quantum channel makes it more noisy and degrades its information and resource preservability. These are mathematically described by completely positive trace-preserving linear maps that represent the generic evolution of quantum systems. These are special cases of Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. In this work, we demonstrate a physically meaningful way to compare a pair of quantum channels using Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. More precisely, given a pair of quantum channels and an arbitrary unknown input state, we show that if the output state of one quantum channel from the pair can be obtained from the output statistics of the other channel from the pair using some quantum measurement, then the latter channel from the pair can be obtained from the former channel by concatenating it with a Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear map. This relation between these two channels is a preorder, and we try to study its characterization in this work. We try to characterize the difficulty of implementing the latter channel, given that the former channel has already been implemented via a quantifier, namely, physical implementability. We also illustrate the implications of our results for the incompatibility of quantum devices through an example.</description>

      <title>Choi-level twirling of quantum channels: finite constructions and non-compact transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twirling, i.e. averaging over symmetry actions, is a standard tool for reducing quantum states and channels to a symmetry-invariant form. We study channel twirling from the perspective of the channel-state duality and provide a constructive Choi-level description of the averaging map induced by arbitrary input/output representations. Our main technical result concerns the collective setting: for $\pi^{\textrm{in}}(U)=U^{\otimes t_{\textrm{in}}}$ and $\pi^{\textrm{out}}(U)=U^{\otimes t_{\textrm{out}}}$, we introduce a partial-transpose reduction that removes the contragredient action and converts the mixed (walled Brauer) channel twirl into an ordinary Schur-Weyl twirl of the partially transposed Choi operator under $U^{\otimes(t_{\textrm{in}}+t_{\textrm{out}})}$, enabling explicit permutation-based formulas without constructing walled Brauer idempotents or mixed Schur transforms. Beyond compact symmetries, we extend channel twirling to reductive, generally non-unitary groups via Cartan decomposition and obtain an invariant-sector decomposition of the averaged Choi operator with weights determined solely by the Abelian Cartan component. Finally, we provide two finite realizations of channel averaging: a "dual" implementation as a convex mixture of unitary-$1$-design channels acting on invariant sectors, and a design-like reconstruction showing that weighted group $t$-designs induce channel $t$-designs for $t=t_{\textrm{in}}+t_{\textrm{out}}$.</description>

Call the outcomes $X \in[0,1]$ and $Y \in\{0,1\}$. We show that in the limit $n\to\infty$ corresponding to perfect precision for $X$, the probability of $Y=1$ tends to 0 for every $\phi$. Since there is no density matrix, pure or mixed, which upon measurement of any $|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|$ yields outcome 1 with probability 0, our result suggests that a novel type of quantum state beyond Hilbert space is necessary to describe a quantum particle after a perfect position measurement.</description>

      <title>Ergotropic Mpemba crossings in finite-dimensional quantum batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a state initially farther from equilibrium relaxes more rapidly than one that starts nearer to equilibrium. In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing.</description>

      <title>Control the qubit-qubit coupling with double superconducting resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally studied the switching off processes in the double-resonator coupler superconducting quantum circuit. In both frequency and time-domain, we observed the variation of qubit-qubit effective coupling by tuning the frequency differences between qubits and the double-resonator coupler. According to the measurement results, by just shifting about 50 MHz of qubits' frequencies, we can tune the effective qubit-qubit coupling strength from switching off point to two qubit gate point (effective coupling larger than 5 MHz) in double-resonator superconducting quantum circuit.The double-resonator (coupler) superconducting quantum circuit has the advantage of simple fabrications, introducing less flux noises, reducing occupancy of dilution refrigerator cables,which might supply a promising platform for future large-scale superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Instruction-Set Architecture for Programmable NV-Center Quantum Repeater Nodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Programmability is increasingly central in emerging quantum network software stacks, yet the node-internal controller-to-hardware interface for quantum repeater devices remains under-specified. We introduce the idea of an instruction-set architecture (ISA) for controller-driven programmability of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center quantum repeater nodes. Each node consists of an optically interfaced electron spin acting as a data qubit and a long-lived nuclear-spin register acting as a control program. We formalize two modes of programmability: (i) deterministic register control, where the nuclear register is initialized in a basis state to select a specific operation on the data qubit; and (ii) coherent register control, where the register is prepared in superposition, enabling coherent combinations of operations beyond classical programmability. Network protocols are expressed as controller-issued instruction vectors, which we illustrate through a compact realization of the BBPSSW purification protocol. We further show that coherent register control enables interferometric diagnostics such as fidelity witnessing and calibration, providing tools unavailable in classical programmability. Finally, we discuss scalability to multi-electron and multi-nuclear spin architectures and connection to Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) and Kraus formulation.</description>

      <title>QwaveMPS: An efficient open-source Python package for simulating non-Markovian waveguide-QED using matrix product states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QwaveMPS is an open-source Python library for simulating one-dimensional quantum many-body waveguide systems using matrix product states (MPS). It provides a user-friendly interface for constructing, evolving, and analyzing quantum states and operators, facilitating studies in quantum physics and quantum information with waveguide QED systems. This approach enables efficient, scalable simulations by focusing computational resources on the most relevant parts of the quantum system. Thus, one can study a wide range of complex dynamical interactions, including time-delayed feedback effects in the non-Markovian regime and deeply non-linear systems, at a highly reduced computational cost compared to full Hilbert space approaches, making it both practical and convenient to model a variety of open waveguide-QED systems (in Markovian and non-Markovian regimes), treating quantized atoms and quantized photons on an equal footing.</description>

Abstract: An industrial-scale adoption of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) requires the development of practical, stable, resilient and cost-effective hardware that can be manufactured at large scales. In this work we present a high-speed (1.25GHz), field-deployable QKD prototype based on integrated photonics, that is consolidated into standard 19-inch rack compatible units. Through integrated photonics, the system prioritizes autonomous long-term stability in metropolitan settings. The architecture is further simplified by removing the need for chromatic dispersion compensation over metropolitan distances (below 100km). We demonstrate continuous key exchange over more than 4 km of metropolitan optical fiber, where the prototype maintained stable, uninterrupted operation across a measurement spanning more than 12 day-night cycles without manual intervention.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to Adiabaticity via Adaptive Quantum Zeno Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum Zeno dynamics arising from monitoring a time-dependent projector. Starting from a stroboscopic measurement protocol, it is shown that the effective Hamiltonian for Zeno dynamics involves a nonadiabatic geometric connection that takes the form of the Kato-Avron Hamiltonian for parallel transport, stirring the evolution within the time-dependent Zeno subspace. The latter reduces to counterdiabatic driving when projective measurements are performed in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis of the quantum system. The effective Zeno Hamiltonian can also be derived in the context of continuous quantum measurements of a time-dependent observable and the non-Hermitian evolution with a complex absorbing potential varying in time. Our results thus provide a unified framework for realizing shortcuts to adiabaticity via adaptive quantum Zeno measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for simulating resonant inelastic X-ray scattering in battery materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) is the workhorse experimental technique for probing the structural degradation of higher-capacity cathode materials. However, the interpretation of experimental spectra is challenging due to the lack of accurate simulations. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for simulating the RIXS spectrum of molecular clusters hypothesized to form in Li-excess cathodes. The algorithm uses quantum phase estimation to sample the spectrum from a state encoding the scattering transition amplitudes of the cluster valence excitations. We prepare this state in the quantum computer using a block-encoding of the dipole operator and quantum signal processing to implement the Green's function propagator over intermediate core-excited states. To showcase the algorithm, we use a model cluster proposed in recent experimental works consisting of an oxygen dimer bonded to a manganese atom. Using the PennyLane software platform, we report resource estimation for simulating RIXS spectra for chemically motivated active spaces of increasing sizes. For a classically challenging active space with 20 orbitals, the algorithm requires $2.0 \times 10^{10}$ Toffoli gates and $414$ logical qubits.</description>

      <title>A time-to-digital converter with steady calibration through single-photon detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-to-Digital Converters (TDCs) are a crucial tool in a wide array of fields, in particular for quantum communication, where time taggers performance can severely affect the quality of the entire application. Nowadays, FPGA-based TDCs present a viable alternative to ASIC ones, once the non-linear behavior due to the intrinsic nature of the device is properly mitigated. To compensate for said nonlinearities, a calibration procedure is required, which should be maintained throughout its runtime. Here we present the design and the demonstration of a TDC that is FPGA-based showing a residual FWHM jitter of 27 ps, that is scalable for multichannel operation. The target application in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is discussed with a calibration method based on the exploitation of single-photon detection that does not require stopping the data acquisition or using any estimation methods, thus increasing accuracy and removing data loss. The calibration was tested in a relevant environment, investigating the behavior of the device between 5 {\deg}C and 80 {\deg}C. Moreover, our design is capable of continuously streaming up to 12 Mevents/s for up to ~1 week without the TDC overflowing making it ready for a real-life scenario deployment.</description>

      <title>Braiding Majoranas in a linear quantum dot-superconductor array: Mitigating the errors from Coulomb repulsion and residual tunneling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exchanging the positions of two non-Abelian anyons transforms between many-body wavefunctions within a degenerate ground-state manifold. This behavior is fundamentally distinct from fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons. Recently, quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a promising platform for creating topological Kitaev chains that can host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. In this work, we propose a minimal braiding setup in a linear array of quantum dots consisting of two minimal Kitaev chains coupled through an ancillary, normal quantum dot. We focus on the physical effects that are peculiar to quantum dot devices, such as interdot Coulomb repulsion and residual single electron tunneling. We find that the errors caused by either of these effects can be efficiently mitigated by optimal control of the ancillary quantum dot that mediates the exchange of the non-Abelian anyons. Moreover, we propose experimentally accessible methods to find this optimal operating regime and predict signatures of a successful Majorana braiding experiment.</description>

      <title>Suppression and enhancement of bosonic stimulation by atomic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a hallmark of quantum statistics. This bunching can enhance the rates of fundamental processes such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering when atoms scatter into already occupied states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of light scattering follows directly from the occupation of the atom's final momentum state. Here, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a quasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak interactions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, strongly affect atom-light scattering. Changes in local atomic correlations suppress the bosonic enhancement under weak repulsive interactions and increase the scattering rate under attractive ones. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly tuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of magnitude faster than the collisional dynamics of the momentum-space populations. Its extreme sensitivity to correlation effects makes off-resonant light scattering a powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic gases.</description>

Abstract: Hoeffding's formulation and solution to the universal hypothesis testing (UHT) problem had a profound impact on many subsequent works dealing with asymmetric hypotheses. In this work, we introduce a quantum universal hypothesis testing framework that serves as a quantum analog to Hoeffding's UHT. Motivated by Hoeffding's approach, which estimates the empirical distribution and uses it to construct the test statistic, we employ quantum state tomography to reconstruct the unknown state prior to forming the test statistic. Leveraging the concentration properties of quantum state tomography, we establish the exponential consistency of the proposed test: the type II error probability decays exponentially quickly, with the exponent determined by the trace distance between the true state and the nominal state.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced ensemble GANs for anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>Quasi-adiabatic thermal ensemble preparation in the thermodynamic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-adiabatic thermal process for preparing finite-temperature ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. The process gradually transforms a thermal ensemble of a noninteracting system into that of an interacting system of interest over a finite operation time, with the temperature controlled by parameters associated with the entropy of the initial state. We analyze this process in both nonintegrable and integrable spin chains with translational invariance. For the nonintegrable case, numerical simulations combined with a thermodynamic argument indicate that the thermal properties of local observables are accurately reproduced with a single parameter, although the operation time increases exponentially with precision. In contrast, for the integrable transverse-field Ising model, we analytically show that an extensive number of parameters tied to local conserved quantities is generally necessary, and the performance is affected by the presence of a quantum phase transition. These results clarify the potential and limitations of the quasi-adiabatic thermal process for an ensemble preparation and highlight the role of integrability in determining its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Higher-form entanglement asymmetry. Part I. The limits of symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a relative entropy that faithfully diagnoses symmetry breaking in quantum states, possibly within a spatial subregion. In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, for 0- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy and asymmetry of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields. In particular, we find a closed-form expression for the R\'enyi asymmetries of a compact scalar field on spherical subregions in three and four spacetime dimensions, and for higher-form gauge fields in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function (g(2)({\tau})) of single-molecule fluorescence has recently been proposed as a powerful new quantum light spectroscopy that can reveal intrinsic quantum coherence in excitation energy transfer in molecular systems ranging from simple dimers to photosynthetic complexes. Yet, no experiments have been reported to date. Here, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence g(2)({\tau}) quantum light spectroscopy (SMFg2-QLS) that can simultaneously measure the fluorescence intensity, lifetime, spectra, and g(2)({\tau}) with frequency resolution, for a single molecule in a controlled environment at both room temperature and cryogenic temperature. As a proof of principle, we have studied single molecules of IDTBT (indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole), a semiconducting donor-acceptor conjugated copolymer with a chain-like structure that shows a high carrier mobility and annihilation-limited long-range exciton transport. We have observed different g(2)({\tau}=0) values with different bands or bandwidths of the single molecule IDTBT fluorescence. The general features are consistent with theoretical predictions and suggest non-trivial excited state quantum dynamics, possibly showing quantum coherence, although further analysis and confirmation will require additional theoretical calculations that take into account the complexity and inhomogeneity of individual IDTBT single molecular chains. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of frequency- and time-resolved SMFg2-QLS to provide new insights into molecular quantum dynamics and to reveal signatures of intrinsic quantum coherence in photosynthetic light harvesting that are independent of the nature of the light excitation.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces based on Ginzburg-Landau theory under Weyl gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometrical design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors, because the proper placement of intended defects in the current path contribute to flux pinning, a reduction in dissipation, and an increase in achievable current density. Topology optimization is currently one of the most powerful approaches used to determine consistent structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.</description>
