      <title>Synchronization of Synchrotron Radiation Bursts during a spatio-temporal Instability in accelerator-Based source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in dynamical systems, occurring in a wide range of contexts such as mechanical, chemical, biological, and social systems. In this work, we explore a novel manifestation of synchronization in accelerator-based light sources, specifically in storage rings where relativistic electron bunches circulate and emit synchrotron radiation, used for user experiments. In such systems, a systematic spatio-temporal instability arises when the bunch contains a large number of electrons. This instability is characterized by the spontaneous formation of microstructures within the bunch, which appear with a bursting behavior. We demonstrate that these bursting events can be synchronized with an external sinusoidal signal by modulating the electric field in a radiofrequency (RF) cavity. This external modulation induces typical synchronization features such as Arnold tongues at fundamental, harmonic, and subharmonic frequencies of the natural bursting rate, as well as phase-slip phenomena near the synchronization threshold. The synchronization mechanism is analyzed using numerical simulations based on the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation, and a proof-of-principle experiment is conducted at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility.</description>

      <title>Threshold Resource Redistribution in Spatially-Structured Kinship Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model for a threshold-based resource redistribution process in a spatially-explicit population, characterizing the relation between kinship network structure, local interactions and persistence. We find that population survival becomes possible for lower resource densities, but leads to increased network heterogeneity and locally centralized clusters. We interpret this in relation to a feedback between the kinship network structure and reproduction ability. Agents receive stochastic resources and solicit additional resources from connected individuals when below a minimum, with each agent contributing a fraction of their excess based on relatedness. We first analyze a fully-connected population with uniform redistribution fraction and discuss mean field expectations as well as finite size corrections. We extend this model to a hub-and-spoke network, exploring the impact of network asymmetry or centrality on resource distribution. We then develop a spatially-limited population model with diffusion, local pairing, reproduction and mortality. Redistribution is introduced as a function of relatedness (generational distance through most-recent common ancestor) and distance. Redistribution-dependent populations exhibit a higher level of relational closeness with increased clustering for agents of highest node strength. These results highlight the interaction of resource density, cooperation and kinship in a spatially-limited regime.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonlinear Heterogeneity in Physical Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical neural networks typically train linear synaptic weights while treating device nonlinearities as fixed. We show the opposite - by training the synaptic nonlinearity itself, as in Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architectures, we yield markedly higher task performance per physical resource and improved performance-parameter scaling than conventional linear weight-based networks, demonstrating ability of KAN topologies to exploit reconfigurable nonlinear physical dynamics.
  We experimentally realise physical KANs in silicon-on-insulator devices we term 'Synaptic Nonlinear Elements' (SYNEs), operating at room temperature, microampere currents, 2 MHz speeds and ~750 fJ per nonlinear operation, with no observed degradation over 10^13 measurements and months-long timescales.
  We demonstrate nonlinear function regression, classification, and prediction of Li-Ion battery dynamics from noisy real-world multi-sensor data. Physical KANs outperform equivalently-parameterised software multilayer perceptron networks across all tasks, with up to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters, and two orders of magnitude fewer devices than linear weight based physical networks. These results establish learned physical nonlinearity as a hardware-native computational primitive for compact and efficient learning systems, and SYNE devices as effective substrates for heterogenous nonlinear computing.</description>
