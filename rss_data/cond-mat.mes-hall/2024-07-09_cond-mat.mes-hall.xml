      <title>The mechanism of electrical conduction in glassy semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the dominant charge carrier in glassy semiconducting alloys is a compound particle in the form of an electron or hole bound to an intimate pair of topological lattice defects; the particle is similar to the polaron solution of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian. The spatial component of the density of states for these special polarons is determined by the length scale of spatial modulation of electronegativity caused by a separate set of standalone topological defects. The latter length scale is fixed by the cooperativity size for structural relaxation; the size is largely independent of temperature in the glass but above melting, it decreases with temperature. Thus we predict that the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity should exhibit a jump in the slope near the glass transition; the size of the jump is predicted to increase with the fragility of the melt. The predicted values of the jump and of the conductivity itself are consistent with experiment.</description>

      <title>Wrinkle formation during uniaxial compression of a graphene sheet lying on a soft (polymer) substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling of wrinkles and folds formation in single and multilayer graphene sheets lying on flat deformable (polymer) substrates has been carried out. It is shown that the deformability of the substrate leads to the appearance of significant features. In contrast to the flat surfaces of rigid crystals molecules of soft polymer substrates can penetrate into wrinkles and folds of the graphene sheet, completely filling the voids beneath the sheet. Moreover, the vertical folds of the sheet can be directed not only upward from the substrate, but also down into the substrate, penetrating it. By modeling the uniaxial compression of the two-component graphene/polymer system, the external pressure and thermal vibrations of the substrate molecules have been taken into account. High external pressure $p\ge 150$~bar leads to a noticeable additional stabilization of the initial ground state of the system. At uniaxial compression above the critical value, a system of localized wrinkles whose interior is filled with molecules of the substrate appears in the graphene sheet. Increasing temperature leads to an increase in the size of wrinkles and to a decrease in their number. The largest wrinkles form before the substrate begins to melt. Melting leads to the complete disappearance of all wrinkles and small folds. Cooling of the melted substrate leads to its crystallization, but the system of wrinkles in the graphene sheet on the surface is not restored. Therefore, melting of the polymer substrate and its subsequent cooling can serve as a method getting rid of localized wrinkles and folds of the graphene sheet.</description>

      <title>Quantitative measurement of viscosity in two-dimensional electron fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron hydrodynamics is an emerging framework that describes dynamics of interacting electron systems as conventional fluids. While evidence for hydrodynamic-like transport is reported in a variety of two-dimensional materials, precise quantitative measurement of the core parameter, electron viscosity, remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that magnetoresistance in Corbino-shaped graphene devices offers a simultaneous Ohmmeter/viscosometer, allowing us to disentangle the individual Ohmic and viscous contributions to the transport response, even in the mixed flow regime. Most surprising, we find that in both monolayer and bilayer graphene, the effective electron-electron scattering rate scales linearly with temperature, at odds with the expected $T$-squared dependence expected from conventional Fermi liquid theory, but consistent with a recently identified tomographic flow regime, which was theoretically conjectured to be generic for two-dimensional charged fluids.</description>

      <title>Theory of Rashba splitting in quantum-well states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory pertaining to the asymptotic behavior of Rashba energy splitting in a quantum-well state (QWS). First, unlike previous studies, we derive $\textbf{k}$-linear Rashba term from a first-principles Hamiltonian in a physically convincing manner. The $\textbf{k}$-dependent in-plane intrinsic magnetic-field term originates from the spin--orbit interaction and hybridized $s$-$p_z$ orbital, whereas a steep nucleus potential realizes the linearity for the $\textbf{k}$ of the effective magnetic field. Next, we analyze the Rashba effect of a QWS using a one-dimensional tight-binding model developed based on the bottom-up approach that is aforementioned. The Rashba-splitting behavior of this system is captured from the density at the interface. The density can be expressed analytically as a function of the monolayer number and well depth. Finally, we apply our formula to the QWS of a few-monolayers Ag on an Au(111) surface to validate the theory based on a realistic system. Our tight-binding analysis qualitatively fits the first-principles result using only two fitting parameters and predicts the optimal condition for achieving a large Rashba splitting.</description>

      <title>Subgap-state-mediated transport in superconductor--semiconductor hybrid islands: Weak and strong coupling regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems play a crucial role in realizing nanoscale quantum devices, including hybrid qubits, Majorana bound states, and Kitaev chains. For such hybrid devices, subgap states play a prominent role in their operation. In this work, we study such subgap states via Coulomb and tunneling spectroscopy through a superconducting island defined in a semiconductor nanowire fully coated by a superconductor. We systematically explore regimes ranging from an almost decoupled island to the open configuration. In the weak coupling regime, the experimental observations are very similar in the absence of a magnetic field and when one flux quantum is piercing the superconducting shell. Conversely, in the strong coupling regime, significant distinctions emerge between the two cases. We ascribe this different behavior to the existence of subgap states at one flux quantum, which become observable only for sufficiently strong coupling to the leads. We support our interpretation using a simple model to describe transport through the island. Our study highlights the importance of studying a broad range of tunnel couplings for understanding the rich physics of hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>Precise correspondence between the p-wave chiral superfluid and the spinless bosonic superfluid on the lowest Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a precise formal correspondence between a spinless p-wave chiral fermionic superfluid and a spinless bosonic superfluid in a strong magnetic field by accounting for the correct superfluid vorticity in the effective theory of the former. In literature, the vorticity manifests itself incompletely as the magnetic field. This paper demonstrates this substitution can be understood as a truncation in the relevant expansion scheme, together with field redefinitions. Those discarded components are critical to restoring the Berry phase term in the effective theory, and the restoration incapsulates these two systems in the same master Lagrangian. In addition to clarifying the structure of the Berry phase, this formalism permits solving the bosonic system on the lowest Landau level (LLL) based on the method of analogue. In particular, we show that in the linear regime, the Maxwell equations governing these systems are identical by reformulating the vortex crystal with an auxiliary electromagnetic field. This approach offers a unified view for these systems and yields solutions that are rotationally covariant, gauge invariants, and physically interpretable.</description>

      <title>Electrical magnetochiral anisotropy and quantum metric in chiral conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (EMCA) refers to the chirality- and current-dependent nonlinear magnetoresistance in chiral conductors and is commonly interpreted in a semimclassical picture. In this work, we reveal a quantum geometry origin of EMCA by a chiral rectangular lattice model that resembles a chiral organic conductor (DM-EDT-TTF)${}_2$ClO${}_4$ studied for EMCA recently and exhibits symmetry-protected Dirac bands similar to those of graphene. Compared to the semiclassical term, we find that Dirac states contribute significantly to EMCA by the quantum metric when Fermi energy is close to the Dirac point. Besides, we discovered topological insulator state can emerge once SOC is added to our chiral model lattice. Our work paves a path to understand quantum geometry in the magneto-transport of chiral materials.</description>

      <title>Simulation of temperature-dependent quantum gates in silicon quantum dots with frequency shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve quantum computing using semiconductor spin qubits, the spin qubits must be precisely controlled. However, unexpected noise limits this precision and prevents the implementation of error correction codes. Specifically, frequency shifts have been found to suppress one-qubit gate fidelity. Although the exact source of the frequency shifts remains unclear, several experiments have indicated a relationship between the frequency shift and heating from the control signal. Based on these results, we modeled the heating effect using the low-temperature dependence of specific heat from the Debye model to simulate qubit control with frequency shifts. This model quantitatively reproduces some of the experimental results and makes it possible to simulate qubit gates with temperature-dependent frequency shifts. The simulated control fidelity of the proposed model was consistent with the experimental results, demonstrating that a gate fidelity above $99.9$% can be achieved in a hot environment. Additionally, our comparison of the two temperature-dependent frequency shift models reveals the condition for a microscopic frequency shift model in which the variance of the frequency shift is limited to a specific range. Furthermore, we investigated gate fidelity using the DRAG method and demonstrated the utility of temperature-dependent simulations.</description>

      <title>Multiple boundary states in bilayer and decorated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological boundary states have attracted widespread fascination due to their series of intriguing properties. In this paper, we investigate the multiple boundary states within the two kinds of extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models. The coexistence of boundary states that exist both in the bulk and band gaps is realized based on the bilayer SSH-like model, which consists of two conventional square-root SSH models that are directly coupled. We further show the square-root topology within the decorated SSH-like model, which supports multiple boundary states that could be embedded into the bulk continuum by tuning the hopping parameters. In addition, the connection between the decorated SSH-like model and its effectively decomposed counterparts is revealed. Our results broaden insight into the multiple boundary states and open up an exciting avenue for the future exploration of square-root topology.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing an individual charge fluctuator in a Si/SiGe quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge noise is a major obstacle to improved gate fidelities in silicon spin qubits. Numerous methods exist to mitigate charge noise, including improving device fabrication, dynamical decoupling, and real-time parameter estimation. In this work, we demonstrate a new class of techniques to mitigate charge noise in semiconductor quantum dots by controlling the noise sources themselves. Using two different classical feedback methods, we stabilize an individual charged two-level fluctuator in a Si/SiGe quantum dot. These control methods reduce the low-frequency component of the noise power spectrum by an order of magnitude. These techniques also enable stabilizing the fluctuator in either of its states. In the future, such techniques may enable improved coherence times in quantum-dot spin qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the combined effects of dynamical Coulomb blockade and integer quantum Hall effect in a coupled hybrid metal-semiconductor setup provide a pathway for realizing resonant tunneling in Luttinger liquids with interaction strength $\eta\leq 1/2$. We explore emergent quantum criticality, charge fractionalization and transport in such a hybrid setup, and verify their robust non-Fermi liquid behaviors. We also present a method to implement $1/2&lt;\eta&lt;1$ within the same hybrid setup. Our work opens a promising route for quantum simulating exotic zero temperature quantum critical phenomena associated with Luttinger liquid physics in a nanoengineered electronic circuit with well-defined quantum Hall channels.</description>

      <title>Quantum Noise Spectroscopy of Critical Slowing Down in an Atomically Thin Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low frequency critical fluctuations in magnetic materials encode important information about the physics of magnetic ordering, especially in the associated critical exponents. While a number of techniques have been established to study magnetic critical fluctuations in bulk materials, few approaches maintain the required microscopic resolution, temporal range, and signal sensitivity to quantitatively analyze critical fluctuations in magnetic phases of 2D materials. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as quantum probes, we implement $T_2$ (spin decoherence) noise magnetometry to quantitatively study critical dynamics in a tri-layer sample of the Van der Waals magnetic material CrSBr. We characterize critical fluctuations across the magnetic phase transition in CrSBr by analyzing the NV spin echo coherence decay on time scales that approach the characteristic fluctuation correlation time $\tau_c$ at criticality, allowing us to study the temperature dependence of critical slowing down. By modelling the spin echo decoherence using theoretical models for critical dynamics, we are able to extract the critical exponent $\nu$ for the correlation length. We find a value for $\nu$ which deviates from the Ising prediction and suggests the role of long-range dipolar interactions in modifying the critical behavior of magnetic fluctuation modes in CrSBr at the 2D limit. We further compare the divergence of correlation length in CrSBr to the predicted exponential divergence for 2D XY criticality, and find evidence suggesting the possibility of such behavior in a temperature window near $T_C$ where static magnetic domains are absent. Our work provides a first demonstration of the capability of decoherence based NV noise magnetometry to quantitatively analyze critical scaling laws in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Light-Induced Mirror Symmetry Breaking and Charge Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that light can break mirror symmetries and combining symmetries with a uniform time translation, and their breaking is characterized by an off-diagonal charge conductivity. Taking periodically driven graphene as an example, we show that mirror symmetries about the $xz$ and $yz$ planes and the combining symmetries, the symmetries of combinations of the mirror operations about these planes and a uniform time translation, can be broken by linearly or circularly polarized light. We also show that this symmetry breaking induces the time-averaged off-diagonal symmetric or antisymmetric charge conductivity in a nonequilibrium steady state with linearly or circularly, respectively, polarized light. Our results are experimentally testable in pump-probe measurements. This work will pave the way for controlling mirror symmetries via light and utilizing the light-induced mirror symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Topological Hall effect of Skyrmions from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a first-principles approach for calculating the topological Hall effect (THE) in magnets with noncollinear nanoscale spin textures. We employ a modeling method to determine the effective magnetic field induced by the spin texture, thereby circumventing the computational challenges associated with superlattice calculations. Based on these results, we construct a Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonian to characterize the electronic states and calculate the Hall conductivity. Applying this approach to the skyrmion material $\rm Gd_2PdSi_3$ shows good agreement with experimental data. Our analysis in momentum space further reveals that the dominant contribution to the THE arises from the crossing points between the folded bands along high-symmetry lines in the Brillouin zone. This work advances numerical techniques for simulating general magnetic system, examplified by but not restricted to skyrmion lattice, and its result offering insights into the complex interplay between spin textures and electronic transport.</description>

      <title>Super-ballistic transport in an open quantum ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the degeneracies of the ring-Hamiltonian are removed by the asymmetric ring-to-electrodes configuration for an open quantum ring (OQR), the overall junction transmission function exhibits fano-type antiresonance, resulting a net circular current appears within the channel, that is the ring around the degenerate energy levels of the ring-Hamiltonian. We investigate the system size scaling properties of the channel conductance and the overall junction conductance of an OQR. Ballistic transport is the unhindered flow of a charge carrier within a conductor. Here we find beyond-ballistic transport near both the degenerate and non-degenerate eigenenergies of the ring-Hamiltonian, depending on the ring-to-lead configuration. This is a purely OQR phenomenon associated with the quantum interference effect between two counter-propagating electronic waves having nearly equal and opposite momenta. Thus there is no equivalent phenomenon in open quantum junctions with linear channel.</description>

      <title>Gyroid ferromagnetic nanostructures in 3D magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research chapter provides a comprehensive overview of ferromagnetic gyroidal nanostructures, combining a review of state-of-the-art research with our new findings on their implications for 3D magnonics. Both static and dynamic magnetization studies show that non-trivial shape anisotropy, chirality, and inhomogeneous demagnetization fields influenced by specific crystallographic arrangements lead to multiple low-energy state magnetization textures, spin-wave mode localization, and controllable spin-wave propagation, highlighting the substantial potential of gyroidal nanostructures.
  The review integrates insights into micro/nano texturing to elucidate the intricate relationships between gyroidal geometry, chirality, and their effective magnetic properties, especially at microwave frequencies. Our study of resonance frequencies in gyroid samples under rotational field manipulation further reveals the significant influence of geometric anisotropy on ferromagnetic resonance signal strength. This chapter establishes a fundamental understanding of ferromagnetic gyroidal nanostructures, paving the way for their future investigation in 3D magnonics.</description>

      <title>Unconventional edge states in a two-leg ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some popular mechanisms for restricting the diffusion of waves include introducing disorder (to provoke Anderson localization) and engineering topologically non-trivial phases (to allow for topological edge states to form). However, other methods for inducing somewhat localized states in elementary lattice models have been historically much less studied. Here we show how edge states can emerge within a simple two-leg ladder of coupled harmonic oscillators, where it is important to include interactions beyond those at the nearest neighbour range. Remarkably, depending upon the interplay between the coupling strength along the rungs of the ladder and the next-nearest neighbour coupling strength along one side of the ladder, edge states can indeed appear at particular energies. In a wonderful manifestation of a type of bulk-edge correspondence, these edge state energies correspond to the quantum number for which additional stationary points appear in the continuum bandstructure of the equivalent problem studied with periodic boundary conditions. Our theoretical results are relevant to a swathe of classical or quantum lattice model simulators, such that the proposed edge states may be useful for applications including waveguiding in metamaterials and quantum transport.</description>

Abstract: Topological quantum numbers are often used to characterise the topological order of phase having protected gapless edge modes when the system is kept in a space with the boundary. The famous examples in this category are the quantized electrical Hall conductance and thermal Hall conductance, which encodes the topological order of integer and fractional quantum Hall states. Here, we review the recent thermal transport study of integer and fractional quantum Hall states realized in graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Five-stage ordering to a topological-defect-mediated ground state in a buckyball artificial spin ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin ices are arrays of coupled nanomagnets, which exhibit a variety of fascinating collective behaviour including emergent magnetic monopoles, charge screening, and novel phase transitions. However, they have mainly been confined to two dimensions due to the challenges inherent to their fabrication and characterisation in three dimensions. Exploiting the third dimension offers new degrees of freedom leading to, for example, topological effects that arise from the curvature. Here, using numerical simulations, we uncover the low-temperature magnetic behaviour of a finite three-dimensional spin lattice: the buckyball artificial spin ice, where the spins are located on the edges of a regular buckyball. This frustrated system has a non-trivial structural topology that results in a rich spectrum of thermal magnetic behaviour, beginning with a crossover from paramagnetism to a Spin-Ice sector followed by the formation of an imperfect charge crystal, before partial spin order is established in three separate steps. The final ground state configuration is described by a pair of robust topological magnetic defects that arise because of the finite curved nature of the spatial-spin interaction. Our work uncovers the intricate thermodynamics of the buckyball artificial spin ice. In doing so, we pave the way to designing unusual magnetic textures in other curved three-dimensional nanomagnetic systems by exploiting the interplay between structural topology and the dipolar interaction.</description>

      <title>Statistical study and parallelisation of multiplexed single-electron sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing electric current from a single-electron source is a main challenge in an effort to establish the standard of the ampere defined by the fixed value of the elementary charge $e$ and operation frequency $f$. While the current scales with $f$, due to an operation frequency limit for maintaining accurate single-electron transfer, parallelisation of singleelectron sources is expected to be a more practical solution to increase the generated electric current $I = Nef$, where $N$ is a number of parallelised devices. One way to parallelise single-electron sources without increasing the complexity in device operation is to use a common gate. Such a scheme will require each device to have the same operation parameters for single-electron transfer. In order to investigate this possibility, we study the statistics for operation gate voltages using single-electron sources embedded in a multiplexer circuit. The multiplexer circuit allows us to measure 64 single-electron sources individually in a single cooldown. We also demonstrate the parallelisation of three single-electron sources and observe the generated current enhanced by a factor of three.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced topological phase transition at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Multiple Interacting Photonic Modes in Strongly Coupled Organic Microcavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Room temperature cavity quantum electrodynamics with molecular materials in optical cavities offers exciting prospects for controlling electronic, nuclear and photonic degrees of freedom for applications in physics, chemistry and materials science. However, achieving strong coupling with molecular ensembles typically requires high molecular densities and substantial electromagnetic field confinement. These conditions usually involve a significant degree of molecular disorder and a highly structured photonic density of states. It remains unclear to what extent these additional complexities modify the usual physical picture of strong coupling developed for atoms and inorganic semiconductors. Using a microscopic quantum description of molecular ensembles in realistic multimode optical resonators, we show that the emergence of a vacuum Rabi splitting in linear spectroscopy is a necessary but not sufficient metric of coherent admixing between light and matter. In low finesse multi-mode situations we find that molecular dipoles can be partially hybridised with photonic dissipation channels associated with off-resonant cavity modes. These vacuum-induced dissipative processes ultimately limit the extent of light-matter coherence that the system can sustain.</description>

      <title>Prolonged Phase Segregation of Mixed-Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals in the Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical issue hindering the potential applications of semiconductor mixed-halide perovskites is the phase segregation effect, wherein localized regions enriched with one type of halide anions would be formed upon continuous photogeneration of the excited-state charge carriers. These unexpected phases are capable of remixing again in the dark under the entropic driving force, the process of which are now being exclusively studied after mixed-halide perovskites have arrived at the final stage of complete phase segregation. Here we show that after the removal of laser excitation from a solid film of mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals with partial phase segregation, the iodide- and bromide-rich regions can continuously grow in the dark for a prolonged time period of several minutes. We propose that this dark phase segregation is sustained by the local electric fields associated with the surface-trapped charge carriers, whose slow dissipation out of mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals causes a delayed occurrence of the reversal phase remixing process.</description>

      <title>Imaging magnetic spiral phases, skyrmion clusters, and skyrmion displacements at the surface of bulk Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surfaces -- by breaking bulk symmetries, introducing roughness, or hosting defects -- can significantly influence magnetic order in magnetic materials. Determining their effect on the complex nanometer-scale phases present in certain non-centrosymmetric magnets is an outstanding problem requiring high-resolution magnetic microscopy. Here, we use scanning SQUID-on-tip microscopy to image the surface of bulk Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ at low temperature and in a magnetic field applied along $\left\langle100\right\rangle$. Real-space maps measured as a function of applied field reveal the microscopic structure of the magnetic phases and their transitions. In low applied field, we observe a magnetic texture consistent with an in-plane stripe phase, pointing to the existence of a distinct surface state. In the low-temperature skyrmion phase, the surface is populated by clusters of disordered skyrmions, which emerge from rupturing domains of the tilted spiral phase. Furthermore, we displace individual skyrmions from their pinning sites by applying an electric potential to the scanning probe, thereby demonstrating local skyrmion control at the surface of a magnetoelectric insulator.</description>

      <title>Measurement of microwave photon correlations at millikelvin with a thermal detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave photons are important carriers of quantum information in many promising platforms for quantum computing. They can be routinely generated, controlled, and teleported in experiments, indicating a variety of applications in quantum technology. However, observation of quantum statistical properties of microwave photons remains demanding: The energy of several microwave photons is considerably smaller than the thermal fluctuation of any room-temperature detector, while amplification necessarily induces noise. Here, we present a measurement technique with a nanobolometer that directly measures the photon statistics at millikelvin and overcomes this trade-off. We apply our method to thermal states generated by a blackbody radiator operating in the regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics. We demonstrate the photon number resolvedness of the nanobolometer, and reveal the n(n+1)-scaling law of the photon number variance as indicated by the Bose--Einstein distribution. By engineering the coherent and incoherent proportions of the input field, we observe the transition between super-Poissonian and Poissonian statistics of the microwave photons from the bolometric second-order correlation measurement. This technique is poised to serve in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics with microwave photons and function as a scalable readout solution for a quantum information processor.</description>

Abstract: Novel collinear magnet, the altermagnet (AM) with spin-splitting energy band and zero net magnetization have attracted great interest due to its potential spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate AM-like phases in a microscopic Kondo lattice model, widely used for heavy fermion compounds. With the framework of fermionic parton mean-field theory, we find the $d$-wave AM state can coexist with the intrinsic Kondo screening effect in such itinerant-local electron system if an alternating next-nearest-neighbor-hopping (NNNH) is included. Such alternating NNNH take nonmagnetic atoms, neglected in usual antiferromagnetism study, into account when encountering real-life candidate AM materials. The AM-like states are characterized by their spin-splitting quasiparticle bands, Fermi surface, spin-resolved distribution function and conductivity. It is suggested that the magnetic quantum oscillation and charge transport measurement can detect those AM-like phases. We hope the present work may be useful for exploring AM-like phases in $f$-electron compounds.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Fermi-surface in the current-driven Hidden state of 1T-TaS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the metallic metastable state in 1T-TaS2. Using microARPES, we measure the spatially-dependent modifications of the electronic structure of the sample following a short current pulse. We observe that, in some regions of the sample, a Fermi surface emerges, while other regions remain gapped. A detailed study of the band structure in these different regions suggests that the metallic parts are in a state similar to the nearly commensurate charge density wave (NC-CDW) state, where the gaps are suppressed and a band crosses the Fermi level. Furthermore, we find that the metallic and insulating regions of the sample exhibit different dispersions normal to the planes. This observation is consistent with a scenario in which the current pulse breaks the star-of-David dimers present in the commensurate charge density wave (C-CDW) state.</description>

      <title>Influence of capacitance and thermal fluctuations on the Josephson diode effect in asymmetric higher-harmonic SQUIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric two-junction SQUIDs with different current-phase relations in the two Josephson junctions, involving higher Josephson harmonics, demonstrate a flux-tunable Josephson diode effect (asymmetry between currents flowing in the opposite directions, which can be tuned by the magnetic flux through the interferometer loop). We theoretically investigate influence of junction capacitance and thermal fluctuations on performance of such Josephson diodes. Our main focus is on the "minimal model" with one junction in the SQUID loop possessing the sinusoidal current-phase relation and the other one featuring additional second harmonic. Capacitance generally weakens the diode effect in the resistive branch (R state) of the current-voltage characteristic (CVC) both in the absence and in the presence of external ac irradiation. At the same time, it leads to qualitatively new features of the Josephson diode effect such as asymmetry of the retrapping currents (which are a manifestation of hysteretic CVC). In particular, the limiting case of the single-sided hysteresis becomes accessible. In its turn, thermal fluctuations are known to lead to nonzero average voltages at any finite current, even below the critical value. We demonstrate that in the diode regime, the fluctuation-induced voltage can become strongly (exponentially) asymmetric. In addition, we find asymmetry of the switching currents arising both due to thermal activation and due to Josephson plasma resonances in the presence of ac irradiation.</description>

Abstract: We have proposed an arbitrary vector beam (VB) generation scheme in a thin disk-shaped quantum dot (QD) medium considering phonon interaction. The QD biexciton system exhibits interplay between first and third-order nonlinear susceptibility between two orthogonal circular polarisation transitions. Three QD transitions are coupled with one applied weak and two strong control orbital angular momentum (OAM) carrying fields. Therefore, the applied field experiences absorption, and a new field with the desired OAM is generated via four-wave mixing (FWM). These two orthogonal field superpositions produce VB at the QD medium end. We have also demonstrated the polarization rotation of a VB by changing only the relative control field phase. Additionally, we have analyzed the effect of temperature on the VB generation.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Unconventional Rashba Band and Vortex Zero Mode in Topopogical Superconductor Candidate AuSn$_{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological superconductivity (TSC) is a promising platform to host Majorana zero mode (MZM) for topological quantum computing. Recently, the noble metal alloy AuSn$_{4}$ has been identified as an intrinsic surface TSC. However, the atomic visualization of its nontrivial surface states and MZM remains elusive. Here, we report the direct observation of unconventional surface states and vortex zero mode at the gold (Au) terminated surfaces of AuSn$_{4}$, by ultra-low scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy. Distinct from the trivial metallic bulk states at tin (Sn) surfaces, the Au terminated surface exhibits pronounced surface states near Fermi level. Our density functional theory calculations indicate that these states arise from unconventional Rashba bands, where two Fermi circles from different bands share identical helical spin textures, chiralities, and group velocities in the same direction. Furthermore, we find that although the superconducting gap, critical temperature, anisotropic in-plane critical field are almost identical on Au and Sn terminated surfaces, the in-gap bound states inside Abrikosov vortex cores show significant differences. The vortex on Sn terminated surfaces exhibits a conventional Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon bound state while the Au surface shows a sharp zero-energy core state with a long non-splitting distance, resembling an MZM in a non-quantum-limit condition. This distinction may result from the dominant contribution of unconventional Rashba bands near Fermi energy from Au terminated surface. Our results provide a new platform for studying unconventional Rashba band and MZM in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Wave Nonlinear Polarization Control and Signatures of Criticality in a Perovskite Cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising photonic materials for fundamental physics studies and technological applications. Their potential for nonlinear optics has also drawn great interest recently; yet, to date, continuous-wave (CW) nonlinearities have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate CW nonlinear phenomena in a CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite cavity. We first demonstrate optical bistability -- the hallmark of single-mode coherent nonlinear optics. Next we exploit the interplay of nonlinearity and birefringence to demonstrate nonlinear control over the polarization of light. Finally, by measuring the optical hysteresis of our cavity as a function of temperature, we find a dramatic enhancement of the nonlinearity around 65 K. This enhancement is indicative of a phase transition in CsPbBr$_3$. Our results position CsPbBr$_3$ cavities as an exceptional platform for nonlinear optics, offering strong CW nonlinearity and birefringence which are furthermore tunable. In addition, our approach to uncover a phase transition of matter via optical hysteresis measurements is promising for exploring strongly correlated states of light-matter systems.</description>

Abstract: The sequential resonant excitation of a 2-level quantum system results in the emission of a state of light showing time-entanglement encoded in the photon-number-basis - notions that can be extended to 3-level quantum systems as discussed in a recent proposal. Here, we report the experimental implementation of a sequential two-photon resonant excitation process of a solid-state 3-level system, constituted by the biexciton-, exciton-, and ground-state of a semiconductor quantum dot. The resulting light state exhibits entanglement in time and energy, encoded in the photon-number basis, which could be used in quantum information applications, e.g., dense information encoding or quantum communication protocols. Performing energy- and time-resolved correlation experiments in combination with extensive theoretical modelling, we are able to partially retrieve the entanglement structure of the generated state.</description>

      <title>Realization of Z$_2$ topological photonic insulators made from multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

Abstract: Monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have long attracted interest for their intriguing optical and electronic properties. Recently TMDs in their quasi-bulk form have started to show considerable promise for nanophotonics thanks to their high refractive indices, large optical anisotropy, wide transparency windows reaching to the visible, and robust room temperature excitons promising for nonlinear optics. Adherence of TMD layers to any substrate via van der Waals forces is a further key enabler for nanofabrication of sophisticated photonic structures requiring heterointegration. Here, we capitalize on these attractive properties and realize topological spin-Hall photonic lattices made of arrays of triangular nanoholes in 50 to 100 nm thick WS$_2$ flakes exfoliated on SiO$_2$/Si substrates. High quality structures are achieved taking advantage of anisotropic dry etching dictated by the crystal axes of WS$_2$. Reflectance measurements at room temperature show a photonic gap opening in the near-infrared in trivial and topological phases. Unidirectional propagation along the domain interface is demonstrated in real space via circularly polarized laser excitation in samples with both zigzag and armchair domain boundaries. Finite-difference time-domain simulations are used to interpret optical spectroscopy results. Our work opens the way for future sophisticated nanophotonic devices based on the layered (van der Waals) materials platform.</description>

      <title>Leveraging collective effects for thermometry in waveguide quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a proof-of-principle experiment for a new method of temperature measurements in waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) experiments, allowing one to differentiate between global and local baths. The method takes advantage of collective states of two transmon qubits located in the center of a waveguide. The Hilbert space of such a system forms two separate subspaces (bright and dark) which are coupled differently to external noise sources. Measuring transmission through the waveguide allows one to extract separately the temperatures of the baths responsible for global and local excitations in the system. Such a system would allow for building a new type of primary temperature sensor capable of distinguishing between local and global baths.</description>

Abstract: This study presents an innovative approach to predicting VCSEL emission characteristics using transformer neural networks. We demonstrate how to modify the transformer neural network for applications in physics. Our model achieved high accuracy in predicting parameters such as VCSEL's eigenenergy, quality factor, and threshold material gain, based on the laser's structure. This model trains faster and predicts more accurately compared to traditional neural networks. The transformer architecture we propose is also suitable for applications in other fields.

      <title>Colloquium: Synthetic quantum matter in non-standard geometries</title>

Abstract: Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This colloquium takes this perspective: Concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in non-standard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices or quasicrystals, higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing a fresh introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. We also shine light on the novel phenomena which arise from these geometries: Condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases which are offered by such exotic quantum simulators. But also in the search of quantum models for gravity and cosmology, quantum simulators of curved spaces can provide a useful experimental tool.</description>

Abstract: A two-terminal quantum spin-Hall heat engine and refrigerator with embedded Majorana bound states (MBS) are analyzed for optimality in thermoelectric performance. The occurrence of MBS can enhance the performance to rival, as well as outperform, some modern nanoscale quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators. The optimal performance of this MBS quantum heat engine and quantum refrigerator can be further enhanced by an Aharonov-Bohm flux.</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence and Energy Transfer Mediated by Hyperbolic Polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08351v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under high electrical current, some materials can emit electromagnetic radiation beyond incandescence. This phenomenon, referred to as electroluminescence, leads to the efficient emission of visible photons and is the basis of domestic lighting devices (e.g., light-emitting diodes). In principle, electroluminescence can lead to mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission of confined light-matter excitations called phonon-polaritons, resulting from the coupling of photons with crystal lattice vibrations (optical phonons). In particular, phonon-polaritons arising in the van der Waals crystal hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) exhibit hyperbolic dispersion, which enhances light-matter coupling. For this reason, electroluminescence of hyperbolic phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) has been proposed as an explanation for the peculiar radiative energy transfer within hBN-encapsulated graphene transistors. However, since HPhPs are confined, they are inaccessible in the far-field, so that any hint of electroluminescence is only based on indirect electronic signatures and needs to be confirmed by direct observation. Here, we demonstrate far-field mid-IR ({\lambda} = 6.5 {\mu}m) electroluminescence of HPhPs excited by strongly biased high-mobility graphene within a van der Waals heterostructure, and we quantify the associated radiative energy transfer through the material. The presence of HPhPs is revealed via far-field mid-IR spectroscopy due to their elastic scattering at discontinuities in the heterostructure. The associated radiative flux is quantified by mid-IR pyrometry of the substrate receiving the energy. This radiative energy transfer is shown to be reduced in hBN with nanoscale inhomogeneities, demonstrating the central role of the electromagnetic environment in this process.</description>

Abstract: The quantum theory of polariton condensation in a trapped state reveals a second-order phase transition evidenced by spontaneous polarization parity breaking in sub-spaces of fixed polariton occupation numbers. The emission spectra of a polariton condensate demonstrate the coexistence of a symmetry-conserving condensate state with {linear} polarization and two symmetry-broken elliptically polarized states in the vicinity of the threshold. As a result, an oscillating linearly polarized second-order coherence $g^{(2)}_{xx}(t)$, with $g^{(2)}_{xx}(t)&lt;1$ over some time intervals is obtained. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is reflected in the second-order cross correlator of circular polarizations. A related build-up of elliptically-polarized weak lasing results also in non-monotonous dependence of the circular second-order coherence on excitation power and interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Large quantum nonreciprocity in plasmons dragged by drifting electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective plasmon modes, riding on top of drifting electrons, acquire a fascinating nonreciprocal dispersion characterized by $\omega_p(\bm{q}) \neq \omega_p(-\bm{q})$. The {\it classical} plasmonic Doppler shift arises from the polarization of the Fermi surface due to the applied DC bias voltage. Going beyond this paradigm, we predict a {\it quantum} plasmonic Doppler shift originating from the quantum metric of the Bloch wavefunction. We systematically compare the classical and quantum Doppler shifts by investigating the drift-induced nonreciprocal plasmon dispersion in generic quantum systems. We demonstrate quantum nonreciprocal plasmons in graphene and twisted bilayer graphene. We show that the quantum plasmonic Doppler shift dominates in \moire systems at large wavevectors, yielding plasmonic nonreciprocity up to 20\% in twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings demonstrate the supremacy of plasmonic quantum Doppler shift in \moire systems, motivating the design of innovative nonreciprocal photonic devices with potential technological implications.</description>

      <title>Pseudospins revealed through the giant dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect in massless Dirac materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect, indicative of the transient light-matter interaction regime between quantum and classical realms, is widely recognized as an essential signature in wide bandgap condensed matter systems such as dielectrics. In this study, we applied the time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy to investigate ultrafast optical responses in graphene, a zero-bandgap system. We observed in the gate-tuned graphene that the massless Dirac materials notably enhance intraband light-driven transitions, significantly leading to the giant dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect compared to the massive Dirac materials, a wide bandgap system. In addition, employing the angle-resolved spectroscopy, it is found that the unique polarimetry orientation, i.e., perpendicular polarizations for the pump and the probe, further pronounces the optical spectra to exhibit the complete fishbone structure, reflecting the quantum pseudospin nature of Dirac cones. Our findings expand the establishment of emergent transient spectroscopy frameworks into not only zero-bandgap systems but also pseudospin-mediated quantum phenomena, moving beyond dielectrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the non-equilibrium Green's function method, we study the local heat current flow of phonons in nanoscale ballistic graphene nanoribbon, where boundary scattering leads to the formation of atomic-scale current vortices. We further map out the atomic temperature distribution in the ribbon with B\"uttiker's probe approach. From the heat current and temperature distribution, we observe inverted temperature response in the ribbon, where the heat current direction goes from the colder to the hotter region. Moreover, we show that atomic scale defect can generate heat vortex at certain frequency, but it is averaged out when including contributions from all the phonon modes. Meanwhile, our results have recovered residual-resistivity dipole features manifested at the vicinity of local defects. These results extend the study of local heat vortex and negative temperature response in the bulk hydrodynamic regime to the atomic-scale ballistic regime, further confirming boundary scattering is crucial to generate backflow of heat current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials have become an established platform to engineer flat bands which can lead to strongly-correlated emergent phenomena. In particular, the family of Ta dichalcogenides in the 1\textit{T} phase presents a star-of-David charge density wave that creates a flat band at the Fermi level. For TaS$_2$ and TaSe$_2$ this flat band is at half filling leading to a magnetic insulating phase. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that ligand substitution in the TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_x$ system produces a transition from the magnetic insulator to a non-magnetic metal in which the flat band gets doped away from half-filling. For $x\in[{0.846},{1.231}]$ the spin-polarized flat band is self-doped and the system becomes a magnetic metal. In this regime, we show that attractive interactions promote three different spin-triplet superconducting phases as a function of $x$, corresponding to a nodal f-wave and two topologically-different chiral p-wave superconducting phases. Our results establish monolayer TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_{x}$ as a promising platform for correlated flat band physics leading to unconventional superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Multimode Ultrastrong Coupling in Three-Dimensional Photonic-Crystal Cavities</title>

Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have highlighted the role of spatially varying cavity electromagnetic fields in exploring novel cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) phenomena, such as the potential realization of the elusive Dicke superradiant phase transition. One-dimensional photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs), widely used for studying solid-state cQED systems, have uniform spatial profiles in the lateral plane. Three-dimensional (3D) PCCs, which exhibit discrete in-plane translational symmetry, overcome this limitation, but fabrication challenges have hindered the achievement of strong coupling in 3D-PCCs. Here, we report the realization of multimode ultrastrong coupling in a 3D-PCC at terahertz frequencies. The multimode coupling between the 3D-PCC's cavity modes and the cyclotron resonance of a Landau-quantized two-dimensional electron gas in GaAs is significantly influenced by the spatial profiles of the cavity modes, leading to distinct coupling scenarios depending on the probe polarization. Our experimental results are in excellent agreement with a multimode extended Hopfield model that accounts for the spatial inhomogeneity of the cavity field. Guided by the model, we discuss the possible strong ground-state correlations between different cavity modes and introduce relevant figures of merit for the multimode ultrastrong coupling regime. Our findings emphasize the importance of spatially nonuniform cavity mode profiles in probing nonintuitive quantum phenomena expected for the ground states of cQED systems in the ultrastrong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of Berry Fermi liquid from the coadjoint orbit method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an effective field theory for an interacting Fermi liquid with nonzero Berry curvature at zero temperature, called the Berry Fermi liquid. We start with the extended phase space formalism, incorporating physical time into the configuration space. This approach allows us to include the time dependence of the background gauge fields ``covariantly'' into the symplectic structure. Upon restricting to the physical hypersurface, the effective action that lives on the coadjoint orbit becomes the minus free energy on the extended phase space. We also derive the action perturbatively in external fields using the canonical variables. For applications, we compute both linear and nonlinear electrical responses using the Kubo formula, and identify contributions from the electric and magnetic dipole moments, which stem from interactions breaking parity and time-reversal symmetry. The anomalous Hall effect is confirmed using the kinetic theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals single crystals DyOBr and SmOCl have been grown by flux method and their anisotropic magnetic properties are reported. DyOBr orders antiferromagnetically at T$_{N}$=9.5 K with magnetic moments lying along $a$-axis, similar as DyOCl. Its magnetic susceptibility shows an anomaly at T$^{*}$=30 K possibly due to the crystal field effect. Furthermore a 1/3 magnetization plateau is clearly observed under H$\parallel$a and H$\parallel$[110], which might be a field-induced spin-flop phase or some exotic quantum magnetic state. On the other hand, isostructural SmOCl undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at T$_{N}$=7.1 K and exhibits a contrasting Ising-like perpendicular $c$-axis magnetic anisotropy, which could be well explained by our crystal field calculations. Both DyOBr and SmOCl are insulators with band gap of $\sim$5 eV, our results suggest they are promising in building van der Waals heterostructures and applications in multifunctional devices.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically study the tunneling conductance of a junction consisting of a two-dimensional $p$-wave altermagnet (AM) and a superconductor (SC) for various pairing symmetries. The zero bias conductance peaks arising from the dispersionless surface Andreev bound states (SABSs) in $d_{xy}$-wave and $p_{x}$-wave superconductor junctions are insensitive against varying the altermagnetic spin-splitting strength $\alpha _{y}$. Moreover, for chiral $p$- or chiral $d$-wave SCs, zero bias conductance shows a non-monotonic change as a function of $\alpha_{y}$ indicating the existence of the dispersive SABSs. Our obtained results of tunneling spectroscopy based on a $p$-wave AM serve as an effective way for the identification of the pairing symmetries of unconventional superconductors. It is noted that our used Hamiltonian of AM is also available for persistent spin helix systems.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we analyze the correlated physics in this system in the framework of a continuum model for the moir\'e superlattice. Using the symmetries in a fine-tuned limit of the system, we identify the strong-coupling ground states and their fate when the perturbations caused by finite bandwidth, displacement field, and the phase of the intralayer potential are taken into account. We classify the superconducting instabilities and, employing a spin-fermion-like model, study the superconducting instabilities in proximity to these insulating particle-hole orders. This reveals that only a neighboring intervalley coherent phase (with zero or finite wave vector) is naturally consistent with the observed superconducting state. Depending on details, the superconductor will be nodal or a chiral gapped state while further including electron-phonon coupling leads to a fully gapped, time-reversal symmetric pairing state.</description>
