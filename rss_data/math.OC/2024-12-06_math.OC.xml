      <title>Nonlinear Optimal Control of Electron Dynamics within Hartree-Fock Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the problem of determining the optimal applied electric field to drive a molecule from an initial state to a desired target state. For even moderately sized molecules, solving this problem directly using the exact equations of motion -- the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) -- is numerically intractable. We present a solution of this problem within time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory, a mean field approximation of the TDSE. Optimality is defined in terms of minimizing the total control effort while maximizing the overlap between desired and achieved target states. We frame this problem as an optimization problem constrained by the nonlinear TDHF equations; we solve it using trust region optimization with gradients computed via a custom-built adjoint state method. For three molecular systems, we show that with very small neural network parametrizations of the control, our method yields solutions that achieve desired targets within acceptable constraints and tolerances.</description>

      <title>Robust Control Barrier Function Design for High Relative Degree Systems: Application to Unknown Moving Obstacle Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In safety-critical control, managing safety constraints with high relative degrees and uncertain obstacle dynamics pose significant challenges in guaranteeing safety performance. Robust Control Barrier Functions (RCBFs) offer a potential solution, but the non-smoothness of the standard RCBF definition can pose a challenge when dealing with multiple derivatives in high relative degree problems. As a result, the definition was extended to the marginally more conservative smooth Robust Control Barrier Functions (sRCBF). Then, by extending the sRCBF framework to the CBF backstepping method, this paper offers a novel approach to these problems. Treating obstacle dynamics as disturbances, our approach reduces the requirement for precise state estimations of the obstacle to an upper bound on the disturbance, which simplifies implementation and enhances the robustness and applicability of CBFs in dynamic and uncertain environments. Then, we validate our technique through an example problem in which an agent, modeled using a kinematic unicycle model, aims to avoid an unknown moving obstacle. The demonstration shows that the standard CBF backstepping method is not sufficient in the presence of a moving obstacle, especially with unknown dynamics. In contrast, the proposed method successfully prevents the agent from colliding with the obstacle, proving its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Optimal probabilistic feature shifts for reclassification in tree ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a novel mathematical optimization based methodology to perturb the features of a given observation to be re-classified, by a tree ensemble classification rule, to a certain desired class. The method is based on these facts: the most viable changes for an observation to reach the desired class do not always coincide with the closest distance point (in the feature space) of the target class; individuals put effort on a few number of features to reach the desired class; and each individual is endowed with a probability to change each of its features to a given value, which determines the overall probability of changing to the target class. Putting all together, we provide different methods to find the features where the individuals must exert effort to maximize the probability to reach the target class. Our method also allows us to rank the most important features in the tree-ensemble. The proposed methodology is tested on a real dataset, validating the proposal.</description>

      <title>Safe and Efficient Online Convex Optimization with Linear Budget Constraints and Partial Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies online convex optimization with unknown linear budget constraints, where only the gradient information of the objective and the bandit feedback of constraint functions are observed. We propose a safe and efficient Lyapunov-optimization algorithm (SELO) that can achieve an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and zero cumulative constraint violation. The result also implies SELO achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret when the budget is hard and not allowed to be violated. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient as it resembles a primal-dual algorithm where the primal problem is an unconstrained, strongly convex and smooth problem, and the dual problem has a simple gradient-type update. The algorithm and theory are further justified in a simulated application of energy-efficient task processing in distributed data centers.</description>

      <title>Marginal Analysis of Convex Optimization Problems with Set-Valued Inclusion Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, stability and sensitivity properties of a class of parametric constrained optimization problem, whose feasible region is defined by a set-valued inclusion, are investigated through the associated optimal value function. Set-valued inclusions are a kind of constraint system, which naturally emerges in contexts requiring the robust fulfilment of traditional cone constraints, where data are affected by uncertain elements having a non stochastic nature, or in (MPEC) as a vector equilibrium constraint, where feasible solutions are intended as equilibrium point in a strong sense. Under proper convexity assumptions on the objective function and the constraining set-valued term, combined with a global qualification condition, a class of parametric optimization problems is singled out, which displays a global Lipschitz behaviour. By employing recent results of variational analysis, elements for a sensitivity analysis of this class of problems are provided via exact subgradient formulae for the optimal value function. Further consequences of the stability behaviour are explored in terms of problem calmness and viability of penalization techniques.</description>

      <title>A Variable Smoothing for Weakly Convex Composite Minimization with Nonconvex Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a nonconvexly constrained nonsmooth optimization problem involving the composition of a weakly convex function and a smooth mapping. To find a stationary point of the target problem, we propose a variable smoothing-type algorithm by combining the ideas of (i) translating the constrained problem into a Euclidean optimization problem with a smooth parametrization of the constraint set; (ii) exploiting a sequence of smoothed surrogate functions, of the cost function, given with the Moreau envelope of a weakly convex function. The proposed algorithm produces a vector sequence by the gradient descent update of a smoothed surrogate function at each iteration. In a case where the proximity operator of the weakly convex function is available, the proposed algorithm does not require any iterative solver for subproblems therein. By leveraging tools in the variational analysis, we show the so-called {\em gradient consistency property}, which is a key ingredient for smoothing-type algorithms, of the smoothed surrogate function used in this paper. Based on the gradient consistency property, we also establish an asymptotic convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimal Low-Thrust Orbit Transfers Connecting Gateway with Earth and Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gateway will represent a primary logistic infrastructure in cislunar space. The identification of efficient orbit transfers capable of connecting Earth, Moon, and Gateway paves the way for enabling refurbishment, servicing, and utilization of this orbiting platform. This study is devoted to determining two-way minimum-time low-thrust orbit transfers that connect both Earth and Moon to Gateway. Backward time propagation is proposed as a very convenient option for trajectories that approach and rendezvous with Gateway, and a unified formulation is introduced for minimum-time orbit transfers, using either forward or backward propagation. Two-way transfers between Gateway and a specified low-altitude lunar orbit are first determined, using an indirect heuristic method, which employs the necessary conditions for optimality and a heuristic algorithm. Second, two-way orbit transfers that connect Earth and Gateway are addressed. Because these trajectories exist under the influence of two major attracting bodies, the underlying optimal control problem is formulated as a multi-arc trajectory optimization problem, involving three different representations for the spacecraft state. Multi-arc optimal control problems are associated with several corner conditions to be enforced at the junction time that separates distinct arcs. However, these conditions are shown to be solvable sequentially for the problem at hand, leveraging implicit costate transformation. This implies that the multi-arc problem has a set of unknown quantities with the same size as that of a single-arc optimal control problem, with apparent advantages of computational nature. The indirect heuristic method is also applied in this second mission scenario.</description>

      <title>Solvability of Coupled Forward-Backward Volterra Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the optimality system associated with controlled (forward) Volterra integral equations (FVIEs, for short), the well-posedness of coupled forward-backward Voterra integral equations (FBVIEs, for short) is studied. The main feature of FBVIEs is that the unknown $\{(X(t,s),Y(t,s))\}$ has two arguments. By taking $t$ as a parameter and $s$ as a (time) variable, one can regard FBVIE as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs, for short), with infinite-dimensional space values $\{(X(\cdot,s),Y(\cdot,s));\,s\in[0,T]\}$. To establish the well-posedness of such an FBVIE, a new non-local monotonicity condition is introduced, by which a bridge in infinite-dimensional spaces is constructed. Then by generalizing the method of continuation developed by \cite{Hu-Peng1995,Yong1997,Peng-Wu1999} for differential equations, we have established the well-posedness of FBVIEs.The key is to apply the chain rule to the mapping $t\mapsto\big[\int_\cdot^T\langle Y(s,s),X(s,\cdot)\rangle ds +\langle G(X(T,T)),X(T,\cdot)\rangle\big](t)$.</description>

      <title>Sensor-Driven Predictive Vehicle Maintenance and Routing Problem with Time Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in sensor technology offer significant insights into vehicle conditions, unlocking new venues to enhance fleet operations. While current vehicle health management models provide accurate predictions of vehicle failures, they often fail to integrate these forecasts into operational decision-making, limiting their practical impact. This paper addresses this gap by incorporating sensor-driven failure predictions into a single-vehicle routing problem with time windows. A maintenance cost function is introduced to balance two critical trade-offs: premature maintenance, which leads to underutilization of remaining useful life, and delayed maintenance, which increases the likelihood of breakdowns. Routing problems with time windows are inherently challenging, and integrating maintenance considerations adds significantly to its computational complexity. To address this, we develop a new solution method, called the Iterative Alignment Method (IAM), building on the structural properties of the problem. IAM generates high-quality solutions even in large-size instances where Gurobi cannot find any solutions. Moreover, compared to the traditional periodic maintenance strategy, our sensor-driven approach to maintenance decisions shows improvements in operational and maintenance costs as well as in overall vehicle reliability.</description>

      <title>Online Experimental Design With Estimation-Regret Trade-off Under Network Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network interference has garnered significant interest in the field of causal inference. It reflects diverse sociological behaviors, wherein the treatment assigned to one individual within a network may influence the outcome of other individuals, such as their neighbors. To estimate the causal effect, one classical way is to randomly assign experimental candidates into different groups and compare their differences. However, in the context of sequential experiments, such treatment assignment may result in a large regret. In this paper, we develop a unified interference-based online experimental design framework. Compared to existing literature, we expand the definition of arm space by leveraging the statistical concept of exposure mapping. Importantly, we establish the Pareto-optimal trade-off between the estimation accuracy and regret with respect to both time period and arm space, which remains superior to the baseline even in the absence of network interference. We further propose an algorithmic implementation and model generalization.</description>

      <title>Towards Fast and Safety-Guaranteed Trajectory Planning and Tracking for Time-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When deploying autonomous systems in unknown and changing environments, it is critical that their motion planning and control algorithms are computationally efficient and can be reapplied online in real time, whilst providing theoretical safety guarantees in the presence of disturbances. The satisfaction of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online, accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems. We simulate our algorithms on a case study of an autonomous underwater vehicle subject to wave disturbances.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Safety Shield for Safe and Efficient Reinforcement Learning of Navigation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to a variety of robotics applications, where it outperforms classical methods. However, the safety aspect of RL and the transfer to the real world remain an open challenge. A prominent field for tackling this challenge and ensuring the safety of the agents during training and execution is safe reinforcement learning. Safe RL can be achieved through constrained RL and safe exploration approaches. The former learns the safety constraints over the course of training to achieve a safe behavior by the end of training, at the cost of high number of collisions at earlier stages of the training. The latter offers robust safety by enforcing the safety constraints as hard constraints, which prevents collisions but hinders the exploration of the RL agent, resulting in lower rewards and poor performance. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a novel safety shield, that combines the robustness of the optimization-based controllers with the long prediction capabilities of the RL agents, allowing the RL agent to adaptively tune the parameters of the controller. Our approach is able to improve the exploration of the RL agents for navigation tasks, while minimizing the number of collisions. Experiments in simulation show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in the reached goals-to-collisions ratio in different challenging environments. The goals-to-collisions ratio metrics emphasizes the importance of minimizing the number of collisions, while learning to accomplish the task. Our approach achieves a higher number of reached goals compared to the classic safety shields and fewer collisions compared to constrained RL approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in a real-world experiment.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Bounds for Closed-Loop Identification of Unstable Nonlinear Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of least squares parameter estimation from single-trajectory data for discrete-time, unstable, closed-loop nonlinear stochastic systems, with linearly parameterised uncertainty. Assuming a region of the state space produces informative data, and the system is sub-exponentially unstable, we establish non-asymptotic guarantees on the estimation error at times where the state trajectory evolves in this region. If the whole state space is informative, high probability guarantees on the error hold for all times. Examples are provided where our results are useful for analysis, but existing results are not.</description>

Abstract: This work is concerned with the computation of the first-order variation for one-dimensional hyperbolic partial differential equations. In the case of shock waves the main challenge is addressed by developing a numerical method to compute the evolution of the generalized tangent vector introduced by Bressan and Marson (1995). Our basic strategy is to combine the conservative numerical schemes and a novel expression of the interface conditions for the tangent vectors along the discontinuity. Based on this, we propose a simple numerical method to compute the tangent vectors for general hyperbolic systems. Numerical results are presented for Burgers' equation and a 2 x 2 hyperbolic system with two genuinely nonlinear fields.</description>

      <title>Stealthy Optimal Range-Sensor Placement for Target Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a stealthy range-sensor placement problem where a set of range sensors are to be placed with respect to targets to effectively localize them while maintaining a degree of stealthiness from the targets. This is an open and challenging problem since two competing objectives must be balanced: (a) optimally placing the sensors to maximize their ability to localize the targets and (b) minimizing the information the targets gather regarding the sensors. We provide analytical solutions in 2D for the case of any number of sensors that localize two targets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a generalization of the Perron-Frobenius theorem to time-varying row-stochastic matrices as follows: using Kolmogorov's concept of absolute probability sequences, which are time-varying analogs of principal eigenvectors, we identify a set of connectivity conditions that generalize the notion of irreducibility (strong connectivity) to time-varying matrices (networks), and we show that under these conditions, the absolute probability sequence associated with a given matrix sequence is (a) uniformly positive and (b) unique. Our results apply to both discrete-time and continuous-time settings. We then discuss a few applications of our main results to non-Bayesian learning, distributed optimization, opinion dynamics, and averaging dynamics over random networks.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Piecewise Affine Decision Rules for Stochastic Programming with Covariate Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13646v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focusing on stochastic programming (SP) with covariate information, this paper proposes an empirical risk minimization (ERM) method embedded within a nonconvex piecewise affine decision rule (PADR), which aims to learn the direct mapping from features to optimal decisions. We establish the nonasymptotic consistency result of our PADR-based ERM model for unconstrained problems and asymptotic consistency result for constrained ones. To solve the nonconvex and nondifferentiable ERM problem, we develop an enhanced stochastic majorization-minimization algorithm and establish the asymptotic convergence to (composite strong) directional stationarity along with complexity analysis. We show that the proposed PADR-based ERM method applies to a broad class of nonconvex SP problems with theoretical consistency guarantees and computational tractability. Our numerical study demonstrates the superior performance of PADR-based ERM methods compared to state-of-the-art approaches under various settings, with significantly lower costs, less computation time, and robustness to feature dimensions and nonlinearity of the underlying dependency.</description>

      <title>A Fisher-Rao gradient flow for entropy-regularised Markov decision processes in Polish spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the global convergence of a Fisher-Rao policy gradient flow for infinite-horizon entropy-regularised Markov decision processes with Polish state and action space. The flow is a continuous-time analogue of a policy mirror descent method. We establish the global well-posedness of the gradient flow and demonstrate its exponential convergence to the optimal policy. Moreover, we prove the flow is stable with respect to gradient evaluation, offering insights into the performance of a natural policy gradient flow with log-linear policy parameterisation. To overcome challenges stemming from the lack of the convexity of the objective function and the discontinuity arising from the entropy regulariser, we leverage the performance difference lemma and the duality relationship between the gradient and mirror descent flows. Our analysis provides a theoretical foundation for developing various discrete policy gradient algorithms.</description>

      <title>Algebraic solution of project scheduling problems with temporal constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New solutions for problems in optimal scheduling of activities in a project under temporal constraints are developed in the framework of tropical algebra which deals with the theory and application of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. We start with a constrained tropical optimization problem that has an objective function represented as a vector form given by an arbitrary matrix, and that can be solved analytically in a closed but somewhat complicated form. We examine a special case of the problem when the objective function is given by a matrix of unit rank, and show that the solution can be sufficiently refined in this case, which results in an essentially simplified analytical form and reduced computational complexity of the solution. We exploit the obtained result to find complete solutions of project scheduling problems to minimize the project makespan and the maximum absolute deviation of start times of activities under temporal constraints. The constraints under consideration include ``start--start'', ``start--finish'' and ``finish--start'' precedence relations, release times, release deadlines and completion deadlines for activities. As an application, we consider optimal scheduling problems of a vaccination project in a medical centre.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence of mild solutions and the approximate controllability for nonautonomous integrodifferential equations with state-dependent delay. We assume the approximate controllability of the linear part, and then we use resolvent operator theory to prove the approximate controllability of the nonlinear case. An example of the one-dimensional heat equation with memory is given to illustrate the basic idea our results.</description>

      <title>A Semidefinite Programming-Based Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for Biclustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biclustering, also called co-clustering, block clustering, or two-way clustering, involves the simultaneous clustering of both the rows and columns of a data matrix into distinct groups, such that the rows and columns within a group display similar patterns. As a model problem for biclustering, we consider the $k$-densest-disjoint biclique problem, whose goal is to identify $k$ disjoint complete bipartite subgraphs (called bicliques) of a given weighted complete bipartite graph such that the sum of their densities is maximized. To address this problem, we present a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm. For the upper bound routine, we consider a semidefinite programming relaxation and propose valid inequalities to strengthen the bound. We solve this relaxation in a cutting-plane fashion using a first-order method. For the lower bound, we design a maximum weight matching rounding procedure that exploits the solution of the relaxation solved at each node. Computational results on both synthetic and real-world instances show that the proposed algorithm can solve instances approximately 20 times larger than those handled by general-purpose solvers.</description>

      <title>Greedy Learning to Optimize with Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00260v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning to optimize is an approach that leverages training data to accelerate the solution of optimization problems. Many approaches use unrolling to parametrize the update step and learn optimal parameters. Although L2O has shown empirical advantages over classical optimization algorithms, memory restrictions often greatly limit the unroll length and learned algorithms usually do not provide convergence guarantees. In contrast, we introduce a novel method employing a greedy strategy that learns iteration-specific parameters by minimizing the function value at the next iteration. This enables training over significantly more iterations while maintaining constant GPU memory usage. We parameterize the update such that parameter learning corresponds to solving a convex optimization problem at each iteration. In particular, we explore preconditioned gradient descent with multiple parametrizations including a novel convolutional preconditioner. With our learned algorithm, convergence in the training set is proved even when the preconditioner is neither symmetric nor positive definite. Convergence on a class of unseen functions is also obtained, ensuring robust performance and generalization beyond the training data. We test our learned algorithms on two inverse problems, image deblurring and Computed Tomography, on which learned convolutional preconditioners demonstrate improved empirical performance over classical optimization algorithms such as Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Method and the quasi-Newton method L-BFGS.</description>

      <title>On Computation of Approximate Solutions to Large-Scale Backstepping Kernel Equations via Continuum Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide two methods for computation of continuum backstepping kernels that arise in control of continua (ensembles) of linear hyperbolic PDEs and which can approximate backstepping kernels arising in control of a large-scale, PDE system counterpart (with computational complexity that does not grow with the number of state components of the large-scale system). In the first method, we provide explicit formulae for the solution to the continuum kernels PDEs, employing a (triple) power series representation of the continuum kernel and establishing its convergence properties. In this case, we also provide means for reducing computational complexity by properly truncating the power series (in the powers of the ensemble variable). In the second method, we identify a class of systems for which the solution to the continuum (and hence, also an approximate solution to the respective large-scale) kernel equations can be constructed in closed form. We also present numerical examples to illustrate computational efficiency/accuracy of the approaches, as well as to validate the stabilization properties of the approximate control kernels, constructed based on the continuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate optimality conditions for the sensor placement problem within optimal experimental design, wherein one must decide on the optimal manner in which a fixed number of sensors can be arranged over a large number of candidate locations. By a subgradient argument, we obtain sufficient and necessary conditions for global optimality of the relaxed problem, and demonstrate how one can take advantage of this optimality criterion to approximate optimal binary designs, i.e.~designs where no fractions of sensors are placed. To demonstrate our optimality criteria-based results, we derive a trace-free, efficient formulation of the gradient of the A-optimal objective for finite element-discretised function space settings, and study globally optimal designs for a Helmholtz-type source problem and extensions towards optimal binary designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle robust optimization problems under objective uncertainty in the oracle model, i.e., when the deterministic problem is solved by an oracle. The oracle-based setup is favorable in many situations, e.g., when a compact formulation of the feasible region is unknown or does not exist. We propose an iterative method based on a Frank-Wolfe type algorithm applied to a smoothed version of the piecewise linear objective function. Our approach bridges several previous efforts from the literature, attains the best known oracle complexity for the problem and performs better than state-of-the-art on high-dimensional problem instances, in particular for larger uncertainty sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems using infinitesimal generator learning within infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns the diffusion operator of a controlled Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation in an infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. This operator models the continuous-time evolution of the probability measure of the control system's state. We demonstrate that this approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven solution to the optimal control problem. Furthermore, our statistical learning framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled forward infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven LQR with Finite-Time Experiments via Extremum-Seeking Policy Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems through a novel iterative algorithm named EXtremum-seeking Policy iteration LQR (EXP-LQR). The peculiarity of EXP-LQR is that it only needs access to a truncated approximation of the infinite-horizon cost associated to a given policy. Hence, EXP-LQR does not need the direct knowledge of neither the system matrices, cost matrices, and state measurements. In particular, at each iteration, EXP-LQR refines the maintained policy using a truncated LQR cost retrieved by performing finite-time virtual or real experiments in which a perturbed version of the current policy is employed. Such a perturbation is done according to an extremum-seeking mechanism and makes the overall algorithm a time-varying nonlinear system. By using a Lyapunov-based approach exploiting averaging theory, we show that EXP-LQR exponentially converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimal gain matrix. We corroborate the theoretical results with numerical simulations involving the control of an induction motor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.13479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fault diagnosis with commendable accuracy is essential for the reliability of industrial machines. Two main challenges affect the design of high-performing intelligent systems: (i) the selection of a suitable model and (ii) domain adaptation if there is a continuous change in operating conditions. Therefore, we propose an evolutionary Net2Net transformation (EvoN2N) that finds the best suitable DNN architecture with limited availability of labeled data samples. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm has been used in the evolutionary framework of Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II to obtain the best DNN architecture. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm uses the concept of knowledge transfer from one generation to the next for faster fitness evaluation. The proposed framework can obtain the best model for intelligent fault diagnosis without a long and time-consuming search process. The proposed framework has been validated on the Case Western Reserve University dataset, the Paderborn University dataset, and the gearbox fault detection dataset under different operating conditions. The best models obtained are capable of demonstrating an excellent diagnostic performance and classification accuracy of almost up to 100\% for most of the operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Practical Operator Sketching Framework for Accelerating Iterative Data-Driven Solutions in Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new operator-sketching paradigm for designing efficient iterative data-driven reconstruction (IDR) schemes, e.g. Plug-and-Play algorithms and deep unrolling networks. These IDR schemes are currently the state-of-the-art solutions for imaging inverse problems. However, for high-dimensional imaging tasks, especially X-ray CT and MRI imaging, these IDR schemes typically become inefficient both in terms of computation, due to the need of computing multiple times the high-dimensional forward and adjoint operators. In this work, we explore and propose a universal dimensionality reduction framework for accelerating IDR schemes in solving imaging inverse problems, based on leveraging the sketching techniques from stochastic optimization. Using this framework, we derive a number of accelerated IDR schemes, such as the plug-and-play multi-stage sketched gradient (PnP-MS2G) and sketching-based primal-dual (LSPD and Sk-LSPD) deep unrolling networks. Meanwhile, for fully accelerating PnP schemes when the denoisers are computationally expensive, we provide novel stochastic lazy denoising schemes (Lazy-PnP and Lazy-PnP-EQ), leveraging the ProxSkip scheme in optimization and equivariant image denoisers, which can massively accelerate the PnP algorithms with improved practicality. We provide theoretical analysis for recovery guarantees of instances of the proposed framework. Our numerical experiments on natural image processing and tomographic image reconstruction demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our sketched IDR schemes.</description>

      <title>ResQPASS: an algorithm for bounded variable linear least squares with asymptotic Krylov convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13616v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Residual Quadratic Programming Active-Set Subspace (ResQPASS) method that solves large-scale linear least-squares problems with bound constraints on the variables. The problem is solved by creating a series of small problems of increasing size by projecting onto the basis of residuals. Each projected problem is solved by the active-set method for convex quadratic programming, warm-started with a working set and solution from the previous problem. The method coincides with conjugate gradients (CG) or, equivalently, LSQR when none of the constraints is active. When only a few constraints are active the method converges, after a few initial iterations, like CG and LSQR. An analysis links the convergence to an asymptotic Krylov subspace. We also present an efficient implementation where QR factorizations of the projected problems are updated over the inner iterations and Cholesky or Gram-Schmidt over the outer iterations.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit of diffusive games through the master equation: extreme value analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-player game where the players control the drifts of their diffusive states which have no interaction in the noise terms. The aim of each player is to minimize the expected value of her cost, which is a function of the player's state and the empirical measure of the states of all the players. Our aim is to determine the $N \to \infty$ asymptotic behavior of the upper order statistics of the player's states under Nash equilibrium (the Nash states). For this purpose, we consider also a system of interacting diffusions which is constructed by using the Master PDE of the game and approximates the system of the Nash states, and we improve an $L^2$ estimate for the distance between the drifts of the two systems which has been used for establishing Central Limit Theorems and Large Deviations Principles for the Nash states in the past. By differentiating the Master PDE, we obtain that estimate also in $L^{\infty}$, which allows us to control the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a Girsanov transformation that connects the two systems. The latter allows us to reduce the problem to the case of $N$ uncontrolled diffusions with standard mean-field interaction in the drifts, which has been treated in a previous work.</description>

      <title>Duality of Stochastic Observability and Constructability and Their Relation to the Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a set of measurements, observability characterizes the distinguishability of a system's initial state, whereas constructability focuses on the final state in a trajectory. In the presence of process and/or measurement noise, the Fisher information matrices with respect to the initial and final states$\unicode{x2013}$equivalent to the stochastic observability and constructability Gramians$\unicode{x2013}$bound the performance of corresponding estimators through the Cram\'er-Rao inequality. This letter establishes a connection between stochastic observability and constructability of discrete-time linear systems and provides a more numerically stable way for calculating the stochastic observability Gramian. We define a dual system and show that the dual system's stochastic constructability is equivalent to the original system's stochastic observability, and vice versa. This duality enables the interchange of theorems and tools for observability and constructability. For example, we use this result to translate an existing recursive formula for the stochastic constructability Gramian into a formula for recursively calculating the stochastic observability Gramian for both time-varying and time-invariant systems, and we show the convergence of this sequence for the latter. Finally, we illustrate the robustness of our formula compared to existing (non-recursive) formulas through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Don't Be So Positive: Negative Step Sizes in Second-Order Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The value of second-order methods lies in the use of curvature information. Yet, this information is costly to extract and once obtained, valuable negative curvature information is often discarded so that the method is globally convergent. This limits the effectiveness of second-order methods in modern machine learning. In this paper, we show that second-order and second-order-like methods are promising optimizers for neural networks provided that we add one ingredient: negative step sizes. We show that under very general conditions, methods that produce ascent directions are globally convergent when combined with a Wolfe line search that allows both positive and negative step sizes. We experimentally demonstrate that using negative step sizes is often more effective than common Hessian modification methods.</description>
