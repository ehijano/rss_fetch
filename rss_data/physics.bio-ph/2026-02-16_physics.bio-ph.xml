      <title>Viscous vertex model for active epithelial tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rotationally invariant viscous vertex model that accounts for both cortical and bulk dissipations of cells. The vanishing substrate-friction limit is enforced via Lagrange multipliers, which also provide a route to strongly constrained boundary conditions such as fixed boundaries and prescribed tractions. Building on this formulation, we introduce a slab-shear rheology protocol to extract an effective, coarse-grained tissue shear viscosity. Under polar or nematic activity, viscosity regulates the formation of elongated, spatially correlated cell-shape textures and stabilizes well-defined topological defects. Because the model remains well-posed at zero substrate friction, it is naturally suited to describing free-floating epithelia and organoids.</description>

      <title>Image-based investigation of the zebrafish developmental process using in vivo dynamic and multi-contrast optical coherence tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate in vivo dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) imaging of zebrafish development from 2 weeks to 12 months post-fertilization, integrated with polarization-sensitive OCT (PS-OCT), OCT angiography (OCTA), and histological validation. Two DOCT algorithms were utilized: logarithmic intensity variance and late OCT correlation decay speed, which characterize the occupancy of dynamic scatterers and their motion speeds, respectively. Our results show that skin stripes exhibit high DOCT signals and it varies among the pigment-cell types. Furthermore, the combination of DOCT and PS-OCT captures the maturation of these stripes. In addition, DOCT and OCTA successfully visualized the developmental progression of blood and lymphatic vessels, as well as spinal tissues.</description>

      <title>Estimating Full Path Lengths and Kinetics from Partial Path Transition Interface Sampling Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing the time scale of biological processes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with sufficient statistical accuracy is a challenging task, as processes are often rare and/or slow events, which may extend largely beyond the time scale of what is accessible with modern day high performance computational infrastructure. Recently, the replica exchange partial path transition interface sampling (REPPTIS) algorithm was developed to study rare and slow events involving metastable states along their reactive pathways. REPPTIS is a path sampling method where paths are cut short to reduce the computational cost, while combining this with the efficiency offered by replica exchange between the partial path ensembles. However, REPPTIS still lacks a formalism to extract time-dependent properties, such as mean first passage times, fluxes, and rates, from the short partial paths. In this work, we introduce a Markov state model (MSM) framework to estimate full path lengths and kinetic properties from the overlapping partial paths generated by REPPTIS. The framework results in newly derived closed formulas for the REPPTIS crossing probability, mean first passage times (MFPTs), flux, and rate constant. Our approach is then validated using simulations of Brownian and Langevin particles on a series of one-dimensional potential energy profiles as well as the dissociation of KCl in solution, demonstrating that REPPTIS accurately reproduces the exact kinetics benchmark. The MSM framework is further applied to the trypsin-benzamidine complex to compute the dissociation rate as a test case of a biological system, albeit the computed rate underestimates the experimental value. In conclusion, our MSM framework equips REPPTIS simulations with a robust theoretical and practical foundation for extracting kinetic information from computationally efficient partial paths.</description>

      <title>Why life is hot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of evolution by natural selection leads to phenotypes of increasing fitness. For cellular chemical reaction networks, this means optimising a variety of fitness functions such as robustness, precision, or sensitivity to external stimuli. We argue that these diverse goals can be achieved by a versatile, generic mechanism: coupling chemical reaction networks to reservoirs that are strongly out of equilibrium. Using theory and numerics we show that this mechanism of optimization comes at the price of significant heat dissipation. We compute the heat flux caused by kinetic proofreading in {\it Escherichia coli} and show that it constitutes a significant fraction of the total heat flux experimentally measured in this model organism. We then demonstrate that the degree of optimality achievable saturates, and that Nature appears to operate near saturation despite high energetic costs. We conclude that `life is hot' largely because of the need for a versatile mechanism to optimise a variety of fitness functions.</description>

      <title>Bicontinuity in active phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study phase separation between coexisting active and passive fluids in three-dimensions, using numerical simulation and experiments. Chaotic flows of the active phase drive giant interfacial deformations, causing the co-existing phases to interpenetrate and generate a continuously reconfiguring bicontinuous morphology which persists over the lifetime of the active fluid. Active bicontinuous structures are dominated by sheet-like interfaces, in marked difference from passive liquid-liquid phase separation which is controlled by saddle-like surfaces. Activity and surface tension control the length scale of the bicontinuous structure. These results demonstrate how active stresses suppress the coarsening of conventional phase separation, generating steady-state reconfigurable morphologies not accessible with conventional surface-modifying agents or through quenching of transient phase separated structures.</description>
