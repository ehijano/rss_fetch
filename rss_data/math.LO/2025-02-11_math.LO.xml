      <title>On definable J-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study definable J-sets for definable groups and compare them with weakly generic sets. We show that the property whether J-sets coincide with weakly generic sets is invariant on enough saturated models and hence a model-theoretical property. We have a positive answer for superstable commutative groups and some easy examples in pCF. We also give an example for noncoincidence.</description>

      <title>First-Order Intuitionistic Linear Logic and Hypergraph Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lambek calculus is a substructural logic known to be closely related to the formal language theory: on the one hand, it is used for generating formal languages by means of categorial grammars and, on the other hand, it is sound and complete with respect to formal language semantics. This paper studies a similar relation between first-order intuitionistic linear logic ILL1 along with its multiplicative fragment MILL1 and the hypergraph grammar theory.
  In the first part, we introduce a novel concept of hypergraph first-order logic categorial grammar, which is a generalisation of string MILL1 grammars studied in (Moot, 2014). We prove that hypergraph ILL1 grammars generate all recursively enumerable hypergraph languages and that hypergraph MILL1 grammars are as powerful as linear-time hypergraph transformation systems. Using these results, we solve an open problem from the article (Moot, 2014), which asks whether string MILL1 grammars generate exactly multiple context-free languages. We show that the class of languages generated by string MILL1 grammars is closed under intersection and that it includes a non-semilinar language as well as an NP-complete one. This shows how powerful string MILL1 grammars are as compared to Lambek categorial grammars.
  In the second part, we develop hypergraph language models for MILL1. In such models, formulae of the logic are interpreted as hypergraph languages and multiplicative conjunction is interpreted using parallel composition, which is one of the operations of HR-algebras introduced by Courcelle. We prove completeness of the universal-implicative fragment of MILL1 with respect to these models and thus present a new kind of semantics for a fragment of first-order linear logic.</description>

      <title>Foulis quantales and complete orthomodular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our approach establishes a natural correspondence between complete orthomodular lattices and certain types of quantales.
  Firstly, given a complete orthomodular lattice X, we associate with it a Foulis quantale Lin(X) consisting of its endomorphisms. This allows us to view X as a left module over Lin(X), thereby introducing a novel fuzzy-theoretic perspective to the study of complete orthomodular lattices.
  Conversely, for any Foulis quantale Q, we associate a complete orthomodular lattice [Q] that naturally forms a left Q-module. Furthermore, there exists a canonical homomorphism of Foulis quantales from Q to Lin([Q]).</description>

      <title>From real analysis to the sorites paradox via Reverse Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a reverse mathematical analysis of several forms of the sorites paradox. We first illustrate how traditional formula- tions are reliant on H\"older's Representation Theorem for ordered Archimedean groups. While this is provable in RCA$_0$, we also consider two forms of the sorites which rest on non-constructive principles: the continuous sorites of Weber &amp; Colyvan (2010) and a variant we refer to as the covering sorites. We show in the setting of second-order arithmetic that the former depends on the existence of suprema and thus on arithmetical comprehension (ACA$_0$) while the latter depends on the Heine-Borel Theorem and thus on Weak K\"onig's Lemma (WKL$_0$). We finally illustrate how recursive counterexamples to these principles provide resolutions to the corresponding paradoxes which can be contrasted with supervaluationist, epistemicist, and constructivist approaches.</description>

      <title>Three meta-questions on infinite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Feder-Vardi dichotomy conjecture for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) with finite templates, confirmed independently by Bulatov and Zhuk, has a counterpart for infinite templates due to Bodirsky and Pinsker which remains wide open. We resolve several meta-problems on the scope of their conjecture. Our first two main results provide two fundamental simplifications of this scope, one of structural, and the other one of algebraic nature. The former simplification implies that the conjecture is equivalent to its restriction to templates without algebraicity, a crucial assumption in the most powerful classification methods. The latter yields that the higher-arity invariants of any template within its scope can be assumed to be essentially injective, and hence any algebraic condition characterizing any complexity class within the conjecture must be satisfiable by injections, thus lifting the mystery of the better applicability of certain conditions over others. Our third main result uses the first one to show that any tractable template within the scope serves, up to a Datalog-computable modification of it, as the witness of the tractability of a finite-domain Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) by the so-called sandwiching method. This provides a strong hitherto unknown connection between infinite-domain CSPs and finite-domain PCSPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an alternative cyclic proof system for Peano arithmetic that could be simpler than the existing ones and well-adapted both for proof analysis and for automatizing inductive proof search. In addition, we will show how various traditional subsystems of Peano arithmetic defined by restricted forms of induction can be represented as fragments of the proposed system.</description>

Abstract: Working in the context of reverse mathematics, we give a fine-grained characterization result on the strength of two possible definitions for Effective Transfinite Recursion used in literature. Moreover, we show that $\Pi^0_2$-induction along a well-order $X$ is equivalent to the statement that the exponentiation of any well-order to the power of $X$ is well-founded.</description>

Abstract: We study the class of differentially henselian fields, which are henselian valued fields equipped with generic derivations in the sense of Cubides Kovacics and Point, and are special cases of differentially large fields in the sense of Le\'on S\'anchez and Tressl. We prove that many results from henselian valued fields as well as differentially large fields can be lifted to the differentially henselian setting, for instance Ax-Kochen/Ershov principles, characterisations in terms of differential algebras, etc. We also give methods to concretely construct such fields in terms of iterated power series expansions and inductive constructions on transcendence bases.</description>

      <title>The tree pigeonhole principle in the Weihrauch degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study versions of the tree pigeonhole principle, $\mathsf{TT}^1$, in the context of Weihrauch-style computable analysis. The principle has previously been the subject of extensive research in reverse mathematics. Two outstanding questions from the latter investigation are whether $\mathsf{TT}^1$ is $\Pi^1_1$-conservative over the ordinary pigeonhole principle, $\mathsf{RT}^1$, and whether it is equivalent to any first-order statement of second-order arithmetic. Using the recently introduced notion of the first-order part of an instance-solution problem, we formulate, and answer in the affirmative, the analogue of the first question for Weihrauch reducibility. We then use this, in combination with other results, to answer in the negative the analogue of the second question. Our proofs develop a new combinatorial machinery for constructing and understanding solutions to instances of $\mathsf{TT}^1$.</description>

      <title>A calculus for modal compact Hausdorff spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetric strict implication calculus $\mathsf{S^2IC}$ is a modal calculus for compact Hausdorff spaces. This is established through de Vries duality, linking compact Hausdorff spaces with de Vries algebras-complete Boolean algebras equipped with a special relation. Modal compact Hausdorff spaces are compact Hausdorff spaces enriched with a continuous relation. These spaces correspond, via modalized de Vries duality, to upper continuous modal de Vries algebras.
  In this paper we introduce the modal symmetric strict implication calculus $\mathsf{MS^2IC}$, which extends $\mathsf{S^2IC}$. We prove that $\mathsf{MS^2IC}$ is strongly sound and complete with respect to upper continuous modal de Vries algebras, thereby providing a logical calculus for modal compact Hausdorff spaces. We also develop a relational semantics for $\mathsf{MS^2IC}$ that we employ to show admissibility of various $\Pi_2$-rules in this system.</description>

      <title>Variants of Solovay reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outside of the left-c.e. reals, Solovay reducibility is considered to be behaved badly [10.1007/978-0-387-68441-3]. Proposals for variants of Solovay reducibility that are better suited for the investigation of arbitrary, not necessarily left-c.e. reals were made by Rettinger and Zheng [10.1007/978-3-540-27798-9_39], and, recently, by Titov [10.11588/heidok.00034250] and by Kumabe and co-authors [10.4115/jla.2020.12.2; 10.3233/COM-230486]. These variants all coincide with the original version of Solovay reducibility on the left-c.e. reals. Furthermore, they are all defined in terms of translation functions. The latter translate between computable approximations in the case of Rettinger and Zheng, are monotone in the case of Titov, and are functions between reals in the case of Kumabe et al.
  Solovay reducibility and its variants mentioned so far have tight connections to Martin-L\"of randomness, the strongest and most central notion of a random sequence. For the investigation of Schnorr randomness, total variants of Solovay reducibility have been introduced by Merkle and Titov [10.48550/arXiv.2407.14869] in 2022 and, independently, by Kumabe et al. [10.3233/COM-230486] in 2024, the latter again via real-valued translation functions. In what follows, we show that total Solovay reducibility defined in terms of rational functions implies total Solovay reducibility defined in terms of real functions and is strictly stronger that the original version of Solovay reducibility.
  In what follows, we derive new results on the mentioned variants and their relation to each other. In particular, we obtain that Solovay reducibility defined in terms of translation function on rationals implies Solovay reducibility defined in terms of translation functions on reals, and we show that the original version of Solovay reducibility is strictly weaker than its monotone variant.</description>

Abstract: Building upon the results of Jacobs, we show that the category OMLatLin of orthomodular lattices and linear maps forms a dagger category. For each orthomodular lattice X, we construct a Foulis m-semilattice Lin(X) composed of endomorphisms of X. This m-semilattice acts as a quantale, enabling us to regard X as a left Lin(X)-module. Our novel approach introduces a fuzzy-theoretic dimension to the theory of orthomodular lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.05380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homeomorphism groups of generalized Wa\.zewski dendrites act on the infinite countable set of branch points of the dendrite and thus have a nice Polish topology. In this paper, we study them in the light of this Polish topology. The group of the universal Wa\.zewski dendrite $D_\infty$ is more characteristic than the others because it is the unique one with a dense conjugacy class. For this group $G_\infty$, we show some of its topological properties like existence of a comeager conjugacy class, the Steinhaus property, automatic continuity and the small index subgroup property. Moreover, we identify the universal minimal flow of $G_\infty$. This allows us to prove that point-stabilizers in $G_\infty$ are amenable and to describe the universal Furstenberg boundary of $G_\infty$.</description>

      <title>Coslice Colimits in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute to the theory of (homotopy) colimits inside homotopy type theory. The heart of our work characterizes the connection between colimits in coslices of a universe, called coslice colimits, and colimits in the universe (i.e., ordinary colimits). To derive this characterization, we find an explicit construction of colimits in coslices that is tailored to reveal the connection. We use the construction to derive properties of colimits. Notably, we prove that the forgetful functor from a coslice creates colimits over trees. We also use the construction to examine how colimits interact with orthogonal factorization systems and with cohomology theories. As a consequence of their interaction with orthogonal factorization systems, all pointed colimits (special kinds of coslice colimits) preserve $n$-connectedness, which implies that higher groups are closed under colimits on directed graphs. We have formalized our main construction of the coslice colimit functor in Agda. The code for this paper is available at https://github.com/PHart3/colimits-agda .</description>
