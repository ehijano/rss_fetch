      <title>The Hypertriton Puzzle in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The yields of hadrons and light nuclei in relativistic collisions of heavy-nuclei at a center of mass energy of 2.6 TeV can be described remarkably well by a thermal distribution of an ideal gas of hadrons and light nuclei interacting only via the decay of resonances. Given the particularly small binding energy of hypertritons relative to the temperature describing the yields (about 156 MeV), one might naturally expect hypertrions to dissociate in medium, making the agreement of hypertriton yields with thermal predictions highly puzzling. The puzzle is compounded by the fact that small binding energy is associated with the large size of the hypertriton. This size is on a similar scale to the overall size of the fireball and much larger than the length scale over which temperatures in the fireball vary over phenomenologically relevant amounts. This paper quantifies the tension this effect causes and shows that it is sufficiently large to render the thermal model inconsistent: its natural assumptions are in conflict with its outputs. The possibility that hypertritons are formed at freeze out as compact objects, quark droplets, that subsequently evolve into hypertritons is considered as a way to resolve the puzzle. It is noted that beyond making the assumption that compact quark droplets form, additional detailed dynamical assumptions which have not been justified are needed to make the thermal model work. The issue of why, despite these issues, the hypertriton is well described by a simple statistical description at freeze out is unresolved. Resolving the hypertriton puzzle is important as it may clarify whether the phenomenological success of the simple thermal model for yields accurately reflects the simple picture of the underlying physics on which it is based.</description>

      <title>16O electroweak response functions from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present calculations of various electroweak response functions for the 16O nucleus obtained using coupled-cluster theory in conjunction with the Lorentz integral transform method. We employ nuclear forces derived at next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to-leading order in chiral effective field theory and perform a Bayesian analysis to assess uncertainties. Our results are in good agreement with available electron-scattering data at q~ 326 MeV/c. Additionally, we provide several predictions for the weak response functions in the quasi-elastic peak region at q= 300 and 400 MeV/c, which are critical for long-baseline neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>White Dwarf Structure and Binary Inspiral Gravitational Waves from Quantum Hadrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarf, one of the compact objects in the universe, is not only pivotal for astrophysical inquiries but also furnishes a dynamic arena for nuclear physics exploration. In this work, we extend the relativistic mean field approach using a Walecka-type quantum hadrodynamics model to encapsulate the intricate structure of white dwarfs. This methodological advancement facilitates a cohesive analysis of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and the nuclear pasta within a unified theoretical framework. By meticulously calibrating the model parameters to nuclear matter properties, we successfully replicate the structures of various nuclei, such as \(^{4}\rm He\), isotopes of \(\rm C\), and \(^{16}\rm O\). Subsequently, we predict the properties of white dwarfs composed of atom-like units and the gravitational waves stemming from binary white dwarf inspirals incorporating tidal deformability contributions up to the 2.5 post-Newtonian order. These results shed light on the structure of white dwarfs and offer more clues for future gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <title>Investigation of 90,92Zr(n,{\gamma}) 91,93Zr in the s process nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron capture rates and Maxwellian averaged cross sections (MACS) for 90Zr(n,{\gamma}) 91Zr and 92Zr(n,{\gamma}) 93Zr processes have been computed within the framework of Talys v1.96. The effects of phenomenological nuclear level density (NLD) parameters and the gamma strength functions (GSFs) on Maxwellian averaged cross sections and neutron capture rates are examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. The present model based computed data for MACS and reaction rates gives a good comparison with the existing literature. The fine-tuning of the statistical models nuclear properties (level density and gamma-ray strength) to reproduce experimental data will allow the detailed investigation of the s process network.</description>

      <title>Re-analysis of the Gamow-Teller distributions for N=Z nuclei, 24Mg, 28Si, and 32S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gamow-Teller (GT) strength distributions of sd shell N=Z nuclei ($^{24}$Mg, $^{28}$Si, and $^{32}$S) are investigated within the framework of proton-neutron quasi particle random phase approximation (pn QRPA) using a deformed basis. The nuclear properties of these special nuclei were investigated by the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model. The RMF framework with density-dependent interactions (DD-PC1 and DD-ME2) was employed to compute ground-state deformation parameters (beta 2) using potential energy curves. The $\beta_2$ values computed from the RMF and the finite range droplet model (FRDM) were employed as a free parameter in the pn QRPA calculation to investigate the resulting GT strength distributions.The present model-based analyses compare well with the observed data.</description>

      <title>Subtleties in the calculation of correlation functions for hot and dense systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss subtleties in the calculation of loop integrals in studies of hot and dense systems as they appear in both perturbative and non-perturbative approaches. To be specific, we address subtleties which appear in situations where the order of integration, differentiation, and limit processes plays a crucial role. For example, this applies to computations of the effective action and the computation of momentum-dependent correlation functions. In particular, the zero-temperature limit is delicate in systems with fermions because of the presence of discontinuities at the Fermi surface. We provide a general discussion of scenarios where the computation and evaluation of loop integrals in the context of relativistic theories requires particular attention as a change of the order of the involved mathematical operations may lead to a different result. Our general considerations are then illustrated with the aid of concrete examples, namely by the computation of screening masses from fully momentum-dependent correlation functions in the context of the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model and quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Study of $\beta^+$/EC-decay properties of $sd$ shell nuclei using nuclear shell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study employs the nuclear shell model to systematically compute the half-lives of $\beta$ -decay for nuclei in the mass range of $A = 18-39$, encompassing the majority of $sd$ shell nuclei. This analysis utilizes the USDB and SDNN Hamiltonians. The theoretical outcomes contain calculations of various parameters such as $Q$ -values, half-lives, excitation energy, log$ft$ values, and branching ratios. We explore these results with axial-vector coupling constant for weak interactions, denoted as $g_A$$(= 1.27)$, and $\kappa$ value $(= 6289)$. We perform calculations of Gamow Teller matrix elements for 116 decay processes to calculate the quenching factor; we found a quenching factor of $q = 0.794\pm0.05 $ for the USDB interaction and $q = 0.815\pm0.04 $ for the SDNN interaction. We have also calculated superallowed transitions $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ for seven nuclei. Further, we have also included the electron capture phase space factor for the required nuclei to calculate the half-lives. This inclusion leads to small contribution in results, particularly for nuclei where electron capture (EC) plays a significant role. The overall results are in agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Tunnelling amplitudes through localised external potentials from Feynman diagram summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently there is no general theory of quantum tunnelling of a particle through a potential barrier which is compatible with QFT. We present a complete calculation of tunnelling amplitudes for a scalar field for some simple potentials using quantum field-theoretic methods. Using the perturbative S-matrix formalism, starting with the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian, we show that an infinite summation of Feynman diagrams can recover tunnelling amplitudes consistent with relativistic quantum mechanics. While this work does not include many-particle effects arising from a fully quantised QFT, it is necessary to investigate QFT corrections to tunnelling amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrections to tunnelling amplitudes of neutral scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though theoretical treatments of quantum tunnelling within single-particle quantum mechanics are well-established, at present, there is no quantum field-theoretic description (QFT) of tunnelling. Due to the single-particle nature of quantum mechanics, many-particle effects arising from quantum field theory are not accounted for. Such many-particle effects, including pair-production, have proved to be essential in resolving the Klein-paradox. This work seeks to determine how quantum corrections affect the tunnelling probability through an external field. We investigate a massive neutral scalar field, which interacts with an external field in accordance with relativistic quantum mechanics. To consider QFT corrections, we include another massive quantised neutral scalar field coupling to the original via a cubic interaction. This study formulates an all-order recursive expression for the loop-corrected scalar propagator, which contains only the class of vertex-corrected Feynman diagrams. This equation applies for general external potentials. Though there is no closed-form analytic solution, we also demonstrate how to approximate the QFT corrections if a perturbative coupling to the quantised field is assumed.</description>

      <title>QCD deconfinement transition line up to $\mu_B=400$ MeV from finite volume lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD cross-over line in the temperature ($T$) -- baryo-chemical potential ($\mu_B$) plane has been computed by several lattice groups by calculating the chiral order parameter and its susceptibility at finite values of $\mu_B$. In this work we focus on the deconfinement aspect of the transition between hadronic and Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phases. We define the deconfinement temperature as the peak position of the static quark entropy ($S_Q(T,\mu_B)$) in $T$, which is based on the renormalized Polyakov loop. We extrapolate $S_Q(T,\mu_B)$ based on high statistics finite temperature ensembles on a $16^3\times 8$ lattice to finite density by means of a Taylor expansion to eighth order in $\mu_B$ (NNNLO) along the strangeness neutral line. For the simulations the 4HEX staggered action was used with 2+1 flavors at physical quark masses. In this setup the phase diagram can be drawn up to unprecedentedly high chemical potentials. Our results for the deconfinement temperature are in rough agreement with phenomenological estimates of the freeze-out curve in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In addition, we study the width of the deconfinement crossover. We show that up to $\mu_B \approx 400$ MeV, the deconfinement transition gets broader at higher densities, disfavoring the existence of a deconfinement critical endpoint in this range. Finally, we examine the transition line without the strangeness neutrality condition and observe a hint for the narrowing of the crossover towards large $\mu_B$.</description>

      <title>Relations Between Anomalous Dimensions in the Regge Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recent formalism developed for computing rapidity anomalous dimension of form factors using unitarity to the problem of high-energy near forward scattering. By combining the factorization of $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering in the effective field theory (EFT) for Glauber operators with definite signature amplitudes, we derive an expression that relates anomalous dimensions (including Regge trajectories) to cut amplitudes, leading to significant computational simplifications. We demonstrate this explicitly by computing the one and two-loop Regge trajectories. Our formalism can also be used to bootstrap anomalous dimensions of operators not related by symmetries. As an example, we show that the full anomalous dimensions (including both the Regge pole and cut pieces) of the two Glauber operator anti-symmetric octet operator, can be determined from the anomalous dimension of the single Glauber exchange operator. Many other such relations exist between other color channels at each order in $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic coupling through flux branching of adjacent type-I and -II superconductors in a neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inner and outer cores of neutron stars are believed to contain type-I and -II proton superconductors, respectively. The type-I superconductor exists in an intermediate state, comprising macroscopic flux-free and flux-containing regions, while the type-II superconductor is flux-free, except for microscopic, quantized flux tubes. Here, we show that the inner and outer cores are coupled magnetically, when the macroscopic flux tubes subdivide dendritically into quantized flux tubes, a phenomenon called flux branching. An important implication is that up to $\sim 10^{12} (r_1/10^6 \, {\rm cm}) \, {\rm erg}$ of energy are required to separate a quantized flux tube from its progenitor macroscopic flux tube, where $r_1$ is the length of the macroscopic flux tube. Approximating the normal-superconducting boundary as sharp, we calculate the magnetic coupling energy between a quantized and macroscopic flux tube due to flux branching as a function of, $f_1$, the radius of the type-I inner core divided by the radius of the type-II outer core. Strong coupling delays magnetic field decay in the type-II superconductor. For an idealised inner core containing only a type-I proton superconductor and poloidal flux, and in the absence of ambipolar diffusion and diamagnetic screening, the low magnetic moments ($\lesssim 10^{27} \, {\rm G \, cm^3}$) of recycled pulsars imply $f_1 \lesssim 10^{-1.5}$.</description>

      <title>A New-Old Approach to Composite Scalars with Chiral Fermion Constituents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a dynamical, Lorentz invariant theory of composite scalars in configuration space consisting of chiral fermions, interacting by the perturbative exchange of a massive ``gluon'' of coupling $g_0$ and mass $M_0^2$ (the coloron model). The formalism is inspired by, but goes beyond, old ideas of Yukawa and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. It yields a non-pointlike internal wave-function of the bound state, $\phi(r)$, which satisfies a Schr\"odinger-Klein-Gordon (SKG) equation with eigenvalue $\mu^2$. For super-critical coupling, $g_0 &gt;g_{0c}$, we have $\mu^2&lt; 0$ leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking. The binding of chiral fermions is semiclassical, and not loop-level as in NJL. The mass scale is determined by the interaction as in NJL. We mainly focus on the short-distance, large $M_0^2$ limit, yielding an NJL pointlike interaction, but the bound state internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$, remains spatially extended and dilutes $\phi(0)$. This leads to power-law suppression of the induced Yukawa and quartic couplings and requires radically less fine-tuning of a hierarchy than does the NJL model. We include a discussion of loop corrections of the theory. A realistic top--condensation model appears possible.</description>

      <title>Exclusive rare semileptonic decays of $B$ and $B_c$ mesons in the relativistic independent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the exclusive rare semileptonic decays: $B(B_c)\to K(D_{(s)})l\bar{l}/\Sigma\nu_l\bar{\nu_l}$ ($l=\mu, \tau$) in the framework of relativistic independent quark (RIQ) model based on an average flavor independent confining potential in equally mixed scalar-vector harmonic form. The invariant weak form factors, parametrising the matrix elements between participating meson states are calculated in the parent meson rest frame. The momentum transfer dependence of the form factors is reliably determined in the whole accessible kinematical range: $q^2_{min}\leq 0\leq q^2_{max}$. Our predicted branching fractions for $B\to K\mu^+\mu^-/\tau^+\tau^-(\Sigma\nu_l\bar{\nu_l})$, $B_c\to D(D_s)\mu^+\mu^-$, $B_c\to D(D_s)\tau^+\tau^-$ and $B_c\to D(D_s)\Sigma\nu_l\bar{\nu_l}$, obtained in order of $10^{-7}(10^{-6})$, $10^{-9}(10^{-7})$, $10^{-9}(10^{-8})$ and $10^{-8}(10^{-7})$, respectively are in reasonable agreement with other Standard Model predictions and Lattice QCD results. The averaged values of the lepton polarization asymmetries for decay modes are obtained as $\langle P_L(B\to K\mu^+\mu^-)\rangle$=-0.97, $\langle P_L(B_c\to D_{(s)}\mu^+\mu^-)\rangle$=-0.972, $\langle P_L(B\to K\tau^+\tau^-)\rangle$=-0.224, $\langle P_L(B_c\to D\tau^+\tau^-)\rangle$=-0.275 and $\langle P_L(B_c\to D_s\tau^+\tau^-)\rangle$=-0.194.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of heavy-ion initial condition in isobar collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01294v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisions of isobar nuclei, those with the same mass number but different structure parameters, provide a new way to probe the initial condition of the heavy ion collisions. Using transport model simulation of $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr collisions at two energies $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=0.2$ TeV and 5.02 TeV, where $^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr nuclei have significantly different deformations and radial profiles, we identify sources of eccentricities contributing independently to the final state harmonic flow $v_n$. The efficacy for flow generation differs among these sources, and explains the modest energy dependence of the isobar ratios of $v_n$. Additionally, a significant component of $v_n$ is found to be uncorrelated with the eccentricity but is instead generated dynamically during system evolution. Experimental measurement of these ratios at the LHC energy and comparison with RHIC energy can provide insight into the collision-energy dependence of the initial condition.</description>

      <title>Next-generation multi-fluid hydrodynamic model for RHIC BES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a next-generation hybrid event-by-event three-fluid hydrodynamic model, suitable for simulations of heavy-ion collisions in the energy range from few up to tens of GeV per colliding NN pair. At such energies the interpenetration time of the nuclei is of the same order as the lifetime of the system, however this model treats the initial phase hydrodynamically. Thanks to that it is more sensitive to the Equation of State than 1-fluid models with initial states being parametrised or generated by transport approach. Hence, our model is well designed for simulations at collision energies, at which matter in vicinity of the QCD critical endpoint is expected. The construction of the model is explained and basic observables like hadron spectra in rapidity and transverse momentum, as well as elliptic flow are calculated.</description>

      <title>Impact of the pre-equilibrium phase for the determination of nuclear geometry in high-energy isobar collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic isobar collisions have been proposed as a useful tool to investigate nuclear structure. These systems are not created in equilibrium, rather undergo a pre-thermalization stage. In this stage, some of the initial structure information may be lost and additional effects introduced. The objective of this paper is to study this possibility in the extreme case of a ``free-streaming'' pre-equilibrium stage. We do this by computing estimators for ratios of various measured (or measurable) quantities (elliptic and triangular flows, mean transverse momentum and associated cumulants, correlators between elliptic or triangular flows and mean transverse momentum, symmetric cumulant and two-plane correlator) and study their sensitivity to the duration of the free-streaming stage. We find that the correlators between elliptic or triangular flows and mean transverse momentum, the so-called $\rho_2$ and $\rho_3$, are indeed sensitive to the duration of the free-streaming stage and that the normalized symmetric cumulant, $\varepsilon NSC(2,3)$ might also depend on this duration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In heavy-ion phenomenology, the nucleon density distribution in colliding nuclei is commonly described by a two-parameter Woods-Saxon (WS) distribution. However, this approach overlooks the detailed radial structure in the density distribution that arises from the quantal filling patterns of neutrons and protons. These fine structures, as estimated by the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock density functional, cause slight deviations in heavy-ion observables from the WS baseline, which cannot be captured by simply readjusting the WS parameters. These deviations depend on centrality and observable but often exhibit similar shapes for different nuclei. To fully exploit the exceptional sensitivity of isobar collisions to nuclear structure, such fine structures should be considered.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of shape in the even-even zirconium (Zr) isotopes has been the subject of study for many years. However, the odd-mass isotopes have not been investigated as extensively due to limited experimental accessibility and computational challenges. This work, employing the interacting boson-fermion model with configuration mixing, examines the effect of rapid shape evolution and normal-intruder configuration crossing -- both identified as quantum phase transitions -- alongside evolution in single particle energies, on the positive-parity spectrum of odd-mass $^\text{93-103}$Zr isotopes. Calculated energy levels, magnetic moments, $B(E2)$ values, and quadrupole moments are compared to experimental data, showing good agreement. The special case of $^{99}$Zr, which lies near the critical point of both quantum phase transitions, is also addressed, offering a new interpretation to the $7/2^+_1$ isomeric state and the occurrence of the type II shell evolution, in light of recent debates.</description>

Abstract: This brief note is to point out that the recent measurements at GSI and RIKEN of the superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly magic closed-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn could give an indication for a possibly important {\it fundamental} quenching, thus-far unrecognized, of $g_A$, unambiguously distinct from nuclear correlation effects in the framework of nuclear effective field theory. The result, either confirmed or ruled out both experimentally and theory, can have strong impacts on nuclear physics vis-\`a-vis with nuclear effective field theory as well as on particle physics relevant for going beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Empirical determination of the energy loss of heavy quarks in nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC energies</title>

Abstract: Heavy quarks produced in the heavy ion collisions loose energy while propagting in the hot partonic matter which finally fragment to heavy ($D$ or $B$) mesons. The energy loss suffered by the heavy quarks is imprinted in the nuclear modification factor as a function of transverse momenta ($p_T$) of these heavy mesons. An alternate measure of in-medium energy loss comes through the effective shift in transverse momentum spectra of hadrons recorded in nucleus-nucleus collisions when it is compared to the same in proton-proton collisions. We start by parametrizing invariant momentum yields of heavy mesons in p+p collisions. The fit function from p+p collisions and measured nuclear modification factor in heavy ion collisions are then utilised to obtain the shift in the transeverse mass $\Delta m_T$ of heavy mesons produced at the RHIC and LHC experiments.The energy loss $\Delta m_T$ so obtained is found to scale with the transverse mass ($m_T$) of heavy mesons through a power law at different energies and centralities of collisions. We have also calculated using theoretical formalism, the total energy loss suffered by a charm quark in quark-gluon plasma produced in Pb~+~Pb collisions at the LHC energies. The evolution of the plasma is described by (2+1) dimensional longitudinal boost-invariant ideal hydrodynamics. It is found that the total energy loss of charm quarks scales with the transverse mass of charm quarks through a similar power law which supports our empirical analysis of energy loss.</description>

      <title>Universal rapidity scaling of entanglement entropy inside hadrons from conformal invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a hadron is probed at high energy, a nontrivial quantum entanglement entropy inside the hadron emerges due to the lack of complete information about the hadron wave function extracted from this measurement. In the high-energy limit, the hadron becomes a maximally entangled state, with a linear dependence of entanglement entropy on rapidity, as has been found in a recent analysis based on parton description. In this paper, we use an effective conformal field theoretic description of hadrons on the light cone to show that the linear dependence of the entanglement entropy on rapidity found in parton description is a general consequence of approximate conformal invariance and does not depend on the assumption of weak coupling. Our result also provides further evidence for a duality between the parton and string descriptions of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Superconducting multi-vortices and a novel BPS bound in chiral perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel BPS bound from chiral perturbation theory minimally coupled to electrodynamics at finite isospin chemical potential. At a critical value of the isospin chemical potential, a system of three first-order differential field equations (which implies the second-order field equations) for the gauge field and the hadronic profile can be derived from the requirement to saturate the bound. These BPS configurations represent magnetic multi-vortices with quantized flux supported by a superconducting current. The corresponding topological charge density is related to the magnetic flux density, but is screened by the hadronic profile. Such a screening effect allows to derive the maximal value of the magnetic field generated by these BPS magnetic vortices, being $B_{max}=2,04 \times 10^{14}G$. The solution for a single BPS vortex is discussed in detail, and some physical consequences, together with the comparison with the magnetic vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau theory at critical coupling, are described.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using SU(3) lattice QCD, we study for the first time the effective potential of the Polyakov loop $\langle P \rangle$ at finite temperature, i.e., the thermodynamic potential, in the field-theoretical way. In the framework of the reweighting method in lattice QCD, we express the effective potential $V_{\rm eff}(\langle P \rangle)$ using the expectation value without a source term. In particular, we consider the most difficult and interesting case of vacuum coexistence at the critical temperature $T_c$. We adopt SU(3) quenched lattice QCD on $48^3 \times 6$ at $\beta$= 5.89379, which corresponds exactly to the critical temperature $T_c$ of the deconfinement phase transition, and use 200,000 Monte Carlo configurations. After categorizing the gauge configurations into one $Z_3$-symmetric and three $Z_3$-broken vacua each, we perform a vacuum-associated reweighting method, using the gauge configurations around each vacuum separately. Finally, we obtain the Polyakov-loop effective potential, which is well depicted around the $Z_3$-symmetric and $Z_3$-broken vacua.</description>

Abstract: We study the impact of nuclear structure uncertainties on a measurement of the weak charge of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at the future MESA facility in Mainz. Information from a large variety of nuclear models, accurately calibrated to the ground-state properties of selected nuclei, suggest that a $0.3$% precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry at forward angles will not be compromised by nuclear structure effects, thereby allowing a world-leading determination of the weak charge of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$. Furthermore, we show that a combination of measurements of the parity-violating asymmetry at forward and backward angles for the same electron beam energy can be used to extract information on the nuclear weak charge distribution. We conclude that a $0.34$% precision on the weak radius of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ may be achieved by performing a $3$% precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry at backward angles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic cooling (heating) of old neutron stars due to coherent scattering with relic neutrinos (sterile neutrino dark matter) via Standard Model neutral-current interactions. We take into account several important physical effects, such as gravitational clustering, coherent enhancement, neutron degeneracy and Pauli blocking. We find that the anomalous cooling of nearby neutron stars due to relic neutrino scattering might actually be observable by current and future telescopes operating in the optical to near-infrared frequency band, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), provided there is a large local relic overdensity that is still allowed. Similarly, the anomalous heating of neutron stars due to coherent scattering with keV-scale sterile neutrino dark matter, could also be observed by JWST or future telescopes, which would probe hitherto unexplored parameter space in the sterile neutrino mass-mixing plane.</description>

Abstract: The angular distributions of elastic scattering of $^{7}$Li, as well as the lithium-induced reaction of one-nucleon transfers $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B were measured at $E_\text{lab}$ = 58 MeV. Experiment was done using U-400 accelerator beam of the FLNR JINR, Dubna. Angular distribution for reaction $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B with excitation of the 3.56 MeV state ($^{6}$Li*) is presented for the first time. The DWBA analysis of the differential cross section of the $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B ground state (g.s.) transition and excited ($J^\pi$ = 0$^+$, $T$ = 1, $E$ = 3.56 MeV) state of $^{6}$Li transition was performed. The optical model potentials were obtained by fitting of measured elastic scattering data and evaluating parameters for the output reaction channels. Phenomenological approach based on solving an approximate equation for the reaction form factor was used to determine its radial dependence and empirical values of asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC). Obtained values of ANCs for the $^{6}$Li$_\text{g.s.}$ and $^{6}$Li*(3.56 MeV) states are in agreement with the literature ones. Comparison of the radial dependences of form factors shows that the wave function of the $^{6}$Li nucleus in excited ($J^\pi$ = 0$^+$, $T$ = 1, $E$ = 3.56 MeV) state has increased spatial dimension compared to the ground state. This result is an argument in favor of a halo existence in $^{6}$Li*(3.56 MeV) state, while the question of a halo in $^{6}$Li$_\text{g.s.}$ still leaves open.</description>

Abstract: A symmetry-preserving analysis of strong interaction quantum field equations is used to complete a unified treatment of pion, kaon, nucleon electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.</description>
