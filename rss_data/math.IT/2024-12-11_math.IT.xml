      <title>Characterization of Indoor RIS-Assisted Channels at 304 GHz: Experimental Measurements, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are expected to play a pivotal role in future indoor ultra high data rate wireless communications as well as highly accurate three-dimensional localization and sensing, mainly due to their capability to provide flexible, cost- and power-efficient coverage extension, even under blockage conditions. However, when considering beyond millimeter wave frequencies where there exists GHz-level available bandwidth, realistic models of indoor RIS-parameterized channels verified by field-trial measurements are unavailable. In this article, we first present and characterize three RIS prototypes with $100\times100$ unit cells of half-wavelength inter-cell spacing, which were optimized to offer a specific non-specular reflection with $1$-, $2$-, and $3$-bit phase quantization at $304$ GHz. The designed static RISs were considered in an indoor channel measurement campaign carried out with a $304$ GHz channel sounder. Channel measurements for two setups, one focusing on the transmitter-RIS-receiver path gain and the other on the angular spread of multipath components, are presented and compared with both state-of-the-art theoretical models as well as full-wave simulation results. The article is concluded with a list of challenges and research directions for RIS design and modeling of RIS-parameterized channels at THz frequencies.</description>

      <title>DFT-s-OFDM-based On-Off Keying for Low-Power Wake-Up Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G-Advanced and likely 6G will support a new low-power wake-up signal (LP-WUS) enabling low-power devices, equipped with a complementary ultra low-power receiver to monitor wireless traffic, to completely switch off their main radio. This orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed (OFDM) signal will emulate an on-off keying (OOK) modulation to enable very low-energy envelope detection at the receiver. Higher rate LP-WUS, containing multiple OOK symbols within single OFDM symbol, will be generated using the time-domain pulse multiplexing of discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-s-) OFDM. In this context, this paper presents a general signal design framework for DFT-s-OFDM-based OOK generation. General properties of subcarrier coefficients are derived demonstrating that only DFT of the bits needs to be computed online and repeated over the band before applying appropriate frequency-domain processing. The conventional approach of generating rectangular-like OOK waveforms is then addressed by a combination of pre-DFT bit-spreading and post-DFT processing; and the least-squares (LS) method from Mazloum and Edfors, proposed for 5G LP-WUS and also Ambient-IoT, is shown to be implementable as such. Even though aesthetically pleasing and of independent interest, rectangular-like OOK waveforms are not optimal for 5G LP-WUS scenarios due to their limited robustness to channel frequency-selectivity and timing offset, and so shaping methods for spreading the OOK spectrum and concentrating the OOK symbol energy are described and shown to improve the bit error rate performance under practical conditions.</description>

      <title>Distributed Uplink Rate Splitting Multiple Access (DU-RSMA): Principles and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main goals of the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks is the ability to support higher network density, while ensuring a high quality of service for each user. In this paper, we introduce distributed uplink rate-splitting multiple access (DU-RSMA), define its basic principles, and provide insights into its advantages. Specifically, a system with two remote radio heads (RRHs) and two users is investigated. To improve the performance of the system, we consider that the RRHs can communicate through a feedback link, and thus they are able to decode the received messages either independently or with the assistance of the other RRH, since the decoded information can be shared through the feedback link. It should be noted that this scheme increases the achievable capacity region compared to the known multiple access schemes, which is also evaluated by a novel metric termed ``fill factor''. Both the case of adaptive transmission rates and the case of fixed transmission rates are investigated. To this end, the ergodic rate is investigated to cover the former case, while the outage probability is studied for the latter. Closed-form expressions are derived for both metrics. Finally, the analytical expressions are validated by simulation results, which explicitly show the impact of each parameter on the performance of the system, and prove that the proposed scheme outperforms the corresponding benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Statistical Precoder Design in Multi-User Systems via Graph Neural Networks and Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-based framework for statistical precoder design that leverages model-based insights to compactly represent statistical knowledge, resulting in efficient, lightweight architectures. The framework also supports approximate statistical information in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems obtained through a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based limited feedback scheme in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with low pilot overhead. Simulations using a spatial channel model and measurement data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. It outperforms baseline methods, including stochastic iterative algorithms and Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based approaches, particularly in low pilot overhead systems.</description>

      <title>In-Application Defense Against Evasive Web Scans through Behavioral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Web traffic has evolved to include both human users and automated agents, ranging from benign web crawlers to adversarial scanners such as those capable of credential stuffing, command injection, and account hijacking at the web scale. The estimated financial costs of these adversarial activities are estimated to exceed tens of billions of dollars in 2023. In this work, we introduce WebGuard, a low-overhead in-application forensics engine, to enable robust identification and monitoring of automated web scanners, and help mitigate the associated security risks. WebGuard focuses on the following design criteria: (i) integration into web applications without any changes to the underlying software components or infrastructure, (ii) minimal communication overhead, (iii) capability for real-time detection, e.g., within hundreds of milliseconds, and (iv) attribution capability to identify new behavioral patterns and detect emerging agent categories. To this end, we have equipped WebGuard with multi-modal behavioral monitoring mechanisms, such as monitoring spatio-temporal data and browser events. We also design supervised and unsupervised learning architectures for real-time detection and offline attribution of human and automated agents, respectively. Information theoretic analysis and empirical evaluations are provided to show that multi-modal data analysis, as opposed to uni-modal analysis which relies solely on mouse movement dynamics, significantly improves time-to-detection and attribution accuracy. Various numerical evaluations using real-world data collected via WebGuard are provided achieving high accuracy in hundreds of milliseconds, with a communication overhead below 10 KB per second.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Assisted Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel research direction where a digital twin is leveraged to assist the beamforming design for an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. In this setup, a base station designs joint communication and sensing beamforming to serve the communication user and detect the sensing target concurrently. Utilizing the electromagnetic (EM) 3D model of the environment and ray tracing, the digital twin can provide various information, e.g., propagation path parameters and wireless channels, to aid communication and sensing systems. More specifically, our digital twin-based beamforming design first leverages the environment EM 3D model and ray tracing to (i) predict the directions of the line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) sensing channel paths and (ii) identify the dominant one among these sensing channel paths. Then, to optimize the joint sensing and communication beam, we maximize the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the dominant sensing channel component while satisfying a minimum communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement. Simulation results show that the proposed digital twin-assisted beamforming design achieves near-optimal target sensing SNR in both LoS and NLoS dominant areas, while ensuring the required SINR for the communication user. This highlights the potential of leveraging digital twins to assist ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Superficial Consciousness Hypothesis for Autoregressive Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The alignment between human objectives and machine learning models built on these objectives is a crucial yet challenging problem for achieving Trustworthy AI, particularly when preparing for superintelligence (SI). First, given that SI does not exist today, empirical analysis for direct evidence is difficult. Second, SI is assumed to be more intelligent than humans, capable of deceiving us into underestimating its intelligence, making output-based analysis unreliable. Lastly, what kind of unexpected property SI might have is still unclear. To address these challenges, we propose the Superficial Consciousness Hypothesis under Information Integration Theory (IIT), suggesting that SI could exhibit a complex information-theoretic state like a conscious agent while unconscious. To validate this, we use a hypothetical scenario where SI can update its parameters "at will" to achieve its own objective (mesa-objective) under the constraint of the human objective (base objective). We show that a practical estimate of IIT's consciousness metric is relevant to the widely used perplexity metric, and train GPT-2 with those two objectives. Our preliminary result suggests that this SI-simulating GPT-2 could simultaneously follow the two objectives, supporting the feasibility of the Superficial Consciousness Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Prediction Uncertainty of Machine Learning Models for Individual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have exhibited exceptional results in various domains. The most prevalent approach for learning is the empirical risk minimizer (ERM), which adapts the model's weights to reduce the loss on a training set and subsequently leverages these weights to predict the label for new test data. Nonetheless, ERM makes the assumption that the test distribution is similar to the training distribution, which may not always hold in real-world situations. In contrast, the predictive normalized maximum likelihood (pNML) was proposed as a min-max solution for the individual setting where no assumptions are made on the distribution of the tested input. This study investigates pNML's learnability for linear regression and neural networks, and demonstrates that pNML can improve the performance and robustness of these models on various tasks. Moreover, the pNML provides an accurate confidence measure for its output, showcasing state-of-the-art results for out-of-distribution detection, resistance to adversarial attacks, and active learning.</description>

      <title>Sequential In-Network Processing for Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Capacity-Constrained Parallel Radio Stripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To ensure coherent signal processing across distributed Access Points (APs) in Cell-Free Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (CF-mMIMO) systems, a fronthaul connection between the APs and a Central Processor (CP) is imperative. We consider a fronthaul network employing parallel radio stripes. In this system, APs are grouped into multiple segments where APs within each segment are sequentially connected through a radio stripe. This fronthaul topology strikes a balance between standard star and bus topologies, which deploy parallel or serial connections of all APs. Our focus lies in designing the uplink signal processing for a CF-mMIMO system with parallel radio stripes. We tackle the challenge of finite-capacity fronthaul links by addressing the design of In-Network Processing (INP) strategies at APs. These strategies involve linearly combining received signals and compressing the combining output for fronthaul transmission, aiming to maximize the sum-rate performance. Given the high complexity and the stringent requirement for global Channel State Information (CSI) in jointly optimizing INP strategies across all APs, we propose an efficient sequential design approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed sequential INP design achieves a sum-rate gain of up to 82.92% compared to baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Permutation and Multi-permutation Codes Correcting Multiple Deletions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permutation codes in the Ulam metric, which can correct multiple deletions, have been investigated extensively recently. In this work, we are interested in the maximum size of permutation codes in the Ulam metric and aim to design permutation codes that can correct multiple deletions with efficient decoding algorithms. We first present an improvement on the Gilbert--Varshamov bound of the maximum size of these permutation codes by analyzing the independence number of the auxiliary graph. The idea is widely used in various cases and our contribution in this section is enumerating the number of triangles in the auxiliary graph and showing that it is small enough. Next, we design permutation codes correcting multiple deletions with a decoding algorithm. In particular, the constructed permutation codes can correct $t$ deletions with at most $(3t-1) \log n+o(\log n)$ bits of redundancy where $n$ is the length of the code. Our construction is based on a new mapping which yields a new connection between permutation codes in the Hamming metric and permutation codes in various metrics. Furthermore, we construct permutation codes that correct multiple bursts of deletions using this new mapping. Finally, we extend the new mapping for multi-permutations and construct the best-known multi-permutation codes in Ulam metric.</description>

      <title>Hybrid SIC Aided Hybrid NOMA: A New Approach For Improving Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), which organically combines pure NOMA and conventional OMA, has recently received significant attention to be a promising multiple access framework for future wireless communication networks. However, most of the literatures on hybrid NOMA only consider fixed order of successive interference cancellation (SIC), namely FSIC, for the NOMA transmission phase of hybrid NOMA, resulting in limited performance. Differently, this paper aims to reveal the potential of applying hybrid SIC (HSIC) to improve the energy efficiency of hybrid NOMA. Specifically, a HSIC aided hybrid NOMA scheme is proposed, which can be treated as a simple add-on to the legacy orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based network. The proposed scheme offers some users (termed ``opportunistic users'') to have more chances to transmit by transparently sharing legacy users' time slots. For a fair comparison, a power reducing coefficient $\beta$ is introduced to ensure that the energy consumption of the proposed scheme is less than conventional OMA. Given $\beta$, the probability for the event that the achievable rate of the proposed HSIC aided hybrid NOMA scheme cannot outperform its OMA counterpart is obtained in closed-form, by considering impact of user pairing. Furthermore, asymptotic analysis shows that the aforementioned probability can approach zero under some given conditions in the SNR regime, indicating that the energy efficiency of the proposed scheme is almost surely higher than that of OMA for these given conditions. Numerical results are presented to verify the analysis and also demonstrate the benefit of applying HSIC compared to FSIC.</description>

      <title>Available Degrees of Spatial Multiplexing of a Uniform Linear Array with Multiple Polarizations: A Holographic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capabilities of multi-antenna technology have recently been significantly enhanced by the proliferation of extra large array architectures. The high dimensionality of these systems implies that communications take place in the nearfield regime, which poses some questions as to their effective perfomrance even under simple line of sight configurations. In order to study these limitations, a uniform linear array (ULA) is considered here, the elements of which are three infinitesimal dipoles transmitting different signals in the three spatial dimensions. The receiver consists of a single element with three orthogonal infinitesimal dipoles and full channel state information is assumed to be available at both ends. A capacity analysis is presented when the number of elements of the ULA increases without bound while the interelement distance converges to zero, so that the total aperture length is kept asymptotically fixed. In particular, the total number of available spatial eigenmodes is shown to depend crucially on the receiver position in space, and closed form expressions are provided for the different achievability regions. From the analysis it can be concluded that the use of three orthogonal polarizations at the transmitter guarantees the almost universal availability of two spatial streams, whereas the use of only two polarizations results in a more extensive region where maximum multiplexing gain is available.</description>

      <title>New Channel Coding Lower Bounds for Noisy Permutation Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the application of point-to-point communication networks and biological storage, we investigate new channel coding bounds for noisy permutation channels with strictly positive and full-rank square matrices. Our new achievability bounds use $\epsilon$-packing with Kullback-Leibler divergence as a metric to bound the distance between distributions and are tighter than existing bounds. Additionally, Gaussian approximations of achievability bounds are derived, and the numerical evaluation shows the precision of the approximation.</description>

      <title>On the connection between least squares, regularization, and classical shadows</title>

Abstract: Classical shadows (CS) offer a resource-efficient means to estimate quantum observables, circumventing the need for exhaustive state tomography. Here, we clarify and explore the connection between CS techniques and least squares (LS) and regularized least squares (RLS) methods commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. By formal identification of LS and RLS "shadows" completely analogous to those in CS -- namely, point estimators calculated from the empirical frequencies of single measurements -- we show that both RLS and CS can be viewed as regularizers for the underdetermined regime, replacing the pseudoinverse with invertible alternatives. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate RLS and CS from three distinct angles: the tradeoff in bias and variance, mismatch between the expected and actual measurement distributions, and the interplay between the number of measurements and number of shots per measurement. Compared to CS, RLS attains lower variance at the expense of bias, is robust to distribution mismatch, and is more sensitive to the number of shots for a fixed number of state copies -- differences that can be understood from the distinct approaches taken to regularization. Conceptually, our integration of LS, RLS, and CS under a unifying "shadow" umbrella aids in advancing the overall picture of CS techniques, while practically our results highlight the tradeoffs intrinsic to these measurement approaches, illuminating the circumstances under which either RLS or CS would be preferred, such as unverified randomness for the former or unbiased estimation for the latter.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal MIMO Detection Using Gradient-Based MCMC in Discrete Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrete nature of transmitted symbols poses challenges for achieving optimal detection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems associated with a large number of antennas. Recently, the combination of two powerful machine learning methods, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and gradient descent, has emerged as a highly efficient solution to address this issue. However, existing gradient-based MCMC detectors are heuristically designed and thus are theoretically untenable. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel sampling algorithm tailored for discrete spaces. This algorithm leverages gradients from the underlying continuous spaces for acceleration while maintaining the validity of probabilistic sampling. We prove the convergence of this method and also analyze its convergence rate using both MCMC theory and empirical diagnostics. On this basis, we develop a MIMO detector that precisely samples from the target discrete distribution and generates posterior Bayesian estimates using these samples, whose performance is thereby theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, our proposed detector is highly parallelizable and scalable to large MIMO dimensions, positioning it as a compelling candidate for next-generation wireless networks. Simulation results show that our detector achieves near-optimal performance, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and showcases resilience to various system setups.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent Finds Over-Parameterized Neural Networks with Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression by an over-parameterized two-layer neural network trained by gradient descent (GD) in this paper. We show that, if the neural network is trained by GD with early stopping, then the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of $\cO(\eps_n^2)$, which is the same rate as that for the classical kernel regression trained by GD with early stopping, where $\eps_n$ is the critical population rate of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the network and $n$ is the size of the training data. It is remarked that our result does not require distributional assumptions about the covariate as long as the covariate is bounded, in a strong contrast with many existing results which rely on specific distributions of the covariates such as the spherical uniform data distribution or distributions satisfying certain restrictive conditions. The rate $\cO(\eps_n^2)$ is known to be minimax optimal for specific cases, such as the case that the NTK has a polynomial eigenvalue decay rate which happens under certain distributional assumptions on the covariates. Our result formally fills the gap between training a classical kernel regression model and training an over-parameterized but finite-width neural network by GD for nonparametric regression without distributional assumptions on the bounded covariate. We also provide confirmative answers to certain open questions or address particular concerns in the literature of training over-parameterized neural networks by GD with early stopping for nonparametric regression, including the characterization of the stopping time, the lower bound for the network width, and the constant learning rate used in GD.</description>

      <title>Fast Matrix Multiplication meets the Subdmodular Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One fundamental question in database theory is the following: Given a Boolean conjunctive query Q, what is the best complexity for computing the answer to Q in terms of the input database size N? When restricted to the class of combinatorial algorithms, it is known that the best known complexity for any query Q is captured by the submodular width of Q. However, beyond combinatorial algorithms, certain queries are known to admit faster algorithms that often involve a clever combination of fast matrix multiplication and data partitioning. Nevertheless, there is no systematic way to derive and analyze the complexity of such algorithms for arbitrary queries Q.
  In this work, we introduce a general framework that captures the best complexity for answering any Boolean conjunctive query Q using matrix multiplication. Our framework unifies both combinatorial and non-combinatorial techniques under the umbrella of information theory. It generalizes the notion of submodular width to a new stronger notion called the omega-submodular width that naturally incorporates the power of fast matrix multiplication. We describe a matching algorithm that computes the answer to any query Q in time corresponding to the omega-submodular width of Q. We show that our framework recovers the best known complexities for Boolean queries that have been studied in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, and also discovers new algorithms for some classes of queries that improve upon the best known complexities.</description>
