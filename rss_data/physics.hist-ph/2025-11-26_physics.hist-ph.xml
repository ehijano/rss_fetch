      <title>Astronomical Methods and Instrumentation in the Islamic World: Past, Present, Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From al-Sufi's tenth-century observation of the Andromeda Galaxy as a "little cloud" to contemporary space missions, Islamic astronomy represents a millennium-spanning tradition of innovation and knowledge. This study traces its trajectory through three phases: the Golden Age (8th to 15th centuries), when scholars such as al-Biruni, al-Battani, and Ibn Sina developed instruments, cataloged the heavens, and refined theories that later influenced Copernicus; a period of decline (late 15th to 17th centuries), shaped by political fragmentation, economic shifts, and the delayed adoption of technologies such as printing and the telescope; and today's revival, marked by observatory collaborations, Olympiad successes, and emerging space programs in Morocco, Iran, Turkey, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. This comparative analysis with Chinese and European scientific traditions shows how Islamic astronomy provided a vital link in the global history of science, transmitting mathematical rigor, observational methods, and Arabic star names that are still used today. The contemporary resurgence signals the potential for renewed contributions to astrophysics, provided that it is supported by regional observatory networks, space-based research initiatives, and educational frameworks that integrate historical heritage with modern computational science.</description>
