      <title>Large Nc Truncations for SU(Nc) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory with Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) require a representation of gauge fields and fermions on the finitely many degrees of freedom available on a quantum computer. We introduce a truncation of lattice QCD coupled to staggered fermions that includes (i) a local Krylov truncation that generates allowed basis states; (ii) a maximum allowed electric energy per link; (iii) a limit on the number of fermions per site; and (iv) a truncation in the large N_c scaling of Hamiltonian matrix elements. Explicit truncated Hamiltonians for 1+1D and 2+1D lattices are given, and numerical simulations of string-breaking dynamics are performed.</description>

      <title>Wilson loops with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wilson loops are essential objects in QCD and have been pivotal in scale setting and demonstrating confinement. Various generalizations are crucial for computations needed in effective field theories. In lattice gauge theory, Wilson loop calculations face challenges, including excited-state contamination at short times and the signal-to-noise ratio issue at longer times. To address these problems, we develop a new method by using neural networks to parametrize interpolators for the static quark-antiquark pair. We construct gauge-equivariant layers for the network and train it to find the ground state of the system. The trained network itself is then treated as our new observable for the inference. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in the signal compared to traditional Wilson loops, performing as well as Coulomb-gauge Wilson-line correlators while maintaining gauge invariance. Additionally, we present an example where the optimized ground state is used to measure the static force directly, as well as another example combining this method with the multilevel algorithm. Finally, we extend the formalism to find excited-state interpolators for static quark-antiquark systems. To our knowledge, this work is the first study of neural networks with a physically motivated loss function for Wilson loops.</description>

      <title>A short proof of confinement in three-dimensional lattice gauge theories with a central $\mathrm{U}(1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pure lattice gauge theories in three dimensions are widely expected to confine. A rigorous proof of confinement for three-dimensional $\mathrm{U}(1)$ lattice gauge theory with Villain action was given by G\"opfert and Mack. Beyond the abelian case, rigorous confinement results are comparatively scarce; one general mechanism applies when the gauge group has a central copy of $\mathrm{U}(1)$. Indeed, combining a comparison inequality of Fr{\"o}hlich with earlier work of Glimm and Jaffe yields confinement with a logarithmically growing quark-antiquark potential for this class of theories. The purpose of this note is to give a short, self-contained proof of this classical result for three-dimensional Wilson lattice gauge theory: when $G\subseteq \mathrm{U}(n)$ contains the full circle of scalar matrices $\{zI:\ |z|=1\}$, rectangular Wilson loops obey an explicit upper bound of the form $\lvert\langle W_\ell\rangle\rvert \le n\exp\{-c(1+n\beta)^{-1}T\log(R+1)\}$.</description>

      <title>Fully strange tetra- and penta-quarks in a chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently reported resonant structure $X(2300)$, a strong candidate for a fully strange tetraquark with positive parity, we perform a systematic study of fully strange tetra- and penta-quark systems within a chiral quark model. Low-lying $S$-wave configurations of the $ss\bar s\bar s$ and $ssss\bar s$ systems are investigated using the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM) combined with the Complex Scaling Method (CSM), which allows for a unified treatment of bound, resonant, and scattering states. For tetraquarks, all possible configurations: meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark, and K-type structures, with complete color bases, are incorporated, while baryon-meson and diquark-diquark-antiquark configurations are considered for pentaquarks. Several weakly bound states and narrow resonances are identified in both sectors. In particular, a compact fully strange tetraquark with $J^P=1^+$ is found near $2.3\,\text{GeV}$, providing a natural interpretation of the $X(2300)$ resonance. Additional exotic states with dominant hidden-color and K-type components are predicted in the mass ranges $1.6-3.1$ GeV for tetraquarks and $2.6-3.2$ GeV for pentaquarks. The internal structure of these states is analyzed through their sizes, magnetic moments, and wave-function compositions, highlighting the essential role of channel coupling and exotic color configurations. Finally, promising two-body strong decay channels are proposed to facilitate future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Shallow $T_{bc}$ states from an EFT analysis of $B^{(*)} \bar D^{(*)}$ scattering on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an effective field theory (EFT) framework for coupled-channel $B^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ scattering, applying it to recent lattice QCD results by Alexandrou et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 151902 (2024)]. Two complementary EFT approaches are developed: (1) A low-energy theory near the $B \bar D$ ($J=0$) and $B^* \bar D$ ($J=1$) thresholds, where coupled-channel effects are integrated out; (2) A coupled-channel formulation, where all relevant momentum scales are treated as soft, incorporating contact interactions and one-pion exchange (OPE). Importantly, OPE contributes to the lowest channels only through off-diagonal transitions, thus resulting in the appearance of the left-hand cut from two-pion exchange. The two approaches yield mutually consistent results, supporting the existence of shallow bound states in both channels, in agreement with the lattice findings. The finite-volume spectra and extracted pole positions show a near-degeneracy in $J=0$ and $J=1$ channels, consistent with heavy-quark spin symmetry (HQSS). Using HQSS, we predict additional shallow bound states near the $B \bar{D}^*$ and $B^* \bar{D}^*$ thresholds, which are accessible to future lattice simulations. The effect of OPE on the finite volume spectra is found to be small, with only moderate impact on HQSS partners.</description>

      <title>Polyakov loop model with exact static quark determinant in the 't Hooft-Veneziano limit: U(N) case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I investigate a $d$-dimensional $U(N)$ Polyakov loop model that includes the exact static determinant with $N_f$ degenerate quark flavor and depends explicitly on the quark mass and chemical potential. In the large $N, N_f$ limit mean field gives the exact solution, and the core of the Polyakov loop model is reduced to a deformed unitary matrix model, which I solve exactly. I compute the free energy, the expectation value of the Polyakov loop, and the quark condensate. The phase diagram of the model and the type of phase transition is investigated and shows it depends on the ratio $\kappa =N_f/N$.</description>

      <title>On the moduli space of multi-fractional instantons on the twisted $\mathbb T^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of self-dual $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills instantons on $\mathbb T^4$ of topological charge $Q = r/N$, $1 \leq r \leq N-1$, is of current interest, yet is not fully understood. In this paper, starting from 't Hooft's constant field strength ($F$) instantons, the only known exact solutions on $\mathbb T^4$, we explore the moduli space via analytical and lattice tools. These solutions are characterized by two positive integers $k, \ell$, $k+\ell=N$, and are self-dual for $\mathbb T^4$ sides $L_\mu$ tuned to $k L_1 L_2 = r \ell L_3 L_4$. For gcd$(k,r) = r$, we show, analytically and numerically (for $N = 3$) that the constant-$F$ solutions are the only self-dual solutions on the tuned $\mathbb T^4$, with $4r$ holonomy moduli. In contrast, when gcd$(k,r) \ne r$, we argue that the self-dual constant-$F$ solutions acquire, in addition to the $4\text{gcd}(k,r)$ holonomies, $4r - 4\text{gcd}(k,r)$ extra moduli, whose turning on makes the field strength nonabelian and non-constant. Thus, for gcd($k,r) \ne r$, 't Hooft's constant-$F$ solutions are a measure-zero subset of the moduli space on the tuned $\mathbb T^4$, a fact explaining a puzzle encountered in arXiv:2307.04795. We also show that, for $r = k = 2$, $N = 3$, the agreement between the approximate analytic solutions on the slightly detuned $\mathbb T^4$ and the $Q=2/3$ self-dual configurations obtained by minimizing the lattice action is remarkable.</description>

      <title>Detecting (emergent) continuous symmetry of criticality via subsystem's entanglement spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (emergent) symmetry of a critical point is one of the most important information to identify the universality class and effective field theory, which is fundamental for various critical theories. However, the underlying symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent) symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.</description>

      <title>Partial pressure and susceptibilities of charmed sector in the van der Waals hadron resonance gas model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the general susceptibilities in the charm sector by using the van der Waals hadron resonance gas model (VDWHRG). We argue that the ideal hadron resonance gas (HRG), which assumes no interactions between hadrons, and the excluded volume hadron resonance gas (EVHRG), which includes only repulsive interactions, fail to explain the lQCD data at very high temperatures. In contrast, the VDWHRG model, incorporating both attractive and repulsive interactions, extends the degree of agreement with lQCD up to nearly 180 MeV. We estimate the partial pressure in the charm sector and study charm susceptibility ratios in a baryon-rich environment, which is tricky for lattice quantum chromodynamics (lQCD) due to the fermion sign problem. Our study further solidifies the notion that the hadrons shouldn't be treated as non-interacting particles, especially when studying higher order fluctuations, but rather one should consider both attractive and repulsive interactions between the hadrons.</description>

      <title>Two-lepton tales: Dalitz decays of heavy quarkonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Dalitz decays of heavy quarkonia, which result from the internal virtual photon conversion into an $\ell^+ \ell^-$ lepton pair. Heavy-quark symmetries allow us to establish systematic relations between transitions of different quarkonium states, and to precisely determine the branching fractions for several charmonium and bottomonium decay modes. For charmonium, existing data on $\chi_{cJ}(1P)\to J/\psi \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $\psi(2S)\to \chi_{cJ}(1P) \ell^+ \ell^-$ enable us to determine the parameters of the transition form factors and to predict the rates of yet-unobserved modes. The Dalitz transitions of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ are important, as they can help assessing the structure of this meson. For bottomonium, recent LHCb measurements allow us to predict the branching fractions of $\chi_{bJ}(nP)\to \Upsilon(1S)\ell^+ \ell^-$ and $h_b(nP)\to \eta_b(1S) \ell^+ \ell^-$ ($n=1,\,2)$. We also investigate the sensitivity of heavy quarkonia Dalitz modes to the contribution of a new light vector mediator, such as the putative $X(17)$.</description>

      <title>Addicted to Flavour: 1976-2026</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I describe my activities in Flavour Physics from 1976 to 2026. However, this 50th anniversary is not the only motivation for this writing. The second reason is the 350th anniversary of the discovery of the first animalcula by van Leeuvanhoek in 1676. Flavour physics makes it possible to search for new animalcula at distance scales far shorter than those resolved by van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 and even shorter than those directly accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. Achieving this goal requires not only precise measurements of a wide variety of processes, but also equally precise theoretical calculations, both within the Standard Model (SM) and beyond it. In this respect, next-to-leading-order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD calculations of various Wilson coefficients in the SM and beyond it, in which I was involved for two decades, as well as reliable treatments of non-perturbative QCD effects, are indispensable. Equally important is the proper choice of observables that are best suited to revealing these new animalcula of particle physics. Moreover, in my view it is crucial to develop strategies for the search for New Physics (NP) that go beyond the global fits that are very popular today. While effective field theories such as WET and SMEFT are formulated in terms of Wilson coefficients of the relevant operators, with correlations characteristic of the SM and of specific NP scenarios, the most direct tests of the SM and its extensions are, in my opinion, correlations among different observables that are characteristic of particular new animalcula at work. Numerous colourful plots in this article illustrate this point. I hope that these ideas are clearly conveyed in my Flavour Autobiography, which also includes my memories of many conferences, workshops, and schools, as well as related anecdotes that are not always directly connected to physics.</description>

      <title>Possible Existence of $^3_\phi$H, $^4_\phi$H, $^4_\phi$He, and $^5_\phi$He Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent HAL QCD simulations of the $\phi N$ interaction in the $^4S_{3/2}$ channel and its modification in the $^2S_{1/2}$ channel, we develop a first-principles few-body framework that embeds these potentials into configuration-space Faddeev--Yakubovsky equations. We predict bound $^4_\phi\mathrm{H}$, $^4_\phi\mathrm{He}$, and $^5_\phi\mathrm{He}$ nuclei by performing calculations for $\phi$-mesic $\phi NNN$ and $\phi NNNN$ systems. Both spin-dependent and spin-independent $\phi N$ interactions are considered, leading to deeply and moderately bound states, respectively. The deeply bound states originate from the strong attraction in the $^2S_{1/2}$ $\phi N$ channel. Coulomb shifts of the binding energies are evaluated. Our findings provide the binding mechanism and demonstrate the importance of short-range $\phi N$ attraction.</description>
