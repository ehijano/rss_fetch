      <title>Resolution of Loschmidts Paradox via Geometric Constraints on Information Accessibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve Loschmidt's paradox -- the apparent contradiction between time-reversible microscopic dynamics and irreversible macroscopic evolution -- including the long-standing puzzle of the thermodynamic arrow of time. The resolution: entropy increases not because dynamics are asymmetric, but because information accessibility is geometrically bounded. For Hamiltonian systems (conservative dynamics), Lyapunov exponents come in positive-negative pairs ($\{\lambda_i, -\lambda_i\}$) due to symplectic structure. Under time reversal these pairs flip ($\lambda_i \to -\lambda_i$), but stable manifolds contract below quantum resolution $\lambda = \hbar/\sqrt{mk_BT}$, becoming physically indistinguishable. We always observe only unstable manifolds where trajectories diverge. Hence information loss proceeds at the same rate $h_{KS} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\text{all } i}|\lambda_i|$ in both time directions, resolving the arrow of time: ``forward'' simply means ``where we observe expansion,'' which is universal because stable manifolds always contract below measurability. Quantitatively, for N$_2$ gas at STP with conservative estimates ($h_{KS} \sim 10^{10}$ s$^{-1}$), time reversal at $t = 1$ nanosecond requires momentum precision $\sim 10^{-13}$ times quantum limits -- geometrically impossible. At macroscopic times, the precision requirement becomes $\sim 10^{-10^{10}}$ times quantum limits. This framework preserves microscopic time-reversal symmetry, requires no special initial conditions or Past Hypothesis, and extends to quantum systems (OTOCs) and black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Legal Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two physical systems are correlated in such a way that they appear to instantaneously affect one another, regardless of the distance between them. As commonly understood, Bell's Theorem famously demonstrates that any causal explanation of entanglement must discard either locality (the principle that nothing, including information, travels faster than light) or classical notions of realism (or both). Drawing on this concept, several legal scholars have metaphorically described 'entangled' legal concepts. For instance, if a state's highest court redefines the concept of 'foreseeability' in negligence law, this redefinition alters the concept of 'reasonable care' immediately in the eyes of the law. Godfrey (2024) is the first work to mathematically model entangled legal concepts, particularly in the context of legal interpretation. Here, we extend the quantification to the formulation and delineation of law (lawmaking) and the adjudication of law (judgment). In so doing, we connect legal entanglement to Sichelman's (2022) work on legal entropy, complexity, and the informational content of law. In addition to quantifying entanglement across various legal contexts, our approach provides broader insights. For example, it offers a more comprehensive analysis of the uses and limits of 'modularity' in law--specifically, the role legal boundaries (spatial or intangible) play in reducing information costs within legal systems. Moreover, we discuss how our model can improve theories of legal artificial intelligence. Finally, we explore the application of legal theory back to physics. If quantum physical entanglement operates analogously to legal entanglement, it requires discarding both locality and classical realism, though not in the manner commonly imagined.</description>

      <title>Comments on Weinstein's comments arXiv: 2509.09361 &amp; 2510.03793</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2024, after thirty years of research on this subject, I published a book entitled: \textit{Poincar\'{e}, Einstein and the discovery of special relativity. An end to the controversy} \cite{Ginoux2024}. In September 2025, Galina Weinstein published a review of this book entitled: \textit{Convergences and Divergences: Einstein Poincar\'{e} and Special Relativity} (arXiv:2509.09361) in which she harshly criticized my work in an unfair and error filled manner. The, she published a second comment (arXiv: 2510.03793) in which she added she added insults about me to all her mistakes, falsehoods and misleading criticisms. So I've decided to reply to her comments, in an academic way (as she would normally have done), in order to demonstrate that her allegedly ``novel way'' of reconstructing the history of the theory of special relativity is purely based on her own interpretation of the facts and not on the facts themselves. To this aim, I will follow the structure of each Weinstein's comment (arXiv: 2509.09361 \&amp; 2510.03793) and I will highlight section by section all the erroneous things she has reported and repeated.</description>
