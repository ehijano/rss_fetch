      <title>On Non-Interactive Simulation of Distributed Sources with Finite Alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a Fourier analysis framework for the non-interactive source simulation (NISS) problem. Two distributed agents observe a pair of sequences $X^d$ and $Y^d$ drawn according to a joint distribution $P_{X^dY^d}$. The agents aim to generate outputs $U=f_d(X^d)$ and $V=g_d(Y^d)$ with a joint distribution sufficiently close in total variation to a target distribution $Q_{UV}$. Existing works have shown that the NISS problem with finite-alphabet outputs is decidable. For the binary-output NISS, an upper-bound to the input complexity was derived which is $O(\exp\operatorname{poly}(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$. In this work, the input complexity and algorithm design are addressed in several classes of NISS scenarios. For binary-output NISS scenarios with doubly-symmetric binary inputs, it is shown that the input complexity is $\Theta(\log{\frac{1}{\epsilon}})$, thus providing a super-exponential improvement in input complexity. An explicit characterization of the simulating pair of functions is provided. For general finite-input scenarios, a constructive algorithm is introduced that explicitly finds the simulating functions $(f_d(X^d),g_d(Y^d))$. The approach relies on a novel Fourier analysis framework. Various numerical simulations of NISS scenarios with IID inputs are provided. Furthermore, to illustrate the general applicability of the Fourier framework, several examples with non-IID inputs, including entanglement-assisted NISS and NISS with Markovian inputs are provided.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning via Lattice Joint Source-Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a universal federated learning framework that enables over-the-air computation via digital communications, using a new joint source-channel coding scheme. Without relying on channel state information at devices, this scheme employs lattice codes to both quantize model parameters and exploit interference from the devices. A novel two-layer receiver structure at the server is designed to reliably decode an integer combination of the quantized model parameters as a lattice point for the purpose of aggregation. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Even with the challenges posed by channel conditions and device heterogeneity, the proposed scheme markedly surpasses other over-the-air FL strategies.</description>

      <title>Rate-limited Shuffling for Distributed Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the shuffling phase in a distributed computing model with rate-limited links between nodes. Each node is connected to all other nodes via a noiseless broadcast link with a finite capacity. For this network, the shuffling phase is described as a distributed index-coding problem to extend an outer bound for the latter to the distributed computing problem. An inner bound on the capacity region is also established by using the distributed composite-coding scheme introduced for the distributed index-coding problem. We consider some special cases of the distributed computing problem through two examples for which we prove that the inner and outer bounds agree, thereby establishing the capacity regions. We, then, generalize the special cases to any number of nodes and computation loads under certain constraints.</description>

      <title>Successful Transmission Probability and SIR Meta Distribution Analysis for Multi-Antenna Cache-Enabled Networks with Interference Nulling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a multi-antenna cache-enabled network with interference nulling (IN) employed at base stations. Two IN schemes, namely, the fixed IN scheme and the flexible IN scheme are considered to improve the received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at users. To thoroughly explore the effects of the caching parameter and the IN parameters on the network performance, we focus on the analysis of not only the successful transmission probability (STP) but the SIR meta distribution. For each IN scheme, the expression for the STP is derived and an approximated expression for the SIR meta distribution is also obtained by deriving the first and second moments of an upper bound of the link reliability and utilizing the beta distribution. With this analytical framework, we compare the performance of these two IN schemes and gain some useful system design guidelines from the perspectives of the STP and the SIR meta distribution by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Maximum Length RLL Sequences in de Bruijn Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A timing and synchronization system based on a de Bruijn sequence has been proposed and studied recently for a channel associated with quantum communication that requires reliable synchronization. To avoid a long period of no-pulse in such a system on-off pulses are used to simulate a zero and on-on pulses are used to simulate a one. However, these sequences have high redundancy. To reduce the redundancy, run-length limited sequences in the de Bruijn graph are proposed for the same purpose. The maximum length of such sequences in the de Bruijn graph is studied and an efficient algorithm to construct a large set of these sequences is presented. A maximum length sequence for which the position of each window can be computed efficiently is constructed. Finally, an enumeration of the number of such sequences is given and some generalizations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Design of Uplink Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the issue of uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G wireless networks where the sensing echo signal and the communication signal are received simultaneously at the base station (BS). To effectively mitigate the mutual interference between sensing and communication caused by the sharing of spectrum and hardware resources, we provide a joint sensing transmit waveform and communication receive beamforming design with the objective of maximizing the weighted sum of normalized sensing rate and normalized communication rate. It is formulated as a computationally complicated non-convex optimization problem, which is quite difficult to be solved by conventional optimization methods. To this end, we first make a series of equivalent transformation on the optimization problem to reduce the design complexity, and then develop a deep learning (DL)-based scheme to enhance the overall performance of ISAC. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DL-based scheme for ISAC in 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear block code over a field can be derived from a unit scheme. Looking at codes as a structure within a unit scheme greatly extends the available of codes, both linear block and convolutional, and allows the construction of particular types of codes and to required length, rate, distance and over specified fields as required. Properties of a code emanate from properties of the unit from which it was derived. Orthogonal units and related orthogonal type units, units in group rings and Fourier/Vandermonde are types of units which are used to construct and analyse particular types of codes and to construct these to predefined length, rate and distance. Dual containing codes, which include self-dual codes, and complementary dual codes as well as codes to specified rate and over specified finite fields are constructible. Low density parity check linear and convolutional codes to required rates are constructed using group rings. From a single unit, multiple codes of a required type are derivable. Using the full unit, rather than just part of the unit, allows the construction of convolutional codes to required types, rates and structure. The distances of the convolutional codes are determinable from the constituents of the unit used and are much better than the distance of an equivalent rate linear code but also efficient convolutional decoding methods are applicable. Dual-containing and complementary dual convolutional codes are constructed by the unit-derived methods from suitable units. Dual-containing convolutional codes are used to construct quantum error-correcting convolutional codes. `Manufacturing' of different and sophisticated `models' is now possible.</description>

      <title>Conditional normality and finite-state dimensions revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of a normal bit sequence was introduced by Borel in 1909; it was the first definition of an individual random object. Normality is a weak notion of randomness requiring only that all $2^n$ factors (substrings) of arbitrary length~$n$ appear with the same limit frequency $2^{-n}$. Later many stronger definitions of randomness were introduced, and in this context normality found its place as ``randomness against a finite-memory adversary''. A quantitative measure of finite-state compressibility was also introduced (the finite-state dimension) and normality means that the finite state dimension is maximal (equals~$1$).
  Recently Nandakumar, Pulari and S (2023) introduced the notion of relative finite-state dimension for a binary sequence with respect to some other binary sequence (treated as an oracle), and the corresponding notion of conditional (relative) normality. (Different notions of conditional randomness were considered before, but not for the finite memory case.) They establish equivalence between the block frequency and the gambling approaches to conditional normality and finite-state dimensions.
  In this note we revisit their definitions and explain how this equivalence can be obtained easily by generalizing known characterizations of (unconditional) normality and dimension in terms of compressibility (finite-state complexity), superadditive complexity measures and gambling (finite-state gales), thus also answering some questions left open in the above-mentioned paper.</description>

      <title>Adapt or Wait: Quality Adaptation for Cache-aided Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on quality adaptation as a means to counter the effects of channel degradation in wireless, cache- aided channels. We design a delivery scheme which combines coded caching, superposition coding, and scalable source coding, while keeping the caching scheme oblivious to channel qualities. By properly adjusting the quality at the degraded users we are able to satisfy all demands in a time-efficient manner. In addition, superposition coding allows us to serve high-rate users with high content quality without subjecting them to a delay penalty caused by users with lower rate channels. We design a communication framework that covers all possible channel rate and quality configurations and we further provide algorithms that can optimise the served quality. An interesting outcome of this work is that a modest quality reduction at the degraded users can counter the effects of significant channel degradation. For example, in a 100-user system with normalized cache size 1/10 at each user, if 10 users experience channel degradation of 60% compared to the rate of the non-degraded users, we show that our transmission strategy leads to a 85% quality at the degraded users and perfect quality at the non-degraded users.</description>

Abstract: In this work we present results on the classification of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-linear MRD codes of dimension three. In particular, using connections with certain algebraic varieties over finite fields, we provide non-existence results for MRD codes $\mathcal{C}=\langle x^{q^t}, F(x), G(x) \rangle \subseteq \mathcal{L}_{n,q}$ of exceptional type, i.e. such that $\mathcal{C}$ is MRD over infinite many extensions of the field $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$. These results partially address a conjecture of Bartoli, Zini and Zullo in 2023.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Active-Passive RIS Transmitter Enabled Energy-Efficient Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel hybrid active-passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) transmitter enabled downlink multi-user communication system is investigated. Specifically, RISs are exploited to serve as transmitter antennas, where each element can flexibly switch between active and passive modes to deliver information to multiple users. The system energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the RIS element scheduling and beamforming coefficients, as well as the power allocation coefficients, subject to the user's individual rate requirement and the maximum RIS amplification power constraint. Using the Dinkelbach relaxation, the original mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is transformed into a nonfractional optimization problem with a two-layer structure, which is solved by the alternating optimization approach. In particular, an exhaustive search method is proposed to determine the optimal operating mode for each RIS element. Then, the RIS beamforming and power allocation coefficients are properly designed in an alternating manner. To overcome the potentially high complexity caused by exhaustive searching, we further develop a joint RIS element mode and beamforming optimization scheme by exploiting the Big-M formulation technique. Numerical results validate that: 1) The proposed hybrid RIS scheme yields higher EE than the baseline multi-antenna schemes employing fully active/passive RIS or conventional radio frequency chains; 2) Both proposed algorithms are effective in improving the system performance, especially the latter can achieve precise design of RIS elements with low complexity; and 3) For a fixed-size hybrid RIS, maximum EE can be reaped by setting only a minority of elements to operate in the active mode.</description>

      <title>OTFS vs OFDM: Which is Superior in Multiuser LEO Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, a delay-Doppler (DD) domain communication scheme exhibiting strong robustness against the Doppler shifts, has the potentials to be employed in LEO satellite communications. However, the performance comparison with the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and the resource allocation scheme for multiuser OTFS-based LEO satellite communication system have rarely been investigated. In this paper, we conduct a performance comparison under various channel conditions between the OTFS and OFDM modulations, encompassing evaluations of sum-rate and bit error ratio (BER). Additionally, we investigate the joint optimal allocation of power and delay-Doppler resource blocks aiming at maximizing sum-rate for multiuser downlink OTFS-based LEO satellite communication systems. Unlike the conventional modulations relaying on complex input-output relations within the Time-Frequency (TF) domain, the OTFS modulation exploits both time and frequency diversities, i.e., delay and Doppler shifts remain constant during a OTFS frame, which facilitates a DD domain input-output simple relation for our investigation. We transform the resulting non-convex and combinatorial optimization problem into an equivalent difference of convex problem by decoupling the conditional constraints, and solve the transformed problem via penalty convex-concave procedure algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the OTFS modulation is robust to carrier frequency offsets (CFO) caused by high-mobility of LEO satellites, and has superior performance to the OFDM modulation. Moreover, numerical results indicate that our proposed resource allocation scheme has higher sum-rate than existed schemes for the OTFS modulation, such as delay divided multiple access and Doppler divided multiple access, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattered subspaces and $h$-scattered subspaces have been extensively studied in recent decades for both theoretical purposes and their connections to various applications. While numerous constructions of scattered subspaces exist, relatively few are known about $h$-scattered subspaces with $h\geq2$. In this paper, we establish the existence of maximum $2$-scattered $\F_q$-subspaces in $V(r,q^6)$ whenever $r\geq 3$, $r\ne 5$, and $q$ is an odd power of $2$. Additionally, we explore the corresponding MRD codes.</description>

      <title>Quantized Hierarchical Federated Learning: A Robust Approach to Statistical Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hierarchical federated learning algorithm within multiple sets that incorporates quantization for communication-efficiency and demonstrates resilience to statistical heterogeneity. Unlike conventional hierarchical federated learning algorithms, our approach combines gradient aggregation in intra-set iterations with model aggregation in inter-set iterations. We offer a comprehensive analytical framework to evaluate its optimality gap and convergence rate, comparing these aspects with those of conventional algorithms. Additionally, we develop a problem formulation to derive optimal system parameters in a closed-form solution. Our findings reveal that our algorithm consistently achieves high learning accuracy over a range of parameters and significantly outperforms other hierarchical algorithms, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous data distributions.</description>

      <title>Exposing the Deception: Uncovering More Forgery Clues for Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfake technology has given rise to a spectrum of novel and compelling applications. Unfortunately, the widespread proliferation of high-fidelity fake videos has led to pervasive confusion and deception, shattering our faith that seeing is believing. One aspect that has been overlooked so far is that current deepfake detection approaches may easily fall into the trap of overfitting, focusing only on forgery clues within one or a few local regions. Moreover, existing works heavily rely on neural networks to extract forgery features, lacking theoretical constraints guaranteeing that sufficient forgery clues are extracted and superfluous features are eliminated. These deficiencies culminate in unsatisfactory accuracy and limited generalizability in real-life scenarios.
  In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges through three designs: (1) We present a novel framework to capture broader forgery clues by extracting multiple non-overlapping local representations and fusing them into a global semantic-rich feature. (2) Based on the information bottleneck theory, we derive Local Information Loss to guarantee the orthogonality of local representations while preserving comprehensive task-relevant information. (3) Further, to fuse the local representations and remove task-irrelevant information, we arrive at a Global Information Loss through the theoretical analysis of mutual information. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets.Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/QingyuLiu/Exposing-the-Deception}, hoping to inspire researchers.</description>

      <title>Information Lower Bounds for Robust Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove lower bounds on the error of any estimator for the mean of a real probability distribution under the knowledge that the distribution belongs to a given set. We apply these lower bounds both to parametric and nonparametric estimation. In the nonparametric case, we apply our results to the question of sub-Gaussian estimation for distributions with finite variance to obtain new lower bounds in the small error probability regime, and present an optimal estimator in that regime. In the (semi-)parametric case, we use the Fisher information to provide distribution-dependent lower bounds that are constant-tight asymptotically, of order $\sqrt{2\log(1/\delta)/(nI)}$ where $I$ is the Fisher information of the distribution. We use known minimizers of the Fisher information on some nonparametric set of distributions to give lower bounds in cases such as corrupted distributions, or bounded/semi-bounded distributions.</description>

      <title>Capacity of the Hebbian-Hopfield network associative memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{Hop82}, Hopfield introduced a \emph{Hebbian} learning rule based neural network model and suggested how it can efficiently operate as an associative memory. Studying random binary patterns, he also uncovered that, if a small fraction of errors is tolerated in the stored patterns retrieval, the capacity of the network (maximal number of memorized patterns, $m$) scales linearly with each pattern's size, $n$. Moreover, he famously predicted $\alpha_c=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{m}{n}\approx 0.14$. We study this very same scenario with two famous pattern's basins of attraction: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} The AGS one from \cite{AmiGutSom85}; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} The NLT one from \cite{Newman88,Louk94,Louk94a,Louk97,Tal98}. Relying on the \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl RDT) from \cite{Stojnicflrdt23}, we obtain the following explicit capacity characterizations on the first level of lifting:
  \begin{equation}
  \alpha_c^{(AGS,1)} = \left ( \max_{\delta\in \left ( 0,\frac{1}{2}\right ) }\frac{1-2\delta}{\sqrt{2} \mbox{erfinv} \left ( 1-2\delta\right )} - \frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\left ( \mbox{erfinv}\left ( 1-2\delta \right )\right )^2}\right )^2 \approx \mathbf{0.137906} \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
  \alpha_c^{(NLT,1)} = \frac{\mbox{erf}(x)^2}{2x^2}-1+\mbox{erf}(x)^2 \approx \mathbf{0.129490}, \quad 1-\mbox{erf}(x)^2- \frac{2\mbox{erf}(x)e^{-x^2}}{\sqrt{\pi}x}+\frac{2e^{-2x^2}}{\pi}=0. \end{equation}
  A substantial numerical work gives on the second level of lifting $\alpha_c^{(AGS,2)} \approx \mathbf{0.138186}$ and $\alpha_c^{(NLT,2)} \approx \mathbf{0.12979}$, effectively uncovering a remarkably fast lifting convergence. Moreover, the obtained AGS characterizations exactly match the replica symmetry based ones of \cite{AmiGutSom85} and the corresponding symmetry breaking ones of \cite{SteKuh94}.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to the problem of mutual information (MI) estimation via introducing normalizing flows-based estimator. The estimator maps original data to the target distribution with known closed-form expression for MI. We demonstrate that our approach yields MI estimates for the original data. Experiments with high-dimensional data are provided to show the advantages of the proposed estimator.</description>

      <title>DSS-o-SAGE: Direction-Scan Sounding-Oriented SAGE Algorithm for Channel Parameter Estimation in mmWave and THz Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigation of millimeter (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) channels relies on channel measurements and estimation of multi-path component (MPC) parameters. As a common measurement technique in the mmWave and THz bands, direction-scan sounding (DSS) resolves angular information and increases the measurable distance. Through mechanical rotation, the DSS creates a virtual multi-antenna sounding system, which however incurs signal phase instability and large data sizes, which are not fully considered in existing estimation algorithms and thus make them ineffective. To tackle this research gap, in this paper, a DSS-oriented space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (DSS-o-SAGE) algorithm is proposed for channel parameter estimation in mmWave and THz bands. To appropriately capture the measured data in mmWave and THz DSS, the phase instability is modeled by the scanning-direction-dependent signal phases. Furthermore, based on the signal model, the DSS-o-SAGE algorithm is developed, which not only addresses the problems brought by phase instability, but also achieves ultra-low computational complexity by exploiting the narrow antenna beam property of DSS. Simulations in synthetic channels are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and explore the applicable region of the far-field approximation in DSS-o-SAGE. Last but not least, the proposed DSS-o-SAGE algorithm is applied in real measurements in an indoor corridor scenario at 300~GHz. Compared with results using the baseline noise-elimination method, the channel is characterized more correctly and reasonably based on the DSS-o-SAGE.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Simultaneous Multi-User Communication and Multi-Target Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for a mono-static integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the dual-functional base station (BS) simultaneously communicates with multiple users and detects multiple moving targets. We aim at optimizing the ISAC waveform to jointly maximize the max-min fairness (MMF) rate of the communication users and minimize the largest eigenvalue of the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) matrix for unbiased estimation. The CRB matrix considered in this work is general as it involves the estimation of angular direction, complex reflection coefficient, and Doppler frequency for multiple moving targets. Simulation results demonstrate that RSMA maintains a larger communication and sensing trade-off than conventional space-division multiple access (SDMA) and it is capable of detecting multiple targets with a high detection accuracy. The finding highlights the potential of RSMA as an effective and powerful strategy for interference management in the general multi-user multi-target ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Small-Scale Channel Model for Sub-6 GHz RIS-Assisted Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have attracted increasing interest from both academia and industry, thanks to their unique features on controlling electromagnetic (EM) waves. Although theoretical models for RIS-empowered communications have covered a variety of applications, yet, very few papers have investigated the modeling of real propagation characteristics. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing an empirical statistical channel model to describe the small-scale channel variations for an RIS-assisted broadband system at 2.6 GHz. Based on real channel measurements in outdoor, indoor and outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) environments, we compare and analyze the global, inter-cluster and intra-cluster parameters. Measurement results indicate that the deployment of an RIS with proper phase configurations can significantly improve the channel quality by enhancing the $K$-factor and reducing the time dispersion. The small-scale fading is well characterized by the proposed statistical model and the empirical channel parameters. These results are essential for the design of emerging RIS-assisted wireless systems for future applications.</description>

      <title>A 5G DMRS-based Signal for Integrated Sensing and Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is considered as the potential key technology of the future mobile communication systems. The signal design is fundamental for the ISAC system. The reference signals in mobile communication systems have good detection performance, which is worth further research. Existing studies applied the single reference signal to radar sensing. In this paper, a multiple reference signals collaborative sensing scheme is designed. Specifically, we jointly apply channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS), positioning reference signal (PRS) and demodulation reference signal (DMRS) in radar sensing, which improve the performance of radar sensing via obtaining continuous time-frequency resource mapping. Cr\'amer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the joint reference signal for distance and velocity estimation is derived. The impacts of carrier frequency and subcarrier spacing on the performance of distance and velocity estimation are revealed. The results of simulation experiments show that compared with the single reference signal sensing scheme, the multiple reference signals collaborative sensing scheme effectively improves the sensing accuracy. Moreover, because of the discontinuous OFDM symbols, the accuracy of velocity estimation could be further improved via compressed sensing (CS). This paper has verified that multiple reference signals, instead of single reference signal, have much more superior performance on radar sensing, which is a practical and efficient approach in designing ISAC signal.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided near-field communications is investigated. First, the necessity of investigating RIS-aided near-field communications and the advantages brought about by the unique spherical-wave-based near-field propagation are discussed. Then, the family of patch-array-based RISs and metasurface-based RISs are introduced along with their respective near-field channel models. A pair of fundamental performance limits of RIS-aided near-field communications, namely their power scaling law and effective degrees-of-freedom, are analyzed for both patch-array-based and metasurface-based RISs, which reveals the potential performance gains that can be achieved. Furthermore, the associated near-field beam training and beamforming design issues are studied, where a two-stage hierarchical beam training approach and a low-complexity element-wise beamforming design are proposed for RIS-aided near-field communications. Finally, a suite of open research problems is highlighted for motivating future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study two dimensional minimal linear code over the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}$(where $p$ is prime). We show that if the generator matrix $G$ of the two dimensional linear code $M$ contains $p^n+p^{n-1}$ column vector of the following type {\scriptsize{$u_{l_1}\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_2}\begin{pmatrix} 0\\1 \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_3}\begin{pmatrix} 1\\u_1 \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_4}\begin{pmatrix} 1\\u_2 \end{pmatrix}$,...,$u_{l_{p^n-p^{n-1}+2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1\\u_{p^n-p^{n-1}} \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_{p^n-p^{n-1}+3}}\begin{pmatrix} d_1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_{p^n-p^{n-1}+4}}\begin{pmatrix} d_2\\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$,..., $u_{l_{p^n+1}}\begin{pmatrix} d_{p^{n-1}-1}\\1 \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_{p^n+2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1\\d_1 \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_{p^n+3}}\begin{pmatrix} 1\\d_2 \end{pmatrix}$,...,$u_{l_{p^n+p^{n-1}}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\d_{p^{n-1}-1} \end{pmatrix}$}}, where $u_i$ and $d_j$ are distinct units and zero divisors respectively in the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}$ for $1\leq i \leq p^n+p^{n-1}$, $1\leq j \leq p^{n-1}-1$ and additionally, denote $u_{l_i}$ as units in $\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}$, then the module generated by $G$ is a minimal linear code. Also we show that if any one column vector of the above types are not present entirely in $G$, then the generated module is not a minimal linear code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive study on the emerging near-space communications (NS-COM) within the context of space-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGSIN). Specifically, we firstly explore the recent technical developments of NS-COM, followed by the discussions about motivations behind integrating NS-COM into SAGSIN. To further demonstrate the necessity of NS-COM, a comparative analysis between the NS-COM network and other counterparts in SAGSIN is conducted, covering aspects of deployment, coverage, channel characteristics and unique problems of NS-COM network. Afterwards, the technical aspects of NS-COM, including channel modeling, random access, channel estimation, array-based beam management and joint network optimization, are examined in detail. Furthermore, we explore the potential applications of NS-COM, such as structural expansion in SAGSIN communication, civil aviation communication, remote and urgent communication, weather monitoring and carbon neutrality. Finally, some promising research avenues are identified, including stratospheric satellite (StratoSat) -to-ground direct links for mobile terminals, reconfigurable multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and holographic MIMO, federated learning in NS-COM networks, maritime communication, electromagnetic spectrum sensing and adversarial game, integrated sensing and communications, StratoSat-based radar detection and imaging, NS-COM assisted enhanced global navigation system, NS-COM assisted intelligent unmanned system and free space optical (FSO) communication. Overall, this paper highlights that the NS-COM plays an indispensable role in the SAGSIN puzzle, providing substantial performance and coverage enhancement to the traditional SAGSIN architecture.</description>

Abstract: DNA storage faces challenges in ensuring data reliability in the presence of edit errors -- deletions, insertions, and substitutions -- that occur randomly during various phases of the storage process. Current limitations in DNA synthesis technology also require the use of short DNA sequences, highlighting the particular need for short edit-correcting codes. Motivated by these factors, we introduce a systematic code designed to correct random edits while adhering to typical length constraints in DNA storage. We evaluate the performance of the code through simulations and assess its effectiveness within a DNA storage framework, revealing promising results.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Active Element Selection in RIS-aided Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter delves into the critical aspects of optimizing energy efficiency (EE) in active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted massive MIMO (M-MIMO) wireless communication systems. We develop a comprehensive and unified theoretical framework to analyze the boundaries of EE within M-MIMO systems integrated with active RIS while adhering to practical constraints. Our research focuses on a formulated EE optimization problem aiming to maximize the EE for active RIS-assisted M-MIMO communication systems. Our goal is to strategically find the number of active RIS elements for outperforming the EE attainable by an entirely passive RIS. Besides, the proposed novel solution has been tailored to the innovative problem. The formulation and solution design consider analytical optimization techniques, such as lagrangian dual transform (LDT) and fractional programming (FP) optimization, facilitating the effective implementation of RIS-aided M-MIMO applications in real-world settings. In particular, our results show that the proposed algorithm can provide up to 120% higher EE than the entirely passive RIS. Besides, we found that the active RIS can operate with less than half of the reflecting elements for the entirely passive RIS. Finally, in view of active RIS achieving the complete utilization of amplification power available, it should be equipped with a reasonable number of reflecting elements above N = 49.</description>

Abstract: By developing a new framework of likelihood POVMs, analysis techniques and a new proof of the quantum covering lemma, we address the simulation of separable quantum measurement over bipartite states. In addition to a new one shot inner bound that naturally generalizes to the asymptotic case, we demonstrate the power, generality and universality of the developed techniques in the most general distributed measurement scenario by recovering all current known inner bounds. In addition to the above results, this framework is appealing in being the most natural and simple POVM simulation protocol.</description>

      <title>Settling the Sample Complexity of Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with offline reinforcement learning (RL), which learns using pre-collected data without further exploration. Effective offline RL would be able to accommodate distribution shift and limited data coverage. However, prior algorithms or analyses either suffer from suboptimal sample complexities or incur high burn-in cost to reach sample optimality, thus posing an impediment to efficient offline RL in sample-starved applications.
  We demonstrate that the model-based (or "plug-in") approach achieves minimax-optimal sample complexity without burn-in cost for tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs). Concretely, consider a finite-horizon (resp. $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon) MDP with $S$ states and horizon $H$ (resp. effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$), and suppose the distribution shift of data is reflected by some single-policy clipped concentrability coefficient $C^{\star}_{\text{clipped}}$. We prove that model-based offline RL yields $\varepsilon$-accuracy with a sample complexity of \[ \begin{cases} \frac{H^{4}SC_{\text{clipped}}^{\star}}{\varepsilon^{2}} &amp; (\text{finite-horizon MDPs}) \frac{SC_{\text{clipped}}^{\star}}{(1-\gamma)^{3}\varepsilon^{2}} &amp; (\text{infinite-horizon MDPs}) \end{cases} \] up to log factor, which is minimax optimal for the entire $\varepsilon$-range. The proposed algorithms are ``pessimistic'' variants of value iteration with Bernstein-style penalties, and do not require sophisticated variance reduction.

      <title>Advocating for the Silent: Enhancing Federated Generalization for Non-Participating Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07171v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has surged in prominence due to its capability of collaborative model training without direct data sharing. However, the vast disparity in local data distributions among clients, often termed the Non-Independent Identically Distributed (Non-IID) challenge, poses a significant hurdle to FL's generalization efficacy. The scenario becomes even more complex when not all clients participate in the training process, a common occurrence due to unstable network connections or limited computational capacities. This can greatly complicate the assessment of the trained models' generalization abilities. While a plethora of recent studies has centered on the generalization gap pertaining to unseen data from participating clients with diverse distributions, the distinction between the training distributions of participating clients and the testing distributions of non-participating ones has been largely overlooked. In response, our paper unveils an information-theoretic generalization framework for FL. Specifically, it quantifies generalization errors by evaluating the information entropy of local distributions and discerning discrepancies across these distributions. Inspired by our deduced generalization bounds, we introduce a weighted aggregation approach and a duo of client selection strategies. These innovations are designed to strengthen FL's ability to generalize and thus ensure that trained models perform better on non-participating clients by incorporating a more diverse range of client data distributions. Our extensive empirical evaluations reaffirm the potency of our proposed methods, aligning seamlessly with our theoretical construct.</description>

      <title>Improving Robustness via Tilted Exponential Layer: A Communication-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art techniques for enhancing robustness of deep networks mostly rely on empirical risk minimization with suitable data augmentation. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach motivated by communication theory, aimed at enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio at the output of a neural network layer via neural competition during learning and inference. In addition to standard empirical risk minimization, neurons compete to sparsely represent layer inputs by maximization of a tilted exponential (TEXP) objective function for the layer. TEXP learning can be interpreted as maximum likelihood estimation of matched filters under a Gaussian model for data noise. Inference in a TEXP layer is accomplished by replacing batch norm by a tilted softmax, which can be interpreted as computation of posterior probabilities for the competing signaling hypotheses represented by each neuron. After providing insights via simplified models, we show, by experimentation on standard image datasets, that TEXP learning and inference enhances robustness against noise and other common corruptions, without requiring data augmentation. Further cumulative gains in robustness against this array of distortions can be obtained by appropriately combining TEXP with data augmentation techniques. The code for all our experiments is available at https://github.com/bhagyapuranik/texp_for_robustness.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Estimation of Multiple Markov Sources in Resource-constrained Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates goal-oriented communication for remote estimation of multiple Markov sources in resource-constrained networks. An agent decides the updating times of the sources and transmits the packet to a remote destination over an unreliable channel with delay. The destination is tasked with source reconstruction for actuation. We utilize the metric \textit{cost of actuation error} (CAE) to capture the state-dependent actuation costs. We aim for a sampling policy that minimizes the long-term average CAE subject to an average resource constraint. We formulate this problem as an average-cost constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) and relax it into an unconstrained problem by utilizing \textit{Lyapunov drift} techniques. Then, we propose a low-complexity \textit{drift-plus-penalty} (DPP) policy for systems with known source/channel statistics and a Lyapunov optimization-based deep reinforcement learning (LO-DRL) policy for unknown environments. Our policies significantly reduce the number of uninformative transmissions by exploiting the timing of the important information.</description>

      <title>Boosting Spectral Efficiency with Data-Carrying Reference Signals on the Grassmann Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In wireless networks, frequent reference signal transmission for accurate channel reconstruction may reduce spectral efficiency. To address this issue, we consider to use a data-carrying reference signal (DC-RS) that can simultaneously estimate channel coefficients and transmit data symbols. Here, symbols on the Grassmann manifold are exploited to carry additional data and to assist in channel estimation. Unlike conventional studies, we analyze the channel estimation errors induced by DC-RS and propose an optimization method that improves the channel estimation accuracy without performance penalty. Then, we derive the achievable rate of noncoherent Grassmann constellation assuming discrete inputs in multi-antenna scenarios, as well as that of coherent signaling assuming channel estimation errors modeled by the Gauss-Markov uncertainty. These derivations enable performance evaluation when introducing DC-RS, and suggest excellent potential for boosting spectral efficiency, where interesting crossings with the non-data carrying RS occurred at intermediate signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation from Language-Oriented to Emergent Communication for Multi-Agent Remote Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compare emergent communication (EC) built upon multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) and language-oriented semantic communication (LSC) empowered by a pre-trained large language model (LLM) using human language. In a multi-agent remote navigation task, with multimodal input data comprising location and channel maps, it is shown that EC incurs high training cost and struggles when using multimodal data, whereas LSC yields high inference computing cost due to the LLM's large size. To address their respective bottlenecks, we propose a novel framework of language-guided EC (LEC) by guiding the EC training using LSC via knowledge distillation (KD). Simulations corroborate that LEC achieves faster travel time while avoiding areas with poor channel conditions, as well as speeding up the MADRL training convergence by up to 61.8% compared to EC.</description>
